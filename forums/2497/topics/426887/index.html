              <div><br><br><span><strong>Carlo Anceloti has admitted that Fernando Torres must start performing better but has dismissed suggestions that his arrival has unsettled Didier Drogba.</strong></span></div>
              </div>
              <p>Torres has still not scored since moving to Chelsea from Liverpool in a £50million deal at the end of January. </p>
              <p>He was dropped to the substitutes' bench for the 1-1 draw with Stoke on Saturday, before enduring more frustration during a 30-minute cameo in the second half. </p>
              <p>Ancelotti has previously played down the 27-year-old's goal drought and remains convinced that he will soon start to link up with his team-mates more effectively. </p>
              <p>The Blues manager has called on the other players to make Torres' job easier by spotting his clever runs, but also concedes that the Spaniard needs to contribute more. </p>
              <p>"He has to improve, obviously," Ancelotti said in the <em>News of the World</em>. </p>
              <p>"But this has been his first two months here. If he has some difficulties building relationships with the players, that can happen. </p>
              <p>"Sometimes he moves very well on the wrong side of the centre-back and the ball does not arrive at the same time so we have to improve this." </p>
              <p>Torres has struggled to build up an on-field rapport with Drogba but Ancelotti has laughed off claims that the Ivory Coast international is reluctant to pass to his new team-mate. </p>
              <p>"This is pub talk," he said. "When we drink in Italy we usually say 'bar sport'. </p>
              <p>"If there is a possibility, they pass the ball without problem." </p>
              <p>The arrival of Torres fuelled speculation that Drogba's days at Stamford Bridge could be numbered, but the former Marseille forward's reaction has pleased Ancelotti. </p>
              <p>He said: "I spoke with Didier about this and his thought is this: that Torres is here to improve the power of the team. And, for this reason, he is happy. </p>
              <p>"If he thought that Chelsea had bought Torres to replace him, obviously he would not be happy."</p>
