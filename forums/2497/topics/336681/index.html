              <h2>Cesc Fabregas believes the win over Manchester United at the
              weekend has shown that, playing under under-fire Arsene Wenger, the
              Gunners have the qualities to play their way back into title contention.</h2>
              <p>Arsenal were coming off a couple of poor results going into the weekend
              clash with Manchester United, with key players missing through injury
              or suspension and several more playing through the pain barrier.<br><br>In
              contrast, United had been struggling to fit all their superstars into
              one cohesive side and had been showing glimpses of their top form.<br><br>Arsene
              Wenger went into Saturday's game a man under pressure. Reports had
              suggested that the Emirates side's board were starting to lose their
              patience in the Frenchman and were demanding three points against the
              Red Devils. Even if those reports were rubbish, the media glare alone
              was enough to startle the wily gaffer.<br><br>Through sheer force of
              will, more than anything else, the Gunners were able to edge a
              free-flowing encounter to the tune of 2-1, even winning plaudits from
              United chief Sir Alex Ferguson.<br><br>Now, midfielder Cesc Fabregas
              has revealed that the under-pressure Gunners rose to the occasion for
              Wenger, whilst insisting that the title is still in sight.<br><br>"We did it for the manager, because he has believed a lot in us," the Spanish star told <em>Setanta</em>.<br><br>"Without
              him, probably apart from Gallas and Silvestre, all the rest of us may
              never have had the chance to play football. We owe him a lot and have
              to show that on the pitch."<br><br>Perhaps the emotional playmaker is being a tad dramatic with that statement, but his fondness for his boss is clear.<br><br>Assessing
              the team's recent form and the way forward from this point, Cesc
              continued: "Sometimes we lose playing this way and everyone says we are
              not good. Therefore, we knew there would be some talk about whether
              Arsenal were capable of winning anything if we had lost this match.<br><br>"We're
              not losers, though, because our heads don't go down. We have shown we
              have character and we beat a great team while under a lot of pressure.<br><br>"The title? Oh yes! We have shown we have the qualities to do it."</p>

              <p><strong>Robin van Persie feels Arsenal made a statement of intent with Saturday’s 2-1 win over Manchester United. </strong></p>
              <p>Arsenal were in danger of losing touch with their Premier League
              title rivals following the draw with Tottenham and loss to Stoke, but
              they roared back with a home win over the champions.</p>
              <p>Van Persie missed the game on account of suspension, but was a keen
              spectator and feels The Gunners threw down a marker to their rivals.</p>
              <p>The Dutchman feels the win proves The Gunners have the quality to
              fight for the title, but admits there are concerns as to why they can
              beat the big guns only to struggle against the supposed minnows.</p>
              <p>”We continue to play football as we always do,” Van Persie told Sport 1 in his native Holland.</p>
              <p>”These are three very important points. If you look at how we
              played, it is a shame that it is against the likes of Stoke and Fulham
              that we have problems with.</p>
              <p>”It is difficult to explain, but I think we have made a clear statement that we will be in the fight for the title.”</p>

              <p>a little like you said, he never control the game. but all 3 goals were very nice strikes, albeit the first one was a deflection.</p>
