I've never played that well for England because I've played a lot of the time at full-back.<br><br>"There's that many people he's [England manager Steve McClaren] played ahead of me. It's a game of opinions.<br><br>"But when you're at my age they are all younger than me, they are all going to improve and maybe I won't at my age.<br><br>"I'm 29, I've been doing it for eight years and obviously I haven't proved it enough so it's not going to change now is it?<br><br>"It's not like I've just got in the squad and I've jumped out.<br><br>"At the moment it's not 100 per cent official because I've still got to speak to the manager before the next game.<br><br>"But it's looking like that and as I said, if there was a major injury crisis and the four centre-halves who he obviously picks ahead of me are all injured and he's absolutely desperate then of course I would (come back), yeah."</div>
