              <p><span class="caption"><em>Icon: Milan fans have already begun to embrace the Beckham brand after the news broke that the England player was eyeing up a loan move to the Italian club</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The Italian club's switchboard, ticket line and website went down on Thursday morning in light of David Beckham's likely arrival early next year. The San Siro-based club were inundated with calls and requests from supporters around the world as to when exactly Beckham would join the club.</strong></p>
              <p>Fans also wanted to know when they would be able to get their hands on club shirts with the player's name and number on, and hundreds of supporters have already had 'Beckham' printed on the backs of their existing jerseys.</p>
              <p>The Italian media have also reported a sharp rise in the demand for tickets at the Italian club in light of the Englishman's hugely-anticipated arrival.</p>
              <p>Beckham is contracted full time to Major League Soccer side Los Angeles Galaxy, but both parties are understood to have agreed a four-month loan deal with Milan.</p>
              <p>After deciding to move to the United States when it appeared that his international career had been ended by former England manager Steve McClaren, it is clear that Beckham is committed to doing whatever it takes to keep his place in Fabio Capello's squad. He has turned to the Serie A giants in an effort to seek competitive football during the MLS winter break, in order to keep himself high in the England manager's mind.</p>

              <p><em>AC Milan duo Fiippo Inzaghi and Andriy Shevchenko have welcomed the news that David Beckham is set to join the Italian giants in January.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>AC Milan strikers Andriy Shevchenko and Filippo Inzaghi have welcomed the news that David Beckham is poised to join the club. The England midfielder is in talks with the Italian outfit over a short-term loan deal from the Los Angeles Galaxy during the MLS close season.</strong></p>
              <p>Shevchenko, who returned to Milan this summer after a disappointing spell with Chelsea, said: "We would all be happy if he arrives and we would welcome him with open arms.</p>
              <p>'He is a great professional and he would come to play at a high level, which is clearly a sign that he wants to be considered for the national team.'</p>
              <p>Beckham, 33, has won 107 England caps and is determined to maintain his fitness in order to stay in the plans of national team coach Fabio Capello.</p>
              <p>That will be good news for Milan, who are looking to strengthen their midfield as they bid to challenge for silverware in both Serie A and the UEFA Cup.</p>
              <p>Former Italy international Inzaghi added: "I would really like it if Beckham came to give us a hand to win. He will certainly get a big welcome.'</p>

              <p><strong>On Wednesday the Italian club confirmed that they are trying to sign David Beckham on loan from LA Galaxy.</strong></p>
              <p>Now Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi wants her to present a film charting the couples move, including their arrival, house-hunt and their first shopping trips in the European fashion capital, it has been reported.</p>
              <p>It is also hoped that the couple's friends Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes will appear in the show. If she accepts the deal, it will make Victoria Beckham the most highly paid presenter in Italian television history.</p>
              <p>Berlusconi owns Italy's three biggest television channels and will apparently extend the project until next summer if the show is a success.</p>
              <p>A source said: "With Silvio 100 per cent behind the project, as part of his vision to expand the AC Milan brand, it really will be no holds barred.</p>
              <p>"Berlusconi is deperate to get Posh on board and will pull out all the stops to make sure it happens."</p>
              <p>Victoria Beckham's last documentary was entitled Victoria Beckham: Coming to America and it followed the family's move to America in 2007 when David Beckham was signed up to LA Galaxy. However it was poorly received by American critics.</p>
