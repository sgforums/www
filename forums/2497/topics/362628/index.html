              <p><strong>England midfielder Gareth Barry has written a formal apology to </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/aston-villa"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Aston Villa</strong></span></a><strong> fans over his £12m move to </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Manchester City</strong></span></a><strong>, saying he joined City "to win major honours".</strong></p>
              <p>The apology, which will be published in full by the Birmingham Mail later on Wednesday, is being seen as an attempt to repair the damage he has done to his reputation by making the lucrative £100,000-a-week switch to a club that have failed to qualify for Europe next season. The midfielder spent 12 years at Villa Park before the move, and last summer spoke of his desire to sign for Liverpool to play Champions League football.</p>
              <p>In the apology, Barry writes: "Once I had spoken to Mark Hughes there was nowhere else I wanted to go. I was also desperate to avoid any long drawn-out saga.</p>
              <p>"I feel I am joining a club that will seriously challenge to win major honours. People might doubt that, but I am convinced with the plans the club has short term and long term, and the backing the manager will receive from the owners, that we will be a major force."</p>
              <p>"I have honestly been very undecided what to do: the [Villa] manager [Martin O'Neill] and the whole club have bent over backwards to try and persuade me to stay and made me a fantastic offer, which I am extremely grateful for."</p>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><em><strong>Gareth Barry has revealed that a fear of 'going stale' prompted his move to Manchester City. </strong></em> </p>
              <p>In an open letter to Villa fans published in the Birmingham Evening Mail, Barry writes... </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>After all the speculation over the last 12 months, I want the chance to explain my decision to the Villa fans. </em></p>
              <p><em>Firstly I want to thank them for the incredible support I have received over the last 12 years, this football club has been a huge part of my life, I joined as a 16-year-old boy and now I am moving on as a 28-year-old man with a wife and two children. </em></p>
              <p><em>A lot of things have changed in that time, players, management and a chairman - but every season bar none, whether we have been bottom half, mid table or challenging for Europe, the support myself and the team have received has been fantastic. </em></p>
              <p><em>My one huge regret is that during my time at this club we have not brought the fans the success they deserve. I obviously have to take my share of responsibility that we have not been good enough to win trophies. </em></p>
              <p><em>I feel the club is in the best position it has been in during my time here, I think we have a group of very good young players, we have a fantastic chairman who is here for the good of the club and one of the best managers in the game.</em></p>
              <p><em>Obviously people will ask why I am leaving if I feel like that. </em></p>
              <p><em>I have honestly been very undecided what to do, the manager and the whole club have bent over backwards to try and persuade me to stay and made me a fantastic offer which I am extremely grateful for. </em></p>
              <p><em>But, after changing my mind lots of times, I came to the decision that the time was right for me and for the club to part company. I need a new challenge, I have a massive fear of going stale and falling into a comfort zone. </em></p>
              <p><em>I believe the deal is a good one for the club, I am sure the manager will use the money well to strengthen the team and the club will go from strength to strength. </em></p>
              <p><em>I am also excited now about my new challenge, a lot of people will question my decision to join Manchester City, but they were the club prepared to meet the valuation, which for a 28-year-old with a year left on his contract I think shows how much they wanted me. </em></p>
              <p><em>Once I had spoke to Mark Hughes there was nowhere else I wanted to go, I was also desperate to avoid any long drawn out saga. </em></p>
              <p><em>I feel I am joining a club that will seriously challenge to win major honours. People might doubt that, but I am convinced with the plans the club has short term and long term. </em></p>
              <p><em>The backing the manager will receive from the owners tells me that we will be a major force. </em></p>
              <p><em>Also the World Cup next year has always been a major part of my thinking. I feel at Manchester City I will get the chance to play regularly in my best position and play a big part in a successful side. </em></p>
              <p><em>Time will tell if I am right or not, but those are my reasons. </em></p>
              <p><em>I have grown bored of all the speculation surrounding me over the last 12 months and I am sure all the fans have as well, I am glad I never left last summer because I would have left under a huge cloud. </em></p>
              <p><em>This year I feel things are different, I haven't used an agent. I have discussed things with my best friend (agent Michael Standing) but ultimately made my own choices. </em></p>
              <p><em>I believe the situation has been handled properly by everybody involved. Once again I have to thank the manager and the club for that. </em></p>
              <p><em>I genuinely wish the club all the best for the future and want to thank everyone who has helped and supported me in my time here. </em></p>
              <p><em>For the rest of my life Aston Villa will be the first result I look for. </em></p>
              <p><em>Thanks for everything.</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>

              <p>Yeah sorry guys...money is more important than loyalty...I joined as a 16 years old boy <em>and now I am moving on as a 28-year-old man with a wife and two children. You see, I have a wife and two children to feed. I am 28 years old now, how many years more my leg allows me to run and earn that kind of money? Please understand...When the offer came from Mark Hughes, my jaw dropped looking at the amount of money being offered for my service. I feel the club value and regard me highly as a player, thats really an hounour to me (apart from the money). There is no turning back after that because I believe ManCity is the richest club in the world at the moment. No way I will get a better deal somewhere else...who cares about honour and title? This will be my last club, as I will be sitting on the bench, relax and enjoy the show while getting that kind of money. Kill 2 birds with one stone. I hope you guys had understand my situation now. Thank you.</em></p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Liverpool unimpressed by Barry's Man City choice</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p>Liverpool
              are unimpressed by former Aston Villa midfielder Gareth Barry's
              decision to join Manchester City in a £12 million deal.</p>
              <p>Liverpool spent all last summer trying to get Barry but baulked at the asking price.</p>
              <p>Those close to Barry claim he feared the same could happen again
              - although Liverpool sources say he knew they wanted him and were
              working on a deal.</p>
              <p>A Liverpool source told <em>The Sun</em>: "Gareth was still a
              target for Rafa Benitez and while Liverpool couldn't match City's
              personal terms they could give him the stage he wanted.</p>
              <p>"The only conclusion has to be that he went to City for the
              money because they are not involved in any European competition next
              season."</p>

              <p>well, I don't think he made the right choice if he wants to advance his career.</p>
              <p>but given you won't know whether your next injury could be your last, it is economical smart to have $$ in your pocket.</p>
              <p>And if City owners are buying smart, you may be the cornerstone to their success. Who can foretell the future?</p>
              <p>Also,he may kanna a "Robbie Keane" and get kicked back  to Villa.. and furthermore, there is no guarantee that he will get any success if he joins the other club, is there?</p>

              I think he made the right and smart choice in advancing his career... Injury or no injury, is not the point... Having seen that Rafa likes to rotate his squad, he might feel he could spend a lot of time on the bench if he is unfortunate... And next year being a World Cup year, I don't think he wants that...
              
              Money wise also no wrong... One is offering $110k the other $70k... Easy decision...
              
              Finally, winning titles... True that Pool may be in this year's Champions League and City are not but can they guarantee they have the squad to win it? No, they can't and their financial strength look very weak... While the Pool owners are going around looking to borrow more money to avoid a financial meltdown, The City owners just made a cool $2b pounds this week after only 7 months in the stock market when they sold their Barclays shares... That is like enough to buy 3 or 4 Liverpool clubs put together...
              
              If things continue this way, in 3 yrs or lesser, City would be bigger than Liverpool with all the star players preferring to go there rather than Anfield... And their squad will have more qualify than Pools too. So not being in this season CL might not be a bad thing after all as it will give them time for a new squad to fully concentrate on just the Premier League... And I seriously believe Barry isn't wrong when he said they are only 12 months away from a CL place, and who knows... maybe even at the expense of Liverpool...
              
              So if people think seriously and hard enough, they probably realized Barry made not just the smart choice, but the right one too...

              <p>Well, it's obvious that all he wanted was $$$$..... but that's not the issue at all.</p>
              <p>After all, footballers come and go, and there's no reason why they wouldn't want to earn more money to do the same job, no?</p>
              <p>What really irks me instead is that he obviously isn't being truthful when talking about his transfer intentions. I mean, Man City didn't even qualify for Europe at all.... how is that even gonna help his footballing ambitions?</p>
              <p>If he had just said something like, <em>'Let's face it; Man City offered me good money, and I see no real reason why I shouldn't take it up</em>' then at least he can be said to be honest.</p>

              Honestly, who doesn't go for the money? Footballers careers are short... Ballack, Lampard, Rio, Gallas, A Cole... All went or stayed cos of the money that was offered to them... So nothing wrong there...
                      
              Club wise, City represent a club with a far more better future than Pool does at the moment... So 12 months no CL... That shouldn't be a serious problem cos we can see they are heading in the right direction... They could be in it 12 months from now... So...
                      
               .
               .
                      
              $$$ wise... plus
                      
              Club's ambition... plus
                      
              Club's future... plus
                      
              Personal contract on offer... At Villa he was on $40k...
                      
              Pool, $70k per week, 4 years... 
              City $110k per week, 5 years...  plus
                      
              He is 28 yrs old, having a contract until he is 33 offers more value and security for a footballer rather than at 32, go looking for another club and they reduce his salary somemore...
