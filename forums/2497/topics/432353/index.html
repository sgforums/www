              <p><em>Dalglish have so far spent almost $80m this year</em></p>

              <p><strong>Kenny Dalglish's £80million Liverpool revolution is set to continue with the capture of Southampton whizzkid Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.</strong></p>
              <p>The Kop boss has been told by the club's American owners to carry on spending as he looks to build a squad capable of mounting a sustained challenge for the Premier League title next season.</p>
              <p>And after missing out to Manchester United in the £16million race to land Phil Jones last week, Dalglish has moved in to beat Arsenal for top teenage winger Oxlade-Chamberlain.</p>
              <p>Arsene Wenger was certain that he had secured the 17-year-old winger with a package that could net Southampton up to £12million.</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>But Liverpool have matched the Gunners' offer and Dalglish believes he has moved into pole position to land the son of former England winger Mark Chamberlain.</p>
              <p>Dalglish has been handed the biggest single transfer kitty in Anfield history by owners Fenway Sports.</p>
              <p>He is looking to add to the fund by selling £10million-rated centre-back Daniel Agger, while he is also hopeful that a buyer willing to pay the same for £18million misfit Alberto Aquillani can be found in Italy.</p>
              <p>Dalglish wants to build his team around predominantly British talent.</p>
              <p>He broke the club's transfer record by buying Andy Carroll from Newcastle for £35million in January and has splashed out another £20million to bring in Jordan Henderson from Sunderland.</p>
              <p>Stewart Downing is high on Dalglish's wish-list, although Aston Villa's resolve to keep the £15million-rated England winger has been stiffened by Ashley Young's departure to United.</p>
              <p>And Liverpool have turned their attentions to Bolton's Gary Cahill after Jones chose Old Trafford ahead of Anfield, with the England centre-back having a £16million release clause in his contract.</p>
              <p>The Merseysiders are also ready to go to £9million for young Ipswich striker Connor Wickham after being rebuffed in midweek, and are confident that a renewed bid for Blackpool midfielder Charlie Adam will succeed after a winter off was rejected.</p>
              <p>Liverpool are also looking to solve a left-back problem.</p>
              <p>Newcastle's Jose Enrique remains the club's preferred choice, despite an interest in Arsenal's unsettled Gael Clichy, although they will be reluctant to pay more than £7million with the Spaniard having just 12 months left on his contract.</p>

              <p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Kenny Dalglish will try to convince Southampton wonderkid Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to turn his back on a move to Arsenal.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Liverpool have entered the £10million race to land the England Under 19 forward in their attempts to lure the brightest young English talent to Merseyside.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Dalglish followed up the £35m signing of Andy Carroll in January with a £20m swoop for Jordan Henderson last week. And the Scot is due to hold talks with  Oxlade-Chamberlain’s representatives in an attempt to persuade them that the 17-year-old’s future is at Anfield.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The teenager looked on course for a move to the Emirates this summer after the Gunners re-opened discussions with Saints. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Sources close to Oxlade-Chamberlain insist the exciting forward favours a move to the Emirates, and his father, former England winger Mark Chamberlain, underlined that by claiming the youngster wanted his move to Arsenal completed as soon as possible.</span></p>
              <p class="imagecaption" style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Arsene Wenger came close to signing the player in January, but the move collapsed due to Saints insisting on a 40 per cent sell-on clause, a demand that remains the main stumbling block for Arsenal. But Liverpool are confident they can negotiate a deal, clearing the path for a move if Dalglish can convince the player that joining Liverpool is in his best interests. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Meanwhile, Arsenal will return with a £10m bid for Chris Samba. <em>Sportsmail</em> revealed last month how the Gunners had tabled an £8m bid for the Blackburn centre back, which was rejected.</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool will need to seriously increase their valuation to land Stewart Downing.</strong></p>
              <p>The Anfield club were hoping to move swiftly to capture the England international winger as soon as Aston Villa appoint a new manager.</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>But the Villa board see things very differently, and even though they don’t yet know if Downing will figure in their new manager’s plans, they have indicated any offer will have to be double that figure for them to consider it.</p>
              <p>Downing, like team-mate Ashley Young, has decided his future lies elsewhere, and he is keen to move to Anfield after being sold on the Merseyside club.</p>
              <p>He is a friend of Andy Carroll, and wants to become part of Dalglish’s revolution, but it seems there is much work to be done if he is to get his his wish.</p>
              <p>Young’s imminent departure has put pressure on the Villa board to attempt to keep the rest of their players, and they are prepared to play hard-ball to at least ensure they have the funds to find an adequate replacement.</p>
              <p>Young seems certain to go to Manchester United. He is about to enter the final year of his contract, and Villa know they must sell now to try and recoup the £8million they paid to Watford for the player.</p>
              <p>But Downing is a different matter, and even though the player is desperate to go, there could be a struggle over the fee reminiscent of the wrangling that surrounded Gareth Barry’s on-off move to Anfield two years ago.</p>
              <p>Dalglish will need to offload several of his highly-paid fringe players if he is to generate the funds and clear the wage bill to snatch Downing, but remains confident he will get his man.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">LIVERPOOL are set to unveil new signing Sylvain Marveaux this week.</h2>
              <p>SunSport understands the French midfielder will join on a free transfer from Rennes after putting pen to paper on a five-year deal worth £60,000 a week.</p>
              <p>Liverpool have been tracking Marveaux for months and were confident of securing his services once it was clear he was not going to sign a new deal with Rennes.</p>
              <p>The former France Under-21 midfielder, 25, has yet to make the breakthrough and receive a senior call-up for Les Bleus.</p>
              <p>He favours the left side and his arrival all but signals the end of Milan Jovanovic's unhappy spell at Anfield.</p>
              <p>The Serb has been desperate to quit after proving a huge flop following his free transfer from Standard Liege last summer.</p>
              <p>But he has so far refused to rescind his contract - worth up to £120,000 a week because it included a signing-on bonus - and is reportedly seeking a £2.5m pay-off.</p>
              <p>Central defender Sotirios Kyrgiakos has earned himself a 12-month contract extension.</p>
              <p>The Greece star, 32 next month, originally joined on a two-year deal from AEK Athens at the start of the 2009-10 season.</p>
              <p>Liverpool have confirmed the exit of a number of reserves - ex-captain Steve Irwin, Nikola Saric, Jason Banton, Deale Chamberlain, Alex Cooper and Sean Highdale.</p>

              <p class="introcopy">Newcastle's French revolution is to continue after Alan Pardew won the battle for Rennes midfielder Sylvain Marveaux.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="padding7north" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 17px; margin: 4px 5px 4px 0px; font-size: 12px;">
              <p class="storycopy">The 25-year-old will formally complete a move to St James' Park for an undisclosed fee on July 1, when he will sign a five-year deal. The Magpies have snatched the former France Under-21 international from under the noses of Liverpool, who had been heavily tipped to land him.</p>
              <p>Marveaux looked to be certain to join Liverpool earlier in the week but the deal stalled after the Anfield outfit claimed that he failed a medical due to reported concerns over his groin.</p>
              <p>However, the midfielder <span style="color: #000000;">denied he was unfit, claiming that he was 'disgusted' with the reports stating so</span> and Newcastle moved quickly to sign the Frenchman who made his debut for Rennes as a 15-year-old.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Pardew said: "It's a great coup to have signed Sylvain, who has received interest from a number of other clubs."<br><br>He added: "He may not be well known to many of our fans, but he is a real talent and a player we have been keeping an eye on for some time. It's been a good couple of days for us on the transfer front."<br><br>Marveaux is a left-sided midfielder and the third Frenchman recruited to the Newcastle engine room in the last year or so after Hatem Ben Arfa and recent signing Yohan Cabaye.<br><br>Confirmation of his capture comes just a day after the Magpies unveiled Senegal international striker Demba Ba as their second summer arrival, following in Cabaye's wake.<br><br>His signing will help to offset the loss of skipper Kevin Nolan, who joined West Ham in a move understood to amount to £4million on Thursday, while Alan Smith has also been told he can leave.<br><br>With Joey Barton having been informed that he will not be offered a new contract, there is a school of thought which suggests he too will be sold this summer rather than be allowed to leave for free when his current deal expires in 12 months' time.<br><br>Newcastle's swoop for Marveaux has come somewhat under the radar with speculation this week linking them with the likes of Bayer Leverkusen's Tranquillo Barnetta and St Etienne's Blaise Matuidi, both players in whom they have had an interest, though it remains to be seen how strong that interest is.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Sylvain Marveaux is delighted to have sealed his 'dream move' to Newcastle after his proposed switch to Liverpool fell through. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The 25-year-old midfielder looked set to leave Rennes for Kenny Dalglish's Reds last week but failed his Anfield medical due to a groin problem. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Marveaux has been sidelined since November but Toon boss Alan Pardew had no hesitation in snapping up the player on a free transfer. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Marveaux told the club's official website: 'This is a dream move for me and I'm very happy to be joining such a great club. As soon as I signed I couldn't wait to phone my parents in France and tell them the news. I've already sent them both Newcastle shirts. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Newcastle United are one of the most well-known clubs in France and have a great tradition.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I saw quite a few of the games last season and thought the team did very well in their first season back in the Premier League. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'The people at the club made me feel so welcome on Friday night when I arrived. They looked after me so well, made me feel part of the club straight away, and I thank them for that.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Pardew has already signed Mehdi Abeid from Lens, Yohan Cabaye  from Lille and West Ham striker Demba Ba while Hatem Ben Arfa is on the books at St James' Park. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Marveaux added: 'It's good for me that there are other French players here, players like Ben Arfa and Cabaye who I know, but it's a very good squad they have too.'</span></p>
