              <h2>Dowie waits on Boateng prognosis</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.georgeboateng.com/Images/1996/George_Boateng_Hull_Fulham_Premier_League_2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="450"></p>
              <p><strong>Hull boss Iain Dowie remains hopeful captain George Boateng's injury 
              is not as serious as first feared after the midfielder was knocked 
              unconscious in the 2-0 defeat at Stoke. </strong></p>
              <p>Boateng was caught in the head by Tuncay Sanli's 
              overhead kick and after lengthy treatment was taken from the field on a 
              stretcher to a waiting ambulance.</p>
              <p>With Dowie having already made all of his 
              substitutions the Tigers had to play the last 15 minutes - plus the 
              resulting eight minutes' injury time - with 10 men.</p>
              <p>But the real concern was for Boateng, although 
              Dowie said it was too early to assess whether or not he had fractured 
              his jaw.</p>
              <p>"There was a lot of blood in his airway and we 
              had to suction that out as he was struggling to breathe," he said.</p>
              <p>"By the time he left he was a lot more 
              comfortable. He will have to stay in hospital and I'll see him 
              overnight.</p>
              <p>"It is a bitter blow, particularly the time it 
              happened when we were in the ascendancy.</p>
              <p>"It was a fantastic challenge and that is the 
              type of character he is - but there was no malice from Tuncay as I think
               he was shocked too.</p>
              <p>"It is a hell of a whack. It is a nasty injury 
              but hopefully he is fine and there is nothing wrong with his jaw because
               that would be a real blow.</p>
              <p>"We've had some curveballs thrown at us already 
              but we've got to get on with it."</p>
              <p>Stoke boss Tony Pulis also absolved Tuncay of any
               blame.</p>
              <p>"It was unfortunate. I don't think 'Tunny' knew 
              the lad was behind him so you can't apportion any blame," he said.</p>
              <p>"It was disappointing and you never want to see 
              that."</p>
