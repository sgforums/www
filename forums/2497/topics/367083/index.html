              <h1 class="titlestory">Moyes angered by Owen's Man Utd move</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Everton</span></abbr> boss David Moyes is upset with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> beating him for Michael Owen's signature.</p>
              <p>The <em>People</em> says Moyes went to extraordinary lengths to
              land the free-agent striker, and even flew him out to America for a
              long meeting over a round of golf.</p>
              <p>He kept up his pursuit of Owen for months, with his number two
              Steve Round also chipping in as he worked with the player at Newcastle
              before both left St James' Park.</p>
              <p>But Moyes really tried hard on proving to the England player he
              was the man to bring the best out of him in a move that would have been
              a brilliant bit of business for the Toffees.</p>
              <p>Owen was even admitting to pals that he had been won over by
              Moyes and as late as last week he was going to join them on less money
              than he could have earned elsewhere.</p>
              <p>But Moyes, who was back from his holiday last week, saw Owen hijacked by <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> and is now sifting through the wreckage of the deal - and looking for another cut-price replacement.</p>

              <p>he wants to win trophies at Man Utd I suppose. He has not won the EPL title yet, although he has won the domestic cups with Liverpool in 2001 and the UEFA cup. HE feels that he would have a better chance being recalled by Capello at Man Utd than at Everton I suppose.</p>

              <p>Totally disgusting move by michael owen, whichever way you look at it. But Im not too worried, as Man U have a lot of oldies in their team. So Michael, if you think you can win the epl title with Man U, you're wrong.</p>
