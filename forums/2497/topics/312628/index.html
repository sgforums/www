              <p class="small bold"><strong></strong></p>
              <p class="small bold"><strong>ENGLAND skipper John Terry sparked fury by leaving his flash motor in a disabled parking bay — while he enjoyed a long lunch. Terry, on a whopping £100,000 a week with Chelsea, blocked the spot for about two hours as he ate with his family. And he seemed little bothered when returning to find a £60 fine on the windscreen of his black Bentley.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">The star swept away, leaving locals furious at his “arrogance”. Terry, 27, jammed the high street bay while lunching at Pizza Express in Esher, Surrey. Yards away is a 50p-an-hour public car park.</p>
              <p class="article">One shopper raged: “He arrived at around 12.30 and went to Pizza Express. "I think it is just arrogance. "Anyone with any sense of morals would say, ‘It is convenient to park there, but someone could clearly use it more than me.’”</p>
              <p class="article"><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/JohnTerryWENN_468x380.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p class="article"><span style="color: #888888;">Terry, at the wheel, has now pledged not to use a disabled parking spot again.</span></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">He added: “If you have money, you can buy your way out of doing wrong.” Surrey councillor Jimmy Cartwright branded Terry’s behaviour “disgraceful”. He went on: “He is showing a blatant disregard for the law and for disabled people.” It doesn’t matter that it’s against the law and potentially depriving a needy individual of access to local amentites, because the fine is only £60, a mere 0.04 per cent of JT’s weekly wage.</p>
              <p class="article">Terry — with wife Toni and one-year-old twins Georgie and Summer — signed autographs before driving away last Friday. Last night an aide said Terry was sorry and pledged not to do it again.</p>

              <h2>TERRY WANTS ARMBAND BACK</h2>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>John Terry has vowed to do everything he can to ensure that he is named as England's captain on a full-time basis. The Chelsea defender was installed as national skipper under previous boss Steve McClaren, but uncertainty continues to rein as to whether he will keep the job under Fabio Capello.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Italian coach has made it clear that he intends to rotate the captaincy between a number of leading candidates before making a final decision once the World Cup qualifiers get underway in September. Despite seeing Steven Gerrard and Rio Ferdinand lead the team out in Capello's first two games in charge, Terry insists that he is still the right man for the job and is determined to wrestle the armband back in the coming months.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I remember when I got the job as captain. To walk out for that first game, it was unbelievable," he said. "I want to keep that armband. I am really passionate about it. "It means so much to me, to my family. I want to be a successful England captain. "I've thought about what the new manager will do. I will give everything, in training, in the games. I will give it my all. "We have some great players and some great leaders. Mr Capello is a clever man and a great manager and he'll give it to the right person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I will have to be patient and we'll see, but I will say here and now that I want to be the England captain." Capello has stated that his captain must be a model professional both on and off the pitch, and Terry has been criticised of late for his tendency to confront match officials over contentious decisions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Chelsea skipper feels that his actions just prove how passionate he is about winning and insists that he is not about to change his ways any time soon. "I get frustrated and I like to make my point," he told <em>Icon</em> magazine in the build up to England's friendly with France.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"You have to be careful not to rant and rage though. "As captain, I think I am entitled to ask questions. If a referee explains his decision, I will walk away. "Being passionate has got me where I am today. I think I do set an example in the way I play. "If they don't want an England captain fighting for England in every way possible, fighting to win the ball and coming out of the tackle fighting for the cause, then that's down to them to make that decision.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Whilst I am captain, I am not going to change the way I am on the pitch. "When I'm off the pitch, I will be as nice as pie. I'll sign autographs, I'll smile, but as soon as I cross the white line, I am there to win the game."</p>
              <p> </p>

              <h1>El Tel rubbishes Capello captaincy auditions</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Former England boss Terry Venables has criticised Fabio Capello's decision to rotate captains and believes the Italian is showing his international inexperience. Steven Gerrard led the side for Capello's first match in charge of England against Switzerland in January with Rio Ferdinand taking over the armband in France last Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Capello is planning to give at least two more players the captaincy before settling on a permanent skipper for the World Cup qualifiers, but Venables believes the system causes 'aggravations where there should not be any'.</p>
              <p>Writing in <em>The Sun</em>, he said: 'It worries me to see the England captaincy turned into some sort of audition. Why is Fabio Capello wasting precious time asking these questions when the World Cup qualifiers are getting closer by the minute?</p>
              <p>'Capello has never managed an international team before. But believe me, it is a whole new ball game. Decisions have to be made sharp and quick.'</p>
              <p>Venables has thrown his weight behind Chelsea skipper John Terry, who was captain under former boss Steve McClaren, for the role.</p>
              <p>'I would give the skipper's job to John Terry, who is a natural leader,' added Venables. 'Rio Ferdinand has a nice way, Steven Gerrard leads by example, but JT has the edge - as long as he puts all his off-field nonsense behind him.'</p>

              <h1>Grant defends embattled skipper Terry</h1>
              <p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/44510000/jpg/_44510001_terry_203_get.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="152"></p>
              <p><strong>Chelsea coach Avram Grant does not believe captain John Terry needs a rest despite a number of unforced errors in recent games. The Chelsea defender has come under fire after mistakes for both club and country in recent weeks.</strong></p>
              <p>But Grant insists that Terry was one of his star performers in last Sunday's 2-1 Premier League victory over title rivals Arsenal at Stamford Bridge. 'Against Arsenal he was one of our best players,' declared Grant. 'Emmanuel Adebayor didn't create even one chance against him.</p>
              <p>'Sometimes mistakes happen. I didn't see the England game, but again I was a national coach. I have a problem with these friendly games. They're not for judging results, but other things. In the last match, I was very happy with John Terry.'</p>
              <p>New England coach Fabio Capello handed the captaincy to Rio Ferdinand but Grant believes there is still time for Terry to prove to the Italian that he is the man who should wear the armband on a permanent basis. Grant added: 'He's a mature guy. He wants to be captain, but he understands the decision of the manager and respects it.</p>
              <p>'There is a lot of time before the (World Cup) qualification game. I understand Fabio's decision, what he is doing. For me, John Terry should be captain. But he's the manager. You need to respect that decision. 'I think he's a great leader, but I don't make the decision. I cannot say I was surprised. I cannot say I was surprised because Capello said he would test some things and he hasn't nominated a player. At the end of the day, England will have the right captain for them.</p>
              <p>'In football, even if you've proved yourself in the past as a captain, you always need to prove yourself again and again. 'It doesn't matter about the captaincy. Sometimes people say you're only as good as your last game, I don't believe that, but you do need to keep proving yourself.'</p>
