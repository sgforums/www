Ferguson has been quick to smooth over his relationship with Strachan and Sunday's newspapers suggested "peace had broken out" between the two men.<br><br>"I want to win at Celtic Park because it's important to finish first in the section," Ferguson told the Sunday Mail.<br><br>"But I'd also like to see Celtic finish second. It would be great for them and Scottish football. I'm keen to finish the job in Glasgow though.<br><br>"We wanted to do it against FC Copenhagen earlier this month, but lost 1-0."<br>Wayne Rooney was in scintillating form for United against Sheffield United on Saturday, scoring both goals in United's seventh successive league win, and will relish the big-match atmosphere at Celtic.<br><br>While Ferguson has no injury concerns, Celtic striker Kenny Miller has been out with an ankle knock and defender Gary Caldwell limped off with a knee injury after an hour of the Inverness game on Saturday.<br><br>However, Strachan is happy to have Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink and the gritty Thomas Gravesen available.<br><br>"It will help us with Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink and Thomas Gravesen coming back because we missed that bit of experience at Benfica," Strachan said, referring to the 3-0 defeat to the Portuguese side in their last Champions League outing.<br><br>Probable teams:<br><br>Celtic: 1-Artur Boruc; 2-Paul Telfer, 3-Lee Naylor, 6-Bobo Balde, 44-Stephen McManus; 16-Thomas Gravesen, 25-Shunsuke Nakamura, 18-Neil Lennon (capt), 46-Aiden McGeady; 9-Kenny Miller, 10-Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink<br><br>Manchester United: 1-Edwin van der Sar; 2-Gary Neville, 5-Rio Ferdinand, 15-Nemanja Vidic, 3-Patrice Evra; 7-Cristiano Ronaldo, 16-Michael Carrick, 18-Paul Scholes, 11-Ryan Giggs; 9-Louis Saha, 8-Wayne Rooney.<br><br>Referee: Manuel Mejuto Gonzales (Spain)<br></div>

At the time, the club feared he might need an operation that would rule him out for the entire group stage.<br><br>Despite looking rusty, Gronkjaer played a full match at the weekend in Copenhagen's 2-2 draw against Midtjylland in the Danish league.<br><br>However, Copenhagen travelled to Lisbon without Norwegian left back Andre Bergdolmo, who has a groin injury, and Ghanaian midfielder Razak Pimpong, who is sick.<br><br>Manchester United lead the group with nine points from four matches ahead of Celtic on six, while Copenhagen and Benfica trail on four points each.

            <div class='col-md body'>Title celebrations could derail CSKA run<br><br>MOSCOW, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Newly-crowned Russian champions CSKA Moscow must overcome massive jetlag and a sweet hangover after clinching a second consecutive league title at the weekend to take on Porto in the Champions League on Tuesday.<br><br>CSKA have had only two days to prepare for the Group G clash after landing in Moscow in the early hours of Sunday morning following their 15,000-km round-trip journey through seven time zones to the eastern port city of Vladivostok where they crushed local side Luch 4-0 to secure first place with a game to spare.<br><br>Local media reported that the army club had brought several cases of champagne on board with them to toast their victory during a 10-hour flight back to Moscow.<br><br>But CSKA coach Valery Gazzayev played down the celebrations, saying his team would be ready to take on the Portuguese knowing victory would put them in the last 16.<br><br>'That (Luch) win is in the past, all we're thinking now is the Porto game,' he was quoted as saying by the Russian media.<br><br>CSKA boast one of the tightest defences in the Champions League, having kept a clean sheet in all four group matches. The Russians top the group on eight points, a point ahead of both Arsenal and Porto.<br><br>Gazzayev remained cautious, however.<br><br>'They (Porto) are a very dangerous team so we have to keep our guard up at all times,' he said.<br><br>Porto should be boosted by memories of their previous visit to Moscow two years ago when they beat CSKA 1-0 in a similar group tie on their way to reaching the next round.<br><br>Porto coach Jesualdo Ferreira refused to talk about the CSKA game after beating Academica 2-1 on Saturday when his side looked nervous, scoring the winning goal six minutes from time.<br><br>Porto are missing Brazilian playmaker Anderson, who is not expected to return for around three months after having surgery on Sunday, while defender Pedro Emanuel is out of form.<br><br>But they have welcomed back Brazilian striker Adriano and his compatriot Ibsom, who returns after two months out due to injury. Midfielder Jose Bosingnwa and Argentine striker Lisandro Lopez should also be available despite nursing minor injuries.<br><br>CSKA are also missing key players through injury. They will be without their defensive linchpin, skipper Sergei Ignashevich, and the club's top scorer, Brazilian striker Jo.<br><br>Probable teams:<br><br>CSKA Moscow: 35-Igor Akinfeyev; 2-Deividas Semberas, 6-Alexei Berezutsky, 24-Vasily Berezutsky; 17-Milos Krasic, 18-Yuri Zhirkov, 20-Dudu, 22-Yevgeny Aldonin, 25-Elvir Rahimic; 7-Daniel Carvalho, 11-Vagner Love<br><br>Porto: 1-Helton; 12-Jose Bosingwa, 3-Pepe, 14-Bruno Alves, 5-Cech, 16-Raul Meireles, 8-Lucho Gonzales, 5-Ibsom, 7-Ricardo Quaresma, 23-Helder Postiga, 9-Lisandro Lopez.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Contenders vie for vacant spots<br>Monday, 20 November 2006<br><br>With two rounds remaining in the UEFA Champions League group stage, the qualifying picture is becoming ever clearer. Six teams are already through Â– Liverpool FC, PSV Eindhoven, FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen, Valencia CF, Olympique Lyonnais and Real Madrid CF Â– while ten places remain up for grabs. With some sections set to go to the wire on Matchday 6, the penultimate batch of fixtures could prove the most dramatic.<br><br>Group A<br>Chelsea FC will win the group with just a draw at Werder Bremen, regardless of results elsewhere. But should Bremen triumph by a two-goal margin, they would take pole position in the section. An FC Barcelona victory at PFC Levski Sofia would guarantee their qualification chances going into the final round, but a draw or a defeat for the holders combined with a Bremen win would end their hopes. Levski must prevail to have any possibility of taking third place.<br><br>Group B<br>Already qualified Bayern will clinch the group with victory at FC Spartak Moskva. A draw would also confirm top spot should the match between FC Internazionale Milano and Sporting Clube de Portugal end in a draw. Inter will go through with three points. Spartak can no longer finish in the leading two places and must win to stay in UEFA Cup contention.<br><br>Group C<br>With both Liverpool and PSV through, three points for either side at Anfield would see them confirmed in pole position. The same applies in the UEFA Cup showdown between FC Girondins de Bordeaux and Galatasaray SK. A draw in either contest would leave matters unresolved until the final matches.<br><br>Group D<br>Valencia are in the last 16 and can seal first place against Olympiacos CFP if they better AS Roma's result at FC Shakhtar Donetsk. Should Valencia lose and Roma win, the Spanish team would still have the edge going into their Matchday 6 clash in Italy, as 2-1 victors in the clubs' first meeting. Victory would be enough for Roma to confirm their progress and a draw would suffice should Olympiacos not win. Olympiacos must prevail to keep in contention and then hope Roma do not win at Shakhtar, who themselves have to take three points to stay alive.<br><br>Group E<br>Lyon and Madrid will contest top spot when they meet in Spain. Lyon have the advantage following their 2-0 Matchday 1 success and the Merengues need to win by a three-goal margin to usurp them going into the final day. A draw would confirm Lyon as section winners. FC Steaua Bucuresti will take the UEFA Cup berth if they draw against visitors FC Dynamo Kyiv - and will even maintain third position ahead of Matchday 6 with a defeat, provided it is not as heavy as the 4-1 opening-night loss Dynamo suffered at Steaua's hands.<br><br>Group F<br>While victory in Glasgow will ensure Manchester United FC top spot, a draw would also be enough to take the English club through, while Celtic FC can qualify if they win and the SL Benfica-FC KÃ¸benhavn fixture ends all-square. A Celtic success that betters the 3-2 defeat inflicted on them by United on Matchday 1 would see the Scottish side move ahead in the race for pole position. Defeat for either Benfica or KÃ¸benhavn would extinguish their knockout hopes, while a draw would do the same to both should Celtic win.<br><br>Group G<br>PFC CSKA Moskva can confirm a top-two finish with victory against visiting FC Porto, while that coupled with Arsenal FC failing to beat Hamburger SV at home would clinch top spot. With Hamburg already fixed in last place, any other sequence of results would still leave the qualifying picture wide open on Matchday 6.<br><br>Group H<br>AC Milan require just a point at AEK Athens FC to secure qualification, while three would win them the group. Should AEK fail to win, then LOSC Lille MÃ©tropole can also go through with a home success against RSC Anderlecht. A score draw will only keep the Belgian club's European aspirations alive if Milan stop AEK winning.<br><br>Â©uefa.com 1998-2006. All rights reserved.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lyon primed for perfection<br>Monday, 20 November 2006<br><br>Olympique Lyonnais are on target for a record-breaking conclusion to their UEFA Champions League group-stage campaign in advance of their Matchday 5 trip to Real Madrid CF.<br><br>Perfect six<br>The French champions are two wins away from becoming only the fifth team Â– and the first since FC Barcelona in 2002/03 Â– to win all six games in a group stage. The first to manage it were AC Milan in the inaugural 1992/93 edition of the UEFA Champions League. Since then Paris Saint-Germain FC (1994/95) and FC Spartak Moskva (1995/96) have matched the achievement, before that BarÃ§a success in the last season before the competition was revamped into its current format.<br><br>Unwanted record<br>Barcelona are not having such an easy ride this time around. A draw or defeat for the title-holders at PFC Levski Sofia and a Werder Bremen victory over Chelsea FC would make the Camp Nou side the first defending champions to fail to get through a group stage since the UEFA Champions League began. (This record, like the others, includes the four seasons that featured a second group stage between 1999/00 and 2002/03.)<br><br>Clean sheets<br>With no such worries, Lyon are also going for another UEFA Champions League first. No team has negotiated a group stage without conceding a goal but Lyon, along with FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen and PFC CSKA Moskva, could yet change that having managed four clean sheets to date. In contrast FC Dynamo Kyiv and Levski Sofia have both shipped 13 goals in their first four outings this term, just six short of the record number let in by FerencvÃ¡rosi TC in the 1995/96 campaign.<br><br>Shot shy<br>For all their defensive solidity, CSKA have only scored two goals so far. They can take comfort from the achievement of Villarreal CF last season and AS Roma in the 2002/03 first group stage, as both clubs advanced to the next phase with just three goals to their name. Villarreal are a particularly noteworthy example, as they made it all the way to the semi-finals in their debut campaign in the competition.<br><br>Seven enough<br>The good news for those who have made a slow start but are still in contention is that seven sides have successfully negotiated a group with only seven points. The first to do it were Legia Warszawa in 1995/96 before Bayer 04 Leverkusen managed it in 1999/00 and Liverpool FC in 2001/02. FC Lokomotiv Moskva and Juventus both progressed with seven points in 2002/03, a feat most recently achieved by Rangers FC and Bremen last term.<br><br>Freescoring United<br>The record for most goals scored in a group stage was established by Manchester United FC in 1998/99 when they found the net 20 times en route to lifting the trophy. It is a mark that is unlikely to be challenged this year, with the closest contenders being Spanish rivals Real Madrid CF and Valencia CF who have ten goals each to their name.<br><br>Athens goal<br>In terms of individual scoring, Chelsea FC forward Didier Drogba and AC Milan playmaker KakÃ¡, with five apiece from their first four games, are on track to break Ruud van Nistelrooy's single-season record of 2002/03, when he struck 12 in nine matches. Both Drogba and KakÃ¡ will hope to have another nine fixtures in the current competition, which of course would mean their respective clubs reaching the final in Athens on 23 May.</div>

It is too difficult a move."<br><br>With the Premiership's lesser lights unwilling to vote for a proposition which could cost them a place in the league, and the bigger fish anxious not to concede any of their power, the path to England is locked and bolted for the Glasgow giants, meaning European confrontations represent the only true measure of the respective standards.<br><br>United will start hefty favourites to gain the victory which would seal qualification and top spot in Group E with a game to spare.<br><br>However, Ferguson is wary of the threat Celtic pose, particularly in front of the home side's supporters.<br><br>"Celtic Park is without question one of the best atmospheres anyone could experience and their players can be inspired by it," he said.<br><br>"Celtic's record at home is one of the best in Europe, so we accept we are in for a tough game."<br><br>Even though Chelsea visit Old Trafford on Sunday in a top-of-the-Premiership showdown, Ferguson is promising no more than two changes to the side which beat Sheffield United last weekend.<br><br>One of them could see captain Gary Neville rested in favour of either John O'Shea or Wes Brown, with the Red Devils boss admitting his long-serving full-back may eventually require an operation to cure a worrying calf problem which has plagued him since returning from the World Cup.<br></div>

It is too difficult a move."<br><br></div>
