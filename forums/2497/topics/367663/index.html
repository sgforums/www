              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Sir Alex: Michael Owen</em> <em>could became an Old Trafford hero</em></p>
              </div>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1199066" rel="1199066|3| nofollow" href="/sport/football/article-1199066/Owen-smiles-better-United-beams-Ferguson.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson believes Michael Owen could became an Old Trafford hero after seeing how the 29-year-old striker has responded to his first week's training with his new Manchester United team-mates.</strong></p>
              <p>The United manager said: 'There is no doubt he could really get his goalscoring form back on track with us. But really he has never lost it.</p>
              <p>'Although he had a few injury problems at Newcastle, he kept up the excellent goals-per-game ratio he has had throughout his career. I've been really pleased with the way he has trained. He has worked hard but the main thing is he coming into work with a smile on his face. He is really enjoying himself.'</p>
              <p>Owen, right, is relishing the opportunity he has been given by Ferguson's dramatic swoop when the former Liverpool player was running out of options. There had been offers from Hull City and Stoke City, while Everton had shown interest, as had a couple of Turkish clubs.</p>
              <p>But having shown little inclination to take the player on themselves, many of United's Premier League rivals now think the Old Trafford boss could have pulled off a masterstroke.</p>
              <p>Hull manager Phil Brown said: 'We would have loved Michael to have come here and we're happy about having been in the frame to get him. But once United came in, that was it. I can see him really getting back into top gear.'</p>
              <p>Owen jets out this week for United's tour of the Far East. The party includes the likes of Wayne Rooney and Nemanja Vidic, who were allowed a longer break after their international duties.</p>

              <p>The 29-year-old spent eight successful seasons at Anfield at the start of his career, scoring 158 goals in all competitions. However that has not stopped the striker joining the Reds' fiercest rivals Manchester United on a free transfer from Newcastle this summer.</p>
              <p>Benitez told <em>The People</em>: "We had contact with different people and were analysing the situation. "But if you want to play Torres and Gerrard there is not always a lot of space for other players.</p>
              <p>"When I brought back Robbie Fowler it was a different situation. We were looking for someone who could understand his role clearly and he was a good finisher. "But we have a World Cup coming up and all the top players want to play. In his position it would be hard for Owen to play every week at Liverpool."</p>
              <p>The Spaniard is also confident he already has enough squad depth at his disposal to cope with any injuries to his preferred front pairing.</p>
              <p>"We are confident in (Dirk) Kuyt, (Ryan) Babel, (David) Ngog and (Andriy) Voronin for next season. We have players with quality," he added.</p>
              <p>"People say I might need another striker but I remember signing Robbie Keane and everyone was saying good things.</p>
              <p>"Then after I sold Robbie people were saying I was short of strikers but we scored more goals than anyone in the Premier League."</p>
