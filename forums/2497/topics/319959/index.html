              <h2>Mark Hughes will begin his Manchester City tenure with the
              proverbial knife at his throat right from start, according to the
              Manchester media.</h2>
              <p>City have officially unveiled the Welshman as their new manager and
              notoriously short-fused Thai owner Thaksin Shinawatra has allegedly
              warned him that nothing less than a top-six finish will do in his first
              season.<br><br>Shinawatra was, by his own admission, ruthless in his
              treatment of Swedish coach Sven-Goran Eriksson after he 'only' managed
              to lead the club into ninth-place, and the indications are that he is
              not about to change his spots ahead of next season.<br><br>The ex
              Blackburn boss will reportedly be given about £40m straight from
              Thaksin's pocket to beef up the squad in the summer, but in return the
              ex Thai premier has demanded a top-six finish next season and a
              Champions League spot in the year thereafter.<br><br>Hughes worked
              small wonders during his time at Ewood Park and is said to be intent on
              raiding his former club to boost his own cause, with Blackburn winger
              David Bentley and striker Roque Santa Cruz said to feature high on his
              shopping list.</p>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>MARK HUGHES wants to make Manchester City as big as their red rivals from down the road.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">The new Eastlands boss knows City might never match United’s global popularity — but he insists they can challenge them in the success stakes, just as Chelsea have in recent years.</p>
              <p class="article">And Hughes admits Blues owner Thaksin Shinawatra’s pledge to dig deep into his £900million fortune was the bait that lured him back to Manchester.</p>
              <p class="article">The former United striker said: “The ambition is to challenge the top clubs — not just in the Premier League, but in Europe.</p>
              <p class="article">“If we can get the right players in the right positions, that is more than realistic. The finance and the commitment are there to bring those players here.</p>
              <p class="article">“I’m very excited by the plans to take this club forward. We want a sustained period of success and the roof will go off the place if we get it</p>
              <p class="article">“The plan is to raise the profile of this club, not only in this country but worldwide as well. That also appeals to me.</p>
              <p class="article">“It is a huge project. But once City’s intentions were clear, I wanted to be part of it.”</p>
              <p class="article">Hughes, 45, left Blackburn to sign a three-year deal which will earn him £9m.</p>
              <p class="article">Former City boss Sven Goran Eriksson also had a three-year contract — and was sacked after just 10 months. But ‘Sparky’ is losing no sleep over the Swede’s ruthless axing.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: “They have big plans and they recognise I am a young man in managerial terms and that I have the drive and energy to propel the club from within.</p>
              <p class="article">“At different times you bring different managerial skills to the role and maybe the energy you need to be a driving force is not there in some people.</p>
              <p class="article">“Last season was a positive one for the club for long periods. But you need to be consistently challenging the top clubs.</p>
              <p class="article">“Every manager is under pressure. It is a results-driven business and you are judged on the decisions you make. It doesn’t faze me. I have worked with pressure as a player and a manager and I have learned to deal with it — even thrive on it.</p>
              <p class="article">“I could easily have stayed at Blackburn and been comfortable, but that’s not what I am about.</p>
              <p class="article">“I want to be somewhere where the level of expectation is high. I love the crackle of the atmosphere leading into key games and that’s what I want to experience again and again.”</p>
              <p class="article">Hughes won nine trophies during his two spells at Old Trafford during the 1990s and also played for Chelsea in the pre-Roman Abramovich era.</p>
              <p class="article">The Welshman added: “When I signed for Chelsea they had a rusty old stand and a big hole for a car park. Just look at them now.</p>
              <p class="article">“There are different periods of progress at every club and I believe this will be one for us.</p>
              <p class="article">“I’m trying to progress my managerial career and I’m at a great club with a great fan base who have reacted very positively to my appointment. But fans of every football club will show their disapproval if their team is not performing or getting results.</p>
              <p class="article">“I believe in my own ability. My passion and my drive are there for all to see.</p>
              <p class="article">“If you see how my teams play, you see that the work I do has a positive impact.</p>
              <p class="article">“I’ll back my ability against most managers in the Premier League and I think my management team is one of the best in the business.”</p>
              <p class="article">Hughes has long been tipped as a successor to Alex Ferguson when the United boss finally retires. But the new City chief was not prepared to hang around to find out.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “I cannot wait around for opportunities that might or might not come one, five or maybe even 10 years down the line.</p>
              <p class="article">“When opportunities arrive you take them, or you regret them for the rest of your life.</p>
              <p class="article">“The opportunity at City is there for all to see.</p>
              <p class="article">“At Blackburn we had three top-10 finishes and three cup semi-finals. I want to move on from that and start winning trophies.</p>
              <p class="article">“If I am successful here I won’t need any stepping stones to anywhere else.”</p>
              <p class="article">And has he received any messages from his old boss congratulating him on his new job?</p>
              <p class="article">Hughes revealed: “No, no — what would you expect?”</p>
