              <p>In the US, where Henry's New England Sports Ventures has taken the Boston Red Sox to two World Series titles, Henry said players were generally held to their contracts and clubs were in control. In the post-Bosman world of European football, however, players and their agents tend to hold sway.</p>
              <p>"It's a culture shock, there's no doubt about it. It's like the wild west," said Henry, who implied there was more certainty in US sport. "It's a completely different system here from what we're used to. If a player has a contract in the US, they fulfil the contract. Over here, it seems players have much more say so."</p>
              <p>Steven Gerrard, the <span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span>captain, has encouraged the new owners to invest in the team as soon as possible. "I think the Americans have got the right idea by trying to build a platform for this club for many years but, of course, when I speak to them, I'm going to be wanting the quick fix because I have got four or five years left at this level and I want to win trophies before I finish because that is what I go to work for," he said.</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool would not be allowed to organise a Barclays Premier League fixture overseas, it was confirmed on Saturday. </strong></p>
              <p>New Reds co-owner Tom Werner revealed on Friday that he would be keen for the club to play a regular-season match abroad.</p>
              <p>The American's comments raised the spectre of 'the 39th game', the concept of an additional international round of matches floated by the Premier League two and a half years ago.</p>
              <p>That idea was shelved indefinitely after meeting massive opposition from clubs, fans and FIFA.</p>
              <p>And a Premier League spokesman told Press Association Sport on Saturday that Liverpool and another top-flight club could not unilaterally stage a match outside of England.</p>
              <p>Werner had told BBC Sport: "Pre-season matches are great but why not have an actual match in season?</p>
              <p>"I think first of all the Premier League is the strongest league in the world and its reach is global.</p>
              <p>"It's been very impressive to me, the number of people globally who watch, and we hope to expand that imprint.</p>
              <p>"I think the more important the game, the more excitement."</p>
              <p>Many Premier League clubs organise money-spinning overseas pre-season tours in territories where English football is popular, such as Asia and the United States.</p>
              <p>Playing a competitive fixture could be even more lucrative and it was this which arguably led to the idea being mooted in the first place.</p>
              <p>The Premier League also confirmed today there were no current plans to revive the proposal.</p>
              <p> </p>
