The way you post and the words you used are never friendly... Your first post is alway out to create trouble with others. If the news is valid and reported in some Press, by all means, post it! I have nothing against it and i have never edited a single thread for this reason...

Though i am not sure what part of "well i'm outta here..." means to you... But ok, you have said your piece... So hopefully we will see the last of you in here. Bye Bye... Take your foul mouth and personal attacks along with you cos this folder doesn't encourage flaming of this kind. This fold is just plainly for news and sharing of views and not for sorts like you who have a tendency for personal attacks and used of foul words...<br><br>Others have been here with different views and we accept that its just a difference of opinion, and after a good exchanged we move on... But one major thing they differ from you is they don't use personal attacks and foul words when they discuss the topic... Just simple and straight forward reasoning is all that it takes.<br><br>Go and take a long hard look at it pal before innocently saying "just give my opinion" Your opinion don't need to have foul words and personal attacks if you honestly don't have the intention to cause offence to anyone... Flaming... Let me tell you, you are the cause of most flaming in here... Even when you got a simple football rules wrong and others in here point it out to you, you still go around causing trouble... and till today, you still can't accept or admit that you were wrong.<br><br>And like i have said, i have never gone to YNWA forum or the Gunners forum to create any trouble with anyone there... How about you, can you say the same about yourself in here, or at Sports and at the Man Utd folder? I guess not right... cos you do have a long history for going around to create trouble with others... <a href="http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=238965" rel="nofollow">http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=238965</a> Your hatred for the Man utd club and their fans is really amazing... I can't imagine how it must have hurt you all those years during the mid 90s and early 2000 and even worst last season... Its only football, no need to be so serious.<br><br>I don't like to pick fights with others, but if these people come in here to create trouble, i will not just sit back and let them bash those who comes here or my co-mod. And If you are really honest in not causing offence to others... You can start with cutting out the foul words and personal attacks which normally comes with your post. You can simply get your message across, no need to resort to these things if your reasons are valid...<br><br></div>

I believe it was recorded much earlier, but why does it come out only now? I'm quite sure there were so many chances before. Of all times it's not sooner, not later but when loyalty within Chelsea dressing room is at doubt.<br><br>Is Drogba's agent trying to push a transfer through? Is someone interested in Drogba trying to unsettle the player or the club? I just think there's a reason and motive behind it coming out now afterall.</div>

He just feels that the news you provide is not balanced. Why is it that the news seems to be unbalanced in this forum I don't know, although what to post is really individual choice. I just don't see the need to act in snide comments and unnecessarily talk down other clubs.<br><br>Also, I think he sees no difference between what the anti-Man U clonemaster and what some of the other Man U fans are doing. He feels Man U fans get away with it purely because they are Man U fans like the moderators. The moderators let them get away with it.</div>
