He just feels that the news you provide is not balanced. Why is it that the news seems to be unbalanced in this forum I don't know, although what to post is really individual choice. I just don't see the need to act in snide comments and unnecessarily talk down other clubs.<br><br>Also, I think he sees no difference between what the anti-Man U clonemaster and what some of the other Man U fans are doing. He feels Man U fans get away with it purely because they are Man U fans like the moderators. The moderators let them get away with it.</div></blockquote>Please man, go out and take a look around... How often do you come across news on Man utd apart from the transfer gossips... How about Arsenal or Pool or Spurs? Evey club have news once in a while but not always... But when Mourinho was at chelsea, there was always lots of news... cos you can't deny he seem to be making a lot of them of his own choice right. That could also be one of the reason he was eventually sack for dragging the club's good name thru the mud all the time... Accusing referee, not just english ones but uefa ones too, other team players, managers, almost everyone lah, even the medical staff at Reading and the police too... You don't hear Grant making too many negative news do you? But more importantly, these are Press reports, true or not, they weren't some made up stories like we can see in Sports. Mostly self-titled and unsubstantiated ones!<br><br>And please see carefully before trying to find a silly reason for his behaviour... I have been in here long enough and I know you are also one that don't condone name calling and personal attacks... But this guy just seem to have no ending with this behaviour... The reason i don't go around much is because i don't want any trouble with him or Gp for that matter. But he came into here and Man utd folder looking for trouble with their members... He can come at me, i don't really care... i always ignore what he says even when he mentioned about me in Sports. But if he wants to disturb my friends in this or Man Utd folder then i will not hesitate to have a go at him... Cos he has stoop as low as to attacked my friends Agenda and dmi and wish they would fail their O levels apart from his usual foul words name calling posts... What type of character is this? If he is really sincere in not causing offence, you can tell by his first post already what... why the name calling still? and why must use foul words on other members in here? He can do that in Sports, if its moderators don't do anything about it, its their problem. But i won't allow that to be done here and to degrade this folder... Flaming is good for ratings i know... just look at the number of people who bother to come and view this thread alone... But its not encourage and its not welcome in here too. If you want to have a proper discussion, i say Come. But if your intention is only to flame others in here, then i would say Don't Come, its not welcome in here.<br><br>Maybe you might not know but sometime back I have already tried to tell a number of man utd members in here not to create trouble too in Sports but not everyone will listen cos if they come across a another taunting thread in Sports... Then what happen? But you never see me getting involve have you? I always stay away from such things cos its silly. But i am quite sure you can find him there in the thick of things...<br><br>You and me don't always agree on everything too but we always discuss in a proper way don't we? Do we need name calling or personal attacks? of course not right... Anyway, if you are still interested to know... there is already this guy Gp that never fail to post negative news, reported or self-created ones about Utd... So do i still need to double it up? And also, just to let you know... It was kenny who was the first to report on the negative news about Ronaldo, Nani and Anderson engaging escort service... and not Gp...<br></div>
