              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Aston Villa</span></abbr> boss Martin O'Neill says they're waiting on an answer from <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> defender Richard Dunne about moving to Villa Park.</p>
              <p>"There's still some distance to go," O'Neill told Villa's website. "We
              have agreed a fee and we have been given permission to speak to
              Richard. He has come down this morning and that's why I said last night
              that it's a way from being done.</p>
              <p>"Until you actually speak to the player and hear his views, you never know. He may well have wanted to stay at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>"At this moment, he is happy with what he seen here but he
              hasn't signed yet. And obviously until things are signed, I won't get
              too carried away.</p>
              <p>"Overall, I'd be delighted if he joined - he would give us that
              experience and ability. We have permission but I have no further
              update.</p>
              <p>"With all transfers, there are issues to look at, with Richard there's obviously his spell at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> and he's got one or two things to iron out there. I think those are the
              things that are being taken into consideration as we speak."</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Dunne due massive Man City pay-off ahead of Villa move</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p>Richard Dunne is set to be given a staggering multi-million pound pay-off by <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> ahead of completing his move to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Aston Villa</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>The <em>Daily Star Sunday</em> says that’s the windfall the
              Republic of Ireland defender was guaranteed from a testimonial next
              year – after being bought from <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Everton</span></abbr> for £3m back in October 2000.</p>
              <p>Villa have agreed a £6m fee for Dunne but the former City skipper needs
              to have the final details sorted out on his bumper pay-off.</p>
              <p>Old club <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Everton</span></abbr> have been keen on Dunne, too, along with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sunderland</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Yet Villa have won the race and will pay him £52,000 a week to prise him away from the City of Manchester Stadium.</p>
              <p>All that remains now is for the City powerbrokers to sort out his compensation.</p>

              <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Aston Villa</span></abbr> have finalised a deal for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> defender Richard Dunne.
              <div class="content">
              <p> </p>
              <p>Villa  were given dispensation to complete a £5million deal for Dunne  as negotiations over his departure from <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> rumbled on past the 5pm deadline.</p>
              <p>Under <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> rules, Villa were able to continue trying to sign Dunne provided they
              started formal proceedings to tie up the deal by the 5pm cut-off.</p>
              <p>Dunne had passed a medical and settled personal terms with
              Villa after the clubs agreed a fee before the weekend. But the Ireland
              defender wanted compensation for giving up a testimonial at City next
              summer.</p>
              <p>He did not ask to leave City and still had three years left on
              his £55,000-a-week contract. It is believed the initial offer made by
              City fell well short of what Dunne felt was a reasonable figure.</p>
              <p>A source close to the player told the <em>Daily Mail</em>: "Richard believes the initial offer he received from <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> was not befitting someone who had given nine years’ service."</p>

                  <div class="sp-story">
                  <p>Aston Villa have taken their summer spending to £40m after finally
                          confirming the signing of Manchester City skipper <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8210">Richard Dunne</a>.</p><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2009/0901/richarddunnemcfcaug09_275x155.jpg" border="0" alt="Richard Dunne" width="275" height="155"><h4 style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0px;font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;font-weight:normal;">Republic of Ireland captain Dunne has ended his nine-year spell with City by
                          making a £6m switch from Eastlands.</h4>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>The Premier League asked for more time to ratify the deal despite Villa
                          starting to submit the relevant documents before 4pm on deadline day - an hour before
                          the transfer window formally closed.</p>
                  <p>But Villa were always confident Dunne would become their player after passing a
                          medical and agreeing personal terms. The Football Association were also satisfied with the paperwork presented by Villa but needed the approval of the Premier League.</p>
                  <p>Dunne becomes Villa's second defensive capture of the past 24 hours after Welsh international James
                          Collins signed from West Ham for £5m.</p>
                  <p>Manager <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=37">Martin O'Neill</a> has been desperate to bolster his back four after
                          skipper Martin Laursen retired and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8889">Zat Knight</a> was sold to Bolton.</p>
                  <p>He said: "Richard Dunne is the kind of person we are looking for.''</p>
                  <p>Dunne's days at Eastlands appeared to be numbered after the arrival of Kolo
                          Toure from Arsenal and then <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=5355">Joleon Lescott</a> from Everton.</p>
                  <p>Villa started the current campaign with only two experienced centre-backs in
                          <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=39488">Curtis Davies</a> and Carlos Cuellar. The need for new blood became even more pressing after Davies started to suffer more regular recurrences of his long standing shoulder problem and he may need
                          surgery.</p>
                  <p>O'Neill was forced to blood 19-year-old <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=129754">Ciaran Clark</a> alongside Cuellar in
                          Sunday's 2-0 home success over Fulham.</p>
                  <p>Villa agreed a fee last week with City for Dunne but the deal dragged on past
                          the weekend because the player wanted to sort out financial issues relating to
                          the remaining three years of his contract. Dunne would have been entitled to a testimonial next summer when he would have completed a decade of service at City.</p>
                  <p>Villa skipper <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=4245">Stiliyan Petrov</a> said: "He's the captain
                          of Ireland, he's been the captain of Manchester City. You love to see players
                          like that coming to this club.</p>
                  <p>"Martin Laursen was a big player for us, with his presence and his influence.
                          But he, like <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8185">Gareth Barry</a>, is now gone and we need to get on without him. The arrival of Dunne will help us to do that.''</p>
                  <p>Villa had previously splashed out £29 million since the end of last season on
                          <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=21187">Stewart Downing</a> (£12m), <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=23144">Stephen Warnock</a> (£8m), <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=98926">Fabian Delph</a> (£6m) and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=21970">Habib Beye</a> (£3m).£3m</p>
