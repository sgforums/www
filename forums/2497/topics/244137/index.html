The former Holland coach has moved to the top of the Stamford Bridge shortlist to come in if Jose Mourinho is sacked at the end of the season. </strong><br><br>According to those close to Abramovich, Mourinho's conduct has deteriorated in recent months and it is expected that the Russian billionaire will sack the Portuguese coach. Such is the discord between the pair, Abramovich has reportedly considered sacking Mourinho before the end of this season, despite Chelsea still being involved in the Premiership title race, the FA Cup and the Champions League, having already won the Carling Cup. His behaviour has compounded the fact that the billionaire has not enjoyed watching Chelsea play of late. They may have only lost one game in their last 29 matches but the football produced has too often been unimpressive and lacking in flair.<br><br>According to the Independent, Rijkaard has been targeted by Abramovich to bring the kind of attacking football that Barcelona have produced over the past few seasons to the Premiership. Crucially, Rijkaard is also seen as a less confrontational figure than Mourinho, who has not been afraid of expressing his views and grievances.<br><br>The Independent claims that Rijkaard heads a list that features, or has featured at various times, Sevilla boss Juande Ramos, Internazionale coach Roberto Mancini, former Holland manager Guus Hiddink and Juventus coach Didier Deschamps.<br><br></div>

The Italian has responded negatively to reports that he and former Blues boss Gianluca Vialli could become the new management team at Stamford Bridge. </strong><br><br>Frank Rijkaard, Juande Ramos, Didier Deschamps, Guus Hiddink, Ronald Koeman and Roberto Mancini have all been strongly linked with Chelsea in recent months even though current coach Jose Mourinho continues to insist he is going nowhere and will see out his contract until 2010.<br><br>Now World Cup winning coach Lippi has made it clear that Chelsea have not made him an offer and that he harbours doubts about working abroad. Lippi said: 'These are just rumours and I hear many of those. The truth is that I haven't received any offers from Italian clubs, but only from foreign outfits, although Chelsea are not one of those. 'I am enjoying my time, I don't miss working and I might not start a new job this year.'<br><br>Lippi is concerned about moving outside of Italy where the language problems can often be a hindrance to coaches. He added: 'The main issue is the language, perhaps it would be better to avoid foreign outfits.'</div>
