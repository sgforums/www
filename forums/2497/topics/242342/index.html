According to The Times, the England midfielder is frustrated by the club's failure to offer him an acceptable new contract and he is considering buying himself out of the remaining two years of his current deal. </strong><br><br>FIFA transfer rules mean Lampard will become eligible to buy himself out of his own contract in July because he is over the age of 28 and because he has served a three-year "protected period" with the club.<br><br>Lampard is threatening to activate the clause if the Blues fail to offer him a bumper new deal by the end of March, potentially paving the way for him to join another club on a free transfer in the close season.<br><br>Spanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid have both expressed their admiration for the midfielder in the past, while Serie A leaders Inter Milan would also be interested in a move.<br><br>The Times claims Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon has not contacted Lampard's agent for more than three weeks, prompting the midfielder to make the threat.<br><br>The news is a double blow for Chelsea after contract talks with skipper John Terry broke down last week. Both Terry and Lampard are both reportedly upset at the club's refusal to offer them deals worth as much as the Â£130,000-a-week paid to summer signings Michael Ballack and Andriy Shevchenko.<br></div>

At current rates, the deal would be worth a minimum of Â£58.2m, making it the richest in British sporting history, but with new signings at the worldÂ’s biggest-spending club it would inevitably rise. </strong><br><br>The Â“limitless parityÂ” clause would guarantee that Terry was the highest-paid player at the club until beyond his 35th birthday. While Chelsea were prepared to increase his wages to the clubÂ’s current ceiling of Â£121,000 a week, which is paid to Michael Ballack and Andriy Shevchenko, they could not accept the liability of promising the defender equivalence with the clubÂ’s best-remunerated player for the best part of the next decade.<br><br>Having initially proposed a deal until the summer of 2016, Chelsea are understood to be surprised and disappointed that Terry has rejected their revised offer of Â£6.3m a year until the end of 2011-12 season. Club officials are, however, sanguine about suggestions that Terry might exploit Fifa regulations and buy out his contract at the end of this season, believing that they appear to be based on a misreading of the relevant clause. Section IV of FifaÂ’s Regulations for the Status and Transfer of Players dictates that players under the age of 28 can terminate their contracts a minimum of three years or seasons after their current deal came into force. As Terry, who is 26, resigned with Chelsea in November 2004, he cannot utilise the rule until the end of next season.<br><br>Chelsea have been eager to tie down their most important players with lucrative Â“golden handcuffsÂ” deals. The clubÂ’s leading scorer Didier Drogba agreed a revised Â£91,000-a-week contract in November. Michael Essien, is the latest to sign.<br><br>With Terry the least likely of MourinhoÂ’s stalwarts to be invited abroad by the manager because of his perceived unsuitability to the foreign game, both Chelsea and their captain expected a new contract to be agreed long before the end of the current campaign. Last month Terry believed that all the negotiations had been completed and that the parity clause had been included. The contract remained unsigned and further negotiations concluded last Wednesday having failed to produce a resolution.<br><br>TerryÂ’s present deal pays him Â£67,000 a week, a comparatively limited sum for a central figure at Stamford Bridge. His England teammate Lampard has been on Â£5m per annum since improving his terms in the summer of 2004. A source close to Terry said that parity with the clubÂ’s highest earners rather than the length of the new deal was his priority. David BeckhamÂ’s new contract with the Los Angeles Galaxy is worth a reputed Â£25.6m a year over five years.<br></div>

Captain Terry and England midfielder Lampard are trying to negotiate long-term extensions to their current contracts and want their respective situations resolved as soon as possible.<br><br>The club have yet to make a formal offer to Lampard while Terry is unhappy with the length of the contract put on the table by the club. Talks have been dragging on for months and the delay has sparked fresh speculation that they could quit the club in the summer.<br><br>However, both players are now reaching the final two years of their Stamford Bridge deals and want to stay. However, they want the same pay parity as top earners Michael Ballack and Andriy Shevchenko - both reported to be earning around Â£130,000-a-week and Lampard is keen to ensure that the loyalty shown to the club by him and Terry is not taken for granted.<br><br>Lampard, 28, may well be in a position to buy himself out of the club in the summer under FIFA rules. But Terry cannot do the same and the Blues captain is unhappy with Chelsea's decision to reduce the length of their offer from nine years to five.<br><br>However, despite continuing concerns over their futures, both coach Jose Mourinho and chief-executive Peter Kenyon insist the pair will be at Stamford Bridge for years.
