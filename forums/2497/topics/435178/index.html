              </div>
              <p></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Josh McEachran is aware of the glare which surrounds his rise through the Chelsea ranks and the expectation that he will be the first homegrown player to establish himself in the team since John Terry.  </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Inspired by Zinedine Zidane, the 18-year-old from Oxford has always caused a stir with his poise and elegant passing.</span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Andre Villas-Boas believes he has a true gem on his hands, a young midfielder capable of  making the sort of impact in the coming campaign that Jack Wilshere had last season.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">McEachran is 14 months younger than the Arsenal starlet and the pair have developed a friendship, with the Chelsea youngster looking to copy Wilshere's incredible progress.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'We speak quite a lot and text each other,' said McEachran. 'We say good luck before we play. I watch most of his games, see how he's doing, and give him encouragement. We've got similar abilities but Jack's a year or so ahead of me. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I'm happy with the progress he's been making, going to Bolton, coming back to Arsenal and playing for England.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Jack's one of the best young players in the world. He's done really well. Hopefully I can do what he's done.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Zidane influence is evident in McEachran's style.He always accepts the ball on the half-turn, ready to pass immediately. He is beautifully  balanced on the ball and capable of a quick change of pace or direction.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">In fact, he offers Chelsea  something they lack in midfield, a genuine passer. Maybe this it what encouraged Villas-Boas to embrace him in the first-team squad rather than rush him out on loan. 'I just want to get more minutes on the pitch this year,' said McEachran. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I'd love them to be at Chelsea but that's not really up to me. It's up to the manager. If he thinks I'm ready to play for Chelsea, I'll stay. If he thinks I need to go out on loan, I'll do that.' </span></p>
              <p> </p>

              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/07/29/article-2020353-0D3A0D8C000005DC-289_468x369.jpg" alt="Incredible progress: Arsenal starlet Jack Wilshere" width="468" height="369"></span>
              <p class="imageCaption">Incredible progress: Arsenal starlet Jack Wilshere</p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">During pre-season, Villas-Boas has played the teenager both as a holding midfielder and in a more advanced role, which McEachran admits he prefers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'The deeper No 6 position is very important and he touches the ball more in the position,' said the Chelsea manager. 'He has the technical and tactical awareness to play further forward, in the No 8 position. This flexibility is important for any coach.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">It was former Chelsea boss Luiz Felipe Scolari who plucked 15-year-old McEachran from the youth ranks and brought him to train with the first team.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Despite his slender frame he excelled, making his debut in the Champions League last season and starting his first Barclays Premier League game against  Newcastle in May.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Before flying off on Chelsea's tour of Asia, McEachran signed a five-year contract worth £30,000 a week, so it is clear the club think he is destined for the top. 'Josh is an exceptional talent,' said assistant manager Roberto di Matteo, who once graced Chelsea's midfield. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'It's been a long time since someone came through the academy as a potential first-team player. He has a bright future, which is also good for England.'    <br></span></p>
