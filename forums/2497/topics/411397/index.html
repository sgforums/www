              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Roy Hodgsin's Anfield reign has been rocked by the first sign of player unrest after Daniel Agger openly questioned his methods.</strong></p>
              <p>Agger has hit out at Roy Hodgson's style of play at Liverpool. In a direct challenge to Hodgson's authority, Agger expressed his opposition to <span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool's</span> style of play under their new manager and claimed he was ready to rebel against it.</p>
              <p>The Denmark centre half said Liverpool's back four were now under orders to launch long balls, and he made it clear he was prepared to risk the wrath of Hodgson rather than compromise his beliefs.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Speaking on Danish television, Agger said: 'The manager has a philosophy that we're playing football further up the pitch, and that means having to play a different kind of football at the back.</p>
              </div>
              <p>'That's not my style. That's not the type of football player I am. I like to keep the ball on the ground, and I'm going to keep doing that. Whether he'll use me or not, time will tell.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS">
              <p class="imageCaption">'I guess I will try to change, even though I'm not going to be the player who unloads the ball every time I get it. 'I'll fight for my chance. I'll get the chance. I know what I represent and I think he (Hodgson) also knows that.</p>
              </div>
              <p>'The manager makes the decisions. You have to adjust. That's the way it is and our play has changed, so I'll have to adjust a bit. But to be honest, I'm not going to adjust 100 per cent.'</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Waiting game: Agger must wait to discover if his comments have landed him in trouble</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Agger lost his starting place to Martin Skrtel at Old Trafford on Sunday and now awaits Hodgson's response to the cracks appearing in his new regime.</strong></p>
              <p>The former <span style="color: #000000;">Fulham</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span>boss has already come under fire for his side's listless performance at Birmingham and their lowly League position, and he will be eager to quell talk of discontent.</p>
              <p>Agger came off the bench for the last eight minutes of Sunday's 3-2 defeat at Manchester United. But he was unable to prevent the cross which led to Dimitar Berbatov's winner, after he replaced Paul Konchesky at left-back.</p>

              <p>I guess Torres didn't want to be called the male version of Britney Spears that's why he dye his hair black... lol. Cos I remember there was a chant about him looking like Britney... lol.</p>
              <p>Anyway, don't count Pool out totally cos the fixture have been rather bad for Roy. I recalled when the fixtures first came out, some people were already saying Pool's title challenge this season would be over in their first 5 games...  But give Roy some time to get them going... I think from now on, their opponents are all those they can beat without too much difficulties kind... They can still challenge for the 4th place.</p>

              <p>Every managers have his reasons for deploying certain tactics.</p>
              <p>There is no right or wrong in soccer as long as you get a victory.</p>
              <p>As for Agger, if he is unhappy, he should feedback to Ah Roy and not released his complaint to the press.</p>
              <p>The only thing that Ah Roy can do is to cold storage him.</p>
              <p>From sunday match, Ah Roy is still getting his men into the best formation.</p>
              <p>For me, I am just surprised that there is not much width in the play.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Daniel Agger backtracked yesterday and escaped the wrath of manager Roy Hodgson after claiming his televised observations about Liverpool's style of play had been taken out of context.</strong></p>
              <p>The Liverpool centre-back discussed an apparent change of style under Hodgson and was quoted as saying he would not resort to hitting long balls, even if it meant failing to regain his place in the side.</p>
              <p>'I am very disappointed with the papers in Denmark for the way they have done this story,' he said.</p>
              <p>'The problem was that the questions I was asked never appeared on television, only the answers. So the papers put their own questions in, and what came out was 100 per cent wrong.</p>
              <p>'An example was the quote about me not playing long balls. The TV journalist asked me what I needed to do to get back in the team and suggested I start hitting more long balls. I said I would not do that because I was not that type of player. That is where that quote came from. I actually think we play good football and that we showed it against Arsenal and Manchester United.'</p>
              <p>Agger will start against Northampton in tonight's Carling Cup tie at Anfield, as will keeper Brad Jones and defender Danny Wilson, who make their debuts.</p>

              <p>If Liverpool fans want to jump ship, they would have jump long time ago.</p>
              <p>Those who jump now do not deserved to be a Liverpool and can be fair weather fans for other clubs.</p>
              <p>It just show what true support for a football club is about.</p>

              <p>There are some who already jumped... just that day there was this guy who went on national tv on the Mio Passport programme and took part on the game show proudly wearing his Man City jersey... Half-way during the game, the host stop and asked his brother if he had been a long time City fan and the brother said smilingly, actually no... Then the host asked then which club he used to support? The brother said Liverpool...</p>
              <p>Of course there will be such things happening if Pool continue to decline... And just like City, if they continue to improve, will pick up more fans in the long run. Things like this happen... If you just think back 6, 7 yrs ago, how many Chelsea wearing jersey fans did you really came across? The fact is, from my own experience... Not many. But today, I see almost as many Chelsea jersey wearing fans as I do see Liverpool ones. So in a way, Chelsea has been successful. But to date, still only short term as I believed it will take more than 10yrs to build a really strong fan base.</p>
              <p>The only type of fans that is more likely to stay loyal to their first club are the ones that has been with them for some period of time and not those in their first 5 yrs... But then again, there are all types of people out there so... even a fans of 10 yrs could change sometimes... but probably in the minority...</p>
