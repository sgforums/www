The 25-year-old was suspended until the end of the season for an attack that left senior colleagues saying he should be sacked.<br><br>A week after Barton incurred the wrath of manager Stuart Pearce for criticising some of his signings, the England international clashed with Frenchman Dabo in front of a group of supporters who had been invited to City's Carrington training ground.<br><br>After the two midfield players cut each other down with alternate late tackles, Barton taunted Dabo by telling him: "You're s**t."<br><br>Dabo retaliated by telling Barton: "You are not as good as you think you are," and the players began to trade blows.<br><br>The Frenchman is believed to have thrown the first punch but Barton responded with a flurry of blows - "five or six", according to one witness - that floored Dabo and left him in a pool of blood.<br><br>Dabo was recovering at home last night and one senior City player said: "I have never seen anything like it. There was blood everywhere. Barton should be sacked."<br><br>City denied that Dabo had lost some teeth but the 30-year-old needed a scan before being allowed home with cuts and bruises to his face.<br><br>Barton said last night: "There was a training ground incident which unfortunately got to escalate pretty quickly as things can do at the training ground. I regret the way it got out of control and I will try to deal with it as soon as possible."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>found that this is a similiar topic to Rock^star's, so moderators can close if you want.<br><br>however, for me, I am puzzled at the anger inside Barton.<br><br>For those who played this game either professional or school wise, when you playing in your team training, do you go to such extreme?<br><br>For me, normally, we always keep a bit so that we trained but we don't injure.<br>Like tackling, we make it a point that we win it without injuring the player.<br>cause in the end, it is still one team.<br><br>I recalled Souness in his managerial days also crash with Yorke over tackling incidents. Is it just ego?? Is there a need?<br><br>Like Barton, he has an excellent guru in Pearce. Pearce was an unforgiving defender in his prime but you never hear such rubbish like attacking own players.<br><br>Perhaps the strain of EPL or just the Barton's Character?<br>Another good example is Lee Bowyer..<br><br></div>
