Today we have no one who can make it in a lesser european league.<br><br>And just the mention of goal 2010 makes me wonder what happened along the way? Goal 2010 was first mentioned i think in the early 90s is it, i am not too sure about when actually but seems very long ago liao... 2010 is suppose to be the year we are going for a WC spot?<br><br>Had we still been in the malaysian cup, younger fans would still be able to experience the Kallang roar rather than keep a huge empty stadium unused for all these years for nothing...<br><br>And no i am not the Zocoss at Asianhandicapp...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Stadium empty?? Got National day parade wat!!!I heard about the 2010 thing just a few years but only started to pay a little bit of attention after watching them play Japan twice on TV on both occasions they did pretty well.Money can indeed buy improvement and I hope FAS or whatever sport ministry would pump in more $$$ to achieve a better goal after all they also know how to make money mah.To reach the roof top of Asian soccer the team must keep on climbing,what is the point of climbing 2 steps just to slide back 3.SIngapore is the defending champion in Asean and they should keep winnning until they reach the next level.I am sure there is a winning system (not talking about TOTO).When I first took a glimpse of the new Lions I thought it was a team from amnesty international......hehehe.Taking in players from other countries is a great idea and probably the only way to keep this sport going.Singapore Players need exposure,like maybe joining in training stint with the J-league or Korean league because we know the Ang Mo Kau clubs in Europe dont want to waste time in baby sitting a lion cub.Tell you what if Singapore lose  this one.....we post a subject like HOW TO TEACH A LION HOW TO PLAY SOCCER?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is one match I would really like to be a part of.No TV,No Radio,No Satelite.Just have to rely on live commentary over here by Zocoss and the rest.FYI SIngapore has never beaten Thailand since the days of the legendary  Niwat Sesawasdi dating back to 1977.I think closest it got to winning was back in 1983 when Singapore had a very strong team but were still beaten by Piyapong Pue-on winning header in the sea games final held at kallang before a sell out crowd,it looks like same same again. tonight The only advantage again is the 55,000 intimiidating  lions fans something even the Thai coach is very much afraid of.Ive heard stories about football players from Thailand and Korea going through ranger style training regiment that also include airborne jumps in army camps just to built up their spirits before a major competition.That is just how serious some people are about winning.Tonight is purely people power.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.fas.org.sg/media/sgvsindoteamcelebrate2.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span class="large"><strong>Raddy: Come and get it, Thailand </strong></span></span><br><br>Singapore coach Radojko Avramovic has challenged Thailand to wrestle away the Asean Football Championship crown from the defending champions, ahead of the first leg of the Final at the National Stadium on Wednesday.<br><br>Having already downed traditional rivals Malaysia 5-4 on penalties in an epic second leg semi-final over the weekend, the Serbian issued a Â‘come and get itÂ’ cry to three-time champions Thailand, the most successful team in the history of the competition.<br><br>"We (Singapore) are still the defending champions," he said at the pre-match press conference on Tuesday. "Thailand will have to be at their best to beat us." "It will be a close game and it wonÂ’t be decided tomorrow. You have two equally strong teams and the team that plays better in both legs will win it."<br><br>Despite Thailand seemingly holding the proverbial Indian sign over the Lions as long as most people can remember, Avramovic feels history and statistics matter little in a big game like this. "This is now what I would call real football atmosphere. It is a shame that we donÂ’t get many big international games like this more often," said Avramovic.<br><br>"I donÂ’t care what happened in the past. Tomorrow is a brand new game, Thailand are playing with a new team and we are playing with a new team. So the result tomorrow will have nothing to do with what happened in the past. "The result tomorrow will depend on what happens on the pitch tomorrow."<br><br><span style="color: darkred;"><span class="large"><strong>Thavatchai: Happy with a draw</strong></span></span><br><br>Meanwhile, Thailand team manager Thavatchai Sajakul is keen to play down his side's chances in this upcoming first leg. "It is a worthy final," he said. "Of course both teams have a 50-50 chance of winning it and we hope we will be able to get a positive result tomorrow.<br><br>"Everytime I watch Singapore play (in the competition), I can see that they have improved from their previous game. It will not be easy for us." "Because of that, we would be happy with a point (draw)."<br><br>Modesty and gamesmanship aside, Thavatchai's approach ahead of the match probably stems from the fact that Thailand had to travel down from Bangkok after their goalless draw against Vietnam on Sunday, while the hosts for the first leg have had an extra day's rest.<br><br>Also, they will be missing the services of their talismanic captain and forward Kitisuk Senamuang. "We have four to five players who are still not fully fit. Even if they play tomorrow they will only be 60% to 70% fit. We will look at these players again tomorrow and then decide whether we can play them or not."<br><br>Midfielders Datasakorn Thonglao and Nirut Surasiang, as well as right sided defender Suree Sukha, are still carrying knocks suffered earlier in the competition, Thavatchai revealed. The man known as 'The Big Boy' also said that he did not think that playing in front of an expected full-house will necessarily affect his players too much.<br><br>"But I have watched Singapore games on television and I can say that your supporters really make it frightening for the opposition. You can almost feel the vibrations through the TV!" The second leg of the final will be played at BangkokÂ’s Suphachalasai Stadium on Sunday, February 4.<br><br></div>
