Malaysian official C.Ravichandran's decision to award a penalty to the hosts after striker Noh Alam Shah had gone down in the penalty area was a red rag to Thailand who stormed off the pitch.<br><br>After 15 minutes of head-shaking and arm-waving the Thais finally returned to the pitch to a wall of boos. Mustafic Fahrudin stepped up and fired high into the roof of the net as the home fans erupted and a small pocket of yellow-clad Thai supporters squirmed.<br><br><img src="http://aseanfootball.org/afc/images/THC02.JPG"><br><br>Moments later the referee blew up and the Thais ran straight to their bench, ignoring the celebrating Singaporeans. Thailand team manager Tawatchai Sajakul defended the protest. "We have all calmed down now, but there's something seriously wrong about the decision of the referee," Tawatchai told Reuters."We have a right to protest and we needed to get the message across that we have been unfairly treated.<br><br>"This is football. We now have to prepare ourselves mentally and physically for the second leg in Bangkok." Singapore coach Radojko Avramovic was left mystified by the unfolding drama."I don't understand what the Thai coach was doing, or what point he was trying to make," he said.<br><br>"I don't think that's right. This is sport; it should be played like sport. "There were many players in the area. They were pulling our players all the time. Their punishment came in the end," he told ESPN.<br><br><img src="http://aseanfootball.org/afc/images/SP01.jpg"><br><br>The controversial victory was the first time Singapore had managed to beat Thailand over 90 minutes at the National Stadium since 1977 but ultimately proved as noteworthy for scenes of Thai dissent and petulance as for any milestone result.<br><br>The incident is sure to add more spice to Sunday's second-leg. Singapore are the holders of the trophy -- formerly the Tiger Cup -- having won in 2004. They also lifted the title in 1998. Thailand are the only other winners of the tournament, champions in 1996, 2000 and 2002.<br><br>Thailand's late antics stole the show on what had been a thrilling, hard-fought contest. Alam Shah had opened the scoring on a balmy night with his 10th goal of the Asian regional tournament.<br><br>The hosting Lions had been tigerish in defence throughout the first period but a lapse in concentration five minutes after the break undid all their good work when striker Pipat Thonkanya sprung the defence and rounded Lionel Lewis in the Singapore goal before coolly slotting home to level.<br></div>

The Thais walked off the pitch in the 82nd minute, protesting the decision of Malaysian referee C.Ravichandran to award a penalty to the defending champions after Noh Alam Shah went down in the box under challenge from Niweat Siriwong.<br><br>They remained off the field for 15 minutes until team manager Thavatchai Sajakul intervened and convinced the team to continue playing. Chanvit showed up for the post-match press conference but remained for only 10 seconds, saying: 'Our comment today is that we have no comment. You can see everything that happened on the field, so we have no comment today.' Team manager Thavatchai later said that he would be lodging a protest with the Asean Football Federation, declaring that the incident had not been instigated by his own team.<br><br>Local organising committee chairman Mohammed Muzzammil said that the AFF will be investigating the matter before commenting further. 'We will wait for the match commissioner to submit his report,' he said. 'The AFF will then discuss the matter before determining if any further action should be taken.'<br><br>While the Thais were up in arms over Ravichandran's decision, Singapore coach Radojko Avramovic felt that his side deserved the victory on merit. 'A win is a win and I felt that we fully deserved our victory tonight,' said the Serbian.<br><br>A fiery atmosphere can be expected from the Thai fans in Bangkok on Sunday evening when Singapore will look to defend their lead in the second leg but Avramovic does not believe that the situation will get to his charges. 'I think for me, this is sport and there are 11 players on each side who will play the game. Whatever happens on the terrace is something for somebody else to control,' he said. 'Our players have already played a few games in those sorts of surrounding so I don't expect that it will be a big thing for them.'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Being unbeaten for 30 years its only normal that the Thais take everyone back in time to Football 70s style.In the past it was exactly like this legs would be flying around,players protesting over every decision,Referees getting assaulted and occasional free for all.I am disappointed with the Thais unsporting like manner ,this is really not like them at all. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ...now I think they have brought politics into last nightrs game.Being rob twice is very hard for every living Thais I suppose.<br>The referee decision is always final no matter how kayu it is.Sunday is going to be an explosive one.WIll the lion bite off the tail of the Elephant again or will the elephant trample on the lion until shit all come out  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> ?? I will put my money on Thailand to be 1 goal ahead after normal regulation time of 90-120 minutes <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
