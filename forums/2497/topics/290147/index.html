FIFA president Blatter's announced that he will lobby for restrictions on the overseas players in each side and Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has voiced his approval.</strong><br><br>But Wenger told Arsenal's club magazine: "I find the whole proposal completely ridiculous," he said. "The thinking behind it, I believe, is to protect the national teams. But it won't protect the best players, it will protect the mediocre ones and you don't win a World Cup with mediocre players, you win it with world-class ones."<br><br>He added: "The best English players - the Rooneys, the Owens, the Gerrards, the Lampards - they are all playing for their clubs anyway. "FIFA are wrong if they think this will improve international football. Look at rugby for example. The Argentina national team - all their players play in Europe, and the national team takes advantage of that. Had they all stayed in Argentina, would they have made the semi-finals? To mix the best with the best makes everyone better.<br><br>"I am worried that it could happen. I would say that it's more than 50% likely to be brought in. "FIFA is powerful enough to implement the rule internally, if (Sepp) Blatter has the support of the council and his committees. Will it go through or not, I do not know but it looks as though it could. I have already had many discussions at UEFA and it looks as though it could happen.<br><br>"I don't believe one football coach at the highest level would say it's a good idea. A football coach is always confronted with the same problem - he wants to reward good players." Asked what would happen if the rule was introduced, Wenger added: "First of all we have to fight against it. "If you fight it that should buy us some time. During that time you have to adapt to it."<br><br></div>
