Eto'o tries to leave the pitch during match last year</span><br><br><strong>SAMUEL ETO'O has called on players to walk off the pitch if they face racist abuse.</strong><br><br>The Barcelona striker, 26, is furious with UEFA's lack of action on racism.<br><br>And he believes he must make a stand for football's authorities to take notice of the problem.<br><br>Eto'o said: Â“Promises have been made for change - for sanctions to be enforced - but the first move needs to be made and it needs to be made by those who are being subjected to racism.<br><br>"Part of me hopes that one day someone will manage to walk off the pitch in protest.Â”<br><br>A recent England Under-21 clash was marred by Serbian supporters chanting racist taunts at defender Nedum Onuoha.<br><br>But Eto'o believes racism is not just an issue in football.<br><br>He thinks the general public have a role to play in clamping down on the problem.<br><br>Eto'o added: Â“If we experience this in football it means our society is rotten and that means we're in a dangerous situation.<br><br>"That's what we need to be fighting against. I think that football is a small thing, but society - just imagine!<br><br>Â“I am treated first and foremost as a footballer, as Samuel Eto'o, but away from the cameras a black man is suffering from racism and nobody cares.<br><br>"That's the problem."<br><br>EtoÂ’o tried to walk off the pitch when he received abuse in a match with Real Zaragoza in February last year.<br><br>He could be seen saying "no more" but he was convinced to stay on by other players and Barca boss Frank Rijkaard.<br><br>He added: Â“I think people tried to shoot me down as if I was making too much of it.<br><br>"But the whole time I was just expressing how I was feeling, something that no one at that time could have felt.<br><br>Â“I think that education is the problem. ItÂ’s just ignorance, that's what it is.Â”</div>
