              <p><em>Thaksin: impressed by Grant in difficult circumstances</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>AVRAM GRANT, sacked by Chelsea last night after less than nine months in charge, is in line for a quick return to Premier League management with Manchester City.</strong></p>
              <p>Grant, who said his farewells to the Chelsea players on Friday, was summoned to meet Roman Abramovich, the club’s owner, at his London home to be informed of his dismissal in person. The two men are long-standing friends, and Abramovich did not want the Israeli to be told by anybody else.</p>
              <p>However, he has now emerged as the favourite to succeed Sven-Göran Eriksson, who lost the confidence of City owner Thaksin Shinawatra in the second half of the season. Luiz Felipe Scolari, the Brazilian World Cup-winner who coaches Portugal, was first choice but is believed to have priced himself out of the job.</p>
              <p>Shinawatra, unlike Abramovich, was impressed by the fact that Grant’s Chelsea ran Manchester United close in the domestic championship and were within John Terry’s missed penalty of beating them in Moscow. He is further attracted by the dignity Grant has shown in difficult circumstances since taking over from Jose Mourinho last year. City are understood to have made offers for four players, for a total of £20m, since the end of the Premier League season, with Pini Zahavi, the Israeli “super agent”, acting on their behalf.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/Shincity.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>
              
              </p>
              <p>City’s appointment of Grant would have a certain irony, Eriksson having been courted by Chelsea before Mourinho got the job, and currently being linked with it again, although that is probably wishful thinking on his part. Zahavi is again involved here, recommending the former England coach to Abramovich. The favourite to replace Grant at Stamford Bridge remains Frank Rijkaard. Reports in Italy last night suggested Mourinho was about to replace Roberto Mancini at Internazionale, and make Frank Lampard his first signing for the Milan club.</p>
