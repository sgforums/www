              <p><strong>Gerard Houllier says he still has the backing of <span style="color: #000000;">Aston Vill</span><span style="color: #000000;">a</span> owner Randy Lerner as he blamed the mental weakness of under-performing senior players for the club’s slide down the Barclays Premier League.</strong></p>
              <p>Villa’s beleaguered boss insists the American billionaire remains firmly behind him after five defeats in six and a miserable showing at Manchester City four days ago left the visiting supporters in uproar.</p>
              <p>Another limp display at Stamford Bridge tomorrow — a ground where Villa shipped seven goals last season — will only heap further pressure on their boss who, ironically, is preparing to hold out an olive branch to some of those players he has alienated.</p>
              <p>Lerner and chief executive Paul Faulkner were shocked at the capitulation at Eastlands — which led to calls from fans for Houllier’s head — but it seems Villa’s top brass are unwilling as yet to show the Frenchman the door.</p>
              <p>Houllier is convinced that Lerner still backs his plans to turn around the club’s fortunes. However, it is feasible that by the time Villa kick off in west London they will be in the bottom three.</p>
              <p>‘We know we are going through a difficult period,’ said Houllier, ‘but any club is a unit. This includes the chairman, the staff and the medical people. Everyone is together. And the chairman trusts me. This trust extends to the players.</p>
              <p>‘In life, when you have adversity there is either fight or flight. We will fight. I knew there would be pressure and there is more pressure when you don’t win games. But I knew that anyway.</p>

              <p><strong>‘And when you don’t get results, the supporters will always look at you. Players win games and managers lose them. But I was watching Mark Hughes at Fulham. He said that one week ago, everyone was on at him. One away win changed things.’</strong></p>
              <p>Whispers are circulating that Lerner was considering asking former caretaker manager Kevin MacDonald to bridge the gap between the dressing room and the manager’s office to restore morale among the players.</p>
              <p>But were that to happen — even though the Scot was snubbed as Martin O’Neill’s successor at the club — it would leave Houllier in an almost untenable position. It would amount to an admission by the decision-makers that he cannot repair relations with several senior players.</p>
              <p>One of those — Richard Dunne — has been called into the squad for tomorrow’s trip.</p>
              <p>But there is still no sign of Stephen Ireland and John Carew is still three games from starting. ‘There will be a way back for them,’ added Villa’s boss.</p>
              <p>When asked to pinpoint why Villa have struggled when, 12 months ago, they were fighting for a Champions League place, Houllier suggested the senior players weren’t pulling their weight.</p>
              <p>He added: ‘The younger ones have done their job but they need a rest sometimes. I’m glad to see some of the experienced ones coming back. I think some of these have been very affected, mentally, by what’s been going on.’</p>

              Houllier will not sell star pair
              
              
              Gerard Houllier insists Aston Villa's star wing duo of Ashley Young and Stewart Downing will not be sold during the January transfer window.
              
              Young and Downing have been linked with moves to Manchester United and Tottenham respectively during the past week but Houllier will only offload players he feels are not part of his plans and has been given the green light to bring in new signings next month by chairman Randy Lerner.
              
              When asked if Downing and Young would be sold, Houllier said: "No. No way. Categorically no."
              
              He added: "The chairman reassured me (there will be money to spend) although I've got everyone coming back.
              
              "But I can tell you that at some stage, if we need some players in, we will take them."
              
              Houllier intimated that defender Richard Dunne and midfielder Stephen Ireland will soon be back in his plans as he looks for a positive reaction against Chelsea following the 4-0 mauling at Manchester City.
              
              Houllier said: "At some stage there will be (a way back for them), sooner rather than later.
              
              "They are out of the team only on footballing reasons. They weren't performing at times."
              
              ====================================================================
              
              Seriously, if Downing arrives at White hart lane, he will be a backup to Bale and Lennon, and he's too good and expensive to be a backup player.

              <p>I think this Houllier is what "King Kenny" would be if he takes over as manager of Liverpool... Both have been out of current football for a length of time, (King Kenny even much longer and also has a history of stress issues too). And given today with the Press and mess media coverage even more intense than during his time, the pressure could crack King Kenny like an egg against a rock if he does poorly again...</p>
              <p>I think Roy also felt he was ok but he soon discover the media coverage for Fulham and Pool is a big difference... one wrong word or action and it becomes headline news and it gets played over and over across the world... He didn't had this over at Fulham...</p>
              <p>Almost a mirror image... Both old men trying to recapture their past glories... And Pool fans could be put in a dilemma whether to boo him or still love him if he brings them further downwards... Just like if Cantona becomes United manager and does badly... lol.</p>
              <p>Anyway, Villa are silly to have got rid of O'Neill... Now they are paying the price.</p>
