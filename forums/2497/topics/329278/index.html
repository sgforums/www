              <h2>Real Madrid tried to prise David Villa away from Valencia on
              multiple occasions during the last day of the transfer window but
              finally saw a €55m bid rejected.</h2>
              <p>Los Merengues' grew desperate as the deadline approached and attempted
              to push through a deal by contacting Los Che throughout the day,
              according to the player's agent.<br><br>While Madrid president Ramón
              Calderón claimed last week that he was offered Villa, it was a very
              different story on Monday according to reports coming out of Mestalla.<br><br>"Real
              Madrid tried 50 times to sign him," Villa's representative, José Luis
              Tamargo, told Marca. "They must have tried at least that many times on
              Monday to sign him."<br><br>Bernd Schuster is reported to have insisted
              that the Spain international was the only player that he wanted before
              the transfer window closed and that saw Calderón spring into action.<br><br>Valencia
              chief, Vicente Soriano, had stated that no bid had been received before
              then, but the club's sporting director, Fernando Gómez,  revealed what
              had really taken place.<br><br>"There was a call Calderón to Soriano
              just after Villa renewed his contract, but there was no time to react
              and we were not going to let the player go," he confirmed.<br><br>Villa
              penned a contract extension that will keep him at Mestalla until 2014
              and that was viewed as a clear snub to Madrid in their quest top prise
              him away this summer.<br><br>After spending the summer chasing
              Cristiano Ronaldo, Los Merengues left it late to start bidding for
              other players and while Schuster became frustrated he has been unable
              to do anything.<br><br>Robinho was sold in the closing hours of the
              window to Manchester City for around €40m after stating that he was
              desperate to leave Madrid and that has now left the German coach at the
              Bernabéu short of options.</p>
