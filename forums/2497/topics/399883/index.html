              <p>Alberto Aquilani could be leaving Liverpool
               and heading to Juventus in an exchange deal involving Brazil 
              international Felipe Melo.</p>
              <p>Aquilani has struggled with 
              fitness since joining Liverpool from Roma in a £20 million deal last 
              summer.</p>

              during his debut season at Anfield </em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The midfielder has not convinced he can adapt to the needs of the
              Barclays Premier League and Juventus are keen to bring Aquilani back to
              Italy.</p>
              <p>Defensive midfielder Melo, who was heavily linked with Arsenal last  
              summer, has not had a happy season with
              Juventus since joining them from Fiorentina a year ago in a deal worth
              over £20m.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Despite making 25 appearances for the Old Lady, the 26-year-old was
              voted the worst player in Serie A last season by listeners of an
              Italian radio station and was rewarded with the Bidone d'Oro or Golden
              Bin - a prize whose 'winners' include Rivaldo and Adriano.</p>
              <p>Sources in Turin say the exchange deal would be in both clubs'
              interests with Aquilani happy to resume his career in Serie A after an
              unhappy debut season in England.</p>

              <p><br>Well I think it's because the big sum of fee from Pool's standard and the expection of being Alonso's replacement and being one of the club's record signing ($20m) along with Keane and Torres, people natural expected more from him. But his contribution was really very minimum...</p>
              <p>And by Nov / Dec , he already recovered and was fit to start the match against Fiorentina and played almost 70mins... Even his own father came out to say he was fit from then on but unsure why he isn't selected most of the time or given more playing time for the next few months...</p>
              <p>So basically, he was fit from Dec onwards but spent most of his time either sitting on the bench or not even on the sub list...</p>
              <p>Perhaps Rafa saw otherwise and thought he wasn't good enough for the tough premier league yet? Or he just don't get along with Rafa as well... lol.</p>
              <p>So if base on last season alone, it isn't wrong to say he is a big money flop... But he may have a good second year who knows... But that is if he stays.</p>

              <p><br>Precisely what I am saying... Cos of his price tag and his age, he should be starting matches and not be sitting on the bench most of the time from Dec to May...</p>
              <p>Can we also say if he didn't prove his capabilities, how to play much?</p>
              <p>He wasn't bought as a young player, he was seen as Alonso's immediate replacement when Rafa bought him... And the fact that he was drop or not selected by Rafa when he was fit from Dec to May... Gave the impression that he is one if base on last season alone...</p>
              <p>Like I said, he my have a better second season who knows...</p>
