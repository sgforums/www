But if all those players don’t show problems we don’t need other players in January."<br><br>And despite the team's current defensive woes, the Italian believes that Carvalho's move to Real Madrid was not a mistake.<br><br>"I think it was not a mistake because Carvalho wanted to go and we don’t want to keep players who are not happy to stay here," Ancelotti said. "I think we have three fantastic centre-halves, it’s difficult because we lose two and Jeffrey Bruma is young. But he played a good game against Zilina in midweek."<br><br>Ancelotti's charges have lost three of their last four Premier League games, but the former AC Milan boss believes that his side can bounce back to hit a rich vein of form - as they did after being defeated by Inter in the Champions League last season, going on to complete the domestic 'Double'.<br><br>He added: "You have to move on like we did last year - like we did after Inter. After that the team talked and they grew stronger. I think we can do the same again."</span><br><br></span></p>

              <div class="padding-top-5">
              <div class="small bold">FEELING BLUE ... Didier Drogba</div>
              <div class="small bold">
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">DIDIER DROGBA last night admitted he has never known it as bad as this in his six years at Chelsea.</h2>
              <p>The Ivory Coast striker says the Stamford Bridge outfit are starting to feel the pressure after a dismal return of just four points out of a possible 15.</p>
              <p>And the reigning Premier League champions now head into a hectic December schedule that includes three games on the trot against title rivals Tottenham, Manchester United and Arsenal.</p>
              <p>Drogba has told his Blues team-mates they must not keep using the absence of key players John Terry, Frank Lampard and Michael Essien as an excuse for dropping points.</p>
              <p>He believes the squad has to take responsibility and take some of the heat off under-fire boss Carlo Ancelotti.</p>
              <p>Drogba, 32, said: "It is maybe the worst run of form I've known since I came to the club. It is not good. "It is very frustrating - very frustrating. I know that during the season you can have moments like this and try your best to change it."</p>
              <p>Chelsea gave up top spot for the first time since early April when they left St James' Park on Sunday with a point after drawing 1-1 with Newcastle. And Drogba feels the pressure is starting to get to Italian chief Ancelotti and his players after a nightmare during November.</p>
              <p>The African hitman added: "It's a lot to say the manager is under pressure because of the results, yes. "But we are not winning and the teams behind us are coming back - and are even in front of us now.</p>
              <p>"Yes, there is pressure from those teams. "Losing top spot, it's not nice, obviously - to see that Manchester United are up front and Arsenal as well. But that's the challenge. We have to see it as a challenge more than being disappointed.</p>
              <p>"You know you have to see it as a challenge and do everything to come back."</p>
              <p>Double-winners Chelsea host Everton on Saturday and then, after playing Marseille in the Champions League a week tomorrow, start their daunting run of fixtures against Spurs, United and Arsenal.</p>
              <p>They will have Essien back from suspension, while Terry and Lampard are also due back in training this week. And Drogba said: "We are playing those teams around us in the next few weeks so this is a challenge that we have to do everything to win.</p>
              <p>"We are glad to get November out of the way - now let's see what December brings. "We can't use the players who are out as an excuse, even if they are key players.</p>
              <p>"When you sign for Chelsea, you know you have to give your best. You know you've signed for the best team so you have to improve your game, especially when players like Terry, Lampard and Essien are not there.</p>
              <p>"This is the moment when you have to show you are able to take responsibility because you know it won't be easy. "It's only going to happen from us. We can't expect people to come and say 'OK, we'll change it for you'.</p>
              <p>"We have to change it as players, with the manager, all of us together. We have to stay together as a team. "You might say this is the basic formula from players but we have to stay together and do everything to change this."</p>
              <p>As well as the points drying up for Chelsea, the usually- prolific Drogba is struggling for goals and has failed to score in his last six matches.</p>
              <p>Drogba, who does have seven goals including a hat-trick so far, added: "It is not happening in front of goal. I had some moments where I didn't even create chances and I was scoring.</p>
              <p>"But now I'm creating maybe more chances than usual but I'm a bit unlucky. "The most important thing is not that I am not scoring but that we are losing points."</p>

              <p>dumb ancelotti. talks about having 3 CBs as enough but never uses bruma because he is 'too young', instead used ivanovic or ferreria as CB. caused chelsea to lose.</p>
              <p>and worst is use ramires. chelsea also dont have enough good DMs. only essien is a good DM. mikel and ramires suck. im not even sure ramires is what position. he cant defend or attack, tackling and interception is below par, just sort of distribute the ball around the pitch, any half decent player can do this.</p>

              <p>Mikel is having one of his best season now, his distribution of ball is getting better, the only problems is that he might be a bit slow, and tend to switch the ball to his favourite right insole. Ramires is new to the BPL, he needs time to settle. However I think they need a creative player that can break down the defend.</p>
              <p>But the real problem right now is the uncertainty of the backroom staffs. Roman Abramovich should let the manager tohave full control of the team and his assistance.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>But for this season, fortuantely, he performed much better. More assured, breaking up opposition moves, becoming the 3rd defender on the pitch,  win poession.</p>
              <p>Honestly, I have trust in Mikel's long range passing, but the thing is that he seldom try it. He went for the easy option - passing to Lampard/Essien.</p>
