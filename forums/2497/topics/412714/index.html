              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">WES BROWN'S future at Manchester United is hanging by a thread after a 
              screaming row with Alex Ferguson.</h2>
              <p>Brown had the bust-up on the pre-season tour of America and has not started a 
              league game since.</p>
              <p>And he believes his Old Trafford stay is now in doubt.</p>
              <p>The argument was over a night out organised by United's players. Brown 
              is understood to have been told by boss Fergie he could not go - although it 
              is not clear why - leading to the row.</p>
              <p>The defender, 31 this Wednesday, stood his ground and Ferguson was described 
              as 'incandescent' as they traded verbal blows.</p>
              <p>Since then, Brown has had to make do with a start against Rangers in the 
              Champions League - when Rafael cried off late through illness.</p>
              <p>And he began the Carling Cup third-round tie with Scunthorpe.</p>
              <p>Brown, who joined United as a pro in 1996, did not get off the bench in the 
              Premier League win over Liverpool last month.</p>
              <p>He made the Euro trip to Valencia but was left out of the squad on the night.</p>
              <p>The former England star, who won 23 caps, has made 349 appearances for the Old 
              Trafford giants.</p>
              <p>He is one short of 200 Premier League starts but may not get the chance to 
              reach that milestone with his current club.</p>
              <p>Brown fears being sold in January - with Sunderland keeping an eye on 
              developments.</p>
              <p>The versatile defender, who has 1Â½ years left on his deal, was diplomatic when 
              asked last week whether he is frustrated on the sidelines.</p>
              <p>He said: "Yeah, a little bit. But I've always had to deal with that situation 
              throughout my career.</p>
              <p>"It's something I've learned to handle. We've got lots of good players in 
              defensive positions.</p>
              <p>"I have to keep training hard and, when I do get a chance, play well.</p>
              <p>"There's no point sulking and letting it get to you.</p>
              <p>"It might be difficult but you have to remember that everyone wants to play 
              every week. Unfortunately, that can't happen."<span><a style="color: #003399;" href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/3172337/Inside-Wes-Browns-screaming-row-with-Alex-Ferguson.html#ixzz11q2jhBln"></a></span></p>
