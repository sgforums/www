"I rotated the squad here because I felt I had a team capable of winning with Kolo Toure, Bacary Sagna, Emmanuel Eboue, Gilberto, Jens Lehmann and Philippe Senderos - they are all top Premier League players.

He said he was determined to leave the club, alleging promises made to him had been broken. "I signed for Arsenal because I was led to believe I was going to be playing," he said. This drew an angry response from Wenger, who suggested that he should simply knuckle down. "If he continues to fight, he will play," he said.<br><br>Newcastle United, Tottenham, Manchester City and Portsmouth have shown an interest in the 22-year-old while Lyon hover more in hope. "He is a player that interests us," said Bernard Lacombe, a special adviser to the Lyon club president, Jean-Michel Aulas. "As far as he [Diarra] is concerned, he does not seem to have a great desire to return to the French championship. If he leaves Arsenal, he will certainly stay in England."<br><br>Wenger is focused on beating Tottenham - his teams have not lost to them in 20 matches - and he welcomes back Robin van Persie to the squad. The Dutchman spent two months on the sidelines after injuring his knee in mid-October and, when he returned, suffered a muscular strain. As far as his opponents are concerned, Wenger's attention will also be on a striker in the Tottenham team, one he has known about for some time.<br><br>"Dimitar Berbatov is top class," said Wenger, who revealed that he considered signing the Bulgarian when he played at Bayer Leverkusen. "I noticed him once when he played against Real Madrid. He was a young boy at the time but we were never in need of him. He always has time on the pitch and when you play against him, he is always in the places you don't want him to be."<br></div>

And he said: Â“Eduardo has 11 goals in 14 starts and that is an exceptional record for any striker anywhere in the world. Â“He had an outstanding December and has carried that form over into the New Year. His improvement has been so great that every time he is in front of the keeper, I expect him to score.Â”<br><br>Eduardo, 24, will partner Nicklas Bendtner up front as Wenger sticks with his kids. But Emirates chief Wenger knows their arch-rivals will have a point to prove and Berbatov, 26, has the ability to trouble his young defence.<br><br>Wenger said: Â“He is always in places you donÂ’t want him to be. Â“Berbatov is a top-class striker because he can provide, he can score, and can be at the start of the move and the end of it. Â“I thought about a move for him when he was at Bayer Leverkusen but we had Thierry Henry, Robin van Persie and then Emmanuel Adebayor.Â”<br><br>Wenger added: Â“I will keep a young team in this competition and we have a good chance of reaching our third cup final in three years.Â”<br><br></div>

SunSport can exclusively reveal that when the Spurs coach parked up at the ground an angry Robinson confronted the Spaniard. We told you yesterday how Robbo was set to be part of a major White Hart Lane clearout by Ramos. And SpursÂ’ boss wasted no time in making his intentions clear by deciding to dump the fallen star for Radek Cerny.<br><br>Robinson was made one of the chief scapegoats for SpursÂ’ failure to beat Reading in the FA Cup on Saturday. A club source said: Â“Robinson was really annoyed when he found out heÂ’d been dropped. Â“He told Ramos what he thought about his decision but the manager did not seem bothered. Paul knows now he will be leaving.Â”<br><br>Ramos refused to confirm Robinson as his No 1 keeper after the game. He said: Â“I choose who is best and the most suitable for each match. Â“Only 11 players can play and there are 24 or 25 now in the squad. Â“Paul is a good goalkeeper, which he has demonstrated in his career so far. "But all players who are available are to be considered and I havenÂ’t decided yet who is going to play against Chelsea on Saturday.Â”<br><br>The second leg is set for White Hart Lane on January 22. Ramos added: Â“We were unfortunate.Â”<br><br>Gunners chief Arsene Wenger is facing a defensive crisis after Johann Djourou and Philippe Senderos were crocked. Wenger said: Â“We have a problem in central defence. I might have to play myself there!Â”<br><br></div>
