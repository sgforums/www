              <p>they are only back on track when the won the league cup.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So why are they back on track? because Fergie spend inorder

              <p>keep his manager position in Manu. There once the owner even
              said</p>
              <p>Fergie is not untouchable if you manu fans can remember.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For Wenger, he will be back for the glory.</p>

              <p>relax, this troll is no mU fan but just trying to stir up feelings.</p>
              <p>Even Wenger and SAF seems to have mend their bad blood.</p>
              <p>Yes, as MU fans, we certainly rem the dry period. Also, we acknowledge Gunner's reign and their "invincibles" days.</p>
              <p>Well, MU got on track after the thrashing by Pool, it woke MU up really fast.</p>
              <p>As for Gunners, they are certainly one of the best football side to see when they are in full flow.. but sadly, MU managed to control and strangle hold such that Gunners can't play their style. and here we see Gunners' failing, as they don't have plan B. MU effectively did the same thing in first leg, but Gunners did not manage to counter.</p>
              <p>looking @ the strikers they bring forth, Vela and the german guy, just not people that can alter the game.</p>
              <p>As a football fan, I wanted to see good football but sadly, the first 11 mins determine the game.. Too fast in my account..</p>

              <p>You really love shooting off your mouth don't you. Before you shoot your mouth off, you really should consider the things you say. Maybe you're just doing this intentionally because you're not really a Man U fan.</p>
              <p>Ferguson joined Man U in 1986 but didn't win his first league title till 1993 although he did win the FA Cup in 1989. Arsene Wenger won the double in the second season.</p>
              <p>In any case, you must be blind to not realise how strong as rivals Arsenal has been since Arsene Wenger has been. Even Alex Ferguson recognises Arsene Wenger's strength as a manager and acknowledges the strength of his team.</p>
              <p>Again I just wanted to point out, if you were looking to make Man U fans look bad you couldn't have done it better.</p>

              <p>to be fair to Gunners, they were using youngsters, no depth in their team..I think they managed to go this far is quite good.</p>
              <p>with their russian import,  and maybe a few more buys, they would be good next season.</p>

              <p>Arsenal got the youngster for the future. Yes we are in no league now compare to Manu. but the fact is, team got to bulit the understanding and need a good coach. When Fergie retire, Manu are done.</p>
