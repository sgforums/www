              <h1>S.League football: Mass brawl forces ref to abandon Young Lions vs Beijing Guoan match</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The score was 1-1 at the time.</strong></p>
              <p>Two Young Lions were sent to hospital as a result of the mass brawl. Gabriel Quak suffered an arm injury while Faritz had injuries to his head, according to <span style="color: #68220a;">todayonline.com</span>.</p>
              <p>The teams’ discipline deteriorated in the final 10 minutes of the game when the first fight broke out in the 84th minute. The game continued with the Young Lions equalising through Afiq Yunos in the 88th minute. However, a tackle on a Young Lions player in the middle of the field saw the game degenerate into a brawl involving both, including reserve players.</p>
              <p>According to the video, one Beijing player went in with a flying kick on Gabriel Quak. Young Lions team manager Eugene Loo stepped in to help but was in turn kicked in the back as well and fell over. A few follow-up kicks from Beijing players followed.</p>
              <p>A Beijing player was seen kicking Faritz who was on the ground while the Beijing goalkeeper Su Boyang was also spotted attempting to punch Khairul Nizam.</p>
              <p>Beijing Yu Tian Zhu’s (#4) was also caught on camera throwing a flailing punch at Young Lions substitute Fairoz Hasan (#5).</p>
              <p>Members of the public were also spotted jumping into the fight but a Football Association of Singapore spokesperson said that their preliminary investigations show that this was not the case.</p>
              <p>Even a medical personnel lost his cool and had to be held back. He was seen escorted away from the pitch while challenging the Beijing players to a fight.</p>
              <p>Before the fight, Beijing’s Meng Yang was seen making provocative gestures at the crowd while being substituted.</p>
              <p>In a statement released after the game, the FAS said: “FAS takes a serious view of this gross misconduct by the players. We are conducting an investigation into this matter and the perpetrator will be dealt with severely.”</p>
              <p>In another statement released today (Sept 8), FAS said: “We have given both the Young Lions and Beijing Guoan Talent until Tuesday 14 September, to file their respective reports on the incident that took place on Tuesday 7 September.</p>
              <p>The FAS Disciplinary Committee will then review the reports and videos before formally laying charges against the players involved in the incident. The disciplinary hearing is scheduled to take place in a fortnight’s time.”</p>
              <p>“We are very sorry for the incident. As players, we understand that we must maintain our discipline and professionalism at all times. We apologise to our fans, coaches and technical staff for the incident. We know that such behaviour was unacceptable and we are regretful of our actions,” said Young Lions captain, Hariss Harun.</p>
              <p>The Young Lions have been selected to take part in the Asian Games in Guangzhou come November while Beijing Guoan are a new team that took the final 12th spot in the league at the expense of the Korean Super Reds.</p>

              <p>Ok i watched it over a few times... The first problem i see 2, let's call them BJ players ok... falling down in the box and the team mates claiming a YL player elbow him... Notice there was a YL player just standing his ground and seems like he is stepping away... But then the BJ players just went at him (28 sec)... I guess he was the culprit in that incident or the no.19 tho cannot confirm. At the end of this incident, i guess the JB players might have felt injustice that no YL players was punished for the elbow tho cannot confirm got or not as didn't see any YL swing elbow in video... So bad blood started from then on and boiling point was near...</p>
              <p>Then that tackle... I thought it should have been a straight red since he came from behind and also very heavy but referee only seem to gave it a yellow. I think that BJ player did it on purpose and was ready to get sent off as it was already in the 89 mins so even get sent off, nvm, just get even first...</p>
              <p>I feel that the YL could do with a little more self-control... Cos i think if they have let the referee did his job and not run around seeking justice on their own, it could have been avoided... I am not sure how old are these BJ players... Maybe normal age but the YL should be under 23 i think... There was a moment right after the bad tackle, had 1 or 2 of the YL not charged at the BJ plyers, I think all hell won't break loose. From what i saw on the clip before all hell broke loose, the referee gave the wrong colour card and the YL were going to questioned him but the BJ players were trying to prevent them.</p>
              <p>This is a team sport and one problem can become a whole team's problem...</p>
              <p>Looking at the video and how the problem started, I won't just put the blame solely on the BJ side. Cos sadly, both sides were at fault... and the YL also lack self discipline... What happened after that, was a free for all... No one can blame who is right or wrong anymore from that point on...</p>
              <p>One thing I found rather strange is, I didn't see a single policeman on hand... lol.</p>

              <p><strong>Singaporean soccer club Young Lions on Thursday apologised for the "unacceptable" on-pitch brawl which caused their S.League match with Beijing Guoan to be abandoned earlier in the week.</strong></p>
              <p>"As players, we understand that we must maintain our discipline and professionalism at all times," said Hariss Harun, captain of the club which fields the national side's Under-23 team.</p>
              <p>"We apologise to our fans, coaches and technical staff for the incident. We know that such behaviour was unacceptable and we are regretful of our actions."</p>
              <p>Singapore's Football Association has launched a probe after the match at the City State's Jalan Besar Stadium on Tuesday was called off 10 minutes before the end with the score locked at 1-1.</p>
              <p>Young Lions players Gabriel Quak and Faritz Abdul Hameed were taken to hospital for checks after the fracas.</p>
              <p>The Singapore FA said on Thursday it had given both teams until Sept. 14 to file reports on the incident.</p>
              <p>Young Lions team manager Eugene Loo said his club was conducting its own investigation.</p>
              <p>"Such incidents are unacceptable and the players are very remorseful for their actions," he said.</p>
              <p>"We apologise for the incident and we maintain that the discipline of our players will always remain a top priority. An investigation is currently ongoing and we will cooperate with the Disciplinary Committee to ensure that appropriate action is taken."</p>
              <p>Young Lions lie seventh in the 12-team league, two spots above the Chinese side, with the season drawing to a close.</p>
