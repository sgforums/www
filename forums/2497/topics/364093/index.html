              *Carlos Tevez to sign for Manchester City after agreeing Â£140,000 a week deal*
              .
              .
              
              *Carlos Tevez is ready to stun Manchester United and sign for arch-rivals City. The Argentine international will switch loyalties at the end of this month when his two-year loan at Old Trafford expires.*
              
              Manager Sir Alex Ferguson contacted Tevez during last week to try to persuade him to stay with United. Old Trafford insiders fear that approach has failed. Fergie made the call on the eve of the announcement that United had agreed to sell Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid in a world record Â£80million deal.
              
              Tevez was in Quito, Ecuador, on international duty with Argentina. He intends to take a family holiday and then accept a Â£140,000-a-week deal with City that dwarfs the contract offered by United. It will be a bitter blow to United fans, who acclaimed the striker's hard-working style.
              
              Liverpool have also made a late move in the Tevez race. But their hopes of spreading a Â£25m deal over fouryears will not appeal to businessman Kia Joorabchian, who retains ownership of the player at the moment.
              
              Joorabchian has a solid working relationship with City manager Mark Hughes. And the City boss said: "I admire Tevez as a player and I like the way he approaches the game of football - that's been recognised by most managers."
              
              Hughes also insists his two Brazil internationals - Robinho and Elano - are staying at Eastlands. Robinho, signed from Real Madrid for a British record Â£32.5m, has hinted at a switch to Barcelona, while Elano has been linked with Inter Milan.
              
              Hughes said: "Robinho says he's happy and wants to stay here and Elano is contracted for another two years."

              *Carlos Tevez is fed up with Manchester United and will not return next season*
              .
              
              â€¢ Argentinian is upset by Ferguson's team selections
              â€¢ Manchester City offer 75% pay increase
              .
              .
              
              *Carlos Tevez has informed Sir Alex Â­Ferguson that he has no plans to return to Manchester United despite the club's renewed efforts to persuade him to reject Manchester City's overtures.*
              
              Ferguson has interrupted his holiday in the south of France several times over the past two weeks to ring Tevez and appeal to him to think carefully about the consequences of leaving a club of United's standing, but the Argentinian has now told the manager that he planned to sever his ties with the Â­Premier League champions.
              
              That is unlikely to prevent Ferguson trying to persuade him from changing his mind before the striker officially becomes a free agent on 30 June, but United's management are realistic about the situation and increasingly fear that Tevez will soon confirm he is following Cristiano Ronaldo out of the club.
              
              City have offered Tevez a 75% pay rise, meaning a Â£140,000-a-week salary, and the chance to re-establish himself as a first-choice player, whereas, tellingly, in all the various discussions with Ferguson there has been no indication from the managerTevez can expect to play in more of Â­United's key games this season.
              
              Tevez's main grievance is the frequency with which he was left out of United's bigger matches last season and he has come to feel disenchanted because of the way the club's chief executive, David Gill, has Â­handled his proposed signing, repeatedly postponing talks before publicly stating that he thought Tevez was over-priced. That has left the way clear for City to capitalise and, unless Ferguson can convince Tevez otherwise,the Abu Dhabi-owned club confidently expect to pull off one of their biggest transfer coups of modern times despite Liverpool also maintaining their own interest in Tevez.
              
              City have the advantage because they can afford to pay Tevez the higher salary and have informed the consortium that owns the player's economic rights they will pay the Â£25.5m fee in one sum whereas Liverpool's proposal is to drag it out with instalments over the course of his contract.
              
              Tevez is also aware that moving to Anfield would irreparably tarnish his standing among those United supporters who have been campaigning for him to stay at Old Trafford. The player is described as "tribal" and is aware of the intense rivalry between United and Liverpool but, in his mind, he does not believe it would cause so much bad feeling if he went to City.

But the striker was also impressed that the Blues boss had called him personally on Sunday night. As a result, Chelsea, not Manchester City, are favourites to steal his signature.*
              
              A source close to the Argie national team said: "Carlos was stunned to get the call from Ancelotti but also very pleased. "Ancelotti did a great job selling the move and Carlos was impressed." 
              
              Tevez was relaxing after last week's World Cup games. Ancelotti had got hold of his mobile phone number from the player's former national team-mate Hernan Crespo. 
              
              Ancelotti also asked Crespo to ring Tevez to help persuade him to move to West London. Former Blues ace Crespo did this and told him what Ancelotti could do for his career. 
              
              Chelsea must now come up with the Â£26million the player's agent and co-owner Kia Joorabchian wants for the 25-year-old. 
              
              The news will not please Manchester United as Tevez is contracted to them as part of their Â£6m two-year loan deal until the end of this month. 
              
              Yet they can hardly have any complaints after dragging their feet over offering the fans' favourite any kind of permanent deal.

              and co-owner Kia Joorabchian wants for the 25-year-old.</p>
              <p>The news will not please Manchester United as Tevez is
              contracted to them as part of their £6m two-year loan deal until
              the end of this month.</p>
              <p>Yet they can hardly have any complaints after dragging their
              feet over offering the fans’ favourite any kind of permanent
              deal.</p>

              The Sun always seem to get it right on Chelsea... Like they got spy at the club like that... The board not happy with Scolari, Lotti was their target... All they break the news first...
              
              So I belief this to be real too... Afterall, they have been chasing Villa and Maradona's son-in-law and looks like it will end in disappointment. So going fo Tevez doesn't look out of place...
