While the favourites will hope to vie for the group's top spot, the outsiders will be hoping to pull off a surprise and qualify for the next stage as the group's second best.<br><br>Saudi Arabia and Uzbekistan know each other well,having first met in the 2000 AFC Asian Cup, where the west Asians ran out 5-0 winners. However, Uzbekistan took their revenge with a memorable 1-0 quarter-final win in the 2004 AFC Asian Cup.

Uzbekistan are a good team but you have to admit that Lebanon and Singapore should be no match for us. We are one of the best sides in the continent and we should not worry about reaching the second round of the qualifiers.

In my view, other than Uzbekistan, there's no one in Asia that I think this current Singapore team should fear. In my mind, Uzbekistan are a really good team and will be dangerous against anyone.
