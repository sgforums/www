Â“Saudi Arabia and Uzbekistan may be the favourites in our group but if football was only about the favourites, the game would not be as interesting as it is.Â”<br><br>Saudi Arabia, who suffered a 1-0 defeat by Iraq in JulyÂ’s AFC Asian Cup final, have qualified for the last four World Cup finals, reaching the second round in 1994.<br><br>Uzbekistan have also never reached a World Cup finals, but have reached the quarter-finals of the last two AFC Asian CupÂ’s, while Lebanon have also failed to advance past the World Cup qualifying stage.<br><br>FIFA have already set the dates for the third stage qualification matches for February 6, March 26, June 7, June 14, September 6 and September 10.<br><br>Lebanon coach Emile Rustom admitted his side face a tough task of battling their way out of Group D, but is hoping to use several upcoming international friendlies to prepare his side and put them in the best possible position to challenge in their six games.<br><br>Â“Our group is not bad. We expected that we would be playing against one of the top teams like Saudi Arabia or Japan for example,Â” said Rustom.<br><br>Â“We will try our best to prepare for the qualifiers, but the situation in Lebanon is not good at the moment and the players have a lot pressure.<br><br>Â“In general, I hope that we can pull off some good results and we will prepare by playing several friendlies before February."<br><br><a href="http://www.afcasiancup.com/en/news/index.asp?aid=51600&amp;cid=1377&amp;sec=105&amp;ssec=246&amp;amth=11&amp;ayr=2007" rel="nofollow">http://www.afcasiancup.com/en/news/index.asp?aid=51600&amp;cid=1377&amp;sec=105&amp;ssec=246&amp;amth=11&amp;ayr=2007</a></div>

He is a striker who challenges for the high balls and it is up to the other forwards like me to pick up the second ball.<br><br>'His physical presence give us possibilities. It will be a big loss if he is suspended, but we have to get on with life.<br><br>'Our success is all down to good team work.''<br><br>Goalkeeper Lionel Lewis added: 'If Alam Shah is suspended, we will miss his strong presence and never-say-die attitude.''<br><br>A first-team regular, Alam Shah has been in red-hot form for Singapore this year.<br><br>He top scored with 10 goals when the Lions won the Asean Football Championship in February.<br><br>The haul included a national record of seven goals in the 11-0 slaughter of Laos.<br><br>'Alam Shah has been prolific for the Lions,'' noted former national midfielder Goh Tat Chuan.<br><br>'He proved in the Asean Football Championship that he is the best striker in the region.''<br><br>According to Goh, who played alongside the striker in the 2005 Tiger Cup win, Alam Shah's strength lies in his big heart.<br><br>The retired midfielder said: 'Alam Shah's self-belief and positive attitude rub off on the rest of the team.<br><br>'He hates losing. He defends from the front. When you see a striker fighting so hard, the midfielders and defenders are inspired to push up and squeeze the opponents.<br><br>'He is an exceptional player to have when the chips are down.''<br><br>Singapore have done well to ease past Palestine and Tajikistan in the first two rounds of the World Cup qualifiers.<br><br>But Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Lebanon will be tough opponents in the third-round group stage.<br><br>This is where, according to Goh, Alam Shah's influence will be crucial.<br><br>'The group stage will be very tough, with games against Saudi Arabia and Uzbekistan,' said Goh.<br><br>'They are physical sides. The Saudis and Uzbeks will not relish facing someone like Alam Shah, who is a real menace for defenders.''<br><br>Since scaling the Asean summit 10 months ago, Avramovic has tweaked his game plan to an attacking 4-2-4 system for the World Cup qualifiers.<br><br>And the new central striking partnership of Aleksandar Duric and Alam Shah has worked a treat, with the duo netting three goals in the two games they played together.<br><br>It was the Tampines man who blasted home the crucial away goal from 20 metres against Tajikistan to give Singapore an aggregate 3-1 win.<br><br>That was his 28th international goal in 63 matches, a strike rate that has made him the country's current leading scorer.<br><br>But Indra feels that Avramovic will change his adventurous strategy, with or without Alam Shah.<br><br>'Raddy is unlikely to place all his emphasis on attack for the big games,'' the skipper said.<br><br>'It's not the wise thing to do against stronger opponents like Saudi Arabia and Uzbekistan.<br><br>'But we still have Duric, who has done well so far.''<br><br>Others, like reader Daniel Izzat, have made an impassioned plea for Alam Shah to be kept in the fold.<br><br>He said: 'Alam Shah carries the dreams of the whole of Singapore.<br><br>'He has been crucial in all our international matches.'<br><br>But Terence Goh, an avid Lions fan, disagreed: 'Key player or not, Alam Shah should not have acted in such a way.<br><br>'He's not fit to be in the team. We cannot simply close one eye and forget about his violent act. Furthermore, this is not the first time he has exploded.<br><br>'Such hot-tempered characters have no place in the national team.''<br><br>meng@sph.com.sg<br><br>'If Alam Shah is suspended, we will definitely miss his strong presence and never-say-die attitude.'<br>- NATIONAL GOALKEEPER LIONEL LEWIS<br><br>'He hates losing.
