              <h3>LIVERPOOL boss Brendan Rodgers is desperate to land Arsenal winger Theo Walcott.</h3>

              <div id="bodyText">
              <p>And he is ready to finance a £15million bid by selling Kop flop Andy Carroll.</p>
              <p>Walcott has one year left to run on his contract and has yet to agree a new deal at the Emirates.</p>
              <p>He earns £65,000 a week and is looking to be brought into line with other England internationals in the Premier League on £100,000 a week.</p>
              <p>Chelsea boss Roberto Di Matteo is ready to make an official bid for Walcott, 23, while former Blues chief Carlo Ancelotti is keen to take the player to Paris St Germain.</p>
              <p>But Rodgers, looking to bring in new faces on Merseyside, believes Walcott could become a major star at Anfield.</p>
              <p>Last night, Liverpool knocked back Newcastle’s offer to take former Toon ace Carroll back on loan.</p>
              <p>It is thought Kop bosses want a permanent deal to raise money for new signings.</p>
              <p>Newcastle owner Mike Ashley is likely to come back with a new offer to take Carroll on a cut-price permanent deal — just 18 months after selling the 6ft 3in striker for £35m.</p>
              <p>Gunners boss Arsene Wenger is desperate to keep Walcott — especially with Robin van Persie refusing to sign a new deal — but some members of Emirates board would be prepared to cash in now.</p>
              <p>Walcott was one of England’s better performers at Euro 2012 and he was man of the match against Sweden.</p>

              <p><strong>The Fenway Sports Group's site audaciously posted a headline that read 'Fabio Borini, <span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span> gear up for North American Tour as Clint Dempsey joins club' and further went on to say Liverpool had "added Fabio Borini and Clint Dempsey to a team that came within a game of winning the FA cup". </strong></p>

              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>The accompanying video, however, although captioned with 'report: Clint Dempsey signs with Liverpool FC', acknowledged that stories in England were merely speculation.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>The seemingly false content was later removed and a <span style="color: #000000;">Fulham</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span>spokesman said that, not only were such claims 'totally untrue', but that the club had 'not (even) received any bids' for the player.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>"We have received no offers from any club for Clint Dempsey," the spokesman said. "We would discourage any club from making a bid for him."</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>Brendan Rodgers is in need of a midfielder who can link up well with attack and score goals and, after missing out on Gylfi Sigurdsson, who surprised his former manager by linking up with Tottenham Hotspur, Dempsey is seen as an ideal candidate.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>Despite today's embarassment, the FSG website's blunder will only fuel speculation further amid reports that a £10 million fee has been agreed between the clubs.</p>
              <p>Liverpool want to sign Dempsey quickly so he can join up with their tour of his homeland, where he is swiftly overtaking Landon Donovan as the nation's most famed and marketable footballer.</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool's principal owner John W Henry says he is prepared to consider selling the naming rights to Anfield to raise funds.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Henry also called upon the Premier League to implement Financial Fair Play properly - accusing some of the Reds' rivals of ignoring UEFA regulations designed to try to make clubs balance the books.</p>
              <p>The American revealed he and his Fenway Sports Group are looking to the overseas market to boost Liverpool's income and that a rebranding of Liverpool's historic home could be on the cards.</p>
              <p>"This club should be able to significantly increase its revenues but it won't be easy," he told the <em>Tomkins Times</em>. "But I don't see it happening at the local level - the vast majority must come from our global agenda.</p>
              <p>"A naming rights deal at Anfield could occur if the partner were right. We haven't [yet] pursued it."</p>
              <p>Henry said Liverpool are looking to be self-sufficient and criticised clubs who overspend. Manchester City posted losses of £197 million for the 2010-11 financial year while Chelsea have already paid more than £60 million to recruit new players this summer.</p>
              <p>UEFA has the power to bar clubs who declare losses of more than €45 million over a three-year period from European competition, but Henry doubts that will happen and called upon the Premier League to act.</p>
              <p>"The mandate of Financial Fair Play in Europe is for clubs to live within their means," Henry said. "Recently I was told that half of the clubs in the top divisions within Europe are losing money and 20% are in straits of varying degrees.</p>
              <p>"We believe the league itself may have to adopt its own rules given that clubs seem to be ignoring UEFA's rules, which may be porous enough to enable clubs to say that the trend of huge losses is positive and therefore be exempt from any meaningful sanctions."</p>
              <p>Liverpool have been criticised for paying excessive transfer fees for players since FSG's 2010 takeover, with almost £130 million having been spent, but Henry said: "It's up to LFC to invest properly in players going forward so that the club can not only be sustainable but a powerhouse."</p>
              <p>Liverpool were Carling Cup winners and FA Cup finalists last season but Kenny Dalglish was sacked after they finished eighth in the league, with Henry outlining that a 19th title is the long-term aim at Anfield.</p>
              <p>"Our goal is to win the Premier League. It's not going to happen this year, but that is what we are building for - first and foremost. That's only going to happen if our league performance turns around substantially."</p>
