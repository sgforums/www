              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">LIVERPOOL plunged headlong into another race storm last night when Oldham kid Tom Adeyemi was left in tears after allegations of vile abuse.</h2>
              <p>The full-back, 20, had to be consoled by team-mates and Liverpool players 10 minutes from the end of this FA Cup third-round tie after a comment shouted from the Kop.</p>
              <p>Adeyemi was walking back into position after a tackle when a supporter wearing a Luis Suarez T-shirt is alleged to have shouted disgusting racist insults.</p>
              <p>An eye witness, who later gave evidence to club officials and the police, claimed he heard a single voice shout: "You f****** black b******."</p>
              <p>Adeyemi, on loan from Norwich, also gave a statement to police before heading straight on to the team bus. It is understood he also claimed he had been called a "black c***."</p>
              <p>Other witnesses insist he was also subject to shouts of "Manc b******".</p>
              <p>That stems from the fact fans are incensed at the handling of the Suarez race row with Manchester United's Patrice Evra, when the Uruguayan received an eight-game ban for calling the Frenchman a 'negro.'</p>
              <p>Merseyside Police said: "We can confirm no one has been arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated behaviour.</p>
              <p>"However, the Force and Liverpool FC are investigating following an incident that occurred during the second half.</p>
              <p>"The aim of the investigation is to establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident to ascertain if any action needs to be taken."</p>
              <p>Oldham boss Paul Dickov said: "I have not spoken to Tom about it.</p>
              <p>"But I will say I know the kid and something has been said. He is a placid boy who has been well educated and has a fantastic temperament.</p>
              <p>"So for him to react like that it's obvious that something has been said."</p>

              <p><br>last time people eat shit doesn't mean nowadays it's ok to eat shit. it's not right to use something that's originally wrong and claim it was ok to do so in the past means it's ok to do so now. For example, last time cocaine was legal but now it's not legal, I don't think the logic will work if I use it to explain to the police why i have cocaine now.</p>

              <p><br>This is a very good tactic... if he just ignore the racists stuff, then that particular fan got away scott free (then it'll be brushed off as non-incident or a minor incident)... by doing what he did, look at the impact of the media and the loss of reputation it caused to Liverpool... they are now almost officially a racist club. Being a united fan, I used to like Liverpool for their tradition but now that they are so racist, I think they have made others lost total respect for them.</p>

              <p><strong>The head of European football's anti-racism group believes <span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span><span style="color: #000000;">'s</span> reaction to the <span style="color: #000000;">Luis Suárez</span> affair has whipped up "a tribal fervour" at Anfield.</strong></p>
              <p>Piara Powar, the executive director of European football's anti-discrimination body, Fare, said some supporters are reacting in a worrying manner after Liverpool mounted a sustained defence of their Uruguayan striker. Last month, Suárez was found guilty by a Football Association-appointed independent regulatory commission of racially abusing the Manchester United defender Patrice Evra. He is now serving an eight-match ban.</p>
              <p>Powar has criticised Liverpool for their response to the Suárez affair, and earlier this week he urged the FA to charge Liverpool and their manager, Kenny Dalglish, with bringing the game into disrepute.</p>
              <p>On Sunday, Powar told the Sportsweek programme on BBC Radio Five Live: "If you look at the comments Dalglish has been making, if you look at how Liverpool resort to defend what they see as an injustice, look at the way their fans have been whipped up into a tribal fervour.</p>
              <p>"Some of the words being used to describe the FA processes, some of the way to describe the FA and its role in governance on these sort of issues, that is really beyond the pale."</p>
              <p>Powar said Liverpool were not setting an appropriate example to their supporters: "The environment at Anfield is so driven – in terms of the paranoia that some fans feel – [by] expressions of injustice from Liverpool, especially over the last few weeks.</p>
              <p>"There is a wider issue here of the way Liverpool have dealt with this and it has disconcerted many observers. It is a constant undermining of the FA's role as the governing body in football."</p>
              <p>Police have investigated allegations that the Oldham Athletic defender Tom Adeyemi was racially abused during Friday's FA Cup match at Anfield. A 20-year-old man from Aintree was yesterday arrested on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence, following the alleged incident.</p>
              <p>Liverpool, who beat Oldham 5-1, said on Saturday that they were also investigating the incident involving Adeyemi. The club issued a statement which said that they were continuing to work closely with the police to establish the facts surrounding the incident. Liverpool also said that they had supplied evidence to police, including CCTV footage and still photography and statements from stewards.</p>
              <p>Powar is also concerned by the levels of abuse aimed at footballers on social networking websites. Powar said he did not think the problem of racism was getting worse but he also said the problem was generated partly by "the way in which fans feel they can get on something like Twitter and make comments without accountability.</p>
              <p>"There is nobody touching them on their shoulder looking at their comments and saying, 'No, that is not what is acceptable.' I don't think the situation has been worse than it's been for a long time but we are dealing with difficult issues here between players and the way in which the clubs have responded."</p>

              <p><br> This is a very good tactic... if he just ignore the racists stuff,
              then that particular fan got away scott free (then it'll be brushed
              off as non-incident or a minor incident)... by doing what he did,
              look at the impact of the media and the loss of reputation it
              caused to Liverpool... they are now almost officially a racist
              club. Being a united fan, I used to like Liverpool for their
              tradition but now that they are so racist, I think they have made
              others lost total respect for them.</p>

              <p>I think this statement is a bit too much. </p>
              <p>As much as the rivarly between the two teams, I don't think Liverpool is a racist club, given they have many fanastic black players like Barnes, and etc.</p>
              <p>It is just the misguided fans who are acting irresponsibly. However, the suarez t shirt is a poor touch, in my books.</p>
