              <p><strong>Joe Hart re-ignited the Carlos Tevez controversy by warning that the Argentina striker is capable of winning Wednesday's explosive Manchester derby on his own.</strong></p>
              <p>Tevez has become a symbol of the increasingly bitter rivalry between United and City since swapping Old Trafford for Eastlands last year, and England goalkeeper Hart hailed his captain's super-human powers, saying: 'Carlos can carry a team and he can carry 10 men.</p>
              <p>'If we're stinking and Carlos plays well, there’s a good chance we'd win.</p>
              <p>'He's a phenomenal player. I’d say the best I've played with. He just leads by example in all the right ways. You would look to him, not to give you a pep talk but to win you a game.'</p>
              <p>United have won five of the six derbies since the Abu Dhabi takeover transformed City's fortunes but Tevez insists he has no regrets over his decision to switch clubs after scoring 28 goals in his last 33 Premier League games.</p>
              <p>'I made the change and so far I'm not sorry,' said Tevez, who also scored three times in a dramatic two-legged Carling Cup semi-final against United last season that saw him become embroiled in a bust-up with Gary Neville.</p>

              <p><strong>'As players we have to make decisions that are right for us. But I also realise many people may not have understood my decision. All I can do is concentrate on my game and at the moment it's going well for me.</strong></p>
              <p>'But at City we're not obsessed with United. Our challenge is just to improve on what we did last year and perhaps by doing that we can overtake our neighbours. That's the road we are on. I think the title race is still wide open.'</p>
              <p>Tevez will be without strike partner Mario Balotelli on Wednesday night after City's decision not to appeal against his red card at West Brom on Sunday means the Italian is suspended.</p>
              <p>United won three of four derby clashes last season with injury-time goals, and Hart - who was on loan to Birmingham at the time - admits City are desperate to settle the score.</p>

              <p><strong>He said: 'It was heartbreaking to watch so I don't know what it was like to play in. I was gutted for the lads because all four games could have gone to anyone.</strong></p>
              <p>'We do owe them one. But even if we'd one the previous four games 7-0, we'd still feel we owe them one. That's just how it is and how it always will be.</p>
              <p>'People sometimes say, "oh United scored late again", but it's not easy to keep doing that. People write off Michael Owen but give him a chance and he’ll score. Wayne Rooney's scored some of them and there are world-class players who can do those things.</p>
              <p>'But look through our squad and there’s not one or two, there’s five or six people who could pop up. We’ve got those players who can do those sorts of things. Man United are aware of that, we’re aware of that, and that’s what makes it such an exciting game.'</p>
              <p>Hart was speaking at an event which was part of the City academy's Multiskills Lifestyle programme which helps young players become better role models.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old keeper was in the headlines for the wrong reasons on two occasions last month when he was pictured singing and dancing on a bar in Marbella 36 hours before meeting up with England's squad for a game against Montenegro and then earned another reprimand from City boss Roberto Mancini for joining team-mates Gareth Barry, Adam Johnson and Shay Given on a boozy trip to Scotland.</p>
              <p>Hart stopped short of apologising for his actions but admitted that he may have been naiive.</p>
              <p>'I don’t think you have to live like a monk,' he added. 'I just think you have to be a bit smart about how you do it. Maybe at my age and not realising the position you are in, naivety comes into it a little bit, but you have got learn fast as a footballer. People are out to get us and there are places you should be and places you shouldn’t.</p>
              <p>'The manager just told us to be a bit more careful with our private lives. I would never disrespect football because it is my livelihood. But I’ve always felt that I’m totally 100 per cent ready for every training session and every single game.'</p>
