            <div class='col-md body'><strong>CASHLEY, Cashley, whatÂ’s the score, Cashley, whatÂ’s the score?Â” Came from the 3,000 Arsenal throats. </strong><br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42336000/jpg/_42336913_ab3.jpg"><br><br>There were just six minutes left and Ashley Cole was facing the most embarrassing afternoon of his life. Arsenal punters, wound up by the Chelsea MC announcing Cole as the Â“greatest left-back in the worldÂ” as he introduced the teams, were beside themselves.<br><br>The England full-back had endured a torrid time, greeted by a wad of fake Â£20 notes swirling from the Arsenal end, booked after 23 minutes for a late challenge on Alex Hleb and booed every time he touched the ball.<br><br>He was also subjected to a continuous chorus of Â“One Greedy BastardÂ” and a novel GoonersÂ’ version of Â“Ten Men Went To MowÂ”. One can only imagine what it will be like when Cole visits the Emirates on May 5.<br><br>Cole had infuriated Arsenal fans Â— and supporters everywhere Â— when he wrote in his autobiography of how he almost crashed his car in disbelief when he heard his former club were only offering him a new deal of Â£55,000-a-week.<br><br>But they certainly couldnÂ’t forgive him another parting shot Â— when Cole tagged some of the younger players big shots, Â“celebritiesÂ” long before their time but with no trophies to show for it.<br><br>Two of the players he picked out were Philippe Senderos and Cesc Fabregas.<br><br>IÂ’ll give him Senderos. But Fabregas? Come on, Ashley. Here is one of the finest Â— if not THE finest Â— young talent in England. He never gave up, neither in his attempts to play football nor to hold back what for long spells was a blue tide. Nor could Cole have had anything but admiration for the performances of the other young kids on the block. Boys he left in the lurch when he defected to Stamford Bridge.<br><br>Remember, this was an Arsenal side that went into the game minus FOUR first-teamers Â— Thierry Henry, Kolo Toure, William Gallas, Tomas Rosicky. And further stripped of long-term casualties Lauren and Abou Diaby. Yet the two Emmanuels Â— Adebayor and Eboue Â— Gael Clichy and Johan Djourou were outstanding.<br><br>Considering the handicap he faced of having to play alongside Senderos, young DjourouÂ’s performance was near miraculous. Incredibly, AdebayorÂ’s display was even better. Leading the line on his own, he gritted his teeth, gave it 100 per cent from start to finish and never complained once.<br><br></div>

He can say what he likes. But being a big club is about more than just winning a league title or two."<br><br>On the day Manchester United's official Opus was launched, Charlton claimed one of the most famous chapters in the Red Devils illustrious history might be about to be written.<br><br>The unique 850-page, 37kg Opus chronicles United's past, right from their earliest days as Newton Heath until the present day.<br><br>Yet, as Charlton acknowledged, the Opus could be missing a major story by next May if United can suppress the threat of Chelsea to claim their 16th league championship.<br><br>After a weekend of drama at Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge, Sir Alex Ferguson's men now stand eight points clear of the back-to-back title winners.<br><br>And, even though Chelsea still have a game in hand, for the first time since Jose Mourinho arrived in England, United are favourites to finish the campaign as top dogs.<br><br>"I wouldn't say winning the title this season would be the greatest achievement in Manchester United history but it would be the most pleasant," he said.<br><br>"When you come up against someone like Chelsea, who appear to have the finance to be able to buy anyone who is available, it is going to be difficult to finish above them.<br><br>"I wouldn't say we were an underdog but they just seem to collect players. We don't have the type of unlimited finance to be able to match that and we cannot put an excessive burden on our supporters in terms of ticket prices, so to win the league this season would rate very highly indeed.<br><br>"I really do believe there is a strong feeling for us to do it this season and part of that is because of the way we play and the exciting players we have in our team."<br></div>
