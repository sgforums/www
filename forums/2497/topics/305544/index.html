              <p>Tottenham are set to take their transfer spending this month to more than £20million after Alan Hutton arrived in London last night to secure his switch to White Hart Lane from Rangers.</p>
              <p>Spurs put the finishing touches on defender Jonathan Woodgate's £7.5m move from Middlesbrough yesterday, while Hertha Berlin left-back Gilberto has arrived ready to complete his £2m move from Germany.</p>
              <p>Head coach Juande Ramos, who completed a £3m deal for Cardiff right-back Chris Gunther earlier this month, has vowed to improve the defence.</p>
              <p>Hutton — who will cost £8m — had been unwilling to leave Ibrox for family reasons, but the right-back was finally persuaded after Rangers agreed to pay-off his contract and give him £1m as part of the deal.</p>
              <p>Hutton flew back to Glasgow this morning and may play in the CIS Cup semi-final against Hearts On Wednesday - but a Thursday deadline deal looks likely.</p>
              <p>It means that Tottenham — who were knocked out of the FA Cup in a 3-1 defeat at Manchester United yesterday — have spent around £67m on players in the last eight months.</p>
              <p>It is an impressive statement of intent from Ramos, who has already got the club to the Carling Cup Final despite his perception that there are still many weaknesses in the squad he inherited from Martin Jol.</p>
              <p>The arrival of Woodgate is also a major coup having beaten off former club Newcastle for his signature. Middlesbrough only agreed to sell the 28-year-old for £500,000 less than Kevin Keegan offered after Tottenham decided to pay a higher fee up front.</p>
              <p>Middlesbrough had been insisting over the weekend that Spurs match Newcastle's bid of £8m, but they eventually agreed to take £6m straight away with the possibility of earning another £1.5m with various add-ons.</p>

              <p><em>Woody's not your saviour</em></p>
              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>JONATHAN WOODGATE’S arrival in North London is unlikely to provide a quick fix 
              for Tottenham’s defensive woes.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">The Middlesbrough defender has opted for a £7.25million move to White Hart 
              Lane and will sign a 3½-year deal today.</p>
              <p class="article">Yet the 28-year-old has endured an injury-hit second season at the Riverside 
              and has not played since New Year’s Day.</p>
              <p class="article">So it seems unthinkable he would be pressed straight into action at Goodison 
              Park by his new boss Juande Ramos on Wednesday.</p>
              <p class="article">And it would be risky to hand him his debut in their rematch with Manchester 
              United at White Hart Lane on Saturday.</p>
              <p class="article">Spurs could certainly do with him.</p>
              <p class="article">Michael Dawson’s red card for handball yesterday means he will be missing, 
              while Ledley King was given the weekend off.</p>
              <p class="article">His troublesome knee is not up to two games in a week yet.</p>
              <p class="article">It was left to midfielder Tom Huddlestone to fill in at the back at Old 
              Trafford but it is not an ideal solution.</p>
              <p class="article">Ramos refused to comment on the impending arrival of Woodgate following their 
              FA Cup defeat but his price tag represents a gamble.</p>
              <p class="article">Woodgate enjoyed an impressive and relatively injury-free first season with 
              his hometown club after joining on loan from Real Madrid in summer 2006.</p>
              <p class="article">But things have not gone so well since a permanent move to Boro in the summer 
              and he has even been jeered by his own fans.</p>
              <p class="article">In recent weeks, he has been sidelined by injury.</p>
              <p class="article">In fact Woodgate has made only 187 league appearances in a decade with Leeds, 
              Newcastle, Real Madrid and Boro.</p>
              <p class="article">If he can recapture the form of last season, Woodgate will be a valuable 
              player for Spurs.</p>
              <p class="article">However, he is unlikely to provide an instant remedy.</p>

              <p><em>Gunners join Woodgate chase</em></p>
              <p><strong>Arsenal have joined the race to sign Boro's Woodgate, according to reports.</strong></p>
              <p>Boro chief executive Keith Lamb revealed this morning that a third club
              had agreed a fee for the central defender and it has since emerged that
              Arsene Wenger has thrown his hat into the ring.</p>
              <p>The  28-year-old had been expected to join north London rivals Spurs after turning down a move to Newcastle.</p>

              <p class="article">The winger was ready to follow Boro team-mate Jonathan Woodgate to White Hart 
              Lane.</p>
              <p class="article">But despite the two clubs agreeing a £7million fee, boss Juande Ramos has 
              cooled his interest in a player who was targeted by Spurs sporting director 
              Damien Comolli when Martin Jol was in charge.</p>
              <p class="article">A pal of the winger said: “Stewart is annoyed that everything seems to have
