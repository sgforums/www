              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">LIVERPOOL face paying £30MILLION in wages on their unwanted stars next year if they fail to shift them.</h2>
              <p>That means the Mersey misfits pocketing the same as the yearly payments on the club's debt in the dark days of Tom Hicks and George Gillett.</p>
              <p>Kop flops like Milan Jovanovic and Joe Cole alone trousered around £12m between them in a disastrous debut season at Anfield.</p>
              <p>The Reds are keen to offload a dozen players who have no chance of action in Kenny Dalglish's Anfield revolution.</p>
              <p>Yet with many sitting on sky-high contracts signed under the old regime, moving them on is proving a huge headache. And that has left Kop bosses staring at the prospect of forking out £600,000 a week plus on what is effectively deadwood.</p>
              <p>Top earner amongst those unwanted men is Serb Jovanovic, pocketing half a million each month under the terms of his free transfer arrival from Standard Liege.</p>
              <p>Midfielder Cole is not far behind, on £110,000 a week, yet neither man went close to holding down a regular place.</p>
              <p>Jovanovic made just five league starts last season, costing the Reds £1.2m a game.</p>
              <p>Christian Poulsen arrived from Juventus touted as one of the great contemporary Danish stars, yet kicked off only nine times in the league - around £300,000 a match.</p>
              <p>The problems hit Liverpool full in the face a week ago when Anderlecht and Bruges - both keen on Jovanovic - did a swift U-turn on learning the size of his wage packet.</p>
              <p>And if relegation did not shatter any hopes West Ham had of taking Cole back to Upton Park, the size of his salary certainly did.</p>
              <p>If that is not bad enough, Liverpool's training ground will be flooded with returning loan "stars" next month, if they fail to find takers.</p>
              <p>Italian Alberto Aquilani spent last season at Juventus but neither they or Milan will pay the asking price for a man who cost £20m two years ago.</p>
              </div>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>Aquilani featured twice for Liverpool before being packed off to Turin and his nine league starts have cost nearly half a million each. Paul Konchesky made 15 league starts but lasted just six months before he was loaned to Nottingham Forest.</p>
              <p>Others returning are Moroccan Nabil El Zhar, who was at PAOK Salonika last term, and Swiss full back Philipp Degen, who was with Stuttgart.</p>
              <p>It is a harsh reality check for fans convinced King Kenny will be leading them to a serious title challenge next season.</p>
              <p>American owners the Fenway Sports Group have so far been true to their word and backed Dalglish's plans with hard cash - as in the £20m they paid for Jordan Henderson.</p>
              <p>Others set to follow are Stewart Downing, Charlie Adam, Connor Wickham and Gael Clichy.</p>
              <p>But one thing is for certain, any return to the glory days under Dalglish will not be on the cheap.</p>

              <p>Where got most lah?</p>
              <p>2 out of the 5 were his and they were the peanut buy of the lot... The cheapest of the cheap kind of players they gave him money to spent on... So how to blame him?</p>
              <p>Joe Cole was bought by their previous MD, Jovanovic already signed an agreement to join them on the free 6 months before Rafa was sacked that's why his salary is sooo high for an average player... And Aquaman... Everyone know the story by now liao right? He was bought to replace Alonso 2 yrs ago when Rafa was still God's gift to them... King of the Pool... So no way ah Roy can take the bullet on him...</p>
              <p>On Paul Konchesky, remember how hard Pool fought to get him from Fulham? I recalled that Fulham owner Mohamed Al Fayed was so angry righ after his good performance over that season that saw Fulham go all the way to the Europa cup final... You want English players so sometimes it doesn't work out lor... Anyway, he was relatively cheap for an English player... $3m only...</p>

              <p><br>I think it was plain clear even during those days that money was his main objective... Chelsea had a $80k contract on the table for like 6 months but he refused to take...</p>
              <p>He waited and waited for a club willing to offer him a big money deal and when one by one was frighten away by his demand... He settled for the "best club in the country" according to his words... and said it was a no brainer not to take the offer...</p>
              <p>Oh well, at least he got one right out of two... lol.</p>

              <h1>Kyrgiakos makes Wolfsburg move</h1>
              <p>Wolfsburg have completed the signing of Greece defender Sotirios Kyrgiakos for an undisclosed fee from Liverpool.</p>

              <p class="introduction"><strong>Liverpool defender Sotirios Kyrgiakos has joined Bundesliga side Wolfsburg on a two-year contract.</strong></p>
              <p>In June Kyrgiakos looked to have <span style="color: #000000;">earned a new one-year deal at Anfield</span> after making the required number of appearances to trigger the extension.</p>
              <p>But on Monday the Reds said the 32-year-old Greek defender had left the club for the German side.</p>
              <p>Liverpool have not revealed whether they have received a fee for Kyrgiakos.</p>
              <p>Kyrgiakos made 49 appearances for the Reds, scoring three goals, after <span style="color: #000000;">signing from AEK Athens in August 2009</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></p>
              <p>Wolfsburg coach Felix Magath was keen to bolster his defence following his team's 4-1 loss at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday in the Bundesliga.</p>
              <p>Kyrgiakos said he was looking forward to returning to Germany after spending two seasons at Eintracht Frankfurt from 2006 to 2008.</p>
              <p>"Wolfsburg are a good club. They won the championship in 2009," he told the club's official website.</p>
              <p>"I'm here to play and I would like to play every game."</p>
