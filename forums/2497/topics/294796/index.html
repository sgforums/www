            <div class='col-md body'>Police to investigate 15 games for match-fixing<br><br>LUCERNE, Switzerland, Dec 1 (Reuters) - UEFA has given police a list of 15 matches it suspects may have been fixed, a senior UEFA source said on Saturday.<br><br>News of the match-fixing investigation came while UEFA officials and coaches gathered in Lucerne ahead of Sunday's draw for Euro 2008, to be played in Switzerland and Austria.<br><br>According to the source, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, '15 matches are under investigation and being dealt with by UEFA's disciplinary committee'.<br><br>The matches under suspicion were played in a variety of UEFA competitions including Champions League qualifiers, UEFA Cup qualifiers and UEFA Cup and Intertoto Cup ties.<br><br>UEFA would not confirm when the matches took place although the source said a 96-page dossier handed to Interpol last month went back to July 2005.<br><br>Irregular betting patterns on the matches alerted UEFA to the possibility that some might have been fixed.<br><br>'UEFA introduced, over one year ago, an early warning system in order to monitor irregular betting activities, and agreed to work together with the appropriate police authorities,' UEFA said in a statement on its Web site (www.uefa.com).<br><br>'In this respect we were informed of some unusual betting patterns in the preliminary rounds of UEFA club competitions.<br><br>'For the avoidance of doubt, there are no investigations underway into any of the qualifying matches for UEFA Euro 2008.<br><br>'As a responsible governing body, UEFA is continuously monitoring football betting patterns and will take disciplinary action in any cases where that may be justified.'<br><br>Graham Bean, an ex-police officer and former head of the English FA's Compliance Unit, said the affair could become the biggest of its kind to hit the international game.<br><br>Bean told the BBC World Service on Saturday: 'These are clearly exceptionally serious allegations but having said that they will be extremely difficult to investigate.<br><br>'Clearly for UEFA to pass this report across (to the police) they must have evidence of some kind...<br><br>'...This is potentially one of the most serious things that has ever happened in world football.'<br><br>Earlier this week, UEFA opened an investigation into the Intertoto Cup match between Bulgarians Cherno More and Macedonia's Makedonija on July 7, which Cherno More won 4-0.<br><br>The Bulgarian club have strongly denied any wrongdoing.<br><br>'It's an extremely unpleasant case but we think that the charges are unwarranted,' Cherno More's lawyer Mihail Statev said at a news conference on Tuesday.<br></div>
