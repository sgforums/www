              <p><strong>Daniel Sturridge is demanding a staggering £80,000 a week to move to Liverpool in January.</strong> </p>
              <p>The Reds have already asked Chelsea about their reserve striker’s availability, and look set <span style="color: #000000;">to follow up their interest</span>, which dates back to the summer, in the winter transfer window.</p>
              <p>There is a feeling at Anfield, however, that Sturridge has done little in the last 12 months to justify such big wages since his fine start to last season. </p>
              <p>Back then, he scored 10 goals playing wide in an attacking three under Andre Villas-Boas. </p>
              <p>But since last December, he has scored just five times for the European Champions.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old’s camp also insist he MUST play through the middle if he were to move to Liverpool next month. </p>
              <p>Liverpool are keen not to repeat the financial mistakes of past windows after big signings Andy Carroll, Jordan Henderson and Stewart Downing struggled to make any sort of impact</p>

              <p><strong><span>Liverpool will unveil a new £18million strike force in January after taking significant steps to securing deals for Daniel Sturridge and Thomas Ince. </span><br></strong></p>
              <p><span>It has been Brendan Rodgers wish for Liverpool to get their business in the New Year done early and they now are on the brink of landing their two prime targets.</span></p>
              <p><span>Chelsea forward Sturridge is expected to cost Liverpool in the region of £12million, while they will have to pay Blackpool in the region of £6million to take Ince back to Anfield 18 months after letting him leave for £250,000.</span></p>
              <p><span>Sturridge, who is currently in Japan with Chelsea at the Club World Cup, almost joined Liverpool in August but did not want to move on an initial loan deal. Rodgers, though, has remained an admirer and his transfer will be completed when the window opens.</span></p>
              <p><span>Ince, meanwhile, will also be brought in to ease the burden on leading scorer Luis Suarez. He left Anfield in August 2011 and has since made eye-catching progress at Bloomfield Road, winning five England Under 21 caps this season.</span></p>
              <p><span>Rodgers said last month he was looking for players "who would really help take the club forward" and both 20-year-old Ince and Sturridge, 23, fit the criteria of players who Liverpool look to buy. Rodgers remains keen on Arsenal’s Theo Walcott but he would be a signing for next summer.</span></p>
              <p><span>It promises to be a significant transfer window for how Rodgers shapes Liverpool’s squad. He remains on the look-out for a left-back, as Stewart Downing has been told he is free to leave if they receive a suitable offer.</span></p>
              <p><span>But whether Joe Cole follows suit is not certain. The former England midfielder made a significant contribution to Sunday's 3-2 win at West Ham, scoring Liverpool’s crucial second goal and Rodgers has challenged Cole to maintain that <a id="_GPLITA_0" style="text-decoration: underline;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Savings Sidekick" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/2497/topics/#">form</a>.</span></p>

              *BRENDAN RODGERS has told his Liverpool players: Weâ€™re a lot better than fourth place.*
              
              
              The improving Reds might be languishing in 10th spot this morning.
              
              But their ambitious boss believes they can shake the Premier League title-chasers.
              
              Liverpool are just four points off fourth place â€” currently held by Mersey rivals Everton â€” after a â€œwatershedâ€� 3-2 comeback win at West Ham last Sunday.
              
              But Rodgers has set his sights on a much loftier finish ahead of todayâ€™s clash with Aston Villa.
              
              He said: â€œYes, fourth is up for grabs â€” so is third, so is second and maybe even first. It isnâ€™t just about fourth place, this club is bigger than that. There is not that big a difference to second.
              
              â€œThere are 17 points between us and Manchester United and that is a big ask, but 11 points isnâ€™t and four points certainly isnâ€™t.
              
              â€œI said to the players that everyone talks about fourth but what about third? Theyâ€™re excited, there is real belief in this group.
              
              â€œWe are 11 points off second, we have still to play Manchester City and we should have beaten them at home. If we get a run of games and stay focused, then it is not fourth we want to aim for.â€�
              
              Villaâ€™s visit is followed by Fulham next weekend, a Boxing Day trip to Stoke and the last game of 2012 at lowly QPR.
              
              Strugglers Sunderland see in the New Year at Anfield and Rodgers said: â€œI wouldnâ€™t say it was a crucial period but Iâ€™d expect to win our home games.
              
              â€œWe are not too far away and I donâ€™t think we need to change.
              
              â€œWeâ€™ve drawn a lot of games and lost four, one more than United and up there with Chelsea. If we had turned one or two of those draws into wins we could be higher.
              
              â€œWe went through a period at the start of the season where we werenâ€™t getting wins and it was a â€˜disasterâ€™ for Liverpool. It doesnâ€™t seem to be a disaster for other teams when they lose.

              <p>Liverpool boss Rodgers had claimed he was chasing more than the fourth-placed finish many have tipped his improving side for.</p>
              <p>But after this sorry showing, he admitted: “It was very much self-inflicted, without taking anything away from Aston Villa. Our intensity was not there while they were a threat on the counter-attack.</p>
              <p>“There’s been talk of the top four for us but it’s more about steady progress and today was a step back.</p>
              <p>“It was very disappointing and I didn’t see it coming.</p>
              <p>“Our momentum and confidence coming into this game were as high as they’ve been and we got punished for poor decision-making and being a bit careless.”</p>
              <p>Villa had hit just four league away goals all season before arriving at Anfield.</p>

              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>And boss Paul Lambert was naturally delighted with Benteke’s double strike and another from Austrian Andreas Weimann.</p>
              <p>Lambert said: “The whole performance was fabulous, from the goals to the way we defended.</p>
              <p>“Liverpool will give anyone a game here but it’s about holding your nerve and trying to see it out, which we did.”</p>

              <p>This game is like the game with Bolton last season befoe the FA cup final. Both was lost because they underestimated the opponent. </p>
              <p>But it seems that Liverpool is petty easy to counter. Just park 2 banks of 4 in front of the goal and counter attack with long balls.</p>
              <p>Its getting amusing that in the second half Liverpool is trying to get more and more crosses into the box instead of trying short passings.</p>
              <p>The team right now is just not good enough to play passing like Bacralona, you need to have amazing midfielder to make sure you don't lose the ball in midfield, but Liverpool is no where near that.</p>

              <p>Every team will be parking their bus in front of the goal mouth at Anfield.</p>
              <p>This is an guaranteed way of beating Liverpool.</p>
              <p>As for center forward, the wingers are pretty weak and slow in delivering the cross. (Except for Sterling)</p>
              <p>When they arrived, the defenders have already fall in to mark Luis.</p>
              <p>This is basically a normal team that wayang for big performance but cannot deliver when the time comes. (Same as the team that we are wasting millions on)</p>
              <p>Most of them are over-paid, under-motivated and lacking in skill.</p>
              <p>Dunno about Sahin. Is he locked in the freezer at the boot room ?</p>
              <p>Why we are re-cycling trash like Downing and Henderson ?</p>

              <p>I dun think so. But, he never failed to provide a response when Liverpool lost.</p>
