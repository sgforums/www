              <p class="first"><strong>Police are investigating an allegation of common assault made against Jose Mourinho after a Champions League tie.</strong></p>
              <p>It has been <span style="text-decoration: underline;">alleged the Inter Milan manager punched a supporter</span> as he left Old Trafford stadium after his team's defeat by Manchester
              United.</p>
              <p>Police have contacted United to request CCTV footage of the area and have confirmed a complaint has been made.</p>
              <p>A spokesman for Manchester United confirmed they are aware of the allegation but made no further comment.</p>
              <p>A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: "Just before midnight on
              Wednesday 11 March 2009 a man reported he'd been punched in the face
              outside Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>"Police are investigating this common assault allegation. Inquiries are ongoing."</p>
              <p>The allegation came at the end of a bad night for Mourinho, who
              watched his team crash out of the Champions League following their
              defeat, with Nemanja Vidic and Cristiano Ronaldo grabbing goals for
              United at the start of each half.</p>
              <p>Mourinho has come under attack from the Italian media for his
              failure to get Inter through to the last eight teams in the
              competition.</p>
              <p>The plane taking the Inter party back to Milan left Manchester at 0025 GMT.</p>

It is claimed the supporter started singing abusive songs at the self-styled "Special One" as he left Manchester United's ground at around midnight.</p>
              <p class="article">The fan is alleged to have chanted “you’re going home, you’re going home” before Mourinho hit him.</p>
              <p class="article">The supporter, who has not been named, later went into Stretford police station, close to Old Trafford, to report the alleged attack.</p>

              <p class="story_panel_text"><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Inter
              Milan have denied allegations that Jose Mourinho assaulted a fan after
              the Champions League tie versus Manchester United at Old Trafford.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Greater Manchester Police
              are investigating a claim that a fan was punched by the former Chelsea
              manager shortly after Inter crashed out of the Champions League.</p>
              <p>A statement from Inter read: "At the end of the game, the
              Portuguese tactician gave interviews to the European media, signed
              autographs, watched the penalties of the Roma v Arsenal game before
              saluting (Sir Alex) Ferguson in his office.</p>
              <p>"After giving the last interview to Inter Channel, he entered
              the team bus that was parked outside the dressing rooms and hence it
              was a very calm post-game experience."</p>
              <p>The allegation was one of common assault against Mourinho, with
              the claim that he punched a supporter close to the Inter team bus as
              the Italian side left the stadium.</p>
              <p>GMP contacted United to request CCTV footage of the area and have confirmed a complaint has been made.</p>
              <p>"Shortly before midnight last night a man reported that he had
              been punched in the face outside Old Trafford," a police statement
              read.</p>
              <p>"We are investigating an allegation of common assault."</p>
              <p>United would only confirm they are aware of the allegation and are making no further comment.</p>
              <p>The allegation came at the end of a bad night for Mourinho, who
              watched his team's European campaign come to an end, with Nemanja Vidic
              and Cristiano Ronaldo grabbing United's goals at the start of each
              half.</p>
              <p>Although the former Chelsea manager was in jovial mood, shaking
              hands with Red Devils supporters as he made his way to the visitors'
              dug-out before kick-off and after half-time and enjoyed a friendly
              post-match chat with Ferguson, he came under sustained attack from the
              Italian media for his failure to get Inter through.</p>
              <p>"If anyone wishes to criticise my team, they will have to fight
              me," he said at one point, those comments coming via an official
              interpreter.</p>
              <p>Although he has taken Inter to the top of Serie A, his
              relationship with the local press is far from smooth, a fact that has
              only fuelled a belief that he could one day replace Ferguson at Old
              Trafford.</p>
              <p>The plane taking the Inter party back to Milan left Manchester
              at 12.25am last night, once Mourinho had concluded his post-match
              obligations and enjoyed his meeting with Ferguson.</p>
              <p>The fan who made the complaint is not from the Greater
              Manchester area and did not report any injuries to police or need
              treatment.</p>

              <p>Poor fellow... In Italy, most of the other club managers despise him, the Italian Press unlike the English dislike him, and the fans of AC Milan, Juve, Roma all hate him... Even the Italian FA has said his outburst and attacks on the other clubs could cause a riot between club fans... His disrespect and ridiculesd the other clubs present state until even the normally quiet Paolo Maldini has responded angrily...</p>
              <p>Now with Inter out of the CL, strangely the other Italians are celebrating... They just can't wait to let him have it back after enduring these last few months of his arrogance... Jose himself knew and was quoted saying... “All of Italy will be pleased Inter are out. But I don’t care, I know I won.”  I recalled he said something quite the same when he was at Chelsea too... like when Chelsea lose its like a public holiday in England... Everyone is so happy...</p>
              <p>Its amazing how he can unite all the other clubs and make Inter the most hated club in Italy right now... And he is looking for a new club possibly Real Madrid... lol</p>
              <p>His purchased have also been poor, spending a combine sum of around $40m or more on Mancini, Muntari and Quaresma but unfortunately all have been flop signings... And instead relying on former manager's <span style="color: #000000;">Roberto Mancini players...</span></p>
              <p>If anything, I think Inter have gotten the shorter end of the stick with Mourinho... R Mancini has won them titles after titles and Jose was suppose to get them the CL or at least to the later stages... But he has reached the same point as Mancini even after spending so much... and getting paid so much extra to R Mancini...</p>

              <p class="small color-666"><em>Jose Mourinho could be looking over his shoulder after recent events in Italy</em></p>
              <p class="heading"> </p>
              <p class="heading"> </p>
              <p><strong>José Mourinho launched a staunch defence last night after being accused of punching a fan as he left Old Trafford at the end of the Champions League defeat by Manchester United.</strong></p>
              <p>The Inter Milan coach is alleged to have struck the supporter as he left the ground on Wednesday night, but Eladio Parames, Mourinho’s spokesman, said last night: “We talked with José and this is very strange. Nothing happened at all. He shook hands with the fans, he was in the press conference, he talked with [Sir Alex] Ferguson in a friendly way like always, went to the bus and nothing happened.” Inter also deny the allegations.</p>
              <p>Greater Manchester Police have confirmed that a complaint was made and are investigating.</p>
              <p>If Mourinho is not called back to England for an interview, his next important appointment will be with Massimo Moratti, the Inter president, as much of the football world debates what his next move will be.</p>
              <p>The Portuguese revels in the limelight more than any other manager since Brian Clough, but even such an attention-seeker will not have enjoyed the recent speculation. While Mourinho is aware that his time in Italy could be limited — with Inter’s fans sceptical, the club embarrassed by some of his antics and the nation’s media openly hostile — he is also conscious that his options are decreasing.</p>
              <p>Mourinho enjoyed flirting with the FA when it was looking for an England manager 15 months ago, because he knew that a big job would come his way sooner rather than later. That, however, is no longer the case, which seems ridiculous given that he is on the brink of winning his fifth league title in three different countries, and says more about his failings as a person than his qualities as a manager. His spats with an Italian media that he regards as xenophobic are well known, but it is his ability to get on with Moratti that will shape his future.</p>
              <p>The essence of Mourinho’s problem at the San Siro is his belief that it is not his team. The Portuguese will demand significant funds to reshape the squad, yet Moratti is reluctant to sanction huge spending given that they are on the verge of a fourth successive championship. His view is strengthened by the negligible contribution of Mourinho’s signings to date — Sulley Muntari, Ricardo Quaresma and Mancini.</p>
              <p>Something has to give, and not for the first time in his career it may have to be Mourinho.</p>
