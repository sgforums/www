              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez has defended his record at </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool </strong></span></a><strong>as his future as Reds manager continues to be the subject of speculation.</strong>  </p>
              <p>The Spaniard has been linked with a move away from Anfield with Inter Milan as a possible destination should Jose Mourinho move on after tonight's Champions League final.  </p>
              <p>Benitez insists he is happy on Merseyside but he has been the subject of increasing criticism following a season where they finished seventh in the Barclays Premier League.  </p>
              <p>However, he defended his tenure and told the Daily Mirror: 'There is this legend that Liverpool hasn't won many trophies, that we have failed in that aspect.  </p>
              <p>'Well, Chelsea and Manchester United have won 10 trophies in the six years I've been in Liverpool;  Arsenal, Spurs and Portsmouth one.  </p>
              <p>'Liverpool? Four trophies and we have played in three finals. Liverpool have been competitive. </p>
              <p>'Does Liverpool have to win the league, as everybody demands, every year?'</p>
              <p>The former Valencia manager also feels he has not had as much control as he would have liked.  </p>
              <p>'Does the manager have absolute power in England?' he went on. 'No, it depends on a budget and on the executive director that negotiates the signings of players.  </p>

              <p>'Look at the wages picked up by the players on Chelsea or Manchester United's substitutes' bench: (John) Obi Mikel, (Michael) Owen, (Salomon) Kalou, (Dimitar) Berbatov, (Michael) Carrick could be on £4million a year. </p>
              <p>'When Portsmouth offered Peter Crouch more money than we were paying him and promised him a starting place, it became very complicated for us to keep hold of him. The arrival of Fernando Torres meant he couldn't play as often at Liverpool.'</p>
              <p>Benitez also claimed to have made money for the club. 'Some people say I have spent £280m.  </p>
              <p>'But we have spent £220m on players and generated £160m in player sales. That is the equivalent of a £60m net spend over six years: in other words, £10m spent per year.  </p>
              <p>'Deduct from that figure the £120m revenue from the Champions League success and qualification over that period, and we have in fact generated an additional £60m benefits for the club.'  </p>

              <p>The prime objective of employing Ah Ben is to win the league title for Liverpool.</p>
              <p>He is now giving himself grounds for providing medicore results this season.</p>
              <p>He have given some many reasons for not meeting his targets this year.</p>
              <p>Targets were set by himself and he have failed himself.</p>

              <p>I think Rafa would long be sacked if he isn't on the mega payroll due to the 5 years contract. They couldn't afford to fire him.</p>
