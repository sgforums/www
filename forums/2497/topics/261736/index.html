Mourinho, speaking on a charity tour in Ghana, said: Â“We work together on the same mission and on the same course. I have to respect him, heÂ’s the boss.Â” Asked by local journalists if he would phone Abramovich to see how his day was going, manager Mourinho added: Â“Would you phone the president of Ghana?Â”</strong><br><br>The Special One had barely spoken to Abramovich since a bust-up in January but called a truce last month. And he was told he can keep his job at Stamford Bridge as long as he compromised on his opposition to some of RomÂ’s future plans. But Andriy Shevchenko could be on his way out.<br><br>AC Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi claims his club are Â“80 per cent certainÂ” of re-signing the striker. The Champions League winners are desperate to get Sheva, 30, back just one year after selling him for Â£30million. Former Italian president Berlusconi admitted: Â“I spoke to vice-president Adriano Galliani a few days ago and he said the chances of Sheva coming back were 80 per cent.<br><br>Â“If that had dropped to 50 per cent, IÂ’m sure Galliani would have told me. Â“Shevchenko wants to return and his wages would not be a problem.Â” Berlusconi, who is godfather to ShevaÂ’s son Jordan, was fiercely critical of the hotshotÂ’s decision to leave Milan.<br><br>Back then, he declared: Â“I am in charge at my home. But when ShevchenkoÂ’s wife shouts he runs under the bed like a lap dog.Â” The pair have since made up and Berlusconi now says: Â“I consider Sheva to be like my son. Â“There is also talk of Milan signing Samuel EtoÂ’o but IÂ’m a romantic and prefer Shevchenko.Â”<br></div>
