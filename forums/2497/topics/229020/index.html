            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2007/01/01/Curbishley128.jpg"><br><br>When Alan Curbishley arrived at Upton Park three weeks ago, it was blithely assumed that his expertise would enable West Ham to avoid relegation with ease. When he won his first game, against Manchester United, it was apparently a done deal. Not any more. Curbishley has presided over three consecutive defeats that have left his side deep in the mire, and while excuses could be made for the first two this one was as bad as it gets.<br><br>Reading were excellent, ending a six-match run without a win, but if they stay in the Premiership for the next century they will never have as easy a game as this. West Ham were pathetic, four goals down by half-time and lucky not to take an even bigger pasting.<br><br>Curbishley's excellence at Charlton means he has limited experience of relegation battles, but he will get a crash course now. This West Ham side has three main problems: a jittery defence, a non-existent midfield and a miserable excuse for an attack. As soon as they went a goal down they played like a side who knew they had lost. While that was hardly an unwarranted conclusion - they have not scored away in the Premiership since August - the defeatist body language, unremitting infighting and brattish dissent were appalling. Curbishley may not be the messiah, but he has inherited some very naughty boys.<br><br>West Ham have been on the road to nowhere. The only thing they showed yesterday was the white flag, from the moment Reading took the lead in the 12th minute.<br><br>West Ham could not shake their left knee and they were three down after half an hour, Curbishley settled for damage limitation by bringing on Jonathan Spector for Marlon Harewood at half-time ("Our aim was to stop it being eight," he explained later). But the goals continued to flow.<br><br>"You just enjoy the moment," said Coppell, "and accept the fact that it won't continue next week." If only Curbishley could be so sure.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Reading boss Steve Coppell:</strong></span><br>"I knew it was a real test physically and that's why the performance was surprising as it has been so demanding for us recently. "I didn't think the players would go to the well again or have the legs for it.<br><br>"But once we scored the first goal it was our best spell of football since I've been here. They were creative and wanted to be on the front foot."<br><br><span style="color: green;"><strong>West Ham manager Alan Curbishley:</strong></span><br>"This hasn't just happened and the players have to realise a couple of things very quickly. "They have not scored a lot of goals and it is a confidence thing. But how do you get it back? By winning games.<br><br>"We couldn't live with Reading but we have to rally around now and get three-pointers. We need to pick up points to give ourselves a chance."<br><br></div>

But thatÂ’s what weÂ’ve got to try to do and hopefully during this month, if we pick up a result against Fulham it may make it a bit easier. Players look at where you are in the league.<br><br>Â“Harry Redknapp couldnÂ’t attract players at Southampton because they were in the bottom three, at Portsmouth he managed it and turned it around.<br><br>Â“WeÂ’ll have to see if we can get the players in weÂ’ve been attempting to get in.Â”<br></div>
