"My agent told me the deal was very advanced and I was then told that the deal had been reached between both clubs.<br><br>"I am happy that Deportivo will take double the amount of what they paid for me, I am grateful to them and I know my departure will help the club. "For me this is a beautiful challenge and I hope everything goes well. "It's a huge leap for me."<br><br>Arbeloa, who joined Deportivo in a Â£1.3million deal from Real Madrid last year, has made 20 league appearances this season.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool move for Spanish pair<br><br>Liverpool are set to bolster their defence with the signing of Deportivo La CoruÃ±a's Alvaro Arbeloa.<br><br>Rafael BenÃ­tez has been looking to add depth at the back this January and made Aberloa, who can play right-back or centre-back, his top target after Lucas Neill signed for West Ham. The 24-year-old only joined Deportivo from Real Madrid in the summer, but is expected to arrive on Merseyside today with reports in Spain suggesting the fee will be in the region of Â£2.6m.<br><br>"I'm as surprised as everyone," said Arbeloa. "It looks like a good move for me and Depor especially as they are going to get double what they paid for me." Coach Joaquin Caparros confirmed the transfer but did not give any financial details. "Arbeloa is going to sign for Liverpool. The club has made a good investment and we are happy for Arbeloa because it is a reward for his professionalism and team spirit," he said.<br><br>The Reds are also set to acquire the services of promising Spanish midfielder Francis Duran from Segunda Division team Malaga. The 18-year-old - who made his debut for Malaga's first team earlier this month, but does not have a professional contract with the Andalusian outfit - was also due to travel to Liverpool and is expected to sign with the Reds, according to the Spanish media.<br><br>Wigan have bolstered their fight against relegation with the signing of Julius Aghahowa from Shakhtar Donetsk for Â£2.1m. The Nigerian striker, who has scored 13 goals in 25 matches at international level, was granted a work permit at a hearing in Sheffield today.<br><br>"He's a striker of real pedigree who will add huge competition to the attacking positions," said Wigan boss Paul Jewell, who also has Emile Heskey and Henri Camara on his books. "We've really done our homework on this one. He's quick, strong, aggressive, good with both feet and I'm sure he will adapt to the rigours of the Premiership."<br><br>Newcastle, meanwhile, have completed the loan signing of United States international defender Oguchi Onyewu until the end of the season. Onyewu successfully underwent a medical on Tyneside yesterday and has signed a deal which will keep him at St James' Park for the rest of the current campaign. Newcastle also have the option to make the transfer permanent in the summer.<br><br>Edgar Davids will return to the club where his career began after signing an 18-month deal with Ajax. Davids - who played for Ajax between 1991 to 1996, winning the 1992 Uefa Cup and the 1995 Champions League - had been angling for a move away from Tottenham this January after falling out of favour there. After starting 28 Premiership games for Spurs last season, Davids has managed just six league starts this term and had been linked with a lucrative move to Major League Soccer.<br><br>Elsewhere, Charlton have taken 19-year-old Arsenal midfielder Alexandre Song on loan until the end of the season, Siena have signed Middlesbrough's Massimo Maccarone on a free transfer and Blackburn have made FC Basle left-back Bruno Berner their fourth signing of the January transfer window.<br><br></div>
