              <p><span>The former England captain, 31, will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London charged with a racially aggravated public order offence. </span> </p>
              <p><span>If found guilty, Terry faces a maximum fine of £2,500. There is no prospect of any jail sentence. Football supporters found guilty of racial abuse can be subject to orders banning them from all grounds in the country. </span></p>
              <p><span>Terry denies any wrongdoing and has hired the services of experienced and highly respected QC, George Carter-Stephenson, to lead his defence.</span></p>
              <p><span>Terry was dropped as England captain by the Football Association once his trial date was set for after Euro 2012, and that axing led to Fabio Capello's resignation as manager and the appointment of Roy Hodgson.</span></p>
              <p><span>Hodgson selected Terry in his 23- man squad for the championship in Ukraine and Poland and the central defender played in all four of England's games at the tournament before their elimination on penalties by Italy. </span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Chelsea captain and England international John Terry called Anton Ferdinand a racist obscenity in response to taunts about his alleged affair with a team-mate's ex-girlfriend, a court has heard. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The 31-year-old allegedly called QPR defender Ferdinand a 'f****** black c***'. </span></p>
              <p><span>Terry is accused of a racially aggravated public order offence during a Barclays Premier League match on October 23 last year, which was broadcast to millions of people. </span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p><span>Appearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court, Terry sat in the dock wearing a light grey suit, white shirt and pink tie. </span></p>
              <p><span>The court heard that Terry told Ferdinand to 'f*** off" and also called him a "f****** k*******' as the pair exchanged insults. </span></p>
              <p><span>Opening the prosecution, Duncan Penny said: 'The Crown alleges that the words he used demonstrated hostility based on Mr Ferdinand's membership or presumed membership of a racial group.</span></p>
              <p> </p>

              </div>
              <p><span>The court heard that Terry maintains he was only sarcastically repeating words that Ferdinand wrongly thought he had used. </span></p>
              <p><span>Mr Penny said: 'The Crown alleges that the defendant, most probably in response to physical gestures being made by Mr Ferdinand which the defendant understood to refer to the well-publicised allegation of an extra-marital affair with a team-mate's wife, shouted at Mr Ferdinand.'</span></p>
              <p><span>He went on: 'The Crown's case is that the words were abusive and insulting in a straightforward sense and that the term 'f****** black c***' was uttered as an abusive insult demonstrating hostility based on Mr Ferdinand's membership of a racial group. </span></p>
              <p><span>'They were uttered by the defendant in response to goading by Mr Ferdinand on the issue of his extra-marital affair, rather than by way of exaggerated and instant querying of a perceived false allegation.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Terry was allowed out of the dock into the well of the court to view footage of the alleged insult.</span></p>
              <p><span>Before the case started, defence barrister George Carter-Stephenson QC asked for Terry to be allowed to sit beside him in the well of the court rather than in the dock.</span></p>
              <p><span>District Judge Howard Riddle rejected the request. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand, controversially axed from Roy Hodgson's 23-man Euro 2012 squad, tweeted support for his brother on Monday. </span></p>
              <p><span>'Morning all! Frazzled head this morning, school run done! @anton_ferdinand head high bruv,' Ferdinand said. </span></p>
              <p><span>Terry denies any wrongdoing and has hired the services of experienced and highly respected QC, George Carter-Stephenson, to lead his defence. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Terry was dropped as England captain by the Football Association once his trial date was set for after Euro 2012, and that axing led to Fabio Capello's resignation as manager and the appointment of Roy Hodgson.</span></p>

              <p><span>Hodgson selected Terry in his squad for the championship in Ukraine and Poland and the central defender played in all four of England's games at the tournament before their elimination on penalties by Italy. </span></p>
              <p><span>The Chelsea defender, who did not say anything when asked for comment on his arrival at court, takes to the dock facing a maximum fine of £2,500 if he is found guilty. There is no prospect of any jail sentence. The trial is expected to last for five days. </span> </p>
              <p><span>The case is being heard by Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle, and there is no jury. </span></p>
              <p><span>Both television clips and unbroadcast footage of the incident, which would normally be used for training purposes, were shown to the court. </span></p>
              <p><span>It is claimed that Ferdinand said something about 'shagging ya mate's missus' and made fist gestures, before Terry responded. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>The court was told that Chelsea team-mates Ashley Cole and John Obi Mikel were nearby when insults were traded, but they will not be called as witnesses as part of the prosecution case. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Terry said in a statement to the Football Association five days after the incident that he and Ferdinand had been exchanging 'verbals' and he had made a gesture to imply Mr Ferdinand had bad breath. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>He said: 'We're still having a, sort of, ding-dong, if you like. That's when, as I said before, he said "black c***". <br></span></p>
              <p><span>'Now clearly, as I said before, I don't think he's calling me a black c***, but at the same time I take quite a strong offence.'</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>The England defender said he was not offended by the taunts about the alleged affair with Wayne Bridge's ex-girlfriend, because 'it's not the first time I've heard it, so it's with a pinch of salt a little bit now'.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>However he said he was angered by any accusation that he might have used a racist insult. After the match, which took place at QPR's ground Loftus Road, Terry asked a steward to get Ferdinand from the QPR dressing room. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Terry said in his statement: 'It's myself, Anton and Ash (Ashley Cole), nobody else, and I said to Anton, "was you accusing me of calling you a black c***?" </span></p>

              <p><span>'That was my exact words to him, and he said "No, not at all."'</span></p>
              <p><span>Later in the interview Terry added: 'I'm being honest and open with you guys, that I didn't mean it in the context that, if you watch the video and me, watching the video, you can quite easily say that doesn't look good. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>'But at the same time, in the context of what I thought Anton accused me of, you know, no-one can argue what my feelings were at that time.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Immediately after the match, Ferdinand did not think that Terry had used racist words, the court heard. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>He said: 'It's handbags innit - it's what happens on the pitch', and the two shook hands. But later, Ferdinand's girlfriend showed him footage posted on YouTube, and he believed Terry had used the racist insult. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Ferdinand told the court that if he had realised at the time he would have told officials.</span></p>
              <p><span>He said: 'I would have been obviously very hurt and I probably wouldn't have reacted at the time because, being a professional, you can't do that. I probably would have let the officials know what happened and dealt with it after the game.</span></p>

              <p><span>Chelsea were down to nine men in the clash at Loftus Road, and Ferdinand and Terry began trading insults over a penalty claim, the court heard.</span></p>
              <p><span>Ferdinand said: 'He called me a c*** and I called him a c*** back and he gave me a gesture as if to say my breath smelled.</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>After the match, Chelsea left-back Ashley Cole told him: 'You can't talk to JT like that.'</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Terry then met Ferdinand to ask what had happened. 'Mr Terry said "Do you think I racially abused you?" I was like "No",' Ferdinand told the court.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I said "No, that never came out of my mouth". Then Ashley Cole popped his head round and said "Yeah, didn't you say that to me?" I said "I didn't say that at all".' He agreed it was just 'handbags', and 'banter', the court heard.</span></p>

              <h2><span style="font-size: xx-large;">'I said to him "How can you call me a c***? You shagged your team-mate's missus, you're a c***". '</span></h2>
              <h2>Anton Ferdinand speaking in court</h2>
              </div>
              <p><span>Ferdinand said he was no stranger to being sworn at and under cross-examination from George Carter-Stephenson QC agreed he had also sworn at players.</span></p>
              <p><span>The QPR defender said he was angry at Terry trying to get a penalty and 'he barged me in the back for no reason', he said.</span></p>
              <p><span>The barrister told Ferdinand he has a tendency to 'paint yourself in the best light'.</span></p>
              <p><span>Asked why he was so angry with Terry appealing for a penalty, Ferdinand, describing himself as a 'calm, collected player', said: 'Because I am a winner.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Ferdinand added that he was angry because Terry had made a hand gesture at him indicating he had bad breath.</span></p>
              <p><span>Proceedings in Court One have been punctuated by swear words but Ferdinand insisted he did not use those words off the pitch.</span></p>
              <p><span>The QC asked the witness if by shouting abuse at him he was 'trying to get a rise out of Mr Terry and get him to react?' <br></span></p>
              <p><span>'Probably, yes,' said Ferdinand. 'There wasn't long left in the game.'<br></span></p>
              <p><span>In a statement made to police last November, Terry said he was offended by the accusation that he had used racist language. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>He said his words to the other player were meant to make it clear that he had not used a racist insult, and that Ferdinand was a 'k*******' for thinking that he had. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>The statement read: 'Whilst footballers are used to industrial language, using racist terms is completely unacceptable whatever (the) situation. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>'I was completely taken aback by this remark as I have never been accused of something like that and I did not take his remark lightly at all, and took strong offence to his suggestion.' </span></p>

              <p><span><strong>John Terry is fighting for his professional reputation after a savage exchange with the Crown Prosecutor in his race trial on Tuesday.<br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Prosecutor Duncan Penny claimed Terry snapped and called Anton Ferdinand a ‘f****** black c***’ because nine-man Chelsea were losing a vital Barclays Premier League match.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Although Penny conceded that the former England captain was not ‘a racist’ during the  ferocious exchange, the barrister claimed in  Westminster Magistrates he made a ‘racial’ slur.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Terry took the stand in Court No 1 at 2.17pm on Tuesday and will be back to face further scrutiny in the dock on Wednesday morning.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>In several heated courtroom exchanges, Terry was forced to explain what level of abuse he considered to be in the ‘no-go area’ for professional footballers playing at the highest level.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>He was also challenged to admit in court that, although he is ‘not a racist’, in the words of Penny, he snapped on the pitch during the derby against Queens Park Rangers last October and made a racist comment. Terry denied this.<br></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Penny</span>: You are not a racist, but you snapped and made a racial slur, didn’t you? <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Terry</span>: No.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Penny</span>: You were fed up of being abused about your wife? <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Terry</span>: Two years on I’ve heard it 100 times, a million times.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Penny</span>: Were you fed up that afternoon?<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Terry</span>: Frustrated.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>The Chelsea defender was forced to admit publicly that conversations between players descend to degrading levels during the heat of battle in the Barclays Premier League.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>During several tense exchanges with Penny and under fierce cross-examination on Tuesday, Terry conceded that players routinely tell each other they ‘s***’ each other’s partners.</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>It was a remarkable acceleration to the courtroom pace after Terry was initially invited to take the stand in a dramatic announcement by his defence QC, George Carter-Stephenson.<br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Just moments after he was taken skilfully through his witness testimony and then shown the video of the controversial incident at Loftus Road, Penny raised the stakes in cross-examination.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>In several explosive exchanges in the courtroom, Penny and Terry clashed over the nature and the level of abuse between footballers. In one, Penny used a litany of swear words and sexual references and asked Terry whether players used these to goad rivals.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Terry’s voice was so soft that, on occasion, he was asked to speak up. In front of a packed gallery, he was confronted by more embarrassing allegations as Penny continued to test him. The audience were gripped.</span></p>

              <p><span>Terry’s defence is that he was questioning Ferdinand’s allegation on the field when he used the phrase in indignation. The previous day his QC had challenged the accuracy of a lip reader’s account of the alleged racist abuse.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Video analysts Prozone provided the court with details of the pair’s clash, which started when they collided in the QPR penalty area and abuse was exchanged for the first time. After being separated by the  referee, Terry ran back to the  halfway line and both continued hurling insults at one another.<br></span></p>

              <p><span>During their tense court exchanges, Penny repeatedly challenged Terry on what constitutes acceptable abuse between players on the field.<br></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Penny</span>: What about if an allegation was made about your sister, your mum, would you repeat that back?<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Terry</span>: He called me ‘black c***’.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Penny</span>: So you repeated those words back immediately?<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Terry</span>: Hindsight is a wonderful thing, I think, I was shocked.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Penny</span>: The ‘n’ word — I’m not even going to repeat it in court, I’m not even going to say it in court. Would you use that?<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Terry</span>: I would probably say that (back to the player).<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Terry, who has been charged with a racially aggravated public order offence following the incident at Loftus Road, denies the charge.</span></p>
              <p><span>Despite the drama on Tuesday, there were some light-hearted moments during the course of Terry’s two-hour stay in the  witness box.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>During the examination of Terry’s evidence, he revealed that he sits next to Ashley Cole, Frank  Lampard and Daniel Sturridge in the dressing room because of ‘superstition’.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>According to Terry’s admission, which brought laughter in the  London courtroom, the Chelsea players move places only if they lose.<br></span></p>

              <p><strong>The Chelsea football captain, <span style="color: #000000;">John Terry</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span> has been "seeking to provide a plausible story" to explain his racist outburst at Anton Ferdinand "ever since it happened", the prosecution at his trial has claimed.</strong></p>
              <p>Dismissing the 31-year-old centre-back's claim that he was merely repeating an accusation made by Ferdinand, prosecutor Duncan Penny said Terry was using "straightforward racial abuse" at Ferdinand, 27, a QPR defender.</p>
              <p>However, the defence QC, George Carter-Stephenson, urged that Terry, 31, be acquitted. This was not a case about racism and there was "an abundance of evidence" to prove that, he argued.</p>
              <p>Claims and counterclaims over the interpretation of words came during closing submissions to chief magistrate Howard Riddle as the trial neared its end. At one point Riddle referenced a French novelist to point out that the argument was about the use of everyday language: "We're not talking about Balzac."</p>
              <p>At another point, the defence claimed Terry may have misheard or misinterpreted what he thought Ferdinand had said as he made a fist pump gesture on the pitch, taunting Terry over an alleged affair with former team-mate Wayne Bridge's ex-girlfriend.</p>
              <p>Terry could have mistaken the word "Bridge" for "black", said Carter-Stephenson. Or even heard a voice in the Loftus Road crowd say "black" simultaneously with Ferdinand's lip movements.</p>
              <p>The former England captain denies a racially aggravated public order offence of calling Ferdinand a "fucking black cunt" during the Premier League derby at Loftus Road on 23 October 2011. He claims he simply repeated back the slur that he thought Ferdinand had used towards him.</p>
              <p>Penny claimed Terry had used the word "you", before the racial obscenity, and had also used the word "and" followed by another word obscured on video footage.</p>
              <p>He suggested Terry had said "and yours", in response to the taunt by Ferdinand as an abuse about Ferdinand's girlfriend.</p>
              <p>"If it's rhetorical repetition, why does the word 'and' feature at all? Why are there any other words spoken by Mr Terry at all, beyond 'a black cunt'?" asked Penny. Those words were Terry's and "nobody else's".</p>
              <p>Penny said it was unlikely, in the final minutes of the game, Ferdinand would have had "the motivation or frankly the sophistication" in the heat of the moment to make up the allegation that Terry had used racial abuse.</p>
              <p>He also asked what was in it for Ferdinand, who was a "reluctant" witness?</p>
              <p>"This case will follow him for the rest of his career. "You may wish to ask yourself the question, whether in truth he was brave to give evidence in this trial?" he told Riddle.</p>
              <p>But Carter-Stephenson urged the magistrate to treat Ferdinand's evidence with caution.</p>
              <p>The QPR player was "inconsistent and unreliable both on word and events".</p>
              <p>"No matter what the words actually were, if they were or may have been Mr Terry repeating back what he believed Mr Ferdinand had accused him of, then that's the end of this particular case."</p>
              <p>There was no evidence, from anyone other than Terry himself, as to what he had said.</p>
              <p>He dismissed claims Terry had snapped over Ferdinand's alleged goading.</p>
              <p>"Can it really be right that Mr Terry totally loses his cool, as suggested by the prosecution, in relation to a further taunt by Mr Ferdinand about shagging his team-mate's missus?"</p>
              <p>That was "inherently implausible" for a man who had 600 games behind him spanning 14 years of top-level football, and who had only been sent off four times, "never in relation to his language".</p>
              <p>It was "inconceivable to suggest that the taunt from Anton Ferdinand", which he had heard hundreds of times, and far worse, made him snap, Carter-Stephenson said.</p>
              <p>A verdict in the case is expected on Friday.</p>

              <p>The Chelsea captain, 31, was accused of calling the QPR centre-half a “f****** black c***” during a Premier League match on October 23 last year.</p>
              <p>He claimed he was sarcastically repeating a slur that Ferdinand mistakenly thought he had used, and denied a racially aggravated public order offence.</p>
              <p>Giving his verdict Mr Riddle said the case was not about “whether Mr Terry is a racist in the broadest sense of the word”.</p>
              <p>He said he had heard a great deal of evidence to show that he is not.</p>
              <p>He added: “It is understandable why Mr Terry wants to make this point, his reputation is at stake."</p>
              <p>Dan Morrison, Terry’s lawyer, said outside court: “The court has today acquitted John Terry of all charges.</p>
              <p>“He has consistently explained his position to the FA, the police and to the court.</p>
              <p>“He did not racially abuse Mr Ferdinand and the court has accepted this.</p>
              <p>“John would like to thank his legal team for their hard work and his family, friends and Chelsea Football Club for their support.”</p>

              <p>Relieved Terry left the dock immediately and walked out of the packed courtroom.</p>
              <p>Minutes later he headed straight through a crowd of photographers and reporters to a waiting cab without saying a word.</p>
              <p>It is thought he will fly off on holiday with his family before joining Chelsea teammates for pre-season training.</p>

              <p><strong>The Football Association will study the findings of the <span style="color: #000000;">John Terry</span><span style="color: #000000;"> court case before deciding whether to bring any charges against the </span><span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span><span style="color: #000000;"> captain.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Terry was cleared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday of racially abusing QPR's Anton Ferdinand and </span><span style="color: #000000;">the FA</span><span style="color: #000000;"> will now have to decide whether to open disciplinary proceedings under its rules. It is likely to be at least a week before a decision is made.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The FA can still bring charges even though Terry was found not guilty in court. Liverpool's Luis Suárez was banned by the FA last season for racially abusing Patrice Evra but that case never went to court.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">An FA spokesman said: "The FA notes the decision in the John Terry case and will now seek to conclude its own enquiries. The FA will make no further comment at this time."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The former Manchester United and Tottenham striker Garth Crooks, now a BBC presenter, has criticised the FA for not acting sooner.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Crooks told the Guardian</span><span style="color: #000000;">: </span>"The real problem in the Terry case began once the FA failed to take immediate action.</p>
              <p>"This lack of fibre by the governing body to act instantly when Terry gave them a statement after the verbal clash with Ferdinand, threw the entire procedure into chaos – forcing everyone associated with the game to either dive for cover or sit on the fence.</p>
              <p>"It may have appeared expedient to delay matters at the time but once the police appeared on the scene the FA lost control of the process and the dynamic dramatically changed."</p>
              <p>Crooks believes that Terry should still face action from the FA even though the Chelsea player's defence was that he was only repeating what he believed Ferdinand had accused him of saying.</p>
              <p>He added: "I believe it was wrong of him to say these words under any circumstances – and though Terry has been found not to have committed a criminal offence, the FA must now decide whether the former England captain should be charged for contravening its own rules.</p>
              <p>"If the FA don't act on the undisputed facts, and find Terry guilty of bringing the game into disrepute, a lot of good people are saying to me that there's no point in getting involved in the game at a senior level."</p>

              <p class="body "> </p>
              <p class="body "><strong>John Terry still faces FA charges and a potential lengthy ban despite being cleared of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">Terry’s five-day ordeal in the dock at Westminster Magistrates Court ended shortly after 2pm when chief magistrate Howard Riddle announced his verdict of “not guilty”.</p>
              <p class="body ">The Chelsea skipper walked free from court, without comment, having had his vehement denials of the allegations upheld by the court.</p>
              <p class="body ">Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck, who was in court throughout the trial, responded: “Chelsea FC notes and of course respects the decision of the Magistrate.</p>
              <p class="body ">“We are pleased that John can now put his mind to football and get back to training and doing what he has done for many years.”</p>
              <p class="body ">But Mr Riddle also stated in his written reasons for the verdict: “There is no doubt that John Terry uttered the words ‘f****** black c***’ at Anton Ferdinand. When he did so he was angry.”</p>
              <p class="body ">And those findings look likely to justify the Football Association launching the disciplinary proceedings that were put on hold in November when the Metropolitan Police began their official investigation into events at Loftus Road.</p>
              <p class="body "> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="body "><img class="captify" title="Flashpoint: Luis Surez exchanges words with Patrice Evra" src="http://www.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article847084.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/Luis+Surez+exchanges+words+with+Patrice+Evra" alt="Luis Surez exchanges words with Patrice Evra" width="615" height="409"></p>

              <div class="body "> </div>
              <p class="body "> </p>
              <p class="body "><strong>While Terry was cleared, Mr Riddle’s comments appear to have deemed the England defender liable to an FA charge under the same disciplinary rules that saw Liverpool’s Luis Suarez fined £40000 and banned for eight games for racially abusing Manchester United’s Patrice Evra.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">After a controversial hearing, a three-man FA regulatory commission, headed by Paul Goulding QC, found Suarez guilty of two breaches of FA Rule E3, first of using abusive or insulting words or behaviour towards Evra and secondly by “including a reference to the ethic origin, colour or race” of the French defender.</p>
              <p class="body ">Soon after yesterday’s verdict was handed down, the FA released a brief holding pattern statement which declared: “The FA notes the decision of the court. The FA will now seek to conclude its inquiries.”</p>
              <p class="body ">But while Mr Riddle noted that the prosecution had failed to make its case against Terry “beyond reasonable doubt”, FA tribunals have a far lower burden of proof, based on the “balance of probabilities”.</p>
              <p class="body "> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="body "><img class="captify" title="No comment: Anton Ferdinand" src="http://www.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article809636.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/Queen%27s+Park+Rangers%27+English+defender+Anton+Ferdinand+during+their+English+FA+Cup+3rd+round+replay+football+match+against+Milton+Keynes+Dons" alt="Queen's Park Rangers' English defender Anton Ferdinand during their English FA Cup 3rd round replay football match against Milton Keynes Dons" width="615" height="409"></p>

              <p class="body "> </p>
              <p class="body "><strong>The FA, which stripped Terry of the England captaincy pending the trial but allowed Roy Hodgson to select the defender in his Euro 2012 squad in Poland and Ukraine, knows it will come under pressure from anti-racism groups to prove its commitment to their cause.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">Ferdinand and his family also left without comment, former PFA chairman Garth Crooks said: “This saga is not over. John Terry is still under investigation by the FA based on what he admitted, saying those words. For John Terry this is only half-time. It’s not over.”</p>
              <p class="body ">Wembley legal officers were in court for the trial and will be able to access the new video evidence used by prosecutor Duncan Penny and which was not available to the FA before.</p>
              <p class="body ">FA disciplinary beaks will wait until the start of next week before deciding their next step and would have to prove that insulting language was used, with the racial adjective deemed an aggravating feature against Terry if a charge is laid.</p>
              <p class="body ">And while Terry left court with his reputation legally restored yesterday, it seems likely that he will have to face a similar battle in the FA courtroom in the next few months.</p>
