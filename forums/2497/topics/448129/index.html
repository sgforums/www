              <p><span><strong>Arsenal are closing in on the transfer of Germany striker Lukas Podolski, who has agreed terms to move to the Emirates.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span> revealed earlier this month that Arsenal were eager to rebuild, and bidding for Podolski and Germany midfielder and team-mate Mario Gotze is a good start. </span></p>
              <p><span>While Borussia Dortmund are in no mood to let 19-year-old rising star Gotze leave, Cologne are resigned to losing Podolski and believe he is bound for the Emirates in the summer. </span></p>
              <p><span>It is understood the 26-year old is happy with the terms on offer at Arsenal and a deal can go through at the end of the season, provided a fee can be agreed. </span></p>
              <p><span>Cologne are ready to dig their heels in and demand around £15million after being left unimpressed by Arsenal's valuation of £8m. </span></p>
              <p><span>The Bundesliga side are bracing themselves for some hard bargaining with their north London counterparts but sense Podolski will be spearheading Arsenal's attack next season. </span></p>
              <p><span>Some high-profile signings would help under-fire Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger stave off a growing rebellion among supporters and dispel any misgivings Van Persie may have about committing himself to the club beyond a contract that runs out at the end of next season. </span></p>
              <p><span>Polish-born Podolski is in his second spell at Cologne, after a three-year stay at Bayern Munich, and has impressed on the international stage.</span></p>
              <p><span>The Gunners are also plotting a move for Blackburn midfielder Steven Nzonzi. </span></p>
              <p><span>The former France Under 21 midfielder has been a rare bright spot in a woeful season for Rovers.</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Lukas Podolski will become an Arsenal player at the end of the season after Cologne accepted a £10.9million bid for the Germany striker.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>revealed last week that Podolski had agreed personal terms with Arsenal and that the only obstacle to a deal going through was the clubs’ respective valuation of the 26-year-old.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">An initial near-£18million asking price was dismissed as prohibitive by Arsenal, who began the bidding at around £8million. With Podolski underlining his eagerness to spearhead Arsene Wenger’s attack by quickly settling on personal terms, however, the Gunners came back with an improved offer that was reluctantly accepted by the Bundesliga club.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Podolski is now due at Emirates Stadium once the Bundesliga season ends and will sign a four-year deal worth over £100,000 a week.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Cologne manager Stale Solbakken reacted to Sportsmail’s account of Podolski’s imminent departure by admitting he feared he would lose his prize asset this summer.<br></span></p>
              <div id="ext-gen7734" class="moduleHalf"> 
              <div class="sport item"><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ArsenalMail"></a><span style="font-size: small;">The air of resignation at Cologne increased after Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker admitted on German television on Wednesday that he had been quizzed by his international team-mate about life at the club.<br></span></div>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">‘He has been very interested for the past few weeks,’ said the Arsenal centre-back. ‘He has sent me a number of text messages, and I have told him this is a great place to work and Arsenal are an amazing club.’<br></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>reported last month that Arsenal were eager to convince Robin Van Persie of their ambitions by bidding for Podolski and his Germany team-mate Mario Goetze.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">While Borussia Dortmund are in no mood to let rising star Goetze leave without a fight, Cologne quickly realised they had little hope of keeping Podolski, in the wake of Arsenal’s approach.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/03/07/article-2111619-0DDF8B1200000578-948_468x305.jpg" alt="German connection: Mertesacker hopes to be playing alongside some of his compatriots next term at the Emirates" width="468" height="305">

              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Wenger followed up his interest after Podolski impressed Arsenal chief scout Steve Rowley with a consistent run of form that has brought him 16 Bundesliga goals this season.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Wenger has been under mounting pressure to make the calibre of signings needed to dispel any misgivings Van Persie may harbour about committing himself to the club beyond a contract that runs out at the end of next season.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Polish-born Podolski is in his second spell at Cologne, after having mixed fortunes during a three-year stay at Bayern Munich, but has done enough on the international stage to leave Wenger in no doubt about his pedigree.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Wenger has also been encouraged to pursue a long-standing interest in the left-sided frontrunner by a firm belief that he has the pace and physical strength to thrive in the Barclays Premier League.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Cologne striker </strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Lukas Podolski</span></strong><strong> has brushed aside speculation that a €13 million [£10.9m] move has been agreed with Premier League club Arsenal.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Podolski has been strongly linked with a move to the Emirates this summer as Cologne, who are currently 14th in the Bundesliga, continue their relegation battle. The German international, though, insists an agreement has not yet been reached between the two clubs despite widespread reports he is due to team up with Arsene Wenger's side.</p>
              <p>"Contrary to reports from the past few days, nothing has been decided yet," Podolski told German <em>Sky Sports</em>. "If there is something to report, then I'll do it."</p>
              <p>The 26-year-old's comments were supported by former Cologne sporting director Volker Finke, who hinted that talks had taken place over Podolski's future but that a final decision had not yet been made at the RheinEnergieStadion.</p>
              <p>"The final die is not yet cast," said Finke. "It's part of the business and so it is generally agreed that only when the die is cast and everything is signed - when it comes to a transfer, as it is being discussed in the newspapers - only then can the parties involved make comments. It is still not settled and therefore we have no comment."</p>
              <p>Finke left the club by mutual consent after Saturday's 1-0 victory over Hertha Berlin. Podolski, meanwhile, is facing the possiblility of a three-match ban after being shown a red card in Cologne's win.</p>
