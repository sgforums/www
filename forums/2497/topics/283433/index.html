"Last season I played 35 games and this campaign I haven't made one appearance.<br><br>"I don't think I have anything to prove. I have made 100 appearances for my national team. The fact that I'm not playing is not good for me and I've decided to leave Milan in January."<br><br>Simic joined the European champions from city rivals Inter Milan in the summer of 2002 and is Croatia's most capped player.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haha omgukilledkenny where u get your source one..<br><br>according to Milan website:<br><br>MILANELLO - Before the last training ahead of the departure for Palermo, Dario Simic talked about his personal moment and the team's form to Milan Channel. Here's what he said.<br><br>'I had some problems to my throat, but now I'm doing fine, I'm training normally, and I'm waiting for my chance. I hope that it will be my turn soon, because I feel like I'm at the peak of my strength. It's never easy to wait for your moment without playing, but it's part of this job. I look ahead, I train and think only about doing well.'<br><br>'Against Palermo for us it's an important game. We go there looking for points. Even though we drew three consecutive games against Fiorentina, Siena, and Parma, and we are not in a good position in the league, we know this competition is still very long, there's a lot of time to recover. We can still do great things."<br><br>'We have to think about last season, when we were in a much worse position than now, but we stuck together, we never gave up and ultimately lifted the Champions League. We have to do the same now, never give up. We are a strong, united group, which can win something important this season as well.'<br><br>'When necessary, this team is able to show character, especially in games where the difference with the opponent is small. That's what happens in the Champions League, where after the group stages everything is decided in two-legged ties.'</div>
