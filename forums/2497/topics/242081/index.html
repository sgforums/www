            <div class='col-md body'>Henrik Larsson has reiterated for the umpteenth time his intention to honour his agreement with Helsingborgs and return to Sweden next week.<br><br>The classy Swede has seemingly made his final competitive appearance for Manchester United, in Saturday's FA Cup draw with Middlesbrough, but his swansong will be a farewell game against a European select XI in Tuesday's charity game at Old Trafford.<br><br>Larsson's fine form, when coupled with United's congested treatment room, has led many to speculate that he would extend his stay until the season's conclusion, with Sir Alex Ferguson's side still gunning for a treble.<br><br>However, despite the pleas of Ferguson, his team-mates and supporters alike, Larsson has no desire for a prolonged stay in Manchester.<br><br>"I had a chat with Sir Alex but nothing would tempt me to change my mind about leaving," said Larsson.<br><br>"It is a little bit sad but I knew when I signed this would be my last game.<br><br>"It has been a pleasure to be here and I will follow this team every step of the way now, keeping my fingers crossed that everything goes well.<br><br>"Nobody knew what the situation would be when I left. United initially signed me to cover some injuries they had at the time.<br><br>"It is unfortunate Louis (Saha) got injured and Ole (Solskjaer) has had a minor operation on his knee. I know it is not good timing for me to leave now but that was the time period of the contract. These things happen.<br><br>"There is a little break coming up, which will help them, and I am confident they have enough to cope."<br><br>Such has been the impression Larsson has made on Ferguson, the Scottish tactician has intimated that he believes the prolific striker, despite his ageing limbs, could still do a job in the Premiership next season.<br><br>Again, this observation is not one shared by Larsson: "This is it.<br><br>"I am not 25 anymore. I am 36 this year so it [returning] is not going to happen."</div>
