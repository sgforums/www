              <p>Sunderland have completed the signing of Hull City defender Michael Turner on a four-year deal, for an undisclosed fee.</p>

              <p class="photoDesc">Michael Turner: Has joined Black Cats</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>The
              25-year-old, who enjoyed a brilliant first season in the Premier League
              which saw him linked with an England call-up and a move to Liverpool,
              had a £12m price tag slapped on his head by the Tigers earlier this
              month.</p>
              <p>Delighted Black Cats manager Steve Bruce said: "I believe
              that Michael is one of the country's
              premier central defenders. I have been looking to add size and strength
              to the back line and Michael fits the bill perfectly in that respect,
              as well as being an excellent technical footballer.</p>
              <p>"His
              aerial ability provides us with another dimension at set-pieces at
              either end of the field, and I am delighted that he has chosen to buy
              into what we are trying to achieve here at Sunderland.</p>
              <p>"He has
              developed immeasurably as a player whilst with Hull - I am extremely
              confident he will continue that progress with Sunderland and go on to
              be a big success.''</p>
              <p>The news of Turner's sale has already caused
              great concern to Hull fans who feel his departure will make it much
              harder for them to stay in the top flight for a third season. But Hull
              are already believed to be in advanced talks to sign a replacement, in
              addition to Paul McShane who moved to the KC from Sunderland on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Turner
              played every single minute of the club's Premier League programme last
              season. He made 146 appearances for the Tigers and was voted player of
              the year at the club in each of the last two seasons.</p>
              <p>But the
              centre-back believes working under former Manchester United defender
              Bruce at the Stadium of Light can bring on his game.</p>
              <p>"A lot of
              things attracted me to Sunderland - the facilities, the stadium, the
              training ground, the fan base," Turner told his new club's official
              website. "But a big factor was the manager. Steve Bruce is a proven
              manager who played in my position as a player, and hopefully he can add
              to my game.''</p>
              <p>Sunderland have six points from their opening four
              matches this season, and Turner is certain the team is going to keep
              improving.</p>
              <p>"It's a great time to be here,'' he said. "The
              signings which have already been made show Sunderland want to move in
              the right direction and I want to be a part of that.''</p>
              <p>Turner
              cost Hull just £300,000 when he was signed from Brentford three years
              ago and after the draw with Wolves at the weekend boss Phil Brown said
              bids were "getting towards a ridiculous valuation''.</p>
              <p>The defender becomes Bruce's seventh summer signing after Darren Bent, Lee Cattermole, Fraizer Campbell, Lorik Cana, Paulo da Silva and loanee John Mensah.</p>
