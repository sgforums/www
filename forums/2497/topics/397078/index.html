              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">DIMITAR BERBATOV could end his Manchester United hell this 
              summer - with AC Milan planning a £20million bid.</h2>
              <p class="article">The
               Sun revealed last week that Old Trafford boss Alex Ferguson has lost 
              faith in the Bulgarian hitman and is ready to offload him.</p>
              <p class="article">Fergie accepts he must take a loss on Berbatov, 29, who 
              cost £30.75m but has scored just 12 goals this season, and will be 
              tempted if Milan move in.</p>
              <p class="article">An AC Milan insider 
              said: "No contact has been made yet but we admire Berbatov.</p>
              <p class="article">"He is a strong player who would do very well in Italy. 
              Whether something can be arranged remains to be seen. It has been 
              difficult for Berbatov in Manchester but he is a good player who has a 
              lot to offer."</p>
              <p class="article">Serbian winger <strong>ZORAN TOSIC</strong>, 
              who cost United £10m last year, wants to turn his loan spell at Cologne 
              into a permanent move.</p>

              <p>I think Huntelaar cannot make it outside Holland.</p>
              <p>Just like Mateja Kezman (3 times top scorer in Eredivisie a.k.a the highest football league in the Netherlands in 200-2001 with 24 goals, 2002-03 with 35 goals and 2003-04 with 31 goals), Dirk Kuyt (2004-05 with 29 goals) &amp; Afonso Alves (2006-07 with 34 goals), they all have one thing in common - failure outside Holland.</p>
              <p>Mateja Kezman and Arjen Robben forged a successful partnership at PSV, prompting the nickname "Batman and Robin". Chelsea thought they could emulate the success, bought Kezman at £5.3 million (WTF? I think the other top clubs must have smell some rat when a supposed top class goal poacher with a pedigree of achieving top scorer in 3 seasons cost a mere £5.3 million) but Kezman failed terribly, scoring just 4 times in 25 games (started in 14 games) in his only season in England.</p>
              <p>Dirk Kuyt was supposed to be a targetman, mis-managed by Rafa and was deployed on the wings. 36 goals in 134 matches for Liverpool - Not exactly a top class striker Liverpool was looking for.</p>
              <p>Alfonso Alves is a joke.The most successful spell of his career was spent playing for
              Heerenveen in the Dutch league where his goal-to-game ratio was better
              than a goal a game (45 goals in 39 matches). This precipitated a club record move to English club Middlesbrough, thought to be around £12.7m. He scored 10 goals in 42 matches for Boro and the team was relegated. Alves moved to Al-Sadd, a Qatari Club, on a three-year deal for £7 million and is now on loan to Qatari giant and seven-time league champion Al-Rayyan.</p>
              <p>I always thought highly of Huntelaar. Young, strong, captain calibre and always have a keen eye for goal with a good record of 76 goals in 92 matches for Ajax. He was signed by Madrid in a deal worth €20 million,<sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaas-Jan_Huntelaar#cite_note-52"></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaas-Jan_Huntelaar#cite_note-53"></a></sup>potentially rising to €27 million. Huntelaar went on to score eight goals in 20 appearances (13 starts and 7 sub appearances) in just half a season at Real Madrid. Just 7 months later, he transferred to Serie A club A.C. Milan for €15 million, played 21 matches as of now and score 7 times.</p>
              <p>Unless Milan is willing to throw in Alberto Palochi + Huntelaar for Berba. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              supposed top class goal poacher with a pedigree of achieving top
              scorer in 3 seasons cost a mere Â£5.3 million) but Kezman failed
              terribly, scoring just 4 times in 25 games (started in 14 games) in
              his only season in England.</p>
              <p>Dirk Kuyt was supposed to be a targetman, mis-managed by Rafa
              and was deployed on the wings. 36 goals in 134 matches for
              Liverpool - Not exactly a top class striker Liverpool was looking
              for.</p>
              <p>Alfonso Alves is a joke.The most successful spell of his career
              was spent playing for Heerenveen in the Dutch league where his
              goal-to-game ratio was better than a goal a game (45 goals in 39
              matches). This precipitated a club record move to English club
              Middlesbrough, thought to be around Â£12.7m. He scored 10 goals in
              42 matches for Boro and the team was relegated. Alves moved to
              Al-Sadd, a Qatari Club, on a three-year deal for Â£7 million
              and is now on loan to Qatari giant and seven-time league champion
              Al-Rayyan.</p>
              <p>I always thought highly of Huntelaar. Young, strong, captain
              calibre and always have a keen eye for goal with a good record of
              76 goals in 92 matches for Ajax. He was signed by Madrid in a deal
              worth â‚¬20 million,<sup class=""><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaas-Jan_Huntelaar#cite_note-52" rel="nofollow"></a></sup><sup class=""><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaas-Jan_Huntelaar#cite_note-53" rel="nofollow"></a></sup>potentially rising to â‚¬27 million.
              Huntelaar went on to score eight goals in 20 appearances (13 starts
              and 7 sub appearances) in just half a season at Real Madrid. Just 7
              months later, he transferred to Serie A club A.C. Milan for â‚¬15
              million, played 21 matches as of now and score 7 times.</p>
              <p>Unless Milan is willing to throw in Alberto Palochi + Huntelaar
              for Berba. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              Thanks for sharing the nice bit of info/stats about strikers who rose to fame in the dutch league but failed outside of it. These are 3 very classic examples, but 1 exception immediately came to my mind: Ruud Van Nistelrooy. This man is bound for success everywhere he goes, at least in terms of his strike rate.

              As for Barbytov, yes please do sell him at a good price. He has already proven that he cannot reproduce his Tottenham form at OT. The transfer from Tottenham to MU was a lose-lose situation for both clubs, with the former almost got sucked into relegation battle in the season which he was offloaded.
              
              Having said that, manU better start shortlisting a suitable candidate as first choice strike partner for rooney before selling.

              <p>perhaps the pressure to outshine weighs heavily on berbatov. At spurs, he's the star man easily and he wasn't bought for a hefty price like 30m.</p>
              <p>Perhaps his languid style of play doesnt suit man u. Or perhaps he doesnt work as hard during training.

              <p>i do admire his skills, as per like Cantona, Zola, and etc. but on the pitch, his attitude sucks. He is whinning n going after his team mates. A good general will perk up the team and move them forward, but he seems to complain too much.</p>
