              <p>Despite playing regularly for Jose Mourinho’s Real Madrid, Karim Benzema has struggled for form this season and has been linked with a move away in the summer to either Aston Villa or Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Benzema was unable to leave the Bernabau in January after Real Madrid’s injury crisis left the young French forward as the club's only recognised fit striker at the club.</p>
              <p>After Madrid signed Manchester City’s Emmanuel Adebayor to ease their striker crisis it is thought that the club were willing to let the former Lyon forward leave, only for time constraints to stop Liverpool from pushing the deal through.</p>
              <p>Although Liverpool were able to sign Andy Carroll and Luis Suarez on deadline day, it is thought the club are still likely to renew their interest in Benzema as the club's new owner, John W. Henry, is keen to see the Merseyside club once again challenging for top honours.</p>

              <p>If he goes to Liverpool I don't think he is going to play though, Atleast clubs like OM does have a chance of winning the ligue 1 title. Given Suarez plays every match, he has no chance of starting.</p>

              <p><br>Not proven lah...shearer was one of the good prospect at that time...if a player has a quality, i don't think their duration of play in top flight is not that important at all. There are so many so called world class flop as well in PL (Schevchenko, Veron, Morientes, to  name a few).  </p>
              <p>Andy Carroll has proven himself in the short 6 months..I am not justifying his transfer fee, I also think that 35m is abit too much for him but I do think people should give him time to prove his worth. Funny cos I see alot of people have written him off as a flop even before he starts for Liverpool?</p>

              <p><br>Not underestimating him my friend... Just saying they overpaid cos it was in the last few days of the Jan window and they allowed themselves to be taken advantage of... I think they might have got him for lesser in Jun...</p>
              <p>Again, I am not saying he is a poor player... Just a smarter move could see Pool got him a little cheaper... Just like it's being reported Fergie wanted A Young in Jan too but Villa wasn't selling or the price they are asking might be too high at the moment... So Fergie give up for now but come Jun, it may be different...</p>
              <p>And in your opinion, is A Young any worse or less valuable a player to Carroll? I don't think so... And his experienced in the premier league over the years seems to suggest he is a better bet than Carroll's 6 months only. Again, not saying Carroll is a poor player. But I think you understand what I'm getting at by now...</p>

              <p><br>On hindsight, I think Pool should have taken Daniel Sturridge + cash when Chelsea was offering... Now Sturridge has gone to Bolton on loan and suddenly score 3 in 3 matches and definitely his valued has gone up...</p>

              <p><br> Not proven lah...shearer was one of the good prospect at that
              time...if a player has a quality, i don't think their duration
              of play in top flight is not that important at all. There are so
              many so called world class flop as well in PL
              (Schevchenko, Veron, Morientes, to  name a few).  </p>
              <p>Andy Carroll has proven himself in the short 6 months..I am not
              justifying his transfer fee, I also think that 35m is abit too much
              for him but I do think people should give him time to prove his
              worth. Funny cos I see alot of people have written him off as
              a flop even before he starts for Liverpool?</p>

              <p>not saying he's a flop but he's clearly massively overrated.....the likes of elmander, davies and santa cruz could do the same job as him for much less, he could be another james beattie....</p>
