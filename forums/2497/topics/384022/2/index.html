              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I found your piece very interesting... Especially your last paragraph.</p>
              <p>I have always said and feel that many newer pool fans like those under 35 or 30, really don't understand what actually is happening... But unfortunately, over the years... They were program to hate the Sun but for whatever reason, they themselves don't even really know but only to refer to this article...</p>
              <p>This is not a healthy or a right way of things i feel. And again, I can't emphasize enough that I am not saying it did or it didn't happen like I have already mentioned in my 2nd post in this thread... All I am saying is, it has been 2 decades, 20 years have passed... Let it go... Younger Pool fans should not be program to hate just because they wish to love the club... What happened was a long time ago already...</p>
              <p>We sit here today 20 yrs on not really knowing what actually did or didn't take place. There is no right or wrong now... The editor of that day still insist and stand by it till this day. True that he did apologised but later came out to made it clear that the newspaper owner ordered him to do so... And all I did wrong was tell the truth...</p>
              <p>Pool fans on the other hand, during those days must have been hurt very badly cos of this incident... Lives were lost because of it, some families had members in there... Sometimes, when people are hurt, they find someone or something else to vent their anger on... The Sun was probably there at the wrong place and the wrong time... Cos, even if the story was indeed true (I believed other Press did report on it too only without using the words "The Truth"), people will still not want to belief something so despicable could take place within their own... But we have seen in times of chaos, unthinkable things do happen... Take Hurricane Katrina for instance... When the Hurricane started, looting and violence became a common event... Reports of carjacking, thefts, rapes and murders also took place... Troops were call in with orders of shoot and kill by the governor... Why we might ask? Cos in a chaos state, some people may take advantage of the opportunity to enrich themselves one way or another... Like the strong taking advantage of the weak. Not everyone is going to be a saint...</p>
              <p>To be honest, it is not totally unimaginable it could happen... English football as I understand from many older folks during the mid 80s till earlier 90s were very problematic... Drinking and fighting wasn't unthinkable during a match... Lots of fans got drunk at football matches. And also the then Liverpool fans were the reason English clubs were ban from Europe for many years and causing standards to drop too... It was mainly an English problem and not just a Liverpool problem... Even England's national team fans were problematic when they went away. It was famous that the English and the Dutch had the most notorious fans during those days.</p>
              <p>But whatever it is, the point I find really unfortunately is... Why does most of the younger Pool fans need to hate the Sun in order to be accepted as a Pool fan? What reasons do you have against it? Have they done something bad to you personally or to your family? Times have gone by, the people in charge are no longer the ones 20 yrs ago... They should grow up not hating... because they are probably equally clueless as me and many others of our generation...</p>
              <p>Lastly, like I have said at the start of this post. I found your post very interesting compare to all the other pool fans... I believed your stand is not much difference from the others under 30s pool fans as well. But yours is the first time I came across a Liverpool fan who confess to not feeling anything of hating anyone during that time... But then grew up program to hate... A rather sad way to love or show loyally to a club i would say... But you are not the only one out there. I believed there are a lot more just like yourself, just that no one said it as clear as you or willing to admit it... They rather call it trash or something else... But subconscious, many Pool fans are program to hate it in order to show their love for the club... But choose not to see the pros from the cons that it brings.</p>
              <p>Perhaps one day i might meet a more open-minder Pool fan who is objective enough not to hate something in order to love the club... Does the Japs still hate the Americans? Well, they did bomb them with the most powerful weapon on earth and killing a lot more people... But it seems the japs are more forgiving to the american afterall as they are great friends today... What is Hillsborough 1989 compare to Hiroshima... Honestly, my frank opinion... Nothing...</p>

              <p>firstly, (all) liverpool fans don't hate the sun...regardless of the club one supports, it's just that the sun is a tabloid that is not taken seriously, or shouldn't be taken seriously for the most part. but that does not equate hate.</p>

              <p>As I said, you would never understand my love and my family's love for Liverpool. It was more than a football club. To me, whenever there was a Liverpool match, that was the only time I could spend time with my late father. Since young, my Dad was'nt that kind who will spend time with us children on our homework, on playing, it was all my mum. But once there was a Liverpool match, I knew I could have my father sitting there with me for the next 90 minutes. ANd so I became a Liverpool fan probably not because I understood what football was but probably I knew it allowed me to spend time with my father. ANd as time grew, Liverpool became more than just a football club. It meant family time. It became the bond where my father and I could spend time together. And as I grew up, when I started working, we spent even lesser time together. But still, everytime there is a Liverpool match, I would be there at the Living room on the sofa and he would quietly sit behind on the rocking chair behind me and that is how we spend time together. He is gone now and for you to say that my passion for Liverpool is questionable just because I was not there at the incident, I found that insulting and maybe you did not mean it that way and because to you, that is a football club, but for me, it was a love me and my late Father shared. Apologies for ranting.</p>

              <p>Your love and your family's love of the club is commendable... And I found your story very touching and rather special unlike many others... But nowhere in my post have I questioned your love and loyally to it... I made a point in general of some younger pool fans not that they love the club any lesser... And I said you are the first one I have came across who dares to admit or confess of not hating for the sake of loving the club, which I found to be a very good and healthy way and nothing more... How you came to conceive it that I questioned your passion baffle me... All I questioned was, why do you see the need to hate/dislike as you grew up?</p>
              <p>I just feel we should try to stay more objectively thats all... What happened was a long time ago already, not for our generation or that of future generations to carry the burden... Love the club by all means do so openly and healthily... Don't carry the burden of yesteryears on your shoulder, and also try to discourage the younger ones of having to do so too. Love the club for it is and not what it must be...</p>
              <p>But nevertheless, I must say if somewhere within my post you found it to be offending towards you personally, my apologies... It was never my intention. I just say it as I feel towards each individual story and nothing more... Its like what you said earlier stating my opinions and him stating his. I guess its just as simple as that...</p>

              <p>Firstly, since when did I used the word ALL?</p>
              <p>And have you check what has been going on these last 20 years? Or have you been under a rock during this whole period? Go and do a simple check up and there are many Pool sites that still wish to pick on a newspaper...</p>
              <p>Do you see Arsenal, Chelsea or any other clubs doing so? Sponsors are not allow to advertised with it, players are not to be seen giving interviews to them...</p>
              <p>Research have been done and they are the best selling newspaper in UK and have the 2nd highest circulation of any English language newspaper in the world but apparently not in Liverpool... hmmm...</p>
              <p>And precisely, the magnitude is far more greater and yet they are more forgiving...</p>

              <p>For those who only thinks that the Sun is all about its page 3, then I guess you all have very little knowledge of its other stuff... lol.</p>
              <p>For those who are not aware... It has been a regular winner of the British Press Awards over the years... It has done many charity events as well even the famous Band Aid ones where it got all those rockers to come together for Africa. It was they who got Bob Geldof into it to get everything started again...</p>
              <p>They even raised millions for injured British servicemen and women during the war...</p>
              <p>They have campaign for free books at schools for children who were unable to afford... They got 3.5m books worth about $20 million into 98 percent of UK schools... Books written and produced by The Sun were also endorsed by the Government for use in UK schools.</p>
              <p>As I have said earlier, it has its pros and cons. But when the pros outweigh the cons... It's definitely much better to have them around. Cos when politicians or the powerful becomes "dirty" it is up to these organisations to bring justice and order back for the weak common man by exposing them... When perceived role models show poor judgement or bad habits, they are also made to answer and apologise, and people will realised not to continue to take them as good role models in future. When high ranking government members make serious mistakes, pressure are place onto them to step down and they normally do in these countries. Good investigative Press are needed for all these to come together... Cos no one in their right mind from the official establishments are ever going to give you this reports.</p>
              <p>You don't become the highest circulated newspaper in the whole of UK and have the 2nd highest circulation of any English language newspaper in the world by dishing out rubbish most of the time. Of course lots of serious stuff and news breaking ones are also part of its content. If naked women is all you think it sells, then you are dead wrong about this... Its just one page, and in today's internet savvy society... its really nothing where printed naked pictures have been easily available in Europe for more than 30 years... I think it's more like just a handphone add to the readers over there these days as we see here in our local newspapers. Its not taken very seriously. Its really not a big deal unless for those who have not came across it before makes it out to be the world...lol. Over there, it has been around for like 30 to 40 years I believed... Even our Hp adds haven't been around for that long...lol. </p>
              <p>Research done on their readership shows that an almost equal amount of women reads them too. A percentage of 56% male to 44% female. So I don't think the majority of women are too bother with its page 3 ladies either having grown up being used to them everyday. I think they find it's something not noteworthy unless you are the occasional tourist or a student from Asia... lol.</p>
              <p>Sensationalising alone doesn't necessary mean you will sell more newspapers... There must be more to it than that. Our very own experienced with the New Paper is probably the best example... It's the most sensationalised English press in Sg but are its sales doing better than The Straits Times? A simple No.</p>
              <p>For those who wish to continue to make the Sun as negative as they can, I tell you honestly, you can really don't need to do so... Cos they and its others will just continue everyday even with your constant barking...</p>
              <p>We can be dis-interested by it, we can choose to be indifferent to it, or we can simply don't even be bother with it... To be frank, I don't feel much for it as well, I can accept it has its good and it's bad... It can disappear the next day and it's still fine with me. I will just move on to the many others available thats all. But while its still around, I also belief it deserved a fair judgement to its work done over the years.</p>
              <p>A feeling of thought just came to me... It just seems ironic that most of those who claim it is rubbish or something bad, or negative... are mostly pool fans I notice. I can see from the first page of this thread and also notice in others threads and forums, that it's mostly the Pool fans that have the biggest negativity to it. Others don't really care. They read without having too much emotions lace into it... They take it at face value only and accept that it is good and bad at times...</p>
              <p>Therefore, I said Pool fans should try to forget 1989 altogether... I believed some have already. Although some will choose to continue to live in denial and claim its not that episode that forms their opinion in the first place. But subconsciously, it is... Otherwise, they wouldn't feel so strongly to it till now... I notice always when there is an issue about the Sun (not the one up there), you can be sure a few pool fans will come around... Its like bees to honey... strange. </p>
              <p>I say they can choose to be indifferent to it like they have been to many other not important issues... Hopefully they can or we can see others young pool fan wannabe being indifferent to all right now... But might very well go the same way as those a generation earlier... Like forming to hate or dislike it for the sake of being a "true pool fan". But deep down, they probably don't even know why but guess its the right thing to do in order to be a better fan. Like I have said earlier, it was a long time ago. Don't let the new and younger fans carry the burden of yesteryears with them... You can be a good and true fan without the prejudiced or the animosity towards the Sun... Just be a fan who loves the club for it is...</p>

              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>zocoss</strong>: Personally I find the Sun a very good investigative newspaper...</span></em></p>
              <p>this is what you written above that is mind-boggling, even borders on moronic. it has got nothing to do with the circulation of the sun, readership mix, etc.</p>
              <p>the sun, when sold to media mogul rupert murdoch, took a deliberate decision to position itself as a trashy, irreverent downmarket tabloid that centers its content around frivolous headline, sex, sports and entertainment to capture the working class readership in britain. that it attracts women readership doesn't mean that the sun is a paper that can be taken seriously. the only section that some thought the sun took its reporting seriously is politics, but even that there are detractors that maintains that the sun just `go with the flow' on its political stand.</p>
              <p>sure, it may have mooted the band aid idea as wiki claims, but it doesn't make the sun any better in terms of investigative journalism (whatever that means).</p>
              <p>....i am inclined to go on &amp;on but obviously it is OT. you may enjoy the sun's irreverent headlines and scoups, interesting articles and the occasional nipple, but investigative paper it is not.</p>

              really care. They read without having too much emotions

              <p>I say they can choose to be indifferent to it

              <p>the sun, when sold to media mogul rupert murdoch, took a deliberate decision to position itself as a trashy, irreverent downmarket tabloid that centers its content around frivolous headline, sex, sports and entertainment to capture the working class readership in britain. that it attracts women readership doesn't mean that the sun is a paper that can be taken seriously. the only section that some thought the sun took its reporting seriously is politics, but even that there are detractors that maintains that the sun just `go with the flow' on its political stand.</p>
              <p>sure, it may have mooted the band aid idea as wiki claims, but it doesn't make the sun any better in terms of investigative journalism (whatever that means).</p>
              <p>....i am inclined to go on &amp;on but obviously it is OT. you may enjoy the sun's irreverent headlines and scoups, interesting articles and the occasional nipple, but investigative paper it is not.</p>

              <p>Really it mind boggling to you… Well I guess the population of Britain isn’t… lol.</p>
              <p>Let’s see… The reason people buy and continue to buy is not because it’s boring or it continuously provides old news to the public… Would you buy a newspaper like that?Well, I know I wouldn’t, just not sure with you…</p>
              <p>The Sun, as I have said earlier, have a very impressive mixture of male and female readers. And its not just coincidental that circulation increased over the years if it had no substance. Would you buy a newspaper that provides only fiction and un-reliable stuff over 30 years? Come on… wake up and smell your coffee and be truthful to us!</p>
              <p>Like I did say earlier, it has its pros and its cons. There are many avenues for the folks to get their sex and entertainment fix… Like magazines, television, cable networks and the internet definitely gives you much, much more… and probably a lot faster and more latest compare to what the Press can ever provide due to the time taken to print, publish and circulate.</p>

              <p>It had provided lots of cover stories and headline news over the years to get to where it is… The British public trust it enough to make it the most circulated newspaper in the land by a big margin. (I have attached 2 pics for your kind viewing above). They have even been awarded by the British Press Awards for articles on their papers. From Reporter of the Year to Front Page of the Year to Scoop of the Year and Photographer of the Year and even Sports Reporter of the Year…</p>
              <p>Your `go with the flow' on its political stand? Lol. Are you serious about this? It sounds even more ridiculous… It doesn’t just go with the flow as you claim… It has its own political stand on parties and policies and even on choice of individual members on party leadership… It’s very much independent and supports who it feels are more to its own agendas and ideals.</p>
              <p>Tony Blair knew the influence of it and the impact it would have on its readers. So he went out of his way to court it for some time by granting exclusive interviews and writing columns way before his party won and him elected PM…</p>
              <p>Despite their support for Blair over the years, they are no just "go with the flow" organization… Due to their difference of ideals with Blair’s successor, they have now openly thrown their support behind the Conservatives. Are the Conservatives in power today? So are they still going with the flow?</p>
              <p>And to frivolously disregard the effort of ones honest hard work on charities just for an argument purpose is so childish… It’s there for everyone to see, no need to say who claims… It’s a fact. At least you are aware I didn’t just pluck it out of the sky like some people do…</p>
              <p>So you concede its reporting in politics is serious?… But wouldn’t this be a direct contradiction to a trashy, irreverent tabloid? Hmmm...</p>
              <p>Finally, now I understand where all this is coming from… You simply don’t understand the term of investigative Press correct? "investigative journalism (whatever that means)." My goodness, you should have asked earlier then everything would have been so much easier…</p>
              <p>Ok… To save me a few minutes trying to explain to you, I will just spend a few seconds and paste this for you to get a better understanding of the term… Hope it helps.</p>
