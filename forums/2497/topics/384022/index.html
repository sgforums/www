              <div class="KonaBody"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Liverpool</span></span> winger <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ryan Babel</span></span> has angrily brushed off tabloid reports that there have been dressing-room problems at Anfield, by insisting that he would never give an interview to <em>The Sun</em>.<br><br>Babel asserted that the quotes attributed to him were badly translated excerpts from an interview he gave in Holland, and that there are no problems between him and his club team-mates.<br><br>"I was very disappointed when it came out because I never gave an interview here in England - I never gave an interview to <em>The Sun</em>," Babel told his club's official website.</div>
              <p class="KonaBody"> </p>
              <p class="KonaBody">"I did give an interview in Holland a month ago when I was with the national team, and I think they took some bits out of it and added some of their own opinions.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody"> </p>
              <p class="KonaBody">"They wrote that I'd talked about other players - and I would never talk about players like that.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody"> </p>
              <p class="KonaBody">"The funniest thing was them publishing that I'm not friends with</p>
              <p class="KonaBody">Dirk Kuyt. Come on! Dirk will tell you how our relationship is.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody"> </p>
              <p class="KonaBody">"It has to be made clear. Who published this? <em>The Sun</em> - I wouldn't talk to <em>The Sun</em>.</p>
              <div class="KonaBody">"I am very happy that the boss made it clear straight away that he had confidence in me and believed that I didn't do the interview.</div>
              <p class="KonaBody"> </p>
              <p class="KonaBody">"I hope people understand. It is easy to read papers and believe it's true, and so I was disappointed with the situation and the fact it was published on the day of a very important game.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody"> </p>
              <p class="KonaBody">"I have spoken to a few of my team-mates and they were clear that it was <em>The Sun</em> and so it was nothing."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="KonaBody">Babel also affirmed his desire to battle for a regular starting spot with Liverpool as he looks to seal a place in the Netherlands squad for next summer's World Cup in South Africa.<br><br>"I have given a lot of interviews about my feelings and how I am but the situation is the same for every player who likes to play games and thinks he is good enough to start," he added.</div>
              <p class="KonaBody"> </p>
              <p class="KonaBody">"I feel confident that I'm good enough to play a lot of games for Liverpool. I keep saying this. Hopefully I'll get chances to show this.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody"> </p>
              <p class="KonaBody">"I was disappointed with the injury (against Man City) because I'd been given another start and had to leave the pitch after 20 minutes.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody"> </p>
              <p class="KonaBody">"I have to keep working hard and I'm not at the point yet where I've shown what I can do.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody"> </p>
              <p class="KonaBody">"For every player it's nice to go to the World Cup and it's very important to do that in your career.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody"> </p>
              <p class="KonaBody">"As far as I'm concerned the way to do that is to fight for my place at Anfield, definitely."</p>

              <p>Personally I find the Sun a very good investigative newspaper together with the NOTW... They have broke many a times things that people were unaware of earlier but came to know because of their reporting. And I am not referring to the 1989 stuff... I fully understand Pool fans unhappiness over what they printer then. But in the bigger picture, I asked how many Pool fans were actually there and really knew what actually happened? or simply choose not to belief something so unthinkable could happen?</p>
              <p>I am not saying it happened but I belief in times of real chaos, even more unimaginable things can take place too... Its just human nature and not something special to Pool fans only... To me, Its a blur area honestly... Anyway, it has been more than 20 yrs already and they have gone through lots of changes over that period as well... even ownership. So Pool fans should let it go, holding on to something done by others in the past onto those in the present is just silly... Time to grow up.</p>
              <p>As for Babel, I am still not sure if he did or didn't... This denial actually came from an official Pool page. And during that time, we all know how unhappy he was at not being able to be in the first team and yet he is playing for his country... He was looking to leave Pool and return to any Dutch club who will give him playtime before the WC finals. </p>
              <p>And this deny took a rather long time to come isn't it? It has been weeks already... Or perhaps the club just don't want any of their players to be seen giving interviews to that particular Press... Thats rather too petty I feel...</p>

              <p><br>Yup, they have broke so many unknown facts and brought it to the public's notice... Say what you like but they are probably the most original and don't take stories from other Press... Other Press actually take stories from them after they have reveal their investigated stuff...</p>
              <p>Like Terry's dad is a small time drug seller, Pennant's dad is a big time drug pusher, Lampard's fooling around in Spain and USA while he was supposed to be there training, Ronaldo's engaging women for with Nani and Anderson when they first arrived, A Cole's fooling around behind his wife's back, Terry was dancing, vomitting while he was supposed to be injured a few days before England's was suppose to play in an important Euro decider, And players getting so drunk that they pee into their cups, Gerrard getting into a fight at a local pub, Peter Crouch and his gal, Jermain Defoe as well... All very original stories...</p>
              <p>From a news point of view, there is just so many original stories that it's so refreshing every week... And they actually send their reporters to do undercover assignments with photos and voice recording to back up their stories... I have not seen others being so articulate to such an extend have you?</p>
              <p>Say what you like but the world needs more of this so as to prevent a cover-up by the rich and the powerful...</p>

              <p>that's a typical tabloid, full of sensational stories that have no importance</p>
              <p>i rather read bbc, watch cnn and wait till news comes out on soccernet.</p>
              <p>if u accept reports from news of the world, that would be like a girl who likes to read E! magazine</p>

              <p>Its much more serious stuff than just girls who likes to read E for sure. Real lives of people are on it, and not just simply entertainment stuff of how they dress...</p>
              <p>Lives are saved from these investigative reporting... Politicians step down because of their wrong doings being uncovered, so no importance? Those quoted earlier were only from its Sports section, there are world news that they cover and break as well like the kidnapping of the little English girl... Anyway, drugs is a serious stuff even in Sports... In Singapore, you know it could be the death penalty, not serious enough for you? </p>
              <p>Therefore, like i have said... It a very worthy investigative paper, much better than you see those who only report official stuff which have very little meaning when almost everything is already done and dusted with. And for your info, Those places you quoted, like soccernet, cnn, frequently quote stuff from these places too lol... Really, you can go and check it out... Otherwise where do you think they get their news from... So you prefer second hand news I guess... </p>

              <p>The astonishing betrayal of fans by prima donna players was exposed by top Premier League ref Steve Bennett. Last night the league's bosses launched a probe and said: "We will be asking Bennett for an explanation."</p>
              <p>A top international Premier League star asked to be booked so he could get suspended and go on holiday with his family. </p>
              <p>ANOTHER tried the same trick because he wanted time off over Christmas.</p>
              <p>And a THIRD wangled a booking so he would miss a match at a far-flung ground where he didn't fancy playing. </p>
              <p>The astonishing allegations were made to undercover News of the World reporters by top referee Steve Bennett. </p>
              <p>The ref, who took charge of the 2007 FA Cup Final, glanced from side to side, lowered his voice and whispered to one of our men: "Never repeat this."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/news/168670/Boot-in-the-teeth-for-all-supporters.html"></a></p>
              <div>He said of the players: "As a fan, they f*****g rip you off. You don't know half the things that go on . . . if they knew that, you'd be absolutely gutted, trust me."</div>
              <div> </div>
              <p>Last night, after we put our findings to the Premier League, a spokesman said: "Those comments do not reflect the opinion of the PGMO (Premier Game Match Officials) and as such we will be asking Steve Bennett for an explanation." </p>
              <p>Bennett's sensational revelations, involving current and former stars, were made at a conference of UEFA referees in Spain this week. </p>
              <p>The ref also INSISTED the practice was well used by foreign players who get suspended over Christmas because they are used to a winter break. </p>
              <p>He also BLASTED one current ace, calling him a "cheating bastard". </p>
              <p>His astonishing claims came at the five-star Hotel Torrequebrada in Benalmadena, venue for the six-day convention to improve ref standards. </p>
              <p>Bennett, a Crystal Palace fan from Farnborough, Kent, flew in from Gatwick to Malaga on Sunday at around 8pm before being chauffeured to the hotel 15 miles away. Premiership colleagues Mike Dean, Andre Marriner, Stuart Attwell, Howard Dean and Mike Riley were also there. At midnight the English refs, plus former official David Elleray, enjoyed a nightcap in the hotel bar. </p>
              <p>It was then that Bennett, who refereed the match between Blackburn and Aston Villa, made his mind-blowing allegations. </p>
              <p>We have decided not to divulge the identities of the players involved for legal reasons. But the News of the World has taped records of Bennett making his astonishing revelations and video footage. </p>
              <p>Still in his UEFA training kit, Bennett recalled one occasion when a player on four yellow cards told him he wanted to be booked to miss a far-flung game. Players who collect five yellow cards automatically get a one-match ban. A straight red card can earn a player up to three matches off.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bennett, 48, said: "XXXXXX certainly said it to me. 'I ain't, I don't want to play against f*****g XXXXXX'."</p>
              <h4>Crude</h4>
              <p>The player, who has pocketed millions in transfer fees, then launched himself into a crude tackle, forcing Bennett to give him a yellow card. The player missed the match he told Bennett he didn't want to play in. </p>
              <p>Bennett then told our men about another player, who wanted Christmas off. Glancing from side to side, Bennett whispered: "He's come in the dresser beforehand . . . he came into the dressing room on my mother's life and said I need one more yellow card. So I gave him a yellow card and, 'No, no, no, no,' he says, 'On the pitch'. It's up to you."</p>
              <p>Here is a transcript of our conversation with Bennett. It is sure to disgust fans, struggling with the credit crunch, who pay the wages of players earning up to £150,000 a week. </p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>REPORTER</strong>: And players do that? </p>
              <p><strong>BENNETT</strong>: And they go straight through a bloke, to get a yellow card so that they don't have to play over Christmas.</p>
              <p><strong>REPORTER</strong>: But as a fan . . . </p>
              <p><strong>BENNETT</strong>: I know and if they knew that, you'd be absolutely gutted, trust me. XXXXXX certainly said it to me, 'I ain't, I don't want to play against f****** XXXXXX'. And what about XXXXXX's tackle at XXXXXX? </p>
              <p><strong>REPORTER</strong>: Did he want Christmas off? </p>
              <p><strong>BENNETT</strong>: When you watch that. He comes in and you think what the f*****g hell are you making a tackle like that for? </p>
              <p><strong>REPORTER</strong>: But, as a fan. </p>
              <p><strong>BENNETT</strong>: He did. It's Christmas, that's three games. Absolutely. You don't realise that. When you think about it now. You watch. Every year.</p>
              <p><strong>REPORTER</strong>: Cos they want Christmas off with their families. </p>
              <p><strong>BENNETT</strong>: They want a rest. What p***** off XXXXXX, I know for a fact, so does everybody else, he had a family holiday booked to go to XXXXXX for Christmas, right?</p>
              <p><strong>REPORTER</strong>: And he didn't get booked? </p>
              <p><strong>BENNETT</strong>: Yep, he got sent off against XXXXXX. That's why he made that tackle right? Right? But the manager says, 'You ain't going f*****g walkies. You are staying with the team and you will turn it in, f*****g good job. I was at XXXXXX on XXXXXX and XXXXXX sat in the box. He did not look happy. Between you me and the gatepost. </p>
              <p><strong>REPORTER</strong>: Mate, I can't, like, look, as a fan, right, if if anyone . . . </p>
              <p><strong>BENNETT</strong>: As a fan, they f*****g rip you off. You don't know half the things that go on. You don't know half the things that go on. </p>
              <p>Just metres away, colleagues Howard Webb and Mike Dean were singing Liverpool anthem You'll Never Walk Alone, unaware Bennett was letting slip the shameful secrets that will rock football.</p>
              <h4>Fingers</h4>
              <p>Bennett went on to claim a number of foreign stars, used to a winter break in their own countries, stick two fingers up at their fans by getting Christmas off. </p>
              <p><strong>BENNETT</strong>: All I'm saying is the foreigner players probably do it more because they are never used to playing games over the Christmas period, because all over Europe there is a three- week, four-week gap. </p>
              <p>On the tape, which you can hear above, he also calls a top foreign star a "cheating bastard" for diving to win a penalty. </p>
              <p><strong>BENNETT</strong>: He (unclear) the ball, takes one step, two steps, turns his body and just f*****g launches himself. I mean two XXXXXX players go like that. But they are nowhere near him. If are in the wrong position, you've a penalty. So I got into a position and thought, 'You cheating bastard'. That's what you say to yourself."</p>

              <p>So you expect football news and you have nothing to say to this story?</p>
              <p>Again, Are you very sure its not until it is confirm then they will publish it? Cos I didn't see a reply to this?</p>
              <p>There is nothing about beckham looking like wolverine or charlize theron here... Just a top referee giving an interview without his knowledge thats all... How more truthful can this be? You don't fine this a worthy story?</p>
              <p>A top epl referee giving his honest thoughts... man, you sure you are a football fan? or just in denial? I suggest you give it a good read to be more objective rather than just being subjective in this case just to prove your point...</p>
              <p>There is a fine line between "good investigative" Press and paparazzi if you look at it through a myopic scope... But on a wider mark, While one is mainly base on private lives only like what they do, what they wear, or who they are dating, what car they drive... The other like I have said earlier, can actually save lives or end careers... More serious stuff...</p>
              <p>There are pros and cons to it, but the pros far outweigh the cons to have a "good investigative" Press around...</p>

              <p><br>Ok fine... If you wish to be subjective about this, then there is not much else need to be said... But I must say, for a football fan who expect football news... It is interesting nevertheless... End of this issue.</p>
              <p>Now, lets just forget everything else... Just one issue left I hope to see should you choose to reply after this...</p>
              <p>Alright, since you admit that some of the stuff came from there earlier, but I have yet to hear your reply despite picking on an earlier point you made... <strong>Again, are you very sure its not until it is confirm then they will publish it? Those sites you claim ?</strong></p>
              <p>Or will they also published it before it is confirmed? Cos I have not seen a reply or anything close to it till now ?</p>
              <p>If you care to reply, please do so... If you choose not to, its fine with me too...</p>

              <p>96 people died and the next day they ran a story with the big WORDS</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"THE TRUTH" with 3 allegations:</p>
              <p>1. That some fans pickpocketed the victims</p>
              <p>2. That the fans urinated at the police</p>
              <p>3. That the fans beat up a police who was performing CPR.</p>
              <p>Among many other allegations, they also claimed that fans abused a dead girl and urinated on the bodies of dead people.</p>
              <p>So this is an investigative newspaper and so tells the truth? This is a newspaper that sensationalise a tragedy without considering the facts and they ran that report for one purpose and one purpose only. To sell newspapers. Those are hardly the truths and a grave disrespect to the fans who helped and especially to the families of those who died. The paper has apologised in 2004 although the editor has apologised in 1993 but retracted it many years later. What kind of sincerity is that? What kind of human being is that to earn money from a tragedy?</p>
              <p>Yes we were not there, but that doesnt mean it dont mean a thing to us. I have been a fan since I was 7 and so for the last 25 years. I was 12 when this thing happened and at that age, things did not appear that big to me, but as I grow as a fan, and understand more of what happened, no real football fan especially a Liverpool one should condone and accept what THE SUN has reported.</p>

              <p>Gasband, Zocoss, didn't read the whole exchange between you two. More because I'm lazy rather than anything.</p>
              <p>The Sun and NOTW, yes, both are freaking tabloids. There is as much reason to like both as there is to hate both. In fact, loving or hating it would be for the same reasons. They would publish the wild news more likely than others, be it true or not. I do think that the news being true is more of a bonus than anything. Because of that, it's also more likely the fanciful but true news would come from them as well.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile though, I don't blame Babel for only making these comments about The Sun now. I think he may even have just replied after somebody asked him rather than him coming out of the way to comment. Or it could also be that he never quite bothered about The Sun and only knew of the article recently.</p>
              <p>Still, I respect him for taking a strong stand regarding this and timing aside, I do like the way he has replied on this at least based on what is said in this article (take it with a pinch of salt?).</p>
              <p>Now, if only he could just make better use of the footballing talent he has and contribute to the Liverpool cause, he'd be a great player to watch.</p>

              <p>I found your piece very interesting... Especially your last paragraph.</p>
              <p>I have always said and feel that many newer pool fans like those under 35 or 30, really don't understand what actually is happening... But unfortunately, over the years... They were program to hate the Sun but for whatever reason, they themselves don't even really know but only to refer to this article...</p>
              <p>This is not a healthy or a right way of things i feel. And again, I can't emphasize enough that I am not saying it did or it didn't happen like I have already mentioned in my 2nd post in this thread... All I am saying is, it has been 2 decades, 20 years have passed... Let it go... Younger Pool fans should not be program to hate just because they wish to love the club... What happened was a long time ago already...</p>
              <p>We sit here today 20 yrs on not really knowing what actually did or didn't take place. There is no right or wrong now... The editor of that day still insist and stand by it till this day. True that he did apologised but later came out to made it clear that the newspaper owner ordered him to do so... And all I did wrong was tell the truth...</p>
              <p>Pool fans on the other hand, during those days must have been hurt very badly cos of this incident... Lives were lost because of it, some families had members in there... Sometimes, when people are hurt, they find someone or something else to vent their anger on... The Sun was probably there at the wrong place and the wrong time... Cos, even if the story was indeed true (I believed other Press did report on it too only without using the words "The Truth"), people will still not want to belief something so despicable could take place within their own... But we have seen in times of chaos, unthinkable things do happen... Take Hurricane Katrina for instance... When the Hurricane started, looting and violence became a common event... Reports of carjacking, thefts, rapes and murders also took place... Troops were call in with orders of shoot and kill by the governor... Why we might ask? Cos in a chaos state, some people may take advantage of the opportunity to enrich themselves one way or another... Like the strong taking advantage of the weak. Not everyone is going to be a saint...</p>
              <p>To be honest, it is not totally unimaginable it could happen... English football as I understand from many older folks during the mid 80s till earlier 90s were very problematic... Drinking and fighting wasn't unthinkable during a match... Lots of fans got drunk at football matches. And also the then Liverpool fans were the reason English clubs were ban from Europe for many years and causing standards to drop too... It was mainly an English problem and not just a Liverpool problem... Even England's national team fans were problematic when they went away. It was famous that the English and the Dutch had the most notorious fans during those days.</p>
              <p>But whatever it is, the point I find really unfortunately is... Why does most of the younger Pool fans need to hate the Sun in order to be accepted as a Pool fan? What reasons do you have against it? Have they done something bad to you personally or to your family? Times have gone by, the people in charge are no longer the ones 20 yrs ago... They should grow up not hating... because they are probably equally clueless as me and many others of our generation...</p>
              <p>Lastly, like I have said at the start of this post. I found your post very interesting compare to all the other pool fans... I believed your stand is not much difference from the others under 30s pool fans as well. But yours is the first time I came across a Liverpool fan who confess to not feeling anything of hating anyone during that time... But then grew up program to hate... A rather sad way to love or show loyally to a club i would say... But you are not the only one out there. I believed there are a lot more just like yourself, just that no one said it as clear as you or willing to admit it... They rather call it trash or something else... But subconscious, many Pool fans are program to hate it in order to show their love for the club... But choose not to see the pros from the cons that it brings.</p>
              <p>Perhaps one day i might meet a more open-minder Pool fan who is objective enough not to hate something in order to love the club... Does the Japs still hate the Americans? Well, they did bomb them with the most powerful weapon on earth and killing a lot more people... But it seems the japs are more forgiving to the american afterall as they are great friends today... What is Hillsborough 1989 compare to Hiroshima... Honestly, my frank opinion... Nothing...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>You've got to be kidding me. There's a reason why NOTW and The Sun are not held in the same regard as proper wire agencies. They pay for stories from WAGs and hangers-on as long as they can sell, never mind what the damage could be. Nobody actually needs to know about who's sleeping together on X Factor, which teenager's exposing her boobs on Page 3 or surgically enhanced wives.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>As I said, you would never understand my love and my family's love for Liverpool. It was more than a football club. To me, whenever there was a Liverpool match, that was the only time I could spend time with my late father. Since young, my Dad was'nt that kind who will spend time with us children on our homework, on playing, it was all my mum. But once there was a Liverpool match, I knew I could have my father sitting there with me for the next 90 minutes. ANd so I became a Liverpool fan probably not because I understood what football was but probably I knew it allowed me to spend time with my father. ANd as time grew, Liverpool became more than just a football club. It meant family time. It became the bond where my father and I could spend time together. And as I grew up, when I started working, we spent even lesser time together. But still, everytime there is a Liverpool match, I would be there at the Living room on the sofa and he would quietly sit behind on the rocking chair behind me and that is how we spend time together. He is gone now and for you to say that my passion for Liverpool is questionable just because I was not there at the incident, I found that insulting and maybe you did not mean it that way and because to you, that is a football club, but for me, it was a love me and my late Father shared. Apologies for ranting.</p></div>
