              <h1>Jose Mourinho: Nemanja Vidic deserves two-match ban</h1>
              <h2>Former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has started the war of words ahead of Inter Milan's Champions League tie with Manchester United, suggesting Nemanja Vidic should miss both legs following his red card against Quito in Tokyo.</h2>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01214/jose-mourinho_1214987c.jpg" alt="Jose Mourinho - I'd rather manager Inter Milan than Manchester United" width="460" height="287"></p>
              <p><span class="caption"><em>Speaking out: Jose Mourinho is not worried about his Inter Milan team having to face Manchester United in the Champions League.</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Speaking in Italy's <em>La Gazzetta dello Sport</em> on Friday the Portuguese coach revealed his reaction to the Serbian's red card in the World Club Championship final last month.</strong></p>
              <p>Mourinho said: "I'd be surprised if Vidic didn't get at least two matches - which wouldn't even be much for a gesture like that, during a match seen by the whole world."</p>
              <p>The Inter Milan coach is ready for the challenge Manchester United will pose next month. He said: "In February the real Champions League starts.</p>
              <p>"In the Champions League details count, even the luck of not having important injuries, I believe that at the end of February Inter will be better than they were at the end of 2008."</p>
              <p>Manchester United travel to Italy to face Mourinho's team on Feb 24 at the San Siro with the second leg at Old Trafford two weeks later, but the former Porto coach is confident.</p>
              <p>He said: "I really wanted Manchester United because I don't see any great difference between them Bayern, Liverpool or Barcelona and seeing as I like pressure and emotion these win or die games playing against the Champions of Europe and the World is perfect for me.</p>
              <p>"I already have an idea of how I will play against Manchester at home and then at Old Trafford and the objective will be to take the team to another level of play, specifically working at this."</p>
              <p>Mourinho dismissed speculation that his team might be underprepared after playing fewer games than United in the intervening period. "No way," he said. "Ferguson has won 30 honours and he has lived his whole career with that rhythm, he has six players for three attacking positions, four for two midfield places but before playing us United haven't got any tough games."</p>
              <p>Inter's coach was not afraid to stir up the controversy surrounding Wayne Rooney's tackle on Aalborg's Kasper Risgard in the group stages, saying: "I don't like the fact that in football there are different standards. I was amazed that Rooney was not suspended. But I know they have Evans who is quality, Brown is also a good option and Ferdinand is on top form."</p>
              <p>Inter are currently six points clear at the top of Serie A, but qualified second in Champions League Group B, two points behind Greek team Panathinaikos, who beat the Italian champions 1-0 at home.</p>
