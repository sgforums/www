              <p>The <em>Sunday Mirror</em> says American millionaires George Gillett

              <p>The Anfield fans who have campaigned to drive the Yanks out are on the

              <p>The American duo had offered a minority stake in the club for around 
              £100m but failed to clinch a deal.</p>
              <p>They have needed to raise £100m of outside investment after the  Royal 
              Bank of Scotland demanded they slash the club’s £237m debts.</p>
              <p>Now, with the clock ticking towards a summer deadline, they are prepared
               to sell the club they bought from David Moores in 2007 for £219m.</p>

              <p>American millionaires Tom Hicks and 
              George Gillett have taken their first step 
              towards selling Liverpool.</p>
              <p>The Premier League club's co-owners have 
              hired investment bank Barclays Capital to 
              find potential investors to ease the financial 
              crisis at Anfield. But, significantly, they 
              have also indicated for the first time 
              that they would sell the club for the 
              right price.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Red raiders: Benitez wants to spend £60million 
              this summer on new
              talent to back up his star players Fernando Torres (left) and Steven 
              Gerrard</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The move will delight under-pressure manager Rafael 
              Benitez, who knows his spending plans have been badly affected by the 
              £237million debt built up by the owners, who are unpopular with the 
              majority of Liverpool fans.</p>
              <p>The Royal Bank of Scotland, who, 
              along with American investment bank Wachovia, lent Hicks and Gillett the
               money, have demanded that they reduce that debt by £100m in July.</p>
              <p>Benitez yesterday warned that he needs to spend £60m this summer to 
              compete for major trophies. The manager underlined his concern that 
              Liverpool's status will be under threat unless they sign three 
              world-class players in addition to acquiring Serbia midfielder Nikola 
              Jovanovic on a Bosman free.</p>
              <p>Hicks and Gillett were met by hostile
               demonstrations when they went to Anfield for Liverpool's Europa League 
              quarter-final against Benfica on Thursday night and they are set to 
              appoint British Airways chairman Martin Broughton to take on the same 
              role at Liverpool because of their own unpopularity.</p>
              <p>However, the 
              Americans are unlikely to be forced into a fire-sale of
              the club, having recently rejected a £105m offer for 40 per cent from
              New York investment bank The Rhone Group. Five sets of investors have
              expressed an interest but Hicks, in particular, was against the offer
              from The Rhone Group.</p>

              £60m this summer to compete</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Liverpool take on Fulham today 19 points behind Premier League 
              leaders Chelsea and four points behind Manchester City in the race for 
              the final Champions League place.</p>
              <p>Benitez, who is being courted 
              by Juventus, last night put a price on his ambitions at Anfield, saying:
               'We need three or four players. The cost of a top-class player is about
               £15m or £20m, so you can start counting how much it will cost.</p>
              <p>'If we have problems with one of our signings like Alberto Aquilani, we 
              find it difficult to manage. Other teams have expensive players injured,
               or not in the team, and they can manage because of the size of their 
              squad.'</p>
              <p>Atletico Madrid striker Diego Forlan, who will face 
              Liverpool in the Europa League, and Spain forward David Silva of 
              Valencia are among Benitez's targets.</p>
              <p>The manager will not want 
              to stay if players such as Fernando Torres  and Steven Gerrard are sold.
               But he is willing to offload the likes of Ryan Babel, Albert Riera and 
              Aquilani.</p>
              <p>The Liverpool manager has spent £220m in six years at 
              Anfield, with Peter Crouch, Craig Bellamy, Robbie Keane, Andrea Dossena 
              and Mark Gonzalez, among others, coming and going through the revolving 
              door. But Benitez insists the high turnover has not been his fault.</p>
              <p>He said: 'I was criticised for selling one tall striker [Crouch] but 
              his wages at Portsmouth were double what they were here. How could I 
              keep him?'</p>
