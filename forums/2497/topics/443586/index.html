              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">ROBIN VAN PERSIE will take one of my records away from me before the end of 
              the month.</h2>
              <p>I'm pretty sure of that and I'll be the first to congratulate him.</p>
              <p>He will beat my total of 36 Premier League goals in a calendar year — a 
              record, by the way, I was unaware of until it was mentioned to me on Match 
              of the Day at the weekend.</p>
              <p>I set that mark back in 1995, when I was with Blackburn.</p>
              <p>But records are there to be broken and I can think of no better striker than 
              the Dutchman to write his name in the history books.</p>
              <p>He has answered a lot of questions over the last 12 months with 33 goals in 32 
              Premier League games — and not just as his team's main striker but as 
              Arsenal captain.</p>
              <p>He has shouldered both of those responsibilities and replied to his critics by 
              doing the hardest job in football, putting the ball in the net on a regular 
              basis.</p>
              <p>People have argued with me that strikers don't make good captains because it 
              is hard to influence the team when you are leading the line.</p>
              <p>I don't go along with that. I managed it OK.</p>
              <p>There are different types of skipper and Van Persie is not the 
              roll-your-sleeves-up type who offers loud vocal encouragement.</p>
              <p>He is someone who leads by example with the excellence of his performances. 
              Team-mates will always be inspired by that kind of skipper.</p>
              <p>We have always known he was a top player.</p>
              <p>There have been nagging doubts in the past about his fitness and his ability 
              to play a long spell of games without interruption.</p>
              <p>He has put that right over the last year and proved beyond doubt he is up 
              there with the world's best.</p>
              <p>Van Persie can score goals any way you like. He puts away headers, tap-ins and 
              rockets.</p>
              <p>The volley which won the game against Everton last Saturday was, I suppose, a 
              definitive strike by the in-form Arsenal man.</p>
              <p>Now he has four games left this year to get the record — trips to Manchester 
              City and Aston Villa and home clashes with Wolves and QPR.</p>
              <p>What we have to remind ourselves is that he carries the burden of getting most 
              of his team's goals on his own shoulders.</p>
              <p>No disrespect to his team-mates, and I know that football is a team game, but 
              he has won so many games and secured so many points that it is hard to 
              believe the Gunners' season would have turned around so dramatically without 
              him.</p>
              <p>He plays a lone role most of the time and that makes a difficult job even 
              harder.</p>
              <p>Arsenal tend to play with two wide men with Van Persie often isolated up front 
              on his own. That's why his achievement is extra special.</p>
              <p>I was fortunate enough to have strike partners like Chris Sutton and Mike 
              Newell at Blackburn and Les Ferdinand and Peter Beardsley at Newcastle.</p>
              <p>It didn't make scoring goals easy but it helped to have quality players like 
              those to share the load.</p>
              <p>Van Persie thrives on going it alone and his overall movement and knack of 
              getting into the right place at the right time is a vital part of his game.</p>
              <p>I have to say also that he has been excellently managed by Arsene Wenger.</p>

              <div class="text-center"><img style="width: 280px; height: 390px;" src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01423/vrp_1423189a.jpg" alt="Robin van Persie has been lethal this year">
              <div class="padding-top-5">
              <div class="small bold">ROBIN RELIABLE ... Van Persie has been lethal</div>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>The Arsenal boss has left Van Persie out of some games to give him a rest and 
              taken him off in quite a few others to ensure the demands of a long season 
              are not too great for him.</p>
              <p>If you ask me what his valuation is in the current market, that's a tough one. 
              You have to remember that he has only 18 months left on his contract at the 
              Emirates and that will affect the price Arsenal could ask for the Dutchman.</p>
              <p>They would have to accept a lot less money if he were heading for his final 
              year without a new deal in place.</p>
              <p>But if you were to put him in the same situation as Fernando Torres and Andy 
              Carroll, who left Liverpool and Newcastle respectively in mid-contract, then 
              you would have to put him in a similar price range as those highly-priced 
              strikers.</p>
              <p>To Arsenal, he is simply invaluable because his goals have been so productive 
              in terms of games won.</p>
              <p>For them to even consider selling Van Persie would be unthinkable and I am 
              sure Arsenal will be doing all they can to get him to sign an extended 
              contract.</p>
              <p>There will be no shortage of takers if he does decide to leave because his 
              reputation has soared so much in the last 12 months.</p>
              <p>A lot will depend on how Arsenal's season pans out.</p>
              <p>If they continue to progress up the Premier League, qualify for the Champions 
              League again and go a long way in the European competition this term, then 
              that will provide boss Wenger with some powerful ammunition to persuade his 
              super striker to stay.</p>
              <p>If you look over the history of the Premier League, there have been some great 
              strikers down the years — players like Andy Cole, Thierry Henry, Dennis 
              Bergkamp, Michael Owen, Wayne Rooney... the list goes on.</p>
              <p>I would put Robin van Persie right up with the best.</p>
              <p>And by the end of the year, the record books will verify that claim.</p>
              <p>from the sun.</p>
              <p>======</p>
              <p>let's cheer RVP on.  i hope he beats the record and avoid injury all the way.</p>
