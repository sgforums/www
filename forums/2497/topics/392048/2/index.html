              <h1>Terry shocker: Snubbed by Bridge, humiliated by Bellamy and slammed by Capello</h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>John Terry was snubbed by Wayne Bridge and humiliated by Craig Bellamy as Manchester City blew the title race wide open with a stunning 4-2 victory at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Terry, stripped of the England captaincy after revelations about his
              relationship with Bridge's former partner, had to suffer the indignity
              of his former friend and team-mate refusing to shake his hand before
              kick-off.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/27/article-0-087E2798000005DC-972_468x439.jpg" alt="john terry" width="468" height="439">

              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="floatRHS"></div>
              <p>Then Bellamy, who 
              shared City's goals 
              with the returning 
              Carlos Tevez, put the 
              boot into Terry's 
              shattered reputation 
              just as ruthlessly as 
              his team had exposed 
              nine-man Chelsea on 
              the counter-attack.</p>
              <p>'I
              know what JT's like,' said Bellamy. 'Nothing surprises me about him.
              Everyone in football knows what the guy's ike. But that's off the
              field. On the field, he's an outstanding player and a great captain for
              Chelsea, and it's always going to be difficult when you play him and
              his team.'</p>

              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/27/article-0-087E9B0A000005DC-685_468x547.jpg" alt="Wayne Bridge" width="468" height="547">

              </div>
              <p>But it was a terrible 
              end to another 
              traumatic week for 
              Terry and Chelsea, on 
              and off the pitch, with 
              the apparent collapse 
              of injured defender 
              Ashley Cole's 
              marriage only adding 
              to the air of sleaze. 
              Bridge - who has 
              said he does not want 
              to be picked for 
              England following the 
              stories about Terry 
              and Vanessa 
              Perroncel, the mother 
              of his three-year-old 
              son - went to shake 
              Terry's hand in the 
              traditional line-up 
              before the match only 
              to then pull it away.</p>
              <p>Frank Lampard gave 
              Chelsea a deserved 
              lead but Terry, having 
              been at fault for the 
              first of Inter Milan's 
              goals in Wednesday's 
              2-1 Champions League 
              defeat in Italy, was 
              caught out by the pace 
              of Tevez in first-half 
              stoppage-time.</p>

              <p>The City striker, 
              back after two weeks 
              in Argentina at the 
              bedside of his 
              newborn daughter, 
              scored after a mistake 
              by stand-in goalkeeper 
              Henrique Hilario, who 
              was also at fault for 
              Bellamy's first goal.</p>

              <p><strong>John Terry was saved from an embarrassing pre-match stand-off at Stamford 
              Bridge on Saturday after the handshake protocol was reversed by the 
              referee.</strong></p>
              <p>Assistant ref Bobby Pollock suggested that Mike Dean, the best official in 
              England on current form, ask <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html">Manchester 
              City</a> skipper Shay Given to lead his away team down the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html">Chelsea </a>line.</p>
              <p>In domestic matches, the home team captain should lead his team down the away 
              team line-up to ‘welcome’ them to their ‘home’.</p>
              <p>The result of the change was that Bridge could stay on the move and avoid the 
              handshake with Terry without an embarrassing stand-off. Had normal protocol been 
              observed we could have seen Terry standing in front of Bridge demanding a 
              reaction — nobody knows what could have ensued.</p>
              <p>The match officials’ decision, which spared Bridge that and allowed him to 
              make his point with dignity and minimum fuss, should be recognised and 
              acknowledged.</p>
              <p>As should Dean’s performance in the match.</p>
              <p>The two penalties awarded and two red cards were correct during an absorbing 
              game. </p>
