              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">MIKEL has warned John Terry and Wayne Bridge not to let their feud boil over when they clash at Stamford Bridge tomorrow.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Chelsea midfielder fears the showdown with Manchester City will be overshadowed by the bitter rivalry between the former friends and team-mates.</p>
              <p class="article">And he urged the duo to put their animosity to one side in their first meeting since news broke of Terry's affair with Bridge's ex-girlfriend.</p>
              <p class="article">Mikel, 22, said: "I don't know what is going to happen between them but Terry and Bridgey are adults and must sort themselves out.</p>
              <p class="article">"They were best friends for a long time and it is sad that something like this has happened.</p>
              <p class="article">"Terry is capable of putting all the fuss behind him but they are both professionals.</p>
              <p class="article">"Then it will be a case on the day of whatever happens, happens."</p>
              <p class="article">City left-back Bridge declared himself no longer available for England selection due of Terry's presence in the squad. And now he is unlikely to shake the Chelsea captain's hand before and after tomorrow's lunchtime match.</p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea striker Salomon Kalou, 24, said: "Maybe what has happened is a big story but for us, it is just about playing well.</p>
              <p class="article">"The talking should be about the game and as players, we are more focused on that than on anything that happened in the past.</p>
              <p class="article">"And I don't know what will happen with England, that is for the boss Fabio Capello to decide."</p>

              <p>Roberto Mancini has urged Wayne Bridge to
              blank out the torment that is bound to be swirling through his mind at
              Stamford Bridge and concentrate on helping Manchester City beat
              Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Just 48 hours after withdrawing from England's World Cup plans,
              Bridge goes back to Stamford Bridge to confront the man who caused his
              agony, former team-mate John Terry.</p>
              <p>In the light of revelations about Terry's affair with Vanessa
              Perroncel, mother of Bridge's young son, the 29-year-old City defender
              declared his position within Fabio Capello's squad as "untenable".</p>
              <p>Now he must decide whether to shake Terry's hand during the traditional pre-match greeting.</p>
              <p>It is hardly the most stable of situations ahead of a game that
              could prove pivotal to City's chances of carving something out of a
              season that has tailed off in recent weeks.</p>
              <p>But Mancini is confident Bridge can handle the pressure, even
              though he had no inkling of the bombshell his full-back was about to
              land with his short statement on Thursday.</p>
              <p>"I am sorry for Wayne and for England because it is important for any player to play for the national team," said Mancini.</p>
              <p>"He didn't speak to me before he made the decision. I don't know
              what has changed, but he has changed his decision because I thought
              that he would play for the national team.</p>
              <p>"But I respect what he has done.</p>
              <p>"It is not affecting the club or the dressing room.</p>
              <p>"He is a strong character, who has a strong mentality. Wayne
              must only think about the game because it is an important match for
              us."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Wayne Bridge comes face to face with John Terry at Stamford Bridge having received an astonishing pledge of support from five members of the </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span></a><strong> dressing room.</strong></p>
              <p>On a day when Fabio Capello all but accused Terry of setting a bad example to young fans, it emerged that the Vanessa Perroncel scandal has divided the Chelsea captain's own colleagues.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester City </span></a>players, some of whom wore Team Bridge T-shirts under their kit after the scandal broke, have told Bridge they will join him in refusing to shake Terry's hand during the now customary exchange.</p>
              <p>But just as remarkable is that, according to sources, Bridge has earned the sympathy of Terry's team-mates over a scandal which has led to the Manchester City full back declaring himself unavailable for England.</p>
              <p>Bridge is a former Chelsea player and he clearly still has friends there who believe Terry deserved to lose the England captaincy.</p>
              <p>Capello certainly seems to be disturbed by the sorry episode, as well as Ashley Cole's troubled private life.</p>
              <p>On Friday he gave a clear indication of what he will say to his England players when they meet for next Wednesday's friendly against Egypt.</p>
              <p>'When I met the players for the first time, I told them, "You have to respect all the people that work with me, around us and the other players",' he said.</p>
              <p>'The younger children look to these players like an example for life.</p>
              <p>'I prefer to speak about football and not the personal life. The next press conference will not be easy to speak about Egypt. A lot of questions will be about John Terry, Wayne Bridge and other things around their private life.'</p>

              <h1>Chelsea 2 Manchester City 4: John Terry shunned by Wayne Bridge as Carlos Tevez and Craig Bellamy humble nine men<br></h1>

              <p>Wayne Bridge made a point, then left with all three as Manchester
              City blew the Premier League title race wide open once more by
              hammering nine-man Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>All kinds of
              conspiracy theories had been raised about the pre-match handshake
              following revelations about John Terry's alleged affair with Vanessa
              Perroncel, the mother of Bridge's young son.</p>
              <p>In the end, there
              was no mass boycott of the traditional pre-match handshake by City
              players, just an icy stare from Bridge as he refused to shake Terry's
              hand.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/27/article-1254190-087E2C67000005DC-803_468x414.jpg" alt="Chelsea's captain John Terry (R) fails to get a hand shake from Manchester City's English defender Wayne Bridge" width="468" height="414">

              </div>
              <p>It was perhaps the most predictable part of a truly astonishing
              afternoon that exploded into life once Frank Lampard had put the hosts
              in front just before the break.</p>
              <p>At about that point, Chelsea's
              world imploded. Henrique Hilario gifted City goals either side of the
              interval, failing to make saves Petr Cech would regard as routine to
              keep out shots from Carlos Tevez and Craig Bellamy either side of the
              interval.</p>
              <p>Then Juliano Belletti was red carded for a foul on Gareth Barry that allowed Tevez to fire home a third from the spot.</p>
              <p>And the drama did not finish there as Michael Ballack was also sent off for two yellow cards before Bellamy added another.</p>
              <p>A
              stoppage time Lampard penalty at least raised a cheer from a team whose
              lead over Manchester United remains a precarious single point.</p>
              <p>For
              Bridge though, it was a perfect afternoon. He stands on the moral high
              ground, despite the disgraceful chants aimed at him by the home fans,
              and City are back in the top four.</p>
              <p>The intrigue concerning Terry and Bridge had completely overshadowed what was a key encounter for both clubs.</p>
              <p>After
              their midweek loss in Milan, Chelsea were eager to re-establish their
              four-point lead over Manchester United whilst for City, it was an
              opportunity to reinforce their top four credentials after a
              disappointing FA Cup exit at Stoke.</p>

              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/27/article-1254190-087E56CC000005DC-636_468x303.jpg" alt="Chelsea's Frank Lampard, right, shoots pass Manchester City's goalkeeper Shay Given" width="468" height="303">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>False dawn: Frank Lampard fires Chelsea ahead </em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Indeed, it could be argued the Bridge issue has taken quite a lot
              of heat away from Roberto Mancini, who, after that short post-Christmas
              honeymoon period, has found his position already coming under scrutiny.</p>
              <p>The Italian cannot have been too impressed with his side's early efforts either.</p>
              <p>Although
              Chelsea were not at their best, they monopolised possession and could
              have been in front when Didier Drogba turned onto an off-target Lampard
              effort and fired a first-time shot over the bar from six yards.</p>
              <p>An
              overworked Vincent Kompany also sliced a shot over his own bar, while,
              for their part, City barely emerged from their own half.</p>
              <p>Given that backdrop, Chelsea could have been forgiven for thinking it was 'job done' when Lampard struck.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/27/article-1254190-087E4D4F000005DC-199_468x322.jpg" alt="Manchester City's Argentinian striker Carlos Tevez (L) scores past Chelsea defenders John Terry (2nd L) and Ricardo Carvalho" width="468" height="322">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>A comedy of errors: Carlos Tevez pounces on indecision from John Terry to level matters</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Joe Cole had cut a frustrated figure during the opening period and clearly remains some way below his best.</p>
              <p>But
              he spotted Lampard's perfectly-timed run in a flash and once through,
              there was never any real doubt the midfielder would beat Given, which
              he did with a precise shot into the corner.</p>
              <p>The home fans
              breathed a sigh of relief and went off to grab their half-time snacks,
              only for Tevez to jolt them out of their complacency and shine the
              light of responsibility on Hilario.</p>
              <p>With Petr Cech out for a
              month with an calf injury, Chelsea are relying on Hilario at a crucial
              stage of the season and there could only be concerned frowns on the
              home bench as Tevez's shot rolled in.</p>
              <p>It looked bad in real time.
              Replays were no kinder to Hilario after Tevez had turned Terry, then
              scuffed a shot that incredibly turned into his 20th goal of the season.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Within four minutes of the re-start, City had scored again, with Hilario again placed in the role of accused.</p>
              <p>Although
              Chelsea had plenty of men forward when Craig Bellamy broke from
              halfway, John Obi Mikel appeared to do everything right.</p>
              <p>He did
              not dive in and kept the Welshman to his outside, ensuring the angle
              was as tight as possible when the shot eventually came.</p>
              <p>But yet again Hilario was not up to the task as Bellamy's shot flew under his body and into the far corner.</p>
              <p>For
              a team that had not scored on this ground since 2000 and had offered so
              little in the opening 40 minutes, it was a quite astonishing change of
              fortunes.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/27/article-1254190-087E6C3E000005DC-586_468x286.jpg" alt="Manchester City's Arentinian striker Carlos Tevez (L) scores a penalty " width="468" height="286">

              </div>
              <p>But more was to come as the red cards started flying. Belletti was
              shown his for a foul on Gareth Barry that allowed Tevez to tuck home a
              penalty.</p>
              <p>Ballack followed for a tackle on Tevez that could easily
              have been a dismissal in itself. A second yellow was produced and he
              was gone too.</p>
              <p>Bellamy took advantage of the huge holes now apparent in the Chelsea rearguard with his second of the game.</p>
              <p>And while Lampard rounded off the scoring, it was City, and Bridge, who were laughing all the way back to Manchester.</p>

              <p>chelsea were the better team in the first half. they imploded after the gifted equalizer.</p>
              <p>since his arrival ballack has hardly done anything useful except committing unnecessary fouls.  100k a week to pass the ball square. malouda is only slightly better.</p>
              <p>why did ancelotti make the double substitution?  and of all people beletti against the very speedy bellamy and hard running tevez. </p>
              <p>chelsea paid the price for selling cudicini.  hilario really cmi. RA's expression was as hilarious as hilario.</p>
              <p>lampard is showing signs of going downhill.  how many of his shots were on target?  much much less than it used to be.</p>

              <p>Team Bridge (Tevez and Bellamy) really put it to Chelsea last night...</p>
              <p>These 2 were the only ones who wore the T-Shirts to show their support for Bridge and they really played their hearts out for him last night... Looks like the news was helpful to City after all as it helped to motivate them... </p>
