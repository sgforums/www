              <div><span><strong>Former Portsmouth manager Tony Adams has claimed he will become Celtic boss if Wim Jansen is appointed technical director. The former England defender has been out of the game since leaving the Pompey manager's chair in February. </strong><strong>But he now claims he could be heading for Parkhead - if his "good friend" Jansen, a former Celtic boss, returns to the Bhoys as technical director.</strong> </span></div>

              <div id="articlebody">
              <p>He told talkSPORT: "Wim Jansen is probably in at Celtic. It would be him as technical director and me as manager. "By saying manager, it is kind of a head coach's position really because once you have a technical director like you have in Europe, they help you with recruitment.</p>
              <p>"They do the 'nuts and bolts', the travel arrangements, the hotels, and all that kind of stuff. "As long as you have the final say of who comes in and out, these people are your help in the boardroom. I never had that at Portsmouth.</p>
              <p>"It works for me and Celtic is an unbelievable club, you have a 50% chance of winning something up there." He added: "I've not applied for the role. I know Wim Jansen, who has put me in there.</p>
              <p>"I think they approached him and I know Wim from my Feyenoord days and he's actually said that he would only do the role if I were to be made manager. That's Wim's opinion, not Celtic's</p>

              <h2>JANSEN DISMISSES ADAMS` CLAIMS</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Wim Jansen has rubbished Tony Adams' claims that he was being lined up for the vacant manager's job at Celtic.</strong> </p>
              <p>Adams suggested earlier this week that he was poised to join Jansen in a new-look management set-up at Parkhead as the club look for a replacement for Gordon Strachan. </p>
              <p>Former Portsmouth chief Adams claimed he would come in as manager at Celtic with former Bhoys boss Jansen taking up a role of technical director. </p>
              <p>Jansen, who has worked with Adams at Feyenoord, is mystified by the former England international's claims and insists he has not spoken to him about joining Celtic. </p>
              <p>"I can honestly say I don't know anything about it," said Jansen. </p>
              <p>"Sure, I worked with Tony in Holland when he was coaching there and I know him well. We have a good relationship.</p>
              <p>"But it's a little while since we have been in contact with each other. And I have never suggested anything about Celtic."</p>
