            <div class='col-md body'>agreed...rome is not made in one day.  just becos he put in a better performance does not mean automatic call-up.  you need consistency, prove it in the league week in week out and you deserve a call-up.<br><br>david beckham has of late, carried / inspired real madrid to their pole position.  what has pennant done?  has he inspired liverpool to UCL cup? has he inspired Liverpool to Premier League title ?  none.  enough said, he shld check his performance for the season, which i say at most is patchy.<br><br></div>
