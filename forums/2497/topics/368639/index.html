              <h3>Gerrard may miss Liverpool Asian tour</h3>
              <h3><img src="http://www.espnstar.com/servlet/file/189962_33_preview.jpg?ITEM_ENT_ID=189962&amp;COLLSPEC_ENT_ID=10&amp;FILE_SERVICE_CONF_ID=33" alt="" width="260" height="195"></h3>
              <p class="excerpt"><strong>Steven Gerrard looks set miss Liverpool’s Asian tour to Singapore and Thailand because of his ongoing court case.</strong></p>
              <p>According
              to The Mirror newspaper, Gerrard's court appearance is due to start
              next Monday (July 20) and will last for approximately two weeks,
              casting doubt on the Anfield favourite's ability to play in Asia.</p>
              <p>The
              England midfielder, along with six others, has been accused of being
              involved in a fight last December at a club in Southport, Merseyside.
              They have all denied charges of affray.</p>
              <p>Gerrard started in the
              friendly match against St Gallen last night and is preparing to play in
              another exhibition game in Austria on Sunday.</p>
              <p>The entire team is
              then scheduled to leave Europe and head to Asia for matches against the
              Thailand and Singapore national teams on July 22 and 26 respectively.</p>
              <p>Steve
              McMahon, commercial director of the Profitable Group who are
              responsible for bringing Liverpool to Asia, was however adamant that
              Liverpool will be bringing their entire squad.</p>
              <p>"Every player will be on the trip to Thailand,"he told Thai publication The Bangkok Post.</p>
              <p>"It (Gerrard's appearance) is something we cannot control,</p>
              <p>"It is about the law. I don't know how long it will take. If everything is done in time then he will surely come to Thailand."</p>
              <p>"I
              don't want to talk negatively. I want to give a positive answer like we
              have just signed Glen Johnson and he will come here," McMahon added.</p>
              <p>There are also concerns surrounding the availability of midfielders Xabi Alonso and Javier Mascherano.</p>
              <p>Alonso is a summer transfer target for Real Madrid and Mascherano may be left behind so that he can be with his pregnant wife.</p>

              <h1>Gerrard on trial over bar affray</h1>
              <p class="first"><strong>Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has arrived at
              court to stand trial in connection with a fight at a Merseyside
              nightclub last year.</strong></p>
              <p>The 29-year-old is due before Liverpool
              Crown Court with six others and denies a charge of affray relating to
              the incident at Southport's Lounge Inn.</p>
              <p>A 34-year-old businessman was injured at the bar on 29 December.</p>
              <p>Mr Gerrard, from Formby, Merseyside, had been celebrating Liverpool's 5-1 win over Newcastle United.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>The
              other defendants include Accrington Stanley goalkeeper Ian Dunbavin,
              28, of Guildford Road, Southport and Accrington midfielder Robert
              Grant, 18, of Enstone Avenue, Litherland.</p>
              <p>Four men from Huyton,
              Merseyside, are also charged. They are: John McGrattan, 33, of Rimmer
              Avenue; Paul McGrattan, 31, of Linden Drive; John Doran, 29, of
              Woodlands Road; Ian Smith, 19, of Hilary Avenue.</p>
              <p>The trial is expected to last two weeks.</p>

              <p><strong>Six co-defendants of the England and </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span><strong> football player, </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Steven Gerrard</strong></span><strong>, today admitted their involvement in a nightclub brawl when they appeared at Liverpool crown court. Gerrard denies affray and now faces trial alone.</strong></p>
              <p>The Liverpool captain is accused of being involved in an incident at a wine bar that injured the Southport businessman Marcus McGee, 34, in the early hours of 29 December last year.</p>
              <p>McGee suffered multiple injuries, including a head wound which needed four stitches, a black eye, and a lost tooth in the fight.</p>
              <p>Gerrard, 29, a father of two, was out with friends at the Lounge Inn in Southport, celebrating Liverpool's 5-1 defeat of Newcastle United last season, when the fight broke out.</p>
              <p>Five of the co-defendants pleaded guilty to affray. They were: Ian Gerrard Smith, 19; John Doran, 29; and Paul McGrattan, 31, all of Huyton.</p>
              <p>John McGrattan, 34, of Huyton, pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of threatening behaviour after denying affray.</p>

              <p><strong>Steven Gerrard "totally lost it" and hit a man "with the style and speed of a professional boxer", a court heard today.</strong> </p>
              <p>Gerrard is at Liverpool Crown Court charged with affray after the alleged attack on businessman Marcus McGee. </p>
              <p>All his co-defendants have now pleaded guilty to leave Gerrard facing trial alone. </p>
              <p>Prosecutor David Turner QC claims that the fight started at the Lounge Inn, in Southport, Merseyside, when Gerrard asked McGee for a card that controlled the music in the bar. </p>
              <p>Turner alleges that Gerrard said to McGee: "Here y'are lad. Give me that lad." </p>
              <p>He went on to say: "Mr McGee took offence at his attitude and the expression 'lad' and he refused. Not many people on Merseyside, or indeed anywhere else, would refuse a request from Steven Gerrard but Mr McGee did. </p>
              <p>"There can be no doubt that this refusal astounded Steven Gerrard. He walked away back to his party but the CCTV shows how much his mood had changed. He was no longer the centre of that high spirited party. </p>
              <p>"He was clearly walking around pondering, musing over what had happened - about the man who said 'no' to Steven Gerrard." </p>
              <p>Gerrard then allegedly went back to confront McGee, and his friend John Doran - who has pleaded guilty to affray - threw the first blow in a physical confrontation. </p>
              <p>The prosecution then alleged: "We say at this stage Gerrard totally lost it. Almost immediately after the blow from John Doran, in fact within seconds, Steven Gerrard joined in the attack with a succession of well aimed uppercut punches delivered with the style and speed of a professional boxer rather than a professional footballer."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The trial continues.</p>

              <p><strong>England footballer Steven Gerrard "totally lost it" and hit a man "with the style and speed of a professional boxer" during a row over music, a court heard today.</strong></p>
              <p>The Liverpool captain launched the assault on businessman Marcus McGee, 34, after the victim refused to hand over control of a CD player at a bar last year, it was alleged.</p>
              <p>The 29-year-old was with friends at the Lounge Inn, in Southport, Merseyside, in the early hours of December 29 when his party clashed with McGee, a member of another group.</p>
              <p>Today, David Turner QC, prosecuting, told Liverpool Crown Court that Gerrard asked McGee for a card controlling the CD player, saying: "Here y'are lad. Give me that lad."</p>
              <p>Mr Turner said: "Mr McGee took offence at his attitude and the expression 'lad' and he refused. "Not many people on Merseyside, or indeed anywhere else, would refuse a request from Steven Gerrard but Mr McGee did.</p>
              <p>"There can be no doubt that this refusal astounded Steven Gerrard. "He walked away back to his party but the CCTV shows how much his mood had changed. "He was no longer the centre of that high spirited party. "He was clearly walking around pondering, musing over what had happened - about the man who said 'no' to Steven Gerrard."</p>
              <p>After about six minutes Gerrard returned to the victim who was sitting alone at the bar and allegedly confronted him with the words: "Who the f*** do you think you are?"</p>
              <p>Mr McGee, who was not a DJ but was in charge of music for the night, stood up to Gerrard, Mr Turner said. The pair were head to head, he said, "in the sort of hostile confrontation that is often seen between professional footballers".</p>
              <div class="advert">
              <p>The barrister added: "Steven Gerrard had clearly lost his cool: he was angry with Marcus McGee." The situation attracted the millionaire's friends. One, John Doran, who has admitted affray, pushed McGee away but "could not resist following through with his right elbow into Mr McGee's face", said Mr Turner.</p>
              </div>
              <p>"We say at this stage Gerrard totally lost it. "Almost immediately after the blow from John Doran, in fact within seconds, Steven Gerrard joined in the attack with a succession of well aimed uppercut punches delivered with the style and speed of a professional boxer rather than a professional footballer." </p>
              <p>Mr Turner said there "was no doubt" that Gerrard struck Mr McGee and said the issue for the jury to decide was whether he was acting in self defence. He said: "Steven Gerrard is a world class footballer. He has the honour to be captain of Liverpool FC and to play for England. "He is a star. He is Liverpool born and bred and here on Merseyside is a hero.</p>
              <p>"Wherever you go in Liverpool and indeed in the world there are little boys proudly wearing a Liverpool shirt with No 8 and the name Gerrard on the back of it. "We do not say that Mr Gerrard is normally an arrogant man, we don't say that he is a bully.</p>
              <p>"What we do say is that that night he just lost his self control and joined in an attack which should never have taken place. He let himself down."</p>
              <p>The jury watched CCTV footage which showed Gerrard and his friends dancing and singing football songs and downing shots in The Lounge Inn at around 3am.</p>
              <p>Real time and slow motion footage was played of the footballer talking to Mr McGee at the bar for 23 seconds, then Doran elbowing him, and then Gerrard throwing punches.</p>

              <p>If the video really showed Gerrard punching the fella, and his co-defendants have all pled guilty, then it'd take more than a miracle for him to be acquitted.</p>
