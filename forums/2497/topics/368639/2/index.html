              <p>The man allegedly attacked by England footballer <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/steven-gerrard"><span style="color: #005689;">Steven Gerrard</span></a> during a bar room brawl today relived the incident in court.</p>
              <p>Marcus McGee, 34, said he faced a "barrage" of blows after the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><span style="color: #005689;">Liverpool</span></a> captain asked him "who the fuck" he thought he was when he refused to hand over control of a CD player.</p>
              <p>McGee lost a front tooth crown in the attack in the early hours of 29 December last year, Liverpool crown court heard.</p>
              <p>McGee, who was initially attacked by Gerrard's friend John Doran, said he had at first thought the England international struck the first blow.</p>
              <p>"I remember a barrage of punches coming in at my face but I didn't know who has done what," he said.</p>
              <p>"Having watched the CCTV it was obvious Steven Gerrard hit me a couple of times, maybe three times but I couldn't honestly say on the night.</p>
              <p>"I didn't know who did what."</p>
              <p>McGee, wearing a smart blue suit and striped tie, said he was in the Lounge Inn with his girlfriend, Gina Lond, and was asked by the manager to be in charge of the music.</p>
              <p>Watching the CCTV footage along with the seven women and five men of the jury, McGee said he threw no punches and was in a "nondescript" mood.</p>
              <p>Led through his evidence by the prosecuting barrister, David Turner QC, McGee explained what happened before the trouble began about 2am.</p>
              <p>McGee said the footballer tried to grab a card from his hand which controlled the stereo.</p>
              <p>He said: "Mr Gerrard came to me from my left hand side and requested he wanted control of the music.</p>
              <p>"It was something to the effect of 'Here you are, lad, give me that'."</p>
              <p>"You recognised Steven Gerrard?" asked Turner.</p>
              <p>"Of course," said McGee. Asked if he agreed to hand over the card, said, "I didn't give it to him, no.</p>
              <p>"It wasn't my permission to be giving it out to somebody else. It was my job so I didn't hand it over.</p>
              <p>"He made a move to try to grab the card to take it away and I remember it slipped on the floor at one stage.</p>
              <p>"He then walked away, that was the end of it."</p>
              <p>Gerrard, who was in the club with friends to celebrate Liverpool's 5-1 win over Newcastle, is shown on CCTV walking away before he returned several minutes later.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I got up," McGee said, because Gerrard had seconds earlier allegedly asked "Who the fuck do you think you are?"</p>
              <p>McGee said: "When someone says something like that to you, well, I felt threatened and vulnerable sitting down and looking up so my instinct was to stand up and talk to him."</p>
              <p>Asked if he could recall what was said, he added: "Not really.</p>
              <p>"In my statement I didn't recall the conversation but looking at my hand movements I was asking him how he would react if somebody came up to him and wanted to take something off him in a manner I found to be rude.</p>
              <p>"I was just asking him what he was talking about but don't recall 100% what the conversation was about.</p>
              <p>"I gave my statement in the 100% firm belief it was Steven Gerrard who hit me first.</p>
              <p>"I was concentrating primarily on Steven because he was so close to me.</p>
              <p>"The next thing I knew there was a bloke at the side of me.</p>
              <p>"I gave that statement in good faith but changed it after watching the CCTV."</p>
              <p>McGee said he was innocent, saying: "I didn't throw any punches, I wasn't acting aggressively, I didn't hit anyone at all."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The trial continues.</p>

              <h1>Steven Gerrard admits punching club DJ in 'self-defence'</h1>

              <p><strong>Steven Gerrard admitted he “threw a punch or three” at a clubber in an angry bust-up over music, a court heard yesterday. But the Liverpool and England star told police he acted in self-defence because he thought “arrogant” Marcus McGee was about to attack him.</strong></p>
              <p>Gerrard said the confrontation came when Mr McGee, who was in control of the bar’s sound system, refused to let him change the music.</p>
              <p>Gerrard, 29, said: “He stood up quite aggressively out of his stool and I thought to myself, ‘I am not going to be able to sort this out in the way I wanted’.</p>
              <p>“I thought he was going to give me a smack. His facial expression was quite aggressive, so I threw a punch, maybe three. He threw some back – one on the side of my head.</p>
              <p>“I am right-handed, but I threw with my left.<span>  </span>He sort of ran at me throwing digs back.”</p>
              <p>In a police statement read to the jury at Liverpool crown court, Gerrard admitted he’d had a few drinks after scoring two goals in Liverpool’s 5-1 away victory over Newcastle United.</p>
              <p>Earlier he had been singing “The Fields of Anfield Road” as he partied with pals at the Lounge Inn in Southport, Merseyside, on December 29.</p>
              <p>Arresting officer Det Const Peter Tynan asked Gerrard: “On a scale of 1 to 10 – 10 being legless<span>  </span>and one being sober as a judge – how drunk were you?”</p>
              <p>Gerrard replied: “I was a six/seven. I’d been drinking Budweiser bottles and one shot called a Jammy Donut.”</p>
              <p>He went on: “The majority of the lads are good lads. My close mates are protective and they don’t like the mither [trouble] that arises. I’m bright enough not to get any mither and this is the first bit of mither I’ve got since I’ve been going out.”</p>
              <p>He added: “It was getting on to about half past 12 and we were all having a laugh. But I wanted an input with the music as it wasn’t my cup of tea. “I feel I know the staff well enough to have an input in the music.”</p>
              <p>The Liverpool skipper said he had a heated exchange with Mr McGee about a “menu” of CDs. He told police: “He is standing right next to me and he grabs my menu off me.</p>
              <p>He grabbed it quite aggressively – almost snatching really. “So I said to him. ‘What’s your problem?’ and he said, ‘You are not allowed to do it’. I said, ‘I’ve had permission’.</p>
              <p>“I couldn’t tell if he was drunk. So I turned to a member of the bar staff and said, ‘Did you see that?’ “He told me to forget about it. I spoke to my mates and told them someone wouldn’t let me have my music on.</p>
              <p>“I told them, ‘Some p***k has just upset me for nothing’. “I pointed him out and they said, ‘Oh, just forget it’. But I wanted to know what his problem was. I walked over to him and asked ‘What right have you got to tell me I can’t have my music on?’ It changed my mood. My mate followed me but I didn’t know.</p>
              <p>“I wanted to sort this problem out. Ideally, I wanted to straighten it out. I didn’t want it to spoil the night. “I just basically asked him, ‘Have you got a problem?’ We were at arm’s length. He stood up out of his stool aggressively. I thought he was going to give me a smack.<span>  </span>John Doran [one of Gerrard’s friends] tried to split it up.</p>
              <p>“But this time Lee, who is a member of the bar staff, pulled me away. “I thought I was going to be hit, so I hit him. I didn’t go over with the intentions of starting a fight. As soon as I spoke to him it became confrontational. He was off his stool quick – in my face. I didn’t want to turn my back in case he gave me a belt. He probably thought I was steaming in.”</p>
              <p>Gerrard told officers he was filled with<span>  </span>remorse over the incident. He said: “I was gutted it had happened. I wanted to round my mates up and get off. I hadn’t gone over to start a fight. The last thing I want is problems, or people getting hurt.”</p>
              <p>Earlier businessman Mr McGee, 34, told the jury how he lost a front tooth after being hit with a flurry of blows. But he admitted his recollection of the incident was unclear.</p>
              <p>He said: “I remember a barrage of punches coming in at my face but I didn’t know who has done what.</p>
              <p>“Having watched the CCTV it was obvious Steven Gerrard hits me a couple of times, maybe three times, but I couldn’t honestly say on the night.</p>
              <p>“I didn’t know who did what.” Mr McGee said the row started when Gerrard tried to grab the card that controlled the music system. He was also offended at being addressed as “lad”.</p>
              <p>He said: “Mr Gerrard said something to the effect of, ‘Here you are, lad, give me that’. He made a move to try to grab the card and I remember it slipped on the floor at one stage.</p>
              <p>“He then walked away, that was the end of it.” Gerrard later returned to Mr McGee, who was sitting alone at the bar. Mr McGee said he stood up because Gerrard had earlier asked, “Who the f*** do you think you are?” He said: “When someone says something like that to you, well, I felt threatened and vulnerable sitting down and looking up so my instinct was to stand up and talk to him.”</p>
              <p>Asked if he could remember what was said, he added: “Not really. I was just asking him what he was talking about. I gave my statement in the 100 per cent firm belief it was Steven Gerrard who hit me first.</p>
              <p>“I was concentrating primarily on Steven because he was so close to me. “The next thing I knew there was a bloke at the side of me. I gave that statement in good faith but changed it after watching the CCTV.”</p>
              <p>Cross-examined by Gerrard’s barrister John Kelsey-Fry, Mr McGee denied he ever had any intention of benefiting financially from the case. He admitted a solicitor initially acting for him had advised him to start a civil claim against Gerrard, but said he had dispensed with the lawyer’s services.</p>
              <p>Mr Kelsey-Fry asked: “On your behalf, did your solicitor speak to Mr Gerrard’s, saying that, as far as you were concerned, this had all been a terrible misunderstanding – and you were wondering if there was any way this could be sorted out amicably?”</p>
              <p>Mr McGee replied: “Definitely not. I never said those words.” The case was adjourned until today, when Gerrard, who denies affray, is due to give evidence.</p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has denied that he lost control on the night he punched a businessman three times in a bar brawl. The England midfielder told a court he was used to being hassled and had ways of smoothing over trouble when confronted by people.</strong></p>
              <p>Gerrard, who denies affray, told Liverpool Crown Court he was enjoying a night out on December 28 last year as he celebrated Liverpool's 5-1 crushing defeat of Newcastle.</p>
              <p>The Anfield star began his evening with friends at a bar in Formby, Merseyside, then went on to the Vincent Hotel in Southport before attending the Lounge Inn, where trouble flared.</p>
              <p>The jury has heard that the 29-year-old estimated he was seven out of 10 on a drunkenness scale. But he told the court today: 'I certainly knew I had had a drink. I was certainly in control of how I felt in my surroundings.'</p>
              <p>Gerrard went into the witness box shortly before 11am. His barrister, John Kelsey-Fry QC, told the jury and public gallery: 'Obviously, there is no need to give an introduction to the captain of Liverpool Football Club.'</p>
              <p>The QC began by explaining that the father-of-two had been in trouble with the police before - when he was 19 he was banned from driving for nine months for drink-driving.</p>
              <p>Gerrard then told the court he had not been in trouble with the law since and had never been involved in any other violent incident.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">He said he suffered 'a lot of mither (bother)', not just in bars, but at traffic lights, shopping centres and in restaurants.</p>
              </div>
              <p>'What sort of mither?' asked his QC.</p>
              <p>'For example, because I am a footballer, sometimes I get supporters coming up to me, be they Liverpool fans or Everton or Manchester United fans, and sometimes the comments can be derogatory or insulting. So I try to deal with it in the best way I can.'</p>
              <p>He added: 'I try to talk to them and smooth it over.'</p>
              <p>The millionaire said he was given permission by the club manageress on December 29 to choose music from a stereo Mr McGee was operating.</p>

              <div class="relatedItems">Recalling Mr McGee allegedly grabbing a music card menu from his hand, Gerrard said: 'I asked Sabrina for permission to have an input into the music and she gave me permission to go over to the machine and have a look at the menu.<br></div>

              <p>'It was a small A4-sized piece of paper covered in a plastic cover with numerous songs and then you speak to a member of staff if you want anything on.</p>
              <p>'I looked for the music card and picked it up. I was looking at the music card for a couple of seconds for my songs and it was snatched out of my hands by a guy I didn't know at that time but I now know to be Marcus McGee.</p>
              <p>'That's when I first spoke to Marcus McGee.'</p>
              <p>Asked what Mr McGee said to him, Gerrard apologised to the jury for his language before replying: 'He said to me "You are not putting no f****** music on in here."</p>
              <p>'I was shocked and tried to speak to him and asked him what his problem was. I asked why I couldn't have an input in the music and tried to explain that I had permission from the manageress.'</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><strong>Mr Kelsey-Fry asked: 'Did he explain it?' to which Gerrard replied: 'No.'</strong></p>
              <p>Describing how it came to an end, the footballer said: 'He turned away from me and wasn't really listening to what I was trying to say and he swore at me a couple of times and we had an argument for four or five seconds and then he walked away.</p>
              <p>'I remember asking a member of the bar staff if they saw the incident and what the guy's problem was, and the bar guy said he never saw it really, but told me to forget it.'</p>
              <p>Gerrard told the court that his friends and the manager of the bar recognised that there was a change in his facial expression and he explained to them what had gone on with Mr McGee.</p>
              <p>He described how Mr McGee then walked towards the bar area of the Lounge Inn and sat on a bar stool and he pointed him out to friends.</p>
              <p>Gerrard said Mr McGee was then staring at him.</p>
              <p>Mr Kelsey-Fry asked the defendant: 'What advice did you get from your mates?' Gerrard replied: 'Basically to ignore him and leave it.'</p>
              <p>Mr Kelsey-Fry then asked him: 'Did you ignore it and leave it?' The footballer said: 'No.'</p>
              <p>Gerrard then told the court he went over to speak to Mr McGee.</p>
              <p>He said: 'I couldn't understand why the guy had such a problem with me, why he was so aggressive.</p>

              <p><strong>'I was also concerned that if I did leave it I would not have been able to enjoy my night, he may have come over to me.</strong></p>
              <p>'I wanted to see why he had such a problem with it, why a total stranger had such a problem with me putting my favourite songs on.</p>
              <p>'I asked Marcus what was the problem with the music machine and why he treated me like that.</p>
              <p>'Very quickly he came off the bar stool and was in my face right by me.'</p>
              <p>Gerrard said it was a heated discussion with Mr McGee and added: 'He felt I was coming over, charging over to confront him in an aggressive way, which I didn't.</p>
              <p>'I went over to speak to the guy and try and smooth the incident over.'</p>
              <p>He said that there was a lot of foul language going back and forth between the men.</p>
              <p>He said: 'When I first spoke to him I didn't intend to use any bad language.'</p>
              <p>Mr Kelsey-Fry asked Gerrard: 'Why did you deliver a blow to Marcus McGee?'</p>
              <p>The defendant replied: 'To defend myself.</p>
              <p>'It was very difficult at the time to explain to police why I did throw that first punch. We were arguing and I told the police I felt that Marcus came towards me and that's why I raised my arms.</p>
              <p>'I firmly believed Marcus came towards me to hit me.'</p>
              <p>Gerrard described raising his left arm and swinging it towards Mr McGee and making contact with him with his wrist.</p>
              <p>He said: 'I grabbed the back of his jumper as he moved forward to me. When I had hold of Marcus, I remember swinging my right hand two or three times.'</p>
              <p>He said the incident took about four or five seconds before he was 'pushed and pulled' away from Mr McGee.</p>
              <p>He said he remembered people shouting in his face and saying 'Don't go back' and 'Stop'.</p>
              <p>He said: 'I was trying to stop still and I felt I had arms all over me. I could see a melee around Marcus McGee.</p>
              <p>'When I was getting pulled away I realised people were patting me, some of whom were my friends.</p>
              <p>'I wanted to help control the situation. I was worried the fight I had with Marcus was going to get worse because people were going past me in that direction.'</p>
              <p>As the fracas continued away from Gerrard, the footballer said: 'I wanted it to stop. I wanted to get as many friends as I could, round them up and go.'</p>
              <p>The trial continues.</p>

              </div>
              <p>The
              Liverpool captain was accused of attacking a DJ in a nightclub in a row
              over music in December 2008, but has been cleared after the jury's
              verdict was delivered on Friday.</p>
              <p>Gerrard admitted hitting Marcus
              McGee, 34, in a Southport bar, but a jury at the city's Crown Court
              accepted his explanation that it was in self-defence.</p>
              <p>The 29-year-old was the only one of seven defendants to be cleared over the
              ''explosion of violence'' at the Lounge Inn during which Mr McGee lost a tooth
              and suffered facial cuts.</p>
              <p>The trial heard that Gerrard was at the Lounge Inn in Southport, Merseyside, on
              December 29 to celebrate Liverpool's 5-1 demolition of Newcastle United hours
              earlier.</p>
              <p>The Reds' captain, who scored twice in the game, was enjoying a night out with
              a party of friends including Anfield legend Kenny Dalglish, 58.</p>
              <p>CCTV
              footage from the bar showed Gerrard and his friends drinking beer,
              downing
              shots and dancing round while chanting football songs. But trouble
              flared at around 2am when the father-of-two wanted to change the music
              on the CD player.</p>
              <p>Prosecutor David Turner QC told the jury of seven women and five men that
              Gerrard lost his cool after Mr McGee refused his request to change the music.</p>
              <p>He said the millionaire footballer stormed off in a huff and then confronted Mr
              McGee at the bar seven minutes later, talking to him for 23 seconds before
              swinging three upper-cut punches at him.</p>
              <p>However, Gerrard's version of events differed. The footballer, who denied
              affray, told the jury yesterday that he was ''shocked'' by Mr McGee's attitude.</p>
              <p>He said the businessman told him: ''You are not putting no f****** music on in
              here'' and swore at him. Gerrard said they argued for a few seconds before he
              walked away.</p>
              <p>The footballer said that minutes later he decided to smooth things over,
              against the advice of his friends, because he did not want the row to ruin his
              night.</p>
              <p>He told the court: ''I asked Marcus what was the problem with the music machine
              and why he treated me like that. Very quickly he came off the bar stool and was in my face right by me.''</p>
              <p>He told his defence counsel, John Kelsey-Fry, that he hit out at Mr McGee in
              self-defence. He said: ''I firmly believed Marcus came towards me to hit me.''</p>
              <p>Gerrard described raising his left arm to grab the back of Mr McGee's jumper.</p>
              <p>He said: ''I grabbed the back of his jumper as he moved forward to me. When I
              had hold of Marcus, I remember swinging my right hand two or three times.''</p>
              <p>He said the incident took about four or five seconds before he was ''pushed and
              pulled'' away from Mr McGee.</p>
              <p>Gerrard apologised for what happened, telling the jury: ''I am sorry about the
              whole incident.''</p>
              <p>CCTV footage showed that Gerrard's friend, John Doran, actually struck the
              first blow.</p>
              <p>Five
              of Gerrard's friends who accompanied him that night admitted affray.
              They are Ian Smith, 19, of Hilary Avenue, John Doran, 29, of Woodlands
              Road,
              and Paul McGrattan, 31, of Linden Drive, all Huyton, and Accrington
              Stanley
              footballers Robert Grant, 19, of Enstone Avenue, Litherland, and Ian
              Dunbavin,
              28, of Guildford Road, Southport.</p>
              <p>Another friend, John McGrattan, 34, of Rimmer Avenue, Huyton, admitted
              threatening behaviour.</p>

              <p>Steven Gerrard has been found not guilty of affray at Liverpool Crown Court. The Liverpool captain admitted 'raising his hands' to Michael McGhee, but claimed self-defence in the altercation in the Lounge Inn in Southport in December, and a jury accepted his explanation after deliberating for an hour. He was the only one of seven defendants to be cleared over the "explosion of violence"...</p>

              <p><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span><strong> have breathed a sigh of relief after Steven Gerrard was found not guilty of affray today.</strong></p>
              <p>The England star was cleared of unjustly attacking a man in a bar and was later applauded by fans outside the city's Crown Court.</p>
              <p>The midfielder admitted hitting Marcus McGee, 34, in a Southport bar last December and a jury accepted his explanation that it was in self-defence.</p>
              <p>The 29-year-old was the only one of seven defendants to be cleared over the 'explosion of violence' at the Lounge Inn during which Mr McGee lost a tooth and suffered facial cuts.</p>
              <p>Five of Gerrard's friends who accompanied him that night admitted affray. They are Ian Smith, 19, of Hilary Avenue, John Doran, 29, of Woodlands Road, and Paul McGrattan, 31, of Linden Drive, all Huyton, and Accrington Stanley footballers Robert Grant, 19, of Enstone Avenue, Litherland, and Ian Dunbavin, 28, of Guildford Road, Southport. Another friend, John McGrattan, 34, of Rimmer Avenue, Huyton, admitted threatening behaviour.<br><br>Gerrard, who was also greeted by shouts of 'come on Rocky' on his way out of court, admitted he was a relieved man.</p>
              <p>'Can I just say how pleased I am with today's verdict,' he said. 'I'd like to put this case behind me. I'm really looking forward to the season ahead and concentrating on football.</p>
              <p>'I'd like to say a big thank you to my legal team, my friends and family and to everyone at Liverpool Football Club for supporting me.'</p>

              <h2>It was a double celebration for the Reds' skipper as he followed a
              good personal result in court with a goal for Liverpool against

              <p>A good day for Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard got better as he
              celebrated his acquittal in court by scoring in the Reds' 2-2 draw
              against Merseyside neighbors Tranmere Rovers in a pre-season friendly
              tonight.<br><br>Gerrard played for Liverpool reserves at Prenton Park
              in Birkenhead within hours of being found not guilty on a charge of
              affray. <br><br>The court case forced Gerrard to miss the Liverpool first-team's pre-season <a id="KonaLink0" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/85/england/2009/07/24/1402185/steven-gerrard-scores-for-liverpool-in-friendly#"><span style="color: #0464d1;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #0464d1 ! important; font-family: Verdana,Arial; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">tour</span></span></a> of Asia, but he was named in a youthful Liverpool team and played the first 63 minutes of the friendly.<br><br>Liverpool
              went behind to a Chris Shuker goal just before half-time, but Gerrard
              fired home an impressive equalizer with a low drive from outside the
              area. <br><br>The England star's presence helped attract a good crowd
              to Prenton Park, but 13 minutes after Gerrard was substituted, Tranmere
              went ahead again, with a headed goal by defender Gareth Edds.<br><br>However,
              Liverpool equalized a second time when John Welsh brought down Adam
              Hammill in the area and Hammill converted the injury-time penalty.</p>

              <p>Yes, I must say I am amazed that the jury at the Liverpool Crown Court actually found him not guilty with the CC TV footage and all of his friends in his group have admitted to guilt... I guess this is what you get when you have a jury system and the person on the stand is a famous and well liked person in Liverpool and happens to be the captain of their FC... On hindsight, the trial should have been held in London and the juries not taken from within Liverpool areas...</p>
              <p>I feel this type of juridical proceedings is flaw... Cos when a likeable sport star is in the stand, the juries may not be objective when making decisions cos they may be fans as well... If Rooney was in the stand and a jury made up of United's fans might do the same thing as well... Its hard to be objective when the person in question is some kind of an idol to you or your City. Remember OJ Simpsons... the guy was even acquitted of murder in a trial similar to this kind...</p>
              <p>But sometimes, in life, things work in strange ways and you don't always get away from it... Like Simpson was later arrested and given at least 9 yrs of prison time for something else... Gerrard might have escape what was seen as a watertight case against him, but he might get his punishment in other ways or form... Like that say, the Lord work in strange ways... lol</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>A wave of relief surged across football's motherland on Friday as one of its shining knights was cleared of criminal thuggery and sent galloping on his way to yet more deeds of derring.</strong></p>
              <p>It was unthinkable that Steven Gerrard should be kicking nothing better than his heels in one of Her Majesty's over-crowded prison cells next summer while his England team strain for World Cup glory in South Africa without him.</p>
              <p>The guttural roar of mindless acclamation to which the mob gave vent outside <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool </span></a>Crown Court yesterday rang through public hostelries everywhere, from the chic salons of London town to the trattorias of Capello-ville.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">For Stevie G is the St George of English football. Yet it is this esteemed position he holds in the national psyche which makes this matter so disturbing.</p>
              </div>
              <p>St George should be slaying dragons, not getting caught up in a seedy nightclub brawl. Our hero should be rallying the nation to the cause, not getting himself acquitted by a jury of his Merseyside brothers and sisters in a celebrity trial. </p>
              <p>The local lad turned multi-millionaire - bearer of Anfield's ambitions and England's dreams - who knocked out another man's tooth with one of three unanswered uppercuts, was cleared of affray in a Southport bar in December last year. Six of his friends admitted charges related to the brawl and will be sentenced next month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/07/24/article-1202044-05D44F4B000005DC-453_468x300.jpg" alt=" Steven Gerrard " width="468" height="300">

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>This was certainly a triumph for expedience. The shouts of 'Come On Rocky' which greeted Gerrard's emergence from court were not so much funny as raucous confirmation of that worrying contradiction.What makes this case all the more demoralising is the identity of its central character.</strong></p>
              <p>Of all the players on the Shakespearean stage which is the Premier League, Gerrard comes across as one of the most honest, likeable and cleancut. We have not associated this particular footballer with the preening peacocks of the game who hurry from the playing fields of England to London's depressingly trendy hang-outs of the louche and famous; certainly not with those who have been accused of 'roasting' stupid girl groupies.</p>
              <p>Nor - even though we would expect him to like a celebration drink as much as the next red-blooded young Englishman - do we picture him slumped in the gutters of this country's drunken Saturday nights.</p>

              <p><strong>He showed the better side of his character only weeks ago in his dignified acceptance of the Footballer of the Year award. His pride at following in the line of such legends as Matthews, Finney, Wright, Moore and Charlton shone through his speech.</strong></p>
              <p>Yet that is what makes this grubby episode especially disappointing. Gerrard has been as much the role model for today's youngsters as those icons of generations past.</p>
              <p>For our latter-day St George to be sucked into the gratuitous egomania which has become the self-aggrandising culture of the modern footballer is enough to make us weep. Gerrard was cleared but the images which came out of that club in Southport - those of a booze-swigging, shot-slugging, punchthrowing yob - betrayed our trust in him. Gerrard apologised for his conduct and expressed gratitude for the verdict. Yet words alone are not enough.</p>
              <p>It is by his actions in the coming weeks, months and years that we will judge him, judge him more profoundly than he was in that star-struck chamber in his home town. By that and the company he keeps.</p>

              <p><strong>Steven Gerrard scored last night for a Liverpool XI as he swapped the suit and tie for the more familiar attire of a red No 8 shirt in a friendly against Tranmere Rovers.</strong></p>
              <p>The goal did little to quell the booing Gerrard received whenever he touched the ball, however, a depressing precursor of what no doubt is to come from opposing fans this season.</p>
              <p>The Liverpool captain was cleared of affray after a week-long trial at Liverpool Crown Court and seven hours later stepped out at Prenton Park. Gerrard, who played for just over an hour, was comfortably the biggest name on display and hit a 20-yard second-half strike in a 2-2 draw.</p>
