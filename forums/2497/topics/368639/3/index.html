              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Steven Gerrard</span></abbr> made a surprise appearance for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> in last night's 2-2 draw with Tranmere Rovers.</p>
              <p>Gerrard stepped from the courtroom straight into a surprise appearance for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>'s reserves - and then scored a trademark goal.</p>
              <p>The <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> skipper was at Prenton Park for a friendly against Tranmere just hours
              after being found not guilty on a charge of affray in a high-profile
              court case.</p>
              <p>Gerrard was part of a very youthful <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> side, who fell behind to a Chris Shuker goal just before half-time.</p>
              <p>But before being substituted after 63 minutes, Gerrard blasted a fine equaliser with a low drive from outside the box.</p>
              <p>Gerrard's trial had lasted a week and forced him to miss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>'s Far East pre-season tour.</p>
              <p>His lack of fitness and match practice meant that it was decided
              he should play against Tranmere, and his presence generated a healthy
              crowd for the Birkenhead club.</p>
              <p>But just 13 minutes after his departure, Tranmere took the lead again with a header from defender Gareth Edds.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> hit back with a penalty equaliser in injury-time when former Anfield
              youngster John Welsh brought down Adam Hammill in the box, with the
              21-year-old substitute getting up to score from the spot himself.</p>

              <p>The <em>Mirror</em> says the ecstatic players jumped in the air,
              roaring with delight when they were told he had been cleared of affray
              as they trained 6,700 miles away in Singapore’s national stadium.</p>
              <p>Several hundred Reds fans watching the session immediately started singing Gerrard’s name.</p>
              <p>Boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rafa Benitez</span></abbr> said: "We’re really pleased. He’s very important for us and he can now
              focus just on football. We’ve been supporting him all the time and were
              waiting for this decision."</p>

              <p>And wasn't OJ Simpson sent to jail recently, after so long. Sometimes, really need to give abit of face to people around you, respect others no matter their alignment, or at least yourself and just stop posting the way you do.</p>

              <p>Our system is far from the same in England... Here in Singapore, a judge preside and have final say on guilty or not guilty... Over in England, a jury of 12 people decide if he is guilty or not and in most cases, its far better than a one man decision... But here arises the problem... The jury are make up of normal citizens without any legal training... Sympathy and other agendas like race or discrimination could sometimes confused these ordinary layman...</p>
              <p>In Gerrard's case, in my honest opinion... He should have been found guilty. The fact that he started the problem, He went over to the guy's table when he was sitting and having a drink by himself... and his group or 6 attacked the guy and they have all admitted to guilt now... Gerrard himself hit the guy 3 times as reported ! 3 times without the guy even hitting back at any of them even once... You asked yourself, do yo need to strike the guy 3 times for self-defence? So if this is not guilty as sin, then I don't know what else is... But in a court room in a city where he is well like and famous... The juries, we could say were all star struck and fail to carried out their duties as jurors.</p>
              <p>OJ Simpson, a well know handsome American football star got away with murder cos he could afford a good defensive team of lawyers... Apart from that, the jury system is most of the time flaw when it comes to a famous person or race or the likeable... There were 9 blacks, 2 whites and one other race on the jury of 12... 10 of which were women and 2 were men. The woman he was charged with murder was his ex-wife and her friend, both were white. Racial elements probably saved him from the electric chair.</p>
              <p>But a criminal never change his shape... cos 12 yrs later he was arrested again for other crimes like robbery and assault with a deadly weapon and kidnapping...</p>
              <p>I guess on hindsight, Singapore's very own Benedict Goh and Christopher Lee would have also got away without a fine or doing any jail time if Sg had a star struck jury like those at the Liverpool Crown Court... But I guess they are not as lucky as a legally trained judge was in charge and could see the obvious unlike the layman whose image of the person is more from what he watch in Tv rather than what he has commit.</p>

              <p>Our system is far from the same in England... Here in Singapore,
                  a judge preside and have final say on guilty or not
                  guilty... Over in England, a jury of 12 people decide if he is
                  guilty or not and in most cases, its far better than a one man
                  decision... But here arises the problem... The jury are make up of
                  normal citizens without any legal training... Sympathy and other
                  agendas like race or discrimination could sometimes confused
                  these ordinary layman...</p>
              <p>In Gerrard's case, in my honest opinion... He should have been
                  found guilty. The fact that he started the problem, He went over to
                  the guy's table when he was sitting and having a
                  drink by himself... and his group or 6 attacked the guy and
                  they have all admitted to guilt now... Gerrard himself hit the guy
                  3 times as reported ! 3 times without the guy even hitting
                  back at any of them even once... You asked yourself, do yo need to
                  strike the guy 3 times for self-defence? So if this is not guilty
                  as sin, then I don't know what else is... But in a court room
                  in a city where he is well like and famous... The juries, we
                  could say were all star struck and fail to carried out their duties
                  as jurors.</p>
              <p>OJ Simpson, a well know handsome American football
                  star got away with murder cos he could afford a good defensive
                  team of lawyers... Apart from that, the jury system is most of the
                  time flaw when it comes to a famous person or race or the
                  likeable... There were 9 blacks, 2 whites and one other race on the
                  jury of 12... 10 of which were women and 2 were men. The
                  woman he was charged with murder was his ex-wife and her friend,
                  both were white. Racial elements probably saved him from the
                  electric chair.</p>
              <p>But a criminal never change his shape... cos 12 yrs later he was
                  arrested again for other crimes like robbery and assault with a
                  deadly weapon and kidnapping...</p>
              <p>I guess on hindsight, Singapore's very own Benedict Goh and
                  Christopher Lee would have also got away without doing any jail
                  time if Sg had a star struck jury like those at the Liverpool
                  Crown Court... But I guess they are not as lucky as a legally
                  trained judge was in charge and could see the obvious unlike the
                  layman whose image of the person is more from what he watch in Tv
                  rather than what he has commit.</p>

              <p>Aiyah, bro, over liao la.</p>
