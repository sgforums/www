              <h1>Big Four break-up: United, Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal told to hand cash to rivals by Government</h1>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/05/07/article-1178214-04D6EB5C000005DC-248_468x336.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="336"></p>
              <p>The Government wants to break up the Big Four by calling for them to
              hand over their Champions League and TV cash to the rest of Barclays
              Premier League clubs.</p>
              <p>The plea to redistribute football's billions comes after high level talks with the Premier League, Football League and the FA.</p>
              <p>Although there is widespread concern about the dominance of <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html">Chelsea</a>, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html">Liverpool </a>and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html">Arsenal</a>, the dominant clubs are bound to resist an attack on their revenues - particularly given their collective debts.</p>
              <p>Champions League cash, worth £15million-£40m to each qualifying
              clubs each season, would be shared out among the 20 clubs in England's
              top division under the scheme, as would the Premier League's £1bn TV
              and sponsorship revenue.</p>
              <p>Currently, 50 per cent is distributed
              among all the clubs, 25 per cent is paid out according to finishing
              places, and 25 per cent is allotted to the number of TV appearances.</p>
              <p>The admirable aim by Culture Secretary Andy Burnham is to create a
              more level playing field, but goes against the motivation for creating
              a Premier League in the first place, which put TV money in the hands of
              an elite 20 rather than the league's 92.</p>
              <p>The big clubs hold the power and previous attempts to tinker with
              the Champions League have led to rumblings that Europe's top teams
              would breakaway to form their own competition.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, the Government have chosen an eye-catching fight and
              insist they are acting in the interest of the sport and its fans.</p>
              <p>The
              proposals follow talks held in October with football's power brokers on
              areas including governance, financial regulation and debt.</p>
              <p>A
              Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesman said: 'We are
              continuing to have good and productive discussions with the Premier
              League on their response to the questions posed to the football
              authorities last autumn.</p>
              <p>'We are pleased that the Premier League
              have stepped up to the plate and are discussing changes that would
              improve the development of the game at the highest level in this
              country.</p>
              <p>'We have made it clear that it is not Government's job
              to run football but to challenge the game on issues that are in the
              public interest and we will continue to do that as part of our ongoing
              dialogue.'</p>
              <p>UEFA president Michel Platini is also a critic of the
              Premier League's dominance, but the English model for success is
              admired by many.</p>
              <p>The free market approach has made the
              Premier League arguably the most popular in the world and England is
              now seen as the prime destination for most top international
              footballers.</p>
