              <p><strong>Liverpool warned off €20m Argentine raid</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/italy/Napoli/lavezzi_480.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool have been told to forget about launching a €20 million summer bid for Napoli’s Ezequiel Lavezzi. </strong></p>
              <p>Rafa Benitez is desperate to add a world class attacking talent to
                  play alongside Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard next season,
                  following the failure of Tottenham's Robbie Keane.</p>
              <p>Lavezzi is the current Napoli number seven, a man dubbed ‘the new
                  Maradona’ during his time at Boca Juniors although his style of
                  football has also drawn comparisons to Carlos Tevez.</p>
              <p>Benitez wants to find a man who can ‘float between the lines’ and,
                  while seven league goals in 28 appearances in not prolific, Lavezzi has
                  creativity in abundance.</p>
              <p>Reports suggest Liverpool would be ready to match the €20 million
                  they spent on Robbie Keane to land the Napoli star, but club director
                  Pierpaolo Marino insists both Lavezzi and Marek Hamsik will not be
                  sold.</p>
              <p>"He and Hamsik will not move, so write it on a sign," Marino told Calciomercato.</p>

              <h1 class="sIFR-ignore">Lavezzi set for Liverpool switch?</h1>
              <div id="div_article_main_content">
              <p><strong>Liverpool target Ezequiel Lavezzi is the subject of a bid from a major English club, according to his agent. </strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/italy/Napoli/lavezzi_shirty.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez has been strongly linked with a move for the Napoli
              striker, and the player’s agent, Alejandro Mazzoni, claimed earlier
              this month that The Reds had seen an offer rejected. </strong></p>
              <p>However, Mazzoni has now revealed that a fresh offer is on the table
              and, as the 24-year-old Argentina international is unhappy with the way
              he has been treated by club president Aurelio De Laurentiis, he has
              suggested that the deal may be likely to go through.</p>
              <p>"His stay depends entirely on Napoli, but I think that the club is now intending to sell him," he told Radio Kiss Kiss.</p>
              <p>“Napoli have not kept the promises they made to Lavezzi.</p>
              <p>“I'm waiting for a call from [Napoli sporting director] Pierpaolo
              Marino about a meeting with the president, so it's a bit difficult for
              us to know what Napoli want.</p>
              <p>“The last time I saw the director, I told him that there had been a bid from a foreign club for Lavezzi.</p>
              <p>“The president, though, has not even responded.”</p>
              <p>Asked if the offer was from Liverpool, he said: “I am not authorised
              to talk about it, but I can say that there was a genuine offer and
              Marino rejected it.</p>
              <p>“What counts, though, is what happens with Napoli and, at the moment, we do not have any relationship with them at all.</p>
              <p>“Marino had promised Lavezzi an improved contract, but we have not heard anything since.”</p>
              <p>He added: “Today there is an offer for the player and I have the impression that the club wants to sell him.</p>
              <p>“I would like to stress that Napoli are important to Lavezzi, but we
              are talking about an English club in the Champions League and,
              moreover, they are offering him three times what he earns now.</p>
              <p>“Players are not slaves – they are people.”</p>

              Ezequiel Lavezzi has moved to quell talk of a move to Liverpool amid
              speculation linking him with a summer switch to Anfield. </strong></p>
              <p class="ss-text-bold"><img src="http://img.skysports.com/08/12/218x298/EzequielLavezzi_1568263.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="298"></p>
              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez is expected to bolster his striking
              options in the close-season and the name of Argentine hit-man Lavezzi
              has demanded its fair share of column inches.</strong></p>
              <p>Lavezzi moved to
              Napoli in the summer of 2007 and caught the eye last season with a
              series of bright displays and seven goals in Serie A.</p>
              <p>Although
              Napoli finished in 12th place last term, in what was a disappointing
              campaign, Lavezzi remains committed to the cause and has no intention
              of seeking a move to the Premier League.</p>
              <p>"Liverpool's offer? I want to stay at Napoli," he said.</p>
              <p>"I hope everything will be made clear but it depends on the club not on me.</p>
              <p>"I reiterate that my wish is to remain at Napoli."</p>
              <p>The 24-year-old is under contract with Napoli until June 2012.</p>

              <p><strong>Lavezzi, an electric attacker who has won the hearts of all
              Napoli fans, has been approached by one of The Premier League’s top
              four according to his agent. </strong></p>
              <p>The player himself is happy at Napoli, but has been angered by
              the conduct of sporting director Pierpaolo Marino, who did not even
              discuss the potential move with Lavezzi.</p>
              <p>Agent Alejandro Mazzoni is furious, and he revealed Lavezzi feels let down by the club.</p>
              <p>Mazzoni told calciomercato.com: "There is a very real offer from
              a team who are playing in the Champions League and where he would earn
              much more than here.</p>
              <p>"Marino has not respected anything of what he promised. I don't
              think that we will hear from him. I have never seen anything like this
              - a club receives an offer for a player and doesn't sit down at the
              table to discuss it.</p>
              <p>"They didn't even ask the player for what he thought about it. I find it incredible.</p>
              <p>"The lad wants to stay at Napoli. But for him what's more
              important is dignity, which is above contracts, national teams, money -
              above everything."</p>

              agent of the Argentinean striker has claimed in an interview with La
              Gazzetta dello Sport published this morning, that Liverpool have an
              offer on the table for the 24-year-old.</strong><br> <br> Eduardo Rosetto told the Italian newspaper that "there is a specific
              offer from Liverpool. So far I have kept it confidential but now it is
              known at Napoli."<br> <br> Rosetto also added in a wide ranging interview on Lavezzi’s future that
              "[Napoli sporting director Pierpaolo] Marino has met twice with the
              FIFA agent Pablo Cosentino who has invited him to a meeting in
              Liverpool or Naples with the British."<br> <br> Lavezzi’s agent continued: "we do not want to compel Napoli to sell the
              player. But I think it is appropriate that the club consider the offer,
              judging it sufficient or insufficient."<br> <br> In late May, representatives of Lavezzi also claimed an offer from
              Liverpool as the Argentinean striker looks for improved terms at the
              Serie A club.<br> <br> Last season, Lavezzi claimed eight goals and six assists in 33 games.
              Recent reports in Italy suggest a bid of 17 million euros will secure
              the services of the supporting striker.</p>
