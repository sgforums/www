              <p>MANCINI: Feels sympathy for Mark Hughes</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div>
              <h3>ROBERTO MANCINI has admitted he felt sorry for Mark Hughes after his sacking from Manchester City but insists he did not stab him in the back.</h3>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Italian claimed he himself was the victim of a massive injustice when he was replaced by Jose Mourinho at Inter Milan after winning the Serie A title three years in a row.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hughes had City in sixth place when he was sacked last month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mancini has since guided the team closer to the top four and has overseen the win over bitter rivals Manchester United in the first leg of the Carling Cup semi-final.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He said: "Of course I feel sorry for Mark. He is a very good coach who did well here at City.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"But this is part of our job and I'm sure he knows that. I haven't done anything wrong. I was called by some Manchester City directors and they offered me the job.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I'm a professional coach and I said yes. Everybody would have done the same in my shoes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It's not difficult to imagine Mark's feeling because it's something I experienced when I was sacked after winning the third Scudetto in a row for Inter. It's a bitter feeling but you have to move on."</p>
              <h4><strong>Spirit</strong></h4>
              <p>Mancini believes one of his first tasks has been to improve the team spirit of the most expensively assembled squad in the Premier League. The former Italy international added: "We have many good and talented players in the squad but we need to improve our team spirit. At the moment the squad is too big.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It becomes difficult to work with more than 24 players when you don't play in Europe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I would be arrogant if I said that we are going to win the Premier League this year. But I really think we can fight until the very end.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The target I have set is a place in the next Champions League, which would be a huge step forward for this club. But you shouldn't put limits on your ambitions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We won't change many players. I am satisfied with them and after one month here I have to admit the situation is much better than I expected before starting the job.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Maybe we will need to strengthen the defence because we have had so many injuries but overall I'm happy with these players.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"My first month has been better than I anticipated in every part of my experience. On a personal level I'm still living in a hotel and I miss my family a bit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Luckily they joined me for New Year's Eve in London. So far I have gone back to Italy just once, for only 24 hours, to bring over some staff.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"But I am excited more and more by this life and I have to say that Manchester is much prettier than I was led to believe. When I move from the hotel, I will take a flat in the centre of the city as I don't want to live in the countryside."</p>
