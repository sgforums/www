              <p>Well, not according to Hick. "Hicks Holdings replace Purslow and Ayre, Broughton continued with the conference call board meeting even though Hicks had put the phone down"</p>
              <p>So technically, G&amp;H didn't take part in that follow-up meeting so the court now have to decided if Broughton had the right to continue with the meeting with 2 ex-directors...</p>
              <p>When a dateline has not arrive, how can we assume they are not able to pay of the loan? We are putting the cart ahead of the horse now aren't we? And how will the RBS react is still not known for sure. It is still a bank looking to make profitable investments. And in the event that they come to know other financial house willing to give H&amp;G a loan to repay them and earn the profitable interest, they might actually be more willing to offer an extension on the current one... I mean who would want to go against a good profitable business deal? Definiely not a bank...</p>
              <p>You seriously need me to enlighten you on how they used their own money for players? Have you been reading the articles? Where do yo think the big money arrivals of Mascherano, Babel, Robbie Keane, Torres, Johnson, Aquaman and the others came from? G&amp;H gave birth to them? Or just do a quick check and tell us, prior to G&amp;H taking over, how many big money "star players" did they ever bought? I can't even come up with one yet let alone 3. And are you aware Liverpool was already well in debts before G&amp;H took over? Operating profits were very low too during those days...</p>

              <p><br>To be honest, I feel for some other Pool fans to put the blame solely on the 2 owners is just an easy way out... Probably just to make themselves feel better about the form of the team. The real problem here is the manager, how they started out from the beginning of the season. Cos remember Hodgson arrived and when Joe Cole was signed, almost everyone in Pool colours rejoice. And many pundits even had they as serious challengers this season... Then what happen since then? J Cole first match gets a red card, out for next 3 matches. Torres loss form or don't seem as interested to play for Hodgson as for Rafa, Carragher sloppy but still gets pick while Agger gets upset with Hodgson on the bench... All these can't possibly blame owners on the other side of the world right?</p>
              <p>When Harry took over Spurs 8 games into the season, Spurs had only 2 points, only 2 points on the table!  It can't be any better than Pool currently having 6 from 7 games right? But the moment he took over, a new fighting spirit was seen from the players and they went on and amazing run of results like victory against Bolton, a 4-4 draw away to Arsenal, beat Pool, beat City away then beat Pool again in a cup match. This is what is really lacking in the current Pool squad, the fighting spirit.</p>
              <p>In terms of quality players, sure they do have them. But in terms of fighting spirit... It isn't there yet. And this I feel they have to look at the manager who have already had some senior players like Agger unhappy with him.</p>

              <p>Purslow maintained the Reds board had 'done their homework' on the American investment group, which owns the Boston Red Sox baseball team, and said that the club's £237m debt would be wiped out if the takeover, which is subject to a High Court challenge from current owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett, goes through next week.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">He also insisted manager Roy Hodgson's job was safe and that the Liverpool fans would be given a voice should the new owners be able to complete their takeover.  </p>
              </div>
              <p>Hicks and Gillett borrowed money from the Royal Bank of Scotland to complete their purchase of Liverpool in 2007, a debt which Purslow insists would be wiped out by an NESV buy-out.  </p>
              <p>Purslow told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme: 'My total priority has been to try to remove the debt which has been put on this club and which has been a cloud since February 2007.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">'It is wrong that we should have so much of the money that comes through the turnstiles or through our commercial activity go to pay interest on loans.</p>
              </div>
              <p>'A bidder who has been willing with cash to rid of us of all this long-term debt is by far the largest and most important priority in evaluating bids.</p>
              <p>'We have done our homework and NESV are buying this business with cash and clearing our debt which transforms our financial position overnight.'</p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>Hicks and Gillett have launched a legal challenge to the takeover, describing it as invalid and insisting that the offer by NESV under-valued the club. The High Court case is set to begin on Tuesday.</strong> </p>
              <p>If the court rules in favour of Hicks and Gillett, RBS could call in their debt as early as Friday, when repayment is due in full, and force Kop Holdings into administration.  </p>
              <p>That would almost certainly result in a nine-point penalty being imposed on the club by the Premier League, which would leave them bottom of the table on minus three points.  </p>
              <p>However, Purslow said: 'I'm not even contemplating administration.'</p>
              <p>NESV, who own American baseball team the Boston Red Sox, and all efforts were focused on tying up the deal.  </p>
              <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme Purslow also gave an insight into why NESV had chosen Liverpool, saying:  'Last Monday we had two very good offers to buy our business that would clear all our debts and I am completely focused on making sure that the sale completes. </p>
              <p>'They (NESV) see a number of parallels with the Red Sox when they purchased them and Liverpool today and the word that jumps off the page every time we sit with them is 'winning.'  </p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>'They see winning on the field is linked to how you perform commercially off the field. They go hand in hand. It's extremely enjoyable to make sports clubs more successful. Whether you're a poor or a rich sports fan, winning is great fun and I sense both of those things when we meet with these people.</strong> </p>
              <p>'They approached us. They met our chairman. He was immediately struck with their seriousness and the entire senior management team of NESV came to Liverpool.</p>
              <p>'They spent a large amount of time in the club doing their work and those are important signs of people's seriousness in the transaction business.'</p>
              <div class="floatRHS">
              <p class="imageCaption">Purslow said he was convinced NESV, fronted by businessman John W Henry, would supply cash for team building and unlike Hicks and Gillett would maintain a high-profile presence at Anfield.  </p>
              </div>
              <p>Purslow said: 'You don't spend $300m on buying a sports team for it to be a mediocre team. </p>
              <p>'If they buy Liverpool I would expect them to be very visible around the business. They are serious people, they're deadly serious about wanting to succeed. I can't imagine they'd be hands-off for one minute.'</p>
              <p>Purslow also insisted that if the deal went through the Liverpool fans, who have protested vociferously against the current owners, would be given a say in how the club was run. </p>
              <p>He said: 'Our fans have felt totally disenfranchised by the experience of the last three years. One thing I really liked about NESV is they are really serious about the importance of engaging with their fans. </p>
              <p>'I've asked them to consider a scheme at our club that will give our fans a real sense of ownership, a real sense of inclusion, the kind of voice they deserve and NESV have told us they'll look at this very seriously if they complete.  </p>
              <p>'It's not been easy with the current owners - tensions have been high and so that side of things has been difficult but now that we have potential new ownership I don't want to miss the opportunity to make sure that our fans never again feel so disenfranchised. </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>'The most important principle is that fans need to feel that they have a means to express their views and to be listened to and the sense of ownership obviously is the most extreme example of that.'</strong> </p>
              <p>Purslow also urged Hicks and Gillett to call off their High Court action and to walk away from Anfield for the good of the club.  </p>
              <p>He said: 'Right now they do have an opportunity with one simple short correspondence today to allow a sale to complete and that would clear the club of all the acquisition debt and give us a massive lift before the Everton game(next Sunday). A fresh start and real hope for our fans and players that we can get back to the top.</p>
              <p>'That's in their gift and would enable them to leave with some dignity and some peace rather than precipitating a messy dispute. I hope they'll think about that.'</p>
              <p>When asked about Hodgson's contract, which had been reported to include an exit clause, Purslow said: 'There is nothing in Roy's contract which is not totally standard under the LMA (League Managers' Association) guidelines.'  </p>
              <p>Pressed if Hodgson would be part of the set-up if the takeover is completed Puslow replied: 'Absolutely.' </p>
              <p>Purslow, however, was unclear whether it would mean a new stadium for the club.</p>
              <p>'We've shown NESV all the plans around the stadium that we have planning permisson for in Stanley Park,' said Purslow.  'They know we believe this is the way forward and have been very impressed by that. It's been a key ingredient in attracting them to Liverpool. </p>
              <p>'A bit too much has been made that when they bought the Red Sox they refurbished the existing stadium. In fact the same ownership group in two previous teams built new stadia in Baltimore and San Diego. </p>
              <p>'It's simple, given that a new owner will be paying for a new stadium it is entirely reasonable and their prerogative that when they get here they want to pull up the carpets, fine-tune the detail that we are proposing and make their final decision. They want to increase the capacity of Liverpool Football Club.'</p>

              I find the 3 stooges are coming out with so much info at this point is rather too disgusting... I mean info from them may not even be true... I feel they are trying very hard and all means to influence the judge... I read so many articles saying the deal going through is good for this and that but really... I think they should follow G&amp;H and keep quiet and see how the judge decides...
              
              And to be honest, I hope the judge decides in favour to G&amp;H cos it's just not a right thing to do from the 3 stooges and it may open a whole new can of worms. How can a non owner director sell away a business when the owners are not happy with the price? Liverpool FC isn't dead, their debt isn't as bad as other clubs... And since they arrived, the club have spent more money than Chelsea, United and Arsenal these last few years. Whose fault is it that most of their purchases turn out to be flops? Certainly not the owners, and I don't think they would want that too... 
              
              I say the court should leave it alone and let the bank handle G&amp;H... If they can't pay up, they will get kick out anyway... 
              
              My honest opinion is, this is a no win situation for Pool FC. Why? cos either way, they end up with bad owners cos I don't see how the new Yanks will go over the top for a British sport they know little of... And as it stands, they aren't even rich to start with... They don't even dare to give a guarantee to build a new stadium and stay evasive on the topic... So I feel a G&amp;H control may actually be a better thing for the club. Their fans need to be alittle more patient cos G&amp;H will sell it's just to who and at what price. And if someone is willing to pay more, chances are he would most likely be a lot richer than the present one being mentioned. 
              
              I find this John W Henry is only an opportunist... Looking for a quick bargain deal... The guy is worth just over $500m so don't expect record signings after the first year... Which ever way one look at it, it's a bad deal for Pool fans. Cos selling to them now will only prolong the fans frustration for a longer period cos G&amp;H time is almost coming to an end so with a little patience, they may actually find a better owner... But it seems in their haste to get rid of G&amp;H, they may end up getting out of the frying pan and into the fire...

              <h1 class="story-header">Liverpool to receive new bid from Singapore billionaire</h1>
              <p><img src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/49457000/jpg/_49457935_003511264-1.jpg" alt="" width="304" height="171"></p>
              <p class="introduction"><strong>The bidding contest for Liverpool FC may not be over, the BBC can reveal.</strong></p>
              <p>The runner-up in the contest, Peter Lim, a Singapore 
                  billionaire, is to approach Liverpool's board with a view to making a 
                  higher offer for the club.</p>
              <p>According to sources close to Mr Lim, he was the club's preferred bidder in the closing stages of the auction.</p>
              <p>He had talks with Liverpool's chairman about how to announce 
                  his takeover, such was the apparent confidence that he would win the 
                  contest.</p>
              <p><strong><span class="cross-head">'No loans'</span></strong></p>
              <p>Mr Lim learned he was not the victor only a few hours before 
                  the club's chairman, Martin Broughton, announced on 6 October that 
                  Liverpool would be sold to John Henry's New England Sport Ventures for 
                  £300m.</p>
              <p id="story_continues_1">Mr Lim, who is being advised by the British 
                  firm of lawyers Macfarlanes and by the Wong Partnership of Singapore, 
                  still does not know why Mr Broughton went with New England Sports 
                  Ventures, owners of the Boston Red Sox.</p>
              <p>He believes that in purely monetary terms, his offer was at least as attractive as Mr Henry's.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim, too, was offering to repay all of Royal Bank of 
                  Scotland's and Wachovia's £200m of long-term debt, to take on £60m of 
                  other debt and to inject £40m of working capital.</p>
              <p>What's more - and Mr Lim regards this as crucial - all the 
                  money being provided by him would come from his own cash resources. He 
                  is not planning to borrow any of it.</p>
              <p>I understand he is also offering to provide tens of millions 
                  of pounds to Liverpool's manager, Roy Hodgson, to allow him to buy 
                  players when the transfer window opens in January.</p>
              <p>According to executives close to Mr Lim, he was told by Mr 
                  Broughton that his ability to fund the takeover for cash, and the size 
                  of his cash resources, meant he was a more attractive owner than New 
                  England Sports Ventures.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim was told that Liverpool's board was concerned that New
                   England Sports Ventures would have to borrow to finance the takeover - 
                  raising questions about whether Liverpool really would break free from 
                  the financial shackles perceived to have been imposed by the current 
                  owners, George Gillett and Tom Hicks.</p>
              <p>In the event, New England Sports Ventures have insisted it will not load up Liverpool FC with debt.</p>
              <p>But there are no guarantees that there will not be 
                  significant debt further up the corporate ownership structure of New 
                  England Sports Ventures - which could limit how much money Mr Henry and 
                  his colleagues can inject into Liverpool in the future.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim is keeping a close eye on the court case, which starts on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The case is supposed to rule on whether Mr Broughton can sell
                   Liverpool to New England Sports Ventures against the wishes of Mr Hicks
                   and Mr Gillett.</p>
              <p>The Singapore billionaire believes the judgement in that case
                   may give him an opportunity to bid again, whatever Mr Broughton may 
                  wish.</p>
              <p><strong><span class="cross-head">Business empire</span></strong></p>
              <p>Mr Lim is also prepared to buy Liverpool, should it ultimately collapse into administration under UK insolvency procedures.</p>
              <p>According to sources close to him, he feels that he may have 
                  been shut out because New England made an offer to Royal Bank of 
                  Scotland to pay some of the £40m penalty fees the banks have demanded.</p>
              <p>If that is the case, he believes Royal Bank may have done a 
                  poor deal, because he would be prepared to pay RBS and Wachovia more 
                  than the £10m or so which New England Sports Ventures is said to have 
                  put on the table.</p>
              <p>"He never had a chance to negotiate directly with Royal Bank 
                  [of Scotland]," said a source. "He was expecting to do so, after 
                  agreeing the takeover with the board."</p>
              <p>Mr Lim has an estimated net worth of $1.6bn (£1bn), according to Forbes Magazine.</p>
              <p>He made his fortune in fashion, logistics and agri-business.</p>
              <p>His interest in English football stems from his ownership of 
                  several Manchester United themed bars in Asia - which have persuaded him
                   that there is huge global potential for making money from top-flight 
                  English football.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Royal Bank of Scotland announced on Monday 
                  afternoon that it had obtained an injuction to prevent Liverpool owners 
                  Tom Hicks and George Gillett from sacking Martin Broughton or any other 
                  of the club's board members ahead of Tuesday's court case.</p>

              <h1 class="storyTitle" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-size: 2.8em;">NESV has no intention of losing Liverpool to Lim</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>ESPNsoccernet</em> can disclose New England Sports Ventures (NESV) has
               a watertight contract to purchase Liverpool and has no intention of 
              relinquishing that right despite a late attempt from Singapore 
              businessman Peter Lim to launch a rival takeover bid.</p>
              <p>The Liverpool board has agreed to sell the club to NESV for £300 
              million but their ability to do so has been challenged by co-owners Tom 
              Hicks and George Gillett. Tuesday's High Court hearing will help to 
              determine whether the takeover has the legal basis to reach completion.</p>
              <p>But
               Lim, who is being advised by the British firm of lawyers Macfarlanes 
              and by the Wong Partnership of Singapore, is preparing a rival offer and
               hopes to outbid NESV to take control of Liverpool.</p>
              <p>It is 
              understood that Lim's interest forced NESV to increase its original 
              offer last week, leading the group, fronted by John W Henry, to emerge 
              as the favoured party. Lim believes his offer was at least as attractive
               as that on the table from the owners of the Boston Red Sox.</p>
              <p>It is being reported by the <em>BBC</em> that Lim was told Liverpool's board was concerned that NESV would have 
              to borrow to finance the takeover.  But Henry's group has insisted it 
              will not load up the Premier League side with debt.</p>
              <p>The American 
              group's £300 million agreement is signed and sealed, pending High Court 
              hearings this week which will address the issue of whether chairman 
              Martin Broughton and the board had the authority to sell the club 
              against the wishes of the co-owners, who stand to lose £144 million if 
              the NESV deal goes through.</p>
              <p>Clearly Lim is looking closely at the 
              opportunity that might arise if Hicks should win his court case, 
              nullifying the NESV deal, and the club ends up in administration on 
              Friday, when the deadline expires for the Americans to repay Royal Bank 
              of Scotland £237 million.</p>
              <p>Lim owns several Manchester United-themed bars in Asia and according to Forbes magazine is said to have a £1 billion fortune.</p>

              <p>NESV, owners of the Boston Red Sox baseball franchise and led by John W Henry, have already concluded their negotiations and should RBS be successful in court, they are in a position to effect a swift change of ownership.</p>

              <p>I would be more concern should Peter Lim becomes their new owner cos the guy is not only 2 to 3 times richer than that John W Henry, he is also a smart businessman. And being a direct owner unlike Henry who have to depend on a board of 18 others... Things can get done very fast.</p>
              <p>And I also belief he being a United fan for many years, and having grown up following the English League, have a good football knowledge unlike the Americans who I guess don't really know much other than the game is called soccer back in the USA... lol. And even as a United fan. I belief he knows Pool's history a lot better than Henry too...</p>
              <p>So, I would be more concern if he becomes their new owner... Cos building their stadium isn't beyond him as from the history of his business dealings, he has always manage to bring rich and able people together and used their money to his advantage... But I feel if Henry is going to build their stadium, he will load the club with new debts down the road...</p>
