              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool were rocked by a major boardroom split on Tuesday night after receiving a takeover bid from baseball's Boston Red Sox.</strong></p>
              <p>Controversial owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett sensationally tried to sack managing director Christian Purslow and commercial director Ian Ayre and replace them with two close American allies minutes before a meeting to discuss two 'excellent' offers, from the Red Sox and an Asian rival.</p>
              <p>But chairman Martin Broughton's casting vote prevented Purslow and Ayre being replaced by Mack Hicks, son of Tom, and his Hicks Holdings colleague Lori Kay McCutcheon, leaving the conflict in the hands of the lawyers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/10/05/article-0-0B7E0958000005DC-608_468x301.jpg" alt="Ian Ayres and Christian Purslow" width="468" height="301">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Liverpool owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett attempted to remove Commercial Director Ian Ayres (left) and Chief Executive Christian Purslow (right) from the Anfield board on Tuesday night</em></p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>Purslow and chairman Martin Broughton have always argued that Hicks and Gillett no longer have the final say on boardroom matters, after falling behind with payments to the Royal Bank of Scotland, and that any proposal needs a majority vote from the club’s five directors.</strong></p>
              <p>With the Americans viewing it differently, and attempting to unseat Purslow and Ayre, the conflict will have to be resolved through legal channels.</p>
              <p>Liverpool took the incredible step of confirming the open warfare by issuing a statement on their official website that said: 'The board have received two excellent offers to buy the club that would repay all its long-term debt. A board meeting was called today to review these bids and approve a sale.</p>
              <p>'Shortly prior to the meeting, the owners sought to remove managing director Christian Purslow and commercial director Ian Ayre from the board, seeking to replace them with Mack Hicks and Lori Kay McCutcheon.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS">
              <p class="imageCaption">'This matter is now subject to legal review. Meanwhile Martin Broughton, Christian Purslow and Ian Ayre continue to explore every possible route to achieving a sale of the Club at the earliest opportunity.'</p>
              </div>
              <p>The bust-up comes with the debt-ridden club lying 18th in the Premier League, knocked out of the Carling Cup by League Two Northampton and facing pressure from the banks to repay £257million by Friday week.</p>
              <p>Fans called for Kenny Dalglish to replace Roy Hodgson after Sunday's 2-1 home loss to Blackpool, while worried supporters, including showbiz celebrities and former players, released a video on YouTube criticising the Hicks-Gillett reign and demanding change.</p>
              <p>The Red Sox have informed Liverpool's board of their intention to lodge a formal bid, in excess of £300m, but they face competition from a rival Asian investor, who is not Kenny Huang, the Chinese tycoon who pulled out of a deal earlier this season. </p>
              <p>Hicks and Gillett released a statement just after midnight saying the offers ‘significantly undervalued the club’ and pledged to fight any quick sale while continuing to search for a suitable buyer.</p>
              <p>The Red Sox are owned by John William Henry ll, a hedge fund specialist with a net fortune of around £545m who is determined to expand his sporting interests by buying out current owners.</p>

              <p><br><strong>Henry is understood to have placed negotiations in the hands of the baseball club's chief executive Larry Lucchino, who specialises in franchises planning to build new stadiums and is said to have held talks with Anfield's under-fire hierarchy.</strong></p>
              <p>Lucchino's involvement will enhance the prospects of a deal with the Red Sox, since Broughton and Purslow have insisted all along that any prospective purchaser must give an undertaking to proceed with the construction of a new ground at Stanley Park.</p>
              <p>Henry was behind the takeover of the Red Sox for close on £420m in 2002, and they have since won two World Series. But worryingly for long-suffering Liverpool followers, Henry has courted controversy at times.</p>

              <p><strong>He caused uproar in 2006 by proposing a change of kit and 200 per cent ticket price hike, while some leading American publications have questioned the company founded by the Illinois-born 61-year old.</strong></p>
              <p>The Boston Magazine reported in March 2006 that it had encountered 'difficulties', while, a year later, the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg noted further problems with the firm.</p>
              <p>While Purslow may have stood firm against Hicks and Gillett and described the new bids in glowing terms, they will give careful consideration to the interested parties, rather than rush into any agreement.</p>
              <p>The initial Red Sox approach may well be resisted, to begin with at least, but the emergence of new bidders, in one of American sport’s most illustrious names and a rival consortium from Asia, is a significant development.</p>
              <p>Purslow recently underlined the need for caution, after the uproar caused by mounting debts and broken promises at the hands of Hicks and Gillett, by saying: ‘The process remains underway, and there are a small number of interested parties working seriously and privately, doing due diligence and looking at the business in detail.</p>
              <p>‘I must say the single most important aspect of the sale of the club - indeed, the most important thing I will ever do in my business career - is to make sure we get the sale right. The only thing worse than no sale would be the wrong sale.’</p>
              <p>Hicks and Gillett originally pitched their asking price at an inflated £800million before reducing it to around £600million. The Red Sox offer still falls substantially short and should lead to some hard bargaining, prior to the October 15 deadline for repaying a £237million loan to the Royal Bank of Scotland.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/10/06/article-1318053-0B75FB26000005DC-952_468x304.jpg" alt="Liverpool" width="468" height="304">

              <p><strong>The club is the asset against which the loan was secured by Hicks, and RBS could take over ownership, should the deadline be missed, then begin negotiating a sale with the likes of Red Sox bosses Henry and Lucchino.</strong></p>
              <p>A source in America claimed that the Red Sox ‘know what it takes to win trophies and would be a good solution for Liverpool’, but that enthusiasm is not shared universally. Certainly not by the Americans who still retain control and are ready to go to any lengths to avoid surrendering it on anything other than their terms.</p>
              <p>Opposition to Hicks and Gillett increased on Tuesday night,  when a video entitled Dear Mr Hicks was posted on youtube and became an instant viral hit.</p>
              <p>The seven-minute video (below) made by Mike Jefferies – the British film producer who tried to buy the club in 2004 along with Miramax executive Stuart Ford - features former player John Aldridge, celebrities including Royle Family stars Ricky Tomlinson and Sue Johnston and lifetime Liverpool fans, all begging Tom Hicks to sell the club.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>With news of two new 'excellent' bids having been received, the pair, led primarily by Hicks, attempted to sack managing director Christian Purslow and commercial director Ian Ayre from the board minutes before a meeting to discuss the new offers.</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The move was intended to allow the Americans to regain control of the sale process, handing them the final say on any offer.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hicks and Gillett wanted to install Mack Hicks, one of Tom's sons, and Lori Kay McCutcheon, financial controller at Hicks Holdings. This was rebuffed as the two club officials, backed by chairman Broughton, out-voted the Americans </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">three to two</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The club issued an unprecedented statement detailing the saga in which they also revealed this boardroom issue was now the subject of a legal review.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">However, the statement pointedly went on to stress that Broughton, Purslow and Ayre would 'continue to explore every possible route to achieving a sale of the club at the earliest opportunity'.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">There has been a division on the board from the moment Hicks and Gillett announced in April they wanted to end their three-year tenure at Anfield, but that split has turned into a chasm.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Broughton was appointed as independent chairman as part of the sale process, ensuring the Americans no longer had a majority vote and could not prevent a sale that was in the best interests of the club.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Central to the whole saga has been next week's looming deadline for the repayment or refinancing of £282million of loans - owed principally to the Royal Bank of </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Scotland</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hicks has been trying to hold on to power by attempting to raise capital to pay off or reduce the debt but has so far been unsuccessful.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">He remained steadfast in his belief there was a profit to be made from the sale of </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> but, with the prospect of RBS having to call in their debt and possibly take control at Anfield, the price the club is actually worth has been falling by the week.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Americans know if the bank steps in then they will receive nothing, hence the move to restructure the board to buy them more time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The latest statement from the club confirmed the sale was 'conditional on Premier League approval, resolution of the dispute concerning board membership and other matters'.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As well as the Boston Red Sox baseball team, NESV also owns New England Sports Network, Fenway Sports Group and Rousch Fenway Racing.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> are also in mess on the pitch.

              <p>I wouldn't be too happy if I was a Pool fan... Cos it looks like they are jumping out of the fire and into the frying pan to me... Selling to another Yank who live in the States most of their time and has no passion for what they call over there soccer? It just looks like another money making deal to me from the prospective owners...</p>
              <p>Another thing being mentioned is, how much the guy has?  A net fortune of around £545 million only? Is that a lot? He has even lesser money than the Glazers... And I don't think Pool is going to take priority over his Boston Red Sox baseball team...</p>
              <p>Anyway, I smell a rat in this whole deal cos how is a club like Liverpool being sold for only $300 to $350 million when Blackburn is already valued at $300m? Pool still just sign a new shirt deal worth about $15m a season, gets about $40m Tv money, other sponsorships, and still got players like Torres, Gerrard, Reina... etc... Just these few could already give them about $100m.</p>
              <p>I think the 3 directors might be getting kickbacks. And their arguement that these are the right people seems to eager. I am just thinking, do they even have the $400m pounds to build the new stadium after paying for the club? Or after everything is done and dusted, borrow from the bank as well?</p>
              <p>Anyway, I don't think we have heard the last of Hicks and Gillett... Maybe a court case could even unfold from this... So sit back and watch how things develop. Hicks and Gillett go or chairman Broughton, managing director Christian Purslow and commercial director Ian Ayre all get the sack...</p>

              <p>I think the issue here is more of the board of directors wanting to take whatever is on the table rather than continue on waiting for a huge offer that may never come.</p>
              <p>Let's face it; the club is in bad shape. The club has huge debts and needs a new stadium. Results on the field also suck: no Champions League football, no League Cup even, currently in relegation zone.... the writing's on the wall.</p>
              <p>I guess the club just wants to settle its debts and avoid going into administration. If that had happened, the 9-point penalty would have been severe. At the very least, they may forget about Europa Cup football next season.</p>
              <p>If this sale had gone through about 18 months ago, the club may have been worth 600 million. However, all these factors would have severely devalued the club's worth since then.</p>

              <h3 class="wocc"></h3>
              <div class="ins cleared xolcc bdrcc">
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why is there a crisis at Liverpool?</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The board, led by Martin Broughton, have accepted an offer of around £300m for the club from New England Sports Ventures, owners of the Boston Red Sox baseball team.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What is Hicks and Gillett's response?</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">They have taken legal action to try to overturn the board's decision. They have also attempted to sack two managing director Christian Purslow and commercial director Ian Ayre, and replace them with their own appointments.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why are they against the offer?</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">They believe the price of £300m grossly under-values the club - and because they would take a massive financial hit.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">But isn't £300m far more than they paid for the club in 2007?</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Yes, they paid £219m, funded entirely by bank loans, but since then the debt has swelled due to interest and other fees to £280m, and they have invested £144.4m into Kop Holdings via a company registered in the Cayman Islands, which was then lent to Liverpool.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What would Hicks and Gillett be left with if the £300m buy-out goes ahead?</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Around £200m would go towards paying off the Royal Bank of Scotland and Wachovia debts. RBS would be likely to leave around £30m of the debt as a credit facility for the new owners. Only after all the other creditors are paid would any cash go to Hicks and Gillett towards the £144.4m loan they put in.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What about the penalty fees that Hicks and Gillett have built up with RBS?</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">They total around £45m but they would no doubt be subject to legal challenges too.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">So what size of loss are Hicks and Gillett contemplating?</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A sizeable one, as much as £100m.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What is the next step?</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The lawyers have moved in with Hicks and Gillett trying to block the board's right to agree a takeover. If they sack the board, then RBS would claim that would put the Americans in breach of their refinancing agreement signed in April.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What if they succeed?</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hicks and Gillett are caught between a rock and a hard place. Even if they succeed then unless they have raised funds to pay off their debts by October 15 then RBS will assume control of the club, put Kop Holdings into administration and sell Liverpool themselves - mostly likely to New England Sports Ventures.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Martin Broughton, the </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Liverpool" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong> chairman, has insisted that an attempt by the club's owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett to frustrate the sale of the club to </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on John W Henry" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/john-w-henry"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>John W Henry</strong></span></a><strong>'s New England Sports Ventures group by changing the board, is a "flagrant abuse" of "written undertakings" and that he is the only person entitled to do such a thing.</strong></p>
              <p>The Liverpool Echo reported that Broughton believes the NESV group to be the "winners". It also reports that the deal with the parent company of the Boston Red Sox baseball club is worth around £300m, that the prospective new owners will deal with the club's "major" debt (£200m) and that they are considering re-developing Anfield, rather than moving to a new stadium.</p>
              <p>In an <a title="interview on the Liverpool website" href="http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/broughton-takeover-q-a"><span style="color: #005689;">interview on the Liverpool website</span></a> the chairman was asked about a statement published last night claiming that the owners had sought to remove Christian Purslow and Ian Ayre from the Board, Broughton said: "The court will ultimately decide whether the owners were successful. The reasoning behind it was that the owners felt we were reviewing two bids which they considered undervalued the club and therefore they wished to remove Christian and Ian and replace them with Mack Hicks, who is Tom's son, and Lori McCutcheon, who also works with him.</p>
              <p>"We don't think it was valid to do it. Essentially when I took the role they gave a couple of written undertakings to Royal Bank of Scotland. Those written undertakings included that I was the only person entitled to change the board and that was written into the articles of the covenants, and also that they would take no action to frustrate any reasonable sale. And I think they flagrantly abused both of those written undertakings."</p>
              <p>Broughton revealed he was confident about the NESV deal: "I have been meeting them now for several weeks in Boston, in Liverpool, in London, and I feel they are totally committed to supporting and getting the winning mentality back into the team."</p>
              <p>On the club's debt, Broughton added: "All of the acquisition debt that was involved in the current owners acquisition will be removed completely. We'll still have what we call normal working capital debt and there's a facility there for the new stadium which will remain in place, but to all intents and purposes all the major debt that has been causing our problem has been paid off." It would leave £37m of external debt, the second lowest in the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Premier League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span></a>.</p>
              <p>The proposed new owners have not commented on squad investment but Broughton believes there is cause for optimism: "They don't want any hostages to fortune, very sensibly, so they're not going to make any comments about how much or anything like that. But this goes back to the winning mentality. I think the demonstration is: let's look at what they have done at Boston, what they said in Boston, what they have done in terms of investing in players – and I think you get a high degree of confidence of their willingness to do that."</p>
              <p>While the NESV group currently "haven't finalised their view whether that should be the new stadium or whether there are still opportunities to build at Anfield itself," said Broughton, "there's definitely a commitment to invest in a stadium and we will finish up with a 60,000-plus seater."</p>
              <p>For the sale to be finalised a court judgment is required to declare: "That we did act validly in completing the sale agreement," said Broughton. Premier League approval is then the final obstacle but the chairman said: "I'm certain that's not going to be an issue. There are one or two minor things like that but the key issue is the court, which should meet I would think next week sometime. That is the most likely time, in short order."</p>

              <div class="entry">
              <p><strong>It was at 7.22 this morning that the news Liverpool’s fans have waited more than three years to hear officially broke. A plainly-worded statement released on the club’s website confirmed that the Anfield board had agreed a deal with New England Sports Ventures, owners of the Boston Red Sox, to end the despised reign of Tom Hicks and George Gillett on Merseyside. Yet no street parties were planned. No bunting hangs from the terraced roofs of L4.  The Kop’s banners, the images and slogans of revolt, remain. The future has not arrived. Dawn has yet to break on Anfield’s perpetual dusk.</strong></p>
              <p>Indeed, in some senses, all that Liverpool’s night of the long knives has served to do is deepen the darkness. A club that has simmered with factionalism for months and years is now in a state of outright civil war. The owners, Hicks and Gillett, the carpetbaggers, the panhandlers who still cling by desperate fingernails to an asset they have done so much to strip, tried to sack two members of chairman Martin Broughton’s board, Christian Purslow and Ian Ayre, after learning they wished to sell the club to John W Henry, the owner of the Red Sox, or another, mystery bidder.</p>
              <p>That much was declared in a staggering statement released on the Liverpool website yesterday evening, as the three-man sub-committee of non-owner directors staged their coup, seizing the means of communication, launching the rebellion. The Americans’ riposte came later – not published on the website – revealing their reasons for seeking to appoint Mack Hicks and Lori Kay McCutcheon in Purslow and Ayre’s stead. It was couched in diplomatic terms, it was persuasively phrased, it contained a defiant logic of a sort. But the basic message, the brass tack, was that neither of the two bids on the table offered them enough money. Hicks and Gillett, whose only notable contribution to Liverpool has been to laden the club with £282 million of debt, want a tidy profit out of their venture.</p>
              <p>And then came this morning’s statement from Broughton, detailing that the sale of the club was now dependent on establishing whether Hicks and Gillett have any legal right to sack Purslow and Ayre. If they do, then Hicks will have a 4 to 1 majority on the board and can veto any sale. If they do not, then the sale should go through.</p>
              <p>If only it was that simple. Nothing is, at Liverpool, and in truth it would hardly be in keeping with Hicks’ and Gillett’s tenure had they chosen to walk quietly into the night. It had to end this way. It had to end in chaos and confusion. There could not just be answers. There had to be questions.</p>
              <p>Even for all the stark talk of a binding agreement upon Broughton’s appointment in April that allowed the board to sell a club they did not own, can Hicks and Gillett, holders of 100 per cent of the shares, be forced out without their agreement? Why are the two potential appointees to Liverpool’s board Hicks loyalists, denying Gillett a strengthened presence? What happens, if Hicks succeeds in his bid to block the sale, and the Royal Bank of Scotland call in their £282 million debt on October 15th? Why did Liverpool have two “excellent” bids at 8.30pm yesterday and yet agree a sale less than 12 hours later? When Broughton suggests that NESV “best met” the criteria laid out for new owners, does that mean they do not meet all of them? Will Henry’s bid involve debt? If so, are Liverpool simply jumping out of their Texan fire and into a sizzling Bostonian pan?</p>
              <p>All will need to be answered, and satisfactorily, whatever happens, if Liverpool are to emerge from the darkest period of their history. In the boardroom, the battle lines are drawn, sides chosen. On the terraces, the fans wait to learn their club’s fate. There is no hope at Anfield any more, only fear. Fear of what has been, and what will come, if Hicks remains. Fear of what is to come, if the legal challenge drags on for weeks, as it may do. And fear of what might be, if Henry and NESV prove to be no different to what went before. The fans, the club’s stakeholders, cannot yet see a glimmer of light. They have learned to be afraid of the dark.</p>

              <p><br>Why should they give up? It's afterall, their money to lose and not the 3 stooges who are non owner directors...</p>
              <p>Ultimately, they are the owners... To be fair, though they may not be like by the fans, they should still be treated fairly in a business sense. How could non owner directors decide to sell the company cheaply when the real owners are not acceptable to the price? Or not allow to appoint new directors to the board?</p>
              <p>If the British court allows something like this to happen, it will be one of the most ridiculous decision.</p>
              <p>True that they owe the bank money but these non owner directors should not stand in their way to refinance it with the club as collateral cos it's still their business at the end of the day.</p>
              <p>The court decision shouldn't be base on what the fans want or favour, or what the non owner directors think is best for the company / club. But only is it right or wrong to take away someone's possession without his approval and try means and ways preventing him to keep it?</p>
              <p>And one could suspect why managing director Christian Purslow (put there by RBS), chairman Broughton and commercial director Ian Ayre are so quick to decide on the sale only less than 12 hrs after receiving the offer? Were they promised benefits after the sale? Like keeping their jobs, increased salaries, all these...?</p>
              <p>One has to suspect their motive for not allowing the club to take a further loan... Afterall, almost every EPL clubs have debts so what's so different with Liverpool?</p>
              <p>This case is getting very interesting...</p>

              <p>Well, the problem is that in the first place G&amp;H decided to saddle the club with the very debts they incurred to buy it.</p>
              <p>In other words, it was like taking out a mortgage to buy a HDB flat, only to give the mortgage to HDB and making them responsible for it.</p>
              <p>If they had taken full responsibility for the loans they took and paid for the interest out of their own pockets, all this would not have been an issue.</p>
              <p>One way or the other, one thing is clear: Come October 15, Liverpool FC must pay its debts to the bank, or the bank takes full ownership of the club. Whatever Gillett and Hicks does, the club will still be sold. And they cannot complain about this: the terms of the loan they took from the bank made this point clear.</p>

The real issue is, can a group of non owner so blatantly sells someone else's property without his consent? They put barrier in his way to seek alternative, and worst of all, sell it at an undervalued price? This is the real issue at hand and not administration or deducting 9 points... and certainly not whether they have enough money to inject into the club...</p>
              <p>And I agree that it isn't rocket science to know which to choose... That is why I said the 3 stooges could likely be getting kickbacks or other form of rewards once this goes through cos honestly, under $300 million for a club like Liverpool? Of course as a fan, one might be happy, but we should look at it from a business sense... The 3 stooges have nothing to lose here, not even one single cent. Only G&amp;H... So their gung-ho style has to be examine more closely. And if we do so, we can smell there is a rat in this episode. In other words, it's just <span lang="EN-GB">unethical.</span></p>

              <p>Simple explanation:</p>
              <p>Boardroom = People managing the club aka they are the people who decides the investment decisions of the club on behalf of the owners. They are<strong> supposed to act in the best interests of the owners</strong>, maximising wealth and profits for them.</p>
              <p>In this Liverpool case, apparently the board did not act in the best interests of owners, BUT whatever decision they took is still valid because they are the ones managing the club.</p>
              <p>Hence most probably what will happen is that the amount of money G&amp;H poured in excess into investing Liverpool or as loan will just be repaid to them. But the sale will still go through</p>

              <p>The Chinese businessman must rely on the High Court delivering a KO to the New England Sports Ventures' £300million bid for the club.</p>
              <p>And even then Huang would only have a slender chance of resurrecting his own bid.</p>
              <p>Huang, chairman of the Hong Kong-based QSL Sports Group, tried to buy the club in the summer, but pulled out after becoming disillusioned with the pace of the deal.</p>
              <p>There were suggestions on Tuesday night that Huang could still make a last-ditch return.</p>
              <p>But NESV have been given 'deal certainty', meaning they are the new owners subject to court approval - effectively stopping any chance of them being gazumped.</p>
              <p>Even if someone was to emerge before the High Court hearing with a cheque for double their £300m offer, the club could not re-open negotiations with another party.</p>
              <p>And with NESV having completed a rigorous due diligence process it is almost unthinkable to consider any late bidder getting the nod.</p>

              <p class=" gr3ox"><em>Putting up a fight: American Tom Hicks has vowed to hold on to power at Anfield</em><br></p>
              <p class=" gr3ox"> </p>
              <p class=" gr3ox"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Tom Hicks insists the </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> board have no right to overthrow him after vowing to hold on to power at Anfield.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hate figure Hicks and co-owner George Gillett are set to be forced to sell up to fellow American John W Henry in a £300million takeover deal.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The reviled pair have launched a legal challenge to prevent the sale, which will be resolved in the High Court in the next five days, but Anfield insiders are confident they will fail.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Chairman Martin Broughton has already revealed that the case is heading for the courts after insisting Hicks signed agreements not to oppose the sale when they received an extension to their refinancing deal with Royal Bank of </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Scotland</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> earlier this year.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">On Tuesday night, Hicks attempted to sack managing director Christian Purslow and commercial director Ian Ayre and install his own people in order to block the deal with New England Sports Ventures (NESV). Hicks and Gillett stand to lose a total of £144m if the takeover goes through.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After rejecting the attemped coup, which would have seen Hicks' son Mack and Lori McCuthcheon, of Hicks Holdings replace Purslow and Ayre, Broughton continued with the conference call board meeting even though Hicks had put the phone down.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The chairman is confident he and the other two England-based members of the board have acted appropriately but they will not be able to have that confirmed until the issue is thrashed out in court next week.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">But Hicks' New York-based spokesman Mark Semer said that Broughton's claim was disputed by the Americans.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">He told Bloomberg News: 'There were no such undertakings given to Broughton, the board has been legally reconstituted, and the new board does not approve of this proposed transaction.'</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In an email sent to a BBC 5 Live reporter, Hicks added: 'That's why there are laws and courts.'</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Asked how he and Gillett could halt the deal, Hicks then wrote: 'We have removed Christian Purslow and Ian Ayre.'</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The stage is set for a dramatic finale to Hicks and Gillett’s deeply unpopular three-and-a-half year reign after it was confirmed a High Court judge will hear evidence from them and the rest of the board before deciding whether the club can be sold. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Fears of a drawn-out legal wrangle were swept away when it emerged the case will  take place in the next five days and be concluded within a day. </span></p>

              <p><br>Yes, they appoint a chairman to try and sell the club but I don't think at an undervalued price like the one being mentioned right now. One cannot claim they are not able to repay on their debts as the bank have never recall their loans and even happy to extent it to earn more interest. There are dateline with each loan and the current one apparently is Oct 15 which is still a week away.</p>
              <p>One shouldn't confuse these two issue. The bank loan is a totally different thing altogether with what the sacked board is attempting to do. There is no clue to what the bank will do yet should G&amp;H remain as owners... They could probably be more than happy to extend their loan to them rather than lose their business to another bank.</p>
              <p>Many seem to assume that G&amp;H have not put a single cent into the club but as report as shown, they have actually put in $144m of their own money to be precise. Their arrival coinside with Pool spending one of the most in the premiership and certainly in their whole history. The arrival of Mascherano, Babel, etc... The report said...</p>
              <p>"Since the Americans bought Liverpool in 2007, they have made available close to £170 million to spend on new players, compared to Manchester City (£426 million), Tottenham Hotpsur (£177 million), Manchester United (£142 million), Chelsea (£112 million) and Arsenal (£71 million), according to figures from Transfer League"</p>
              <p>So to say they have not invest or the club had no money to buy players during their time as owners can't hold any water cos the club probably had more money to spent than at any time of their history... It also show that the club profits have increased during this time as well...</p>
              <p>The case here is about the 3 stooges attempting a coup to snatch power at the expensed of G&amp;H... They are doing it without a thing to lose, probably only their reputation. While G&amp;H we could say runs into hundreds of millions.</p>

                          League"</p>
              <p>So to say they have not invest or the club had no money to buy
                          players during their time as owners can't hold any water cos
                          the club probably had more money to spent than at any time of their
                          history... It also show that the club profits have increased during
                          this time as well...</p>
              <p>The case here is about the 3 stooges attempting a coup to
                          snatch power at the expensed of G&amp;H... They are doing it
                          without a thing to lose, probably only their reputation. While
                          G&amp;H we could say runs into hundreds of millions.</p>
              <p> and if i'm not wrong, the global financial crisis basically devalued almost everything?</p>

              <p>1stly, if i'm not wrong, the board hasn't been sacked yet from the club?...2ndly, the last we heard about hicks and gillett is that they are not able to pay off their loans with gillett defaulting on his part and hicks going around to borrow $$ from financial institutions...thirdly, mind enlightening me by showing evidences that they used their own $$ to buy players? lastly, club profits may have increased, but the debts due to them on the club have increased exponentially as well...to the point that the profits cannot cover the debts totally..</p>
