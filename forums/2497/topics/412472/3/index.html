              <p class="intro entry-summary">Singapore billionaire Peter Lim, who plans to make an improved bid for <a href="http://sgforums.com/football/liverpool/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Liverpool</span></span></a>, is a shrewd investor and football fan whose <a href="http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.comurl/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">name</span></span></a> is more often associated with <a href="http://sgforums.com/football/manchester-united/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Manchester United</span></span></a>, the Merseyside club's biggest rival.</p>
              <p>Lim, 57, ranked as the eighth-richest Singaporean with an estimated wealth of £1.01 billion by Forbes, has exclusive rights to own and operate a chain of Manchester United-themed restaurants and bars in Asia.</p>
              <p>Singapore-listed fashion retailer FJ Benjamin , in which Lim is the second-largest shareholder, previously operated the Manchester United Theatre of Dreams stores in the city-state.</p>
              <p>Lim, the son of a fishmonger, made his fortune as a stock broker and became a private investor in 1996. He keeps a relatively low profile and rarely gives media interviews.</p>
              <p>His key holdings include stakes in Wilmar International , the world's largest palm oil firm, and regional education provider Informatics , which he turned around after the firm had fallen on hard times.</p>
              <p>Earlier this month he invested about £63 million in Global Logistic Properties, a giant provider of warehouse facilities in China and <a href="http://sgforums.com/football/japan/index.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Japan</span></span></a> that is majority owned by Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC.</p>
              <p>People who know Lim said his interest in Liverpool stemmed from his love of soccer, and he recently donated S$10m (£4.82m)to the Singapore Olympics Foundation for scholarships for promising young athletes from poor families.</p>
              <p>But they added he would expect a financial return from Liverpool if successful with his bid and would not be content with just winning trophies.</p>
              <p>"He is a shrewd investor and a contrarian investor who has turned around companies," said Mano Sabnani, a former newspaper editor and head of investment research at one of Singapore's big three banks.</p>
              <p>"Liverpool is a brand name that has fallen on hard times... But if you take away the debt payments, the club is operationally profitable."</p>

              <div class="firstPar">
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>His advisers, the Wong Partnership, on Tuesday submitted a letter to the High Court detailing Lim's "surprise" at learning NESV had come to an agreement with </strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>'s three non-shareholder directors less than 12 hours after he was informed his offer was "preferred and superior". </strong></span></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>Paul Girolami QC, for Tom Hicks and others, revealed Lim had taken legal advice on the decisions taken by the club's directors between 3pm on Oct 5 – when Lim was informed he remained the preferred bidder – and when the agreement with NESV was struck.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>He has also submitted a request to discover whether the terms of his offer, which sources close to the billionaire believe was financially more attractive until NESV improved its own bid by promising to pay £10 million to the Royal Bank of Scotland in fees, were revealed to his rivals, breaching his confidentiality clause.</p>
              <p>Despite that, on Tuesday Lim improved his original bid, believed to be worth the £300 million NESV wishes to pay, to £320 million, plus £40 million for manager Roy Hodgson to spend in the January transfer window.</p>
              <p>Lim's offer, through his Meriton vehicle, would wipe Liverpool clear of debt and is funded entirely from the former stockbroker's own $1.6 billion (£1 billion) fortune.</p>
              <p>He said in a statement: "My offer pays off the existing owners' bank acquisition debt and also frees the club of its own bank debt. If the board accepts this offer, the monies are available immediately, thereby removing the threat of administration."</p>
              <p>Lim accepts he remains an outsider to land the club – his bid would be considered only if NESV walk away or Liverpool go into administration – but he is determined to push ahead with a deal.</p>
              <p>Though his background running Manchester United-themed cafés in the Far East is unlikely to impress Liverpool fans, it is thought, should he land the club, he would pull out of that deal when his contract expires in 2012.</p>

              <p><br>You can read more from the court case thread where G&amp;H has classified it as an ‘epic swindle’ and a ‘grand conspiracy’...</p>
              <p>I am not sure how too but it seems to me the English judge has gone with his heart rather than with his head and went with the more popular decision rather than the right one... And it now seems like RBS is the main instagator in this ‘grand conspiracy’... The 3 British non owner directors are just their stooges in this ‘epic swindle’ case...</p>
              <p>Oh well, I just hope after everything is done and dusted, either G&amp;H gets to keep the club (rightfully so) or it is sold to Henry and not Lim or someone else richer... Cos for me, going to Henry is like out of the fire and into the frying pan... lol.</p>
              <p>I belief if Henry wins and once everything have settle down. It won't be long before they will still be in debts to build a new stadium... That seems to be the American way of doing business...</p>

              <div class="sp-clear">Singaporean businessman Peter Lim has withdrawn his bid for Liverpool. The bid was reported to have been around £320 million, with £40 million available for the purchase of new players, but Lim has now decided to remove himself from the bidding process.</div>
              <div class="sp-clear">
              <p>In a statement, Lim claimed that Martin Broughton and the Liverpool board refused to consider his offer, despite it being better for the club than the one on the table from New England Sports Ventures.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">SINGAPORE tycoon Peter Lim has withdrawn from the race to buy Liverpool after becoming frustrated at having his offer ignored by their board.</h2>
              </div>
              <p>The Singapore business announced his decision today, claiming that the football club's board have no intention of selling to him.</p>
              <p>"It has become clear to me that the board is intent on selling the club to New England Sports Ventures to the exclusion of all other parties, regardless of the merits of their bids," said Lim. "In these circumstances, I am not able to proceed with my intention to acquire the club</p>
              <p>A high court ruling on Wednesday gave the Liverpool board the right to proceed with a £300m sale of the club to NESV, who also own the Boston Red Sox baseball team.</p>
              <p>However, the current owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks, who lost the case, later gained a temporary restraining order on the sale in a Texas court. The takeover case returned to the high court on Thursday as the board seeks to overcome the restraining order.</p>
              <p>Lim, who made his fortune through stockbroking, said he had received no response to his offer.</p>
              <p>"I have tried to engage constructively with the board and Royal Bank of Scotland based on an offer, funded from my existing resources, providing greater value for Liverpool Football Club, more cash for players, full repayment of all bank debts and a long term personal commitment to build a better future for the club and its supporters," he said.</p>
              <p>"The board and RBS have chosen not to respond or to discuss my offer with me. My representatives even offered to meet the board last night. This was ignored, although NESV was invited to attend that meeting."</p>
              <p>Lim said his interest in buying Liverpool could be revived if "current events cause the circumstances to change".</p>

              <p><strong>Former Liverpool owner Tom Hicks has reacted with astonishment at the sale of Liverpool to New England Sports Ventures, claiming he is "shocked" and "cannot understand the fans' anger".</strong></p>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>In an amazing interview, Hicks blamed an "internet terrorism campaign" for the collapse of a takeover from mega-rich multi-billionaires - on the scale of Manchester City.</p>
              <p>He also claimed an "organised conspiracy" by Liverpool and the Royal Bank of Scotland led to the sale of the club to John W Henry's company. He criticised chairman Martin Broughton, citing that he is really a Chelsea fan but simply wanted to be the man to hound both himself and George Gillett out of the club.</p>
              <p>Hicks said that Rafael Benitez had "lost the club".</p>
              <p>And he said the matter is far from over and all will come out in the courts.</p>
              <p>Asked how he felt about the sale, Hicks told <em>Sky Sports News</em>: "Shocked. Devastated. Frustrated. I'm very disappointed.</p>
              <p>"It's hurt my family tremendously. This is a very valuable asset that was swindled away from me in an epic swindle. I'm very angry about it.</p>
              <p>"This has been an organised conspiracy over many months. [Liverpool independent chairman] Martin Broughton wanted a good PR event in his life and be seen as the guy that got rid of those Americans - and he sold to another group of Americans.</p>
              <p>"I can't go into the details but I can confirm the funds were available to pay off Royal Bank of Scotland entirely but between Royal Bank of Scotland, the chairman and the employees that conspired against us, they would not let us.</p>
              <p>"They were people I thought were our friends, people I thought were loyal, and I was wrong.</p>
              <p>"We spent £300million on players, £150million net - I think it's the second or third highest in the English Premier League. You never read about that in the media.</p>
              <p>"I read a very interesting article in which Alex Ferguson said 'Rafa had more money to spend than the rest of us, he just bought bad players'.</p>
              <p>"Rafa lost the club. We didn't finish at the top - that's not the fault of the owners, we spent good money. Rafa has to take accountability for his own results.</p>
              <p>"When we finished second the year before, people weren't nearly as angry. Liverpool fans are just unbelievably strong supporters and they want to win.</p>
              <p>"I'm not a novice, I've been in sport for almost 15 years. Whether it's hockey or baseball in the US or soccer fans in Liverpool, people want to win.</p>
              <p>"My family members and I have been working very hard to solve the issue. We know there are better owners out there for the Liverpool Football Club than the Boston Red Sox group. We knew who they were. We were just frustrated that every time we had conversations with them we had people in our own organisation who somehow had those things not work out.</p>
              <p>"They conspired against us. They were people I thought were our friends, people I thought were loyal, and I was wrong. The process was continually frustrated by chatter about financial distress coming out of RBS.</p>
              <p>"The interested buyers that we knew would be the right type of buyers for the club - look what's happened to Manchester City now with their new ownership - that's the kind of buyer we were trying to find for Liverpool and those people were scared off by the distress chatter and the organised internet terrorism campaign that was directed against people involved.</p>
              <p>"I just want the truth to come out in the courts. Our desire was to get Liverpool into the hands of an owner who would be able to build a stadium and make Liverpool the top club in the world they deserve to be.''</p>
              <p>The 64-year-old Texan admitted that the debt he and Gillett had saddled on the club was "a little too much'', but he hit out at the Royal Bank of Scotland for attempting to drive through a sale too quickly.</p>
              <p>"Liverpool is a very healthy performing club which covers its interest fine," he continued. "It has a little bit too much debt, no question. But we were going to fix that and we were frustrated by others.</p>
              <p>On the angry protests from the club's fans he said: "I cannot understand the fans' anger.</p>
              <p>"I accept that fact that something went wrong in my ability to communicate with the fans and I'm saddened by it. I wish more people had the accurate information. It (the debt figures) have been a millstone because of the fans' reaction to it.</p>
              <p>"There's been so many inaccurate numbers about what our interest bill is - we've had plenty of operating income to cover our interest payments with a lot of room to spare.</p>
              <p>"We've invested. George and I put in $270 million into the club. We've spent nearly $300 million gross on players. About $150 million net on players and you never hear that in the media.</p>
              <p>"That disappears in all the noise and anger.''</p>
              <p>The delay over the building of a new stadium for the club was yet another subject to exercise fans' ire. Gillett claimed after taking over that "the shovel has to be in the ground within 60 days''.</p>
              <p>"George said that because that was our plan,'' Hicks said. "The design was done 10 years ago, we thought we were going to build it and planned to get that going in the first couple of months. When we presented the new stadium plans in August 2007, that fans who came up to the stadium liked them.</p>
              <p>"The people that wanted to be angry at Gillett and Hicks, that's one thing they picked up on. They didn't talk about the reality. We had the chance to build a world-class stadium in Liverpool and I hope the group that took the club today builds that stadium.''</p>
              <p>Hicks said the club was ready to start building in late 2008 when the global credit crisis hit and their funding was revoked.</p>
