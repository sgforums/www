              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Cesc Fabregas maintains the critics who wrote off
              Arsenal's title challenge before a ball had even been kicked "fired us
              up" for the campaign.</span></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Speaking to the March issue of the Official
              Arsenal Magazine, in an interview conducted ahead of last weekend's
              game, the Spaniard recalled: "It is true that people were taking us out
              of the top four at the start of the season, even placing us in the
              middle of the table.</p>
              <p>"I don't think it added pressure, in fact it probably helped us
              more because we wanted to everyone what we could do. It fired us up."</p>
              <p>Fabregas continued: "We knew we had the quality, we know what
              we can do. The important thing is always not what others believe, but
              what you yourself believe.</p>
              <p>"If we don't do well then people can say what they want - but
              if we do well, then that will be for everyone inside for the club and
              for the fans. That is who we are playing for, no-one else.</p>
              <p>"You want to win all the time and last season it was difficult.
              Each morning when you wake up and go to training, if you are in third
              or fourth position, it is not the same.</p>
              <p>"Now every morning when we come into training you feel ready to
              fight for the title, to take on the big teams, the big players, and
              that is why I really love being a footballer. For these moments."</p>
              <p>Fabregas believes the Gunners can draw strength from their
              position ahead of the chasing pack, but warned they "would be stupid"
              to believe the title was already in the bag.</p>
              <p>"We should take inspiration from being top. We have to try to keep the gap, and keep playing in the same way," he said.</p>
              <p>"We are not thinking it's all over, we would be very stupid to
              do that. We have to keep working hard and keep believing we can do it.</p>
              <p>"If we can win it it would be amazing considering the age of the team - it would be unbelievable.</p>
              <p>"For me to win the league at 20 years old, playing every game, that would be something unforgettable."</p>
