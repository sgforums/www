              <h1>Premier League Team Of The Season</h1>
              <h2>Who have been the stand-out performers so far this season?</h2>
              </div>
              <p></p>
              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> <strong>FORMATION: 4-4-2</strong><br><br><strong>GK: Joe Hart (Birmingham City)</strong><br><br>Loaned out by Manchester City so they could make the most of their new signing Shay Given, Joe Hart has done just as well for himself, with a superior defensive record to show for it.<br><br>In 18 games, he has kept five clean sheets and conceded just 18 goals. Mark Schwarzer, Brad Friedel and Petr Cech run him close, but Hart's rise to the occasion against the odds grabs him the spot.<br><br><strong>RB: Stephen Carr (Birmingham City)</strong><br><br>As
              captain of the most overachieving team of the season so far, with that
              achievement built largely on the success of a rookie-laden defence in
              which he is the sole elder statesman, Stephen Carr has made the
              right-back spot his own in this team.<br><br>Admittedly, there has been
              a lack of strong challengers from the bigger clubs as would have most
              likely been expected, but consistency, solidity and leadership have
              made Carr well worth his place.<br><br><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/62759hp2.jpg" alt="" width="100%"><br><br><strong>CB: Richard Dunne (Aston Villa)</strong><br><br>Another Manchester City 'reject' who is proving just what he can do elsewhere. Richard Dunne has been the mainstay in a formidable Aston Villa
              defence, and also bagged himself a couple of valuable goals in a team
              that has, at times, desperately needed them to maintain a rather
              fantastic start to the season.<br><br>He is a player who knows his
              limitations and is very much at home within Villa's current system. It
              seems last year's dreadful run was a mere exception to the rule of his
              outstanding consistency. Martin O'Neill must take due credit for what
              was seemingly a gamble that has paid off already, in spades.<br><br><strong>CB: John Terry (Chelsea)</strong><br><br>A
              World Cup year has brought out the best in England's captain on the
              pitch, despite continued news and rumors that are said to be
              compromising his position in his private life.<br><br>Chelsea's defense has been the best in the league, and with Petr Cech
              still prone to some high-profile errors, considerable credit for that
              must go to the defense, of which Terry has been its star performer.<br><br><strong>LB: Patrice Evra (Manchester United)</strong><br><br>The most hotly-contested position so far, as Ashley Cole
              could justifiably feel unlucky to be pipped by Patrice Evra at
              left-back. It was a close-run, but ultimately decided by the individual
              influence on the entire team, in addition to the circumstances in which
              each player performed as well as they did.<br><br>After last season, in
              which the Frenchman was not consistently at his best, he has, thus far
              this season, been the most fit and superbly consistent of an injury-hit
              United back line, and also proven as influential as ever attacking up
              the left flank.<br><br>
              </span></p><div><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/61573hp2.jpg" alt="" width="100%"><br></div>
              <br><strong>RW: Aaron Lennon (Tottenham Hotspur)</strong><br><br>There
              is now less and less talk of 'potential' when it comes to Aaron Lennon,
              as he has racked up eight assists in 17 games, three goals to boot and
              is regularly Spurs' most consistently threatening player going forward.<br><br>He
              has also broken through in the national team and, keeping up this kind
              of form, will surely make the right-wing slot and the No.7 shirt his
              own in South Africa.<br><br><strong>CM: Darren Fletcher (Manchester United)</strong><br><br>There
              was never talk of potential with Darren Fletcher. Almost from nowhere,
              even after being tempted to leave the club in months prior, the
              Scotland international has now become as good as first pick in midfield
              - particularly in big games.<br><br>His role in closing down opponents
              and also breaking forward to score the odd goal - three for the season,
              including two in the epic 4-3 Manchester derby victory - make him
              without doubt one of the surprise performers of the season so far,
              edging Michael Essien into this position on the over-achievement factor.<br><br><strong>CM: Cesc Fabregas (Arsenal)</strong><br><br>And if we were voting for a player of the season so far, there is little to no doubt that Cesc Fabregas
              would be the runaway leader in the polls. He is, as he usually does,
              leading the assists charts with an exceptional 12 assists in 16
              appearances, added to which he has netted an impressive seven goals -
              many of them spectacular, as well.<br><br>He's also captain of an
              Arsenal side many believe are overachieving - he is their main strength
              and creative outlet, and within his role in the team's system, is quite
              simply without a weakness.<br><br>
              <div><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/64358hp2.jpg" alt="" width="100%"><br></div>
              <br><strong>LW: Craig Bellamy (Manchester City)</strong><br><br>There were arguments over the summer between Craig Bellamy and Mark Hughes
              about former being deployed on the wing; but it was loyalty to his
              manager and an eagerness to succeed that kept him there despite the
              overwhelming influx of new strikers at Eastlands.<br><br>And it has
              been from left-wing that Craig Bellamy has been City's player of a
              so-so season so far. His energy has been invaluable, as has been his
              often overlooked terrific technique and eye for some good goals. Let's
              see what new manager Roberto Mancini does with the Welshman in part two of this Premier League season...<br><br><strong>ST: Jermain Defoe (Tottenham Hotspur)</strong><br><br>Jermain
              Defoe has been hitting the back of the net with regularity all season -
              most notably when he bagged a record-equaling five against Wigan Athletic. Indeed, he scores with some style and incredible power.<br><br>A
              quite crucial penalty miss and a needless red card have blotted his
              copy book to some extent, especially with Wayne Rooney, Darren Bent, a
              half-fit Fernando Torres,
              and a surprisingly fit Louis Saha all making good cases for inclusion.
              Ultimately, it has been Defoe who has had the season to remember... so
              far.<br><br>
              <div><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/63230hp2.jpg" alt="" width="100%"><br></div>
              <br><strong>ST: Didier Drogba (Chelsea)</strong><br><br>In 15 games, Didier Drogba
              has scored 13 goals and provided eight assists. Add to this the overall
              'monster' factor - which, unfortunately, does not translate
              statistically - and you have a player who is unplayable. As much of a
              cliché as the term may be, it has rarely been more appropriately
              applied than to the Ivory Coast talisman.<br><br>Chelsea have been solid all-round - including the under-appreciated and un-included Nicolas Anelka
              and Frank Lampard, whose goal returns have dropped from last season -
              but the one stand-out performer, in big games with big goals as always,
              has been Drogba. And now he's off to Africa for a month...<br><br><strong>IN NUMBERS . . .</strong><br><br><strong>England: 4 (Hart, Terry, Lennon, Defoe)<br>Ireland: 2 (Carr, Dunne)<br>Scotland: 1 (Fletcher)<br>Wales: 1 (Bellamy)<br>France: 1 (Evra)<br>Ivory Coast: 1 (Drogba)<br>Spain: 1 (Fabregas)</strong><br><br>England
              provides most individuals for the line-up, which will please those who
              wish to counter the argument that foreigners are taking over (or have
              taken over) the Premier League.
              There are four Englishmen in the XI and further British representation
              with a Scotsman and a Welshman. This is not the start of a joke. That's
              six of the XI and Ireland adds another two players to the list. <br><br>But
              the slightly more depressing factor might be that three foreigners -
              Evra of France, Fabregas of Spain and Drogba of Ivory Coast - are
              arguably the three best players in the XI. Certainly Drogba and
              Fabregas have been the star performers, by some distance.<br><br><strong>Birmingham: 2 (Hart, Carr)<br>Chelsea: 2 (Terry, Drogba)<br>Manchester United: 2 (Evra, Fletcher)<br>Tottenham Hotspur: 2 (Lennon, Defoe)<br>Arsenal: 1 (Fabregas)<br>Aston Villa: 1 (Dunne)<br>Manchester City: 1 (Bellamy)</strong><br><br>There
              is no club dominance in the XI, with Chelsea, United, Spurs and
              surprisingly Birmingham each having two representatives, while Arsenal,
              Aston Villa and Manchester City pitch in with one apiece.<br><br>Age
              is split throughout the XI. The youngest is Fabregas at 22, who is
              joined by Hart and Lennon of the same age but mere days, weeks and
              months older. Beyond that, the rest of the XI are up around 30, with
              Stephen Carr being the oldest at 33. The average age is a healthy 27.18.<p></p>
