              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>JOHN OBI MIKEL has warned Chelsea will take revenge for losing out on the title by winning the Champions League. The Blues midfielder is ready to sour Manchester United’s celebrations by beating them in Moscow next week.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Mikel, 21, said: “We know what happened last year when United won the league but we beat them in the FA Cup final. Now we need to repeat that. “We have to keep working hard and make sure that Moscow is a whole different ball game. “United have won the title so we have to go there and win the Champions League. It’s going to be do or die — but we have to win.”</p>
              <p class="article">The Londoners have become one of United’s bogey teams since Roman Abramovich bought the Blues. In the last 14 games against Alex Ferguson’s side, Chelsea have won seven, drawn five and lost just two.</p>
              <p class="article">Mikel added: “We know we are more than good enough to win in Russia but we have to work harder. “They’re a very good side — we all know that — but we have to wait and see what happens in the final. I think we will win it.” Mikel admits the pain of missing out in the Premier League will drive on the Blues.</p>
              <p class="article">Bolton snatched a last-gasp equaliser at Chelsea on Sunday just moments after Ryan Giggs slotted United’s title clincher at Wigan.</p>
              <p class="article">Mikel added: “There is a mixture of frustration and determination. It was a difficult game. “We knew how Bolton play and we knew coming into the game it was going to be difficult. "We can now think about Moscow but we didn’t want to speak about it too much on Sunday.</p>
              <p class="article">“What mattered after the Bolton game was to thank the fans. “We will now get down to thinking about the final. We have to keep working hard and win the Champions League.”</p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea’s season was hit by drawing seven games at Stamford Bridge. They also conceded late goals to Everton, Tottenham, Wigan as well as Bolton. Mikel admitted: “When you keep dropping points, you can’t expect to be at the top. “We’ve dropped a lot of points this season. Hopefully, the next campaign will not be like this.</p>
              <p class="article">“There have been a few times when we have lost concentration. It cost us two points again in the Bolton match. We have to correct that and make sure it doesn’t happen again. “But we have an excellent chance to finish the season on a perfect high if we win the Champions League. We believe we can do that.”</p>
