              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">PEPE REINA was left in despair when his last-minute cock-up cost 10-man Liverpool a dream Premier League start.</h2>
              <p>Keeper Reina scooped Arsenal striker Marouane Chamakh's header into his own net after the ball had rebounded off a post.</p>
              <p>His gaffe followed Joe Cole's straight red card on his Anfield debut, for a reckless challenge on Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny in first-half stoppage time.</p>
              <p>Kop boss Roy Hodgson admitted: "Pepe has taken it very hard.</p>
              <p>"He's a serious pro who believes in himself and the team. He had played very well considering he had not had a lot to do.</p>
              <p>"Pepe has had a shoulder injury but came back from that quicker than we thought.</p>
              <p>"But the negative to it is he's let in a goal he'd otherwise have kept out."</p>
              <p>It was heartbreaking for the hosts, who took the lead early in the second half through David Ngog's blistering shot - his fourth goal in three games.</p>
              <p>But when Tomas Rosicky's cross was nodded on by Chamakh, it came back off a post - only for the retreating Reina to bundle it over the line.</p>
              <p>Liverpool veteran Jamie Carragher, 32, insisted: "It's a real kick in the teeth for any team, even if it had been 11 versus 11.</p>
              <p>"But Pepe is the best goalkeeper in the world. He was our player of the year last season but we all make mistakes.</p>
              <p>"It's very disappointing but, at half-time, we would have taken the draw."</p>
              <p>More drama was to follow when Koscielny was given his marching orders - for two bookings - in injury time.</p>

              <p>joe's tackle was very much not needed, but let's move on. he had
                                      a bad debut, and we have to live on with it, doesnt matter. no
                                      point going into debate, it wont change anything. on yesterday's
                                      performance, i think we suck in the first half, but did better in
                                      the beginning of the 2nd half. then after, when we got the first
                                      goal, the concentration was only on defending, bad ; real bad i
                                      would say. that's no such thing in football, nvr stop going forward
                                      till the ref put the game to an end. by doing so, we're just
                                      telling arsenal that we're so fearful of them scoring against us,
                                      we should be the aggressor, the game is at anfield mind you!</p>
              <p>reina had a bad day, one of the worse i ever seen during his
                                      time with liverpool. he's good as almunia yesterday, totally
                                      rubbish. overall, we did not improve on last season's performance.
                                      the way roy set the players out was exactly like what rafael did.
                                      dirt on right wing, agger at left back, playermaker behind striker.
                                      what's the use of getting roy in if things remain unchanged? a
                                      disappointing display in conclusion. if the tactics were to remain
                                      like yesterday's for the rest of the season, we're still going
                                      downwards, no way up.</p>

              <p>It wasn't that bad lah... You must take into consideration they played with only 10 men for the whole 2nd half and there was even a moment 9 only when something happened to Agger...  The way it ended can be disappointing but the result should be seen as a good one for the problems they faced... Cos it could have been worse had Rosicky took his shot better instead of so near the keeper...</p>

              <p>maybe i'm feeling damn bad about the loss of the extra 2 points. but what angered me most about yesterday's game was the approach after we scored one. everyone was sitting back, none made the effort to attack, i dont know whether it is roy's instruction to play it this way, but this is so frustrating.</p>
              <p>it seems that, liverpool is waiting for that something to happen rather than wanting to make that thing happen. as much as i know, football isnt something that you can leave it to the fate of god, you got to fight for the victory yourself, and as for yest, im delighted with way ngog scored but disappointed at the way we 'waited' for the victory to come.</p>

              <p>If i am the manager yest, i would scream to the lads at full time. because they dont know what is the best way to defend, not to park a bus, not to keep pressure going. it's to keep attacking!</p>
              <p>fine with me even if the kop choose to park a bus, but please park properply, not half heartedly, come on, pressure every single movement by arsenal. our defence line did well, but not wings. we need to improve.</p>

              <p>The best performance in ages so far from Liverpool. Gerrard seems to be a different player compare to last season. Mascherano was brilliant. Ngog getting better but still think that he is not good enough for LFC.</p>
              <p>If Rafa was in charge, the goal will never come once Joe Cole red carded...good to see they keep attacking even after a man down. Can only get better after 4-5 games playing together as a team!</p>

              <p>I thought liverpool's defending was excellent....they were tight and players in disciplined positions. Only problem was why send so many of those long balls up front?</p>
              <p>Arsenal lost out once again due to their youthful inexperience. Wilshere lost the ball and then Ngog scored. But their passing was fluid as usual.</p>
