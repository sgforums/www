              <p>Bordeaux striker Marouane Chamakh has confirmed he will join Arsenal at the end of the season and revealed he rejected offers from Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Chamakh is out of contract this summer and it has long been assumed he will move to Emirates Stadium, with Arsene Wenger saying last month that there is a "good chance" he will arrive.</p>
              <p>"There were approaches from Liverpool, Tottenham and crazy offers from Russia that were much bigger than those from England, but I was focused on playing in the Premier League," Chamakh told <em>L'Equipe</em>.</p>
              <p>"Bordeaux offered me a contract extension that was almost impossible to refuse, financially - the figures were very close to those offered by Arsenal.</p>
              <p>"I have always loved Arsenal's football. I know I will have to adapt, but I have experience of playing the short passing game from working with Yoann Gourcuff."</p>
              <p>He added: "I am counting down the days - 11 short days. As time passes, it feels strange. I am experiencing many emotions."</p>

              <p>Arsene Wenger has vowed to strengthen his squad this summer with the Bordeaux hitman expected to be his first acquisition.</p>
              <p>And speaking to French newspaper <span style="font-style: italic;">L'Equipe</span>, Chamakh, 26, said: 'There were approaches from Liverpool, Tottenham and offers of madness from Russia which were much greater than those from England. But, I was focused on playing in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>'I have always loved Arsenal's football. I know I will have to adapt, but I have experience of playing the short passing game from working with Yoann Gourcuff.</p>
              <p>'I count the days, 11 short days. As time passes, it feels weird. I feel many emotions.' </p>
              <p>Wenger was expected to sign Chamakh last summer but opted against the move due to the hefty price Bordeaux demanded for their player, who had just one year to run on his contract.</p>

              <p><strong>Chamakh added that it was a risk to stay with the French club, who progressed to the last eight of the Champions League this season, albeit a risk that was justified.</strong></p>
              <p>'I took a risk to stay with one year left on my contract, but I never cheated, I gave myself thoroughly.</p>
