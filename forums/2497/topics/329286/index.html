              <h2>Roma’s Norwegian international full-back John Arne Riise has penned
              a heart-felt open letter to Liverpool fans all over the world following
              his transfer from Merseyside to the Eternal City this summer.</h2>
              <div class="C">
              <p>John Arne Riise, something of a cult hero among
              Liverpool fans during his seven successful years at Anfield, left the
              club in the summer for AS Roma as it became clear his first-team
              opportunities under Rafael Benitez would become increasingly restricted
              following the manager’s transfer dealings.</p>
              <p>Now Riise has written the following letter, published on Liverpool’s
              official website, liverpool.tv, to the Reds fans with whom he was so
              popular…</p>
              <p><br>“Dear fans of Liverpool FC, <br><br>“After seven seasons at
              Anfield, it's time for me to "walk on". In many ways it feels inspiring
              and exciting to be familiar with the pressure of a new employer, meet
              new fans, meet a new culture and play a new kind of football. I look
              forward to this new adventure, but I travel with a loss. <br><br>“Because,
              it's not easy for me to leave you - the world's best supporters! I've
              been thinking about this almost every day this summer. After seven
              wonderful seasons, and more than 340 matches for Liverpool, I never had
              the opportunity to make a real and proper goodbye with you - the
              world's most motivating fans. You have always supported me and the team
              and I want you all to know how important you've been to me and the
              other players. <br><br>“I've been giving my "thank you" to the club,
              the staff and the players and they'll always have a special place in my
              heart. And this is my thank-you letter to all the fans out there that
              have been supporting me during these years. I will follow the team
              closely from Italy and will stay in touch with many of the players and
              many of my friends in Liverpool. <br><br>“With respect to the many
              hundreds of great moments I have experienced in red, it will be unfair
              to draw up one highlight rather than another. There has always been the
              highlight of wearing the red shirt at Anfield. It's always been a
              privilege to have the initials LFC on the space closest to the heart.
              As you all know I was a player who always, no matter what, gave 110 per
              cent in every training session and every game. I always tried to give
              you the entertainment you deserved. Even in the bad moments you were
              there for me and the team. <br><br>“To play in front of the red crowd,
              every minute has been a privilege. Even after my unfortunate own goal
              against Chelsea in the Champions League semi last April - where all our
              dreams were crushed - I felt the support and sympathies from you as
              real and important. When I signed seven years ago, I couldn't in my
              wildest dreams expect the journey you all gave me. I will always be
              grateful for that. A big thank-you to you all. <br><br>“I'm 100 per
              cent sincere when I say that I will always remember all the great
              moments we've had and you - our fans - have such great importance for
              these great matches and great moments. Liverpool FC will have a lot
              more great moments like this in the future and I hope that I will
              experience great things with my new team - AS Roma. I hope you will
              continue to follow my career. <br><br>“Therefore, I do not say goodbye, but so long. Arrivederci - Walk on! <br><br>Sincerely, <br>John Arne Riise <br>"The ginger".</p>
