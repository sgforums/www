              <h1>Manchester United Comment: One More Year For Paul Scholes, But No More 'Big Four' Battles</h1>
              <h2>His contract extension is deserved, but he must be used selectively...</h2>

              <div><br></div>
              <p>Paul Scholes’ Manchester United career is to be extended by another year, but his time going toe-to-toe with the Premier League’s best must come to an end.<br><br>Reports
              have stated that Sir Alex Ferguson has rewarded his veteran midfielder
              with a new 12-month contract to continue his 15-year spell at the club.
              While his signature has yet to be sealed, the extension is just reward
              for a man who continues to be a valuable member of the squad.<br><br>Alongside
              fellow senior citizens Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville and Edwin Van der Sar,
              the 35-year-old is still a regular fixture on the Premier League
              champions’ team sheet. Scholes was meant to wind down his career in the
              humble environs of his hometown club Oldham Athletic in League One, but
              on current form he more than merits his place at the highest level.<br><br>Twin
              strikes against CSKA Moscow and Besiktas has prompted the manager’s
              decision, as well as a performance against Tottehnham Hotspur which
              rewound the clock, at least until he was red-carded.<br><br>The sending
              off isn’t the only blot on his copy book this season. Effortless
              displays against Spurs, Wigan Athletic and Stoke City have been
              tempered by his public struggles when selected to face the tough
              tackling units of Liverpool and Sunderland.<br><br>Thrown in at the
              deep end against the tenacious duo of Lucas and Javier Mascherano at
              Anfield, Scholes was swamped by their attentions. Never blessed with
              the engine and size of many of his contemporaries, he previously made
              up for the imbalance with a street fighter’s aggression and ballerina’s
              touch.<br></p>
              <div><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/60104_hp.jpg" alt=""><br></div>
              <div><strong>Class is permanent</strong> | Scholes worth his weight in goals</div>
              <p><br>Age
              has robbed him of the turn of speed and tenacity that made him capable
              of trading blows. Even the flawless touch can fall away when
              pressurised by men capable of making him play the game at a speed his
              ageing legs are not used to.<br><br>Ryan Giggs’ supreme physical
              capacity has hardly been diminished, but for the asthmatic Scholes,
              this problem has been extenuated in recent years.<br><br>United’s
              terrible 2-0 defeat at Anfield was followed by a 1-0 setback against
              Chelsea. While United were never at the races in Merseyside with
              Scholes in place, a team flush with terriers outfought the Blues on
              their turf.<br><br>Ferguson seemed to have learnt from the harsh lesson
              dealt. For nearly all of Scholes’ period at the hub of the
              all-conquering machine, he has been in the starting side for the top of
              the table clashes that led to the league title residing in the Old
              Trafford trophy cabinet.<br><br>The ‘Ginger Maestro’ can now only play to his own tune against the rest, because the best will destroy his rhythm.</p>

              <p>it will be a sad day when these players no longer take to the field
              after all the beautiful football they have played and being an integral
              part of taking United to the glory achieved.In any other career one is
              now at one's peak- in football you are on your way down. These are
              going to be very difficult shoes to fill.We will miss them.</p>
