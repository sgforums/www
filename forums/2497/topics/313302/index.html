              <p><strong>Liverpool midfielder Javier Mascherano has been banned for a further two matches and fined £15,000 following his behaviour after being sent off in the game against Manchester United on March 23, the Football Association have confirmed.</strong></p>
              <p>Mascherano was banned for one match after being shown two yellow cards by referee Steve Bennett at Old Trafford. But the Argentinian has been banned for a further two games after he continued to protest after being shown the red card by the official.</p>
              <p>Mascherano admitted a charge of improper conduct and has been punished further by the FA, with the additional suspension coming into effect immediately. Mascherano - who missed the derby victory over Everton as a result of the dismissal - will now also miss this weekend's clash with Arsenal and the home game with Blackburn on April 13</p>
              <p>Following the announcement Liverpool confirmed that they will consider their options before deciding whether to appeal the decision. A club spokesman told www.liverpoolfc.tv: "Although we received a fair hearing we must now decide whether to appeal on the basis of inconsistency of sentencing for Javier based on past precedents."</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">It's a fair Kop, says Javier, I deserve to be banned.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_04/079mascherano_468x638.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Javier Mascherano has issued a public apology for his dissent towards referee Steve Bennett and indicated a willingness to accept the extended two-match ban and £15,000 fine dished out on Thursday by the FA. Though Liverpool may yet appeal against the extent of his additional punishment, the Argentina midfielder was full of remorse as he reflected on his hearing before a disciplinary panel, acknowledging that he had been in the wrong.</strong></p>
              <p>Mascherano, who was outstanding once again in Liverpool's 1-1 Champions League draw at Arsenal on Wednesday, will miss the Barclays Premier League matches against Arsenal on Saturday and Blackburn, unless Liverpool challenge the ruling.</p>
              <p>In an exclusive interview with Sportsmail on Thursday night, he said: 'I apologise to everyone. I made a mistake and I regret this mistake. It was my fault. 'I am not a dirty player, I do not make a habit of showing disrespect towards referees, I don't like this and I can only think the high intensity of the fixture, against Manchester United, affected my behaviour that day. It was out of character but I do not use that as an excuse.'</p>
              <p>Mascherano is not the sort of player you expect to see chasing officials. He has an excellent disciplinary record and takes pride in his sweeping style of tackling. 'It is a bad thing when you let down your team-mates and leave them to play with 10 men, especially against Manchester United,' he said. 'They have been supportive and so have the Liverpool fans, but it didn't take away the pain. Looking back at that game, I was wrong to approach the referee. I approached him to talk to him but I understand this was not a good idea.</p>
              <p>'I reacted badly to the red card because I could not believe what was happening to me. 'I must learn my lesson but move on from this and forget what has happened. I hope people know that I try to be fair and that I have no intention to be aggressive. 'I have to concentrate on the matches I can play in and stay focused on the Champions League. We have enjoyed a very good result against Arsenal and I am very much looking forward to the second leg.</p>
              <p>'It is time for me to move forward but not to forget the lessons from the past and the match at Manchester United. 'Off the field it has been a difficult time for me. My disciplinary record has been good until now but I have to show that again. I always try to respect decisions by the referee and this is important.'</p>
              <p>Though Mascherano accepted every refereeing decision without complaint at the Emirates on Wednesday, and appeared keen to draw a line under his brush with authority, Anfield officials consider an additional two-match suspension to be excessive in comparison to similar cases.</p>
              <p>Arsenal striker Emmanuel Adebayor staged a long protest after being sent off in last season's Carling Cup Final against Chelsea, while Watford's John Eustace was just as reluctant to leave the pitch after being dismissed last month.</p>
              <p>Both players had their automatic bans extended by only one match and Liverpool are unhappy that Mascherano appears to be paying what they feel is an unfair price for stepping out of line in the midst of a crackdown on player conduct.</p>
              <p>Ashley Cole's show of contempt towards Mike Riley, in turning his back on the Leeds referee after being booked in Chelsea's 4-4 draw at Tottenham, highlighted the need for greater respect towards officials.</p>
              <p>While firmly in favour of any campaign to curb player dissent, Liverpool feel Mascherano has been made a scapegoat for the misdemeanours of others and are contemplating an appeal before Friday's noon deadline against the second of his two-game ban.</p>
