The players and fans would have gone mad if they had found out what I was up to."<br><br>The bugging took place during the reign of disgraced Toon bosses Freddie Shepherd and Douglas HallÂ—both caught by the News of the World in a Spanish brothel ridiculing players and fans in 1999 in a soccer scandal that became known as Toongate.<br><br>Last night ShepherdÂ—ousted as Newcastle chairman in a summer takeover by sports shops tycoon Mike AshleyÂ—ADMITTED he found out about 52-year-old Tough's phone tapping in 2004 after it happened.<br><br>But the portly 65-year-oldÂ—who walked away from Newcastle with Â£37 million and is believed to be considering buying into Leeds UnitedÂ—said Toongate Two was nothing to do with him.<br><br>"Tough did make me aware of what he had done but I did not condone it," he said. "I couldn't control what he did. He didn't work for me. I had nothing to do with bugging anybody."<br><br>However he failed to pass this information about illegal activities at his club onto police.<br><br>Tough was employed by former Newcastle vice-chairman Douglas, Sir John's son, as a security consultant in 1994. He was paid through Cameron Hall Developments. Douglas, 47, was the chairman of this property development company, which had been set up by his Sir John.<br><br>ToughÂ—who doubled up as a bodyguard for DouglasÂ—told us: "I was the man tasked with carrying out the dirty work. I personally arranged bugging operations.<br><br>"I didn't do this off my own bat. I knew what I was being asked to sort out was potentially illegal, but at the time I was just so happy to be in with the club and so I went for it."<br><br>The price was Â£3,000 a time in cash for a phone tap to be placed on a victim's lineÂ—plus a monitoring fee of around Â£500 a day.<br><br>"Any juicy tapes were immediately to be brought to my contact at the club. I even played some of the tapes in boxes at St James' Park," claimed Tough.</div>
