              <p><strong>Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia is in danger of losing his place to his bitter rival Jens Lehmann after Arsenal suffered yet another dreadful defensive mix-up in their 2-2 draw at West Bromwich Albion. </strong></p>
              <p>The 41-year-old former Germany keeper, who was brought out of retirement last week as emergency cover for an unprecedented injury crisis at Arsenal, looked on from the bench as Almunia charged from his goal in the 61st minute to meet a long ball, only to collide with Sebastien Squillaci.</p>
              <p>The ball bounced kindly for Peter Odemwingie, who rolled it into an open net.</p>

              <p><strong>The Spaniard looked distraught by his latest gaffe and Lehmann could now be called on to make a dramatic return in two weeks' time for the home match against Blackburn.</strong></p>
              <p>Almunia - dropped after an error-strewn performance in a shock 3-2 home defeat against the same opponents in Sseptember - has only returned because of injuries to Lukasz Fabianski and Wojciech Szczesny, but is now in danger of being axed again.</p>
              <p>The error came just weeks after the awful confusion between Szczesny and Laurent Koscielny gifted Birmingham their winner in the Carling Cup final.</p>
              <p>Arsenal fans again looked on in disbelief yesterday, but manager Arsene Wenger, who failed to agree a deal for Fulham keeper Mark Schwarzer last summer, declined to criticise his players.</p>
              <p>'I don't want to go into individual criticisms,' said Wenger. 'The players who were involved know what dignity is about. What was good was the reaction the whole team has shown with their fighting spirit and it will be interesting until the end because we are ready to focus and ready to fight.'</p>
              <p>Almunia looked set to leave the club in the January transfer window but Arsenal were unable to tie up a move.</p>
              <p>He injured an elbow in the dreadful display against Albion in September but came back into Wenger's team when first Fabianski was ruled out with a shoulder problem and then Szczesny dislocated a finger against Barcelona earlier this month.</p>

              <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Wenger's goalkeeping woes<br></h2>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">MANUEL ALMUNIA (Appearances: 13)</p>
              <p>Started season as No1 after failed bid to sign Mark Schwarzer from Fulham but has suffered injury and horror shows against West Brom</p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">LUKASZ FABIANSKI (Appearances: 20)</p>
              <p>Took Almunia’s place but was soon dubbed ‘Flapihandski’ and replaced after shoulder injury</p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">WOJCIECH SZCZESNY (Appearances: 17)</p>
              <p>Showed promise but 20-year-old soon followed his elders, dropping a clanger in the Carling Cup final at Wembley and getting injured</p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">VITO MANNONE (Appearances: 0)</p>
              <p>Italian played last season but has been at Hull on loan this term and, guess what, he’s also injured</p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">JENS LEHMANN (Appearances: 0)</p>
              <p>Brought out of retirement, aged 41, the former Arsenal keeper (left) is Wenger’s only option if he’s ready to axe Almunia again. The German is no stranger to gaffes himself, with his costliest blunder coming when he was sent off in the 2006 Champions League final.</p>
