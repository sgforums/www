              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Cesc Fabregas launched a furious verbal attack on the match officials in the tunnel during </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Arsenal</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">'s 2-1 win over </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Everton</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> on Tuesday, allegedly calling their integrity into question. </span></strong></p>
              <p>Everton manager David Moyes refused to reveal what the Arsenal captain said as the players left the pitch at half-time, only saying Fabregas would have been sent off had he made the comments on the pitch.</p>
              <p>However, it is alleged the Spaniard shouted in the direction of the officials: 'How much have you been paid?' He then allegedly accused an opponent of cheating.</p>
              <p>Tempers were frayed in the first half when Louis Saha fired Everton into the lead with a controversial goal that Moyes agreed should have been ruled out for offside.</p>
              <p>Fabregas made his comments from afar and referee Lee Mason chose not to report the incident to the FA when he was quizzed on the matter on Wednesday. It will go no further unless Everton lodge an official complaint.</p>
              <p>Fabregas said: 'All I can say is that I have respect for all match officials. Their job is a very difficult one and their decisions are final.</p>

              <p><strong>'Yes, I was upset at half-time. So too were about 60,000 Arsenal supporters in the stadium. Players from both sides were saying things as we came off the pitch.</strong></p>
              <p>'I'm passionate about this club and like all the players want to win every single match, so many things are said in the heat of the moment.'</p>
              <p>Arsenal will be without Samir Nasri for three weeks and are waiting to discover the extent of the injury sustained by Alex Song against Everton.</p>
              <p>Theo Walcott will be fit to face Newcastle on Saturday despite hurting an ankle in the game. Lukasz Fabianski may need an operation on an injured shoulder this week, which could keep him out until November</p>

              <p>Corruption exists everywhere. It is linked to the Mafia.</p>
              <p>Anyway, it looks like anti-MUFC fans will have another chant to use when Howard Webb officiates a match dominated by the Red Devils.</p>
