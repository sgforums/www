Donning a flat cap and puffing on a pipe, the Liverpool skipper stunned his team-mates as he trundled into the party venue on an 5mph electric scooter. Still buzzing from netting three goals in his team's 5-0 FA Cup thrashing of Luton, Gerrard joined the rest of the team for their belated Christmas party. </strong><br><br>One passer-by was fooled by Stevie's brilliant disguise and offered to help the England midfielder from the four-wheel chair outside Sports Bar England in Liverpool city centre. One reveller said: "This old looking guy drove up to the door in this electric scooter so I just thought he was a bit confused and offered him help. "Next minute some of the players in the bar shouted it was Steven Gerrard in the chair." "Afterwards they were calling him Steven Geri-hatric after his three goals. I was gobsmacked and totally fooled because it was a hell of a disguise."<br><br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/01_03/crouch1701_468x626.jpg"><br><span class="small">Peter Crouch dressed as a penguin pictured at the Liverpool football club fancy dress party</span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><strong>The players put the Kop giants' off-field turmoil behind them for the night as they partied the night away in the plush haunt on Stanley Street. Gerrard may have been the driving force of the fancy dress team, but it was fellow Scouser Carra who had the X-factor.</strong><br><br>The defender dazzled in a glittering silver suit and wig as he went as tele-crooner Rhydian. The reality tv theme was kept us by the Dane Daniel Agger, who turned up more looking like Big Bro livewire Pete Burns than a punk rocker.<br><br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/01_03/lpoolfancydress111701_468x342.jpg"><br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/01_03/lpoolfancydress11701_468x342.jpg"><br><span class="small">Left to right: Jamie Carragher as Rhydian from X Factor, John Arne Riise as Batman and Xabi Alonso as Del Boy</span><br><br>And the hilarious party was doused with a touch of controversy when Mail midfielder Momo Sissokko stormed in as terror chief Osama Bin Laden. Spanish midfield maestro Xabi Alonso sipped lovely bubbly in a Del Boy outfit and Peter Crouch sparked fits of giggles went as a 6ft9 penguin.<br><br>Norwegian John Arne Riise flew in as Batman - but disappointingly there was no Batmobile - while striker Dirk Kuyt claimed to be the King. Only spoilsports Fernando Torres, Yosi Benayoun, and Alvero Albeloa chose to go in their own clothes. Flying Dutchman Ryan Babel made a less-than-impressive effort to be Hollywood Star Will Smith in jeans and a black tracksuit top.<br><br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/01_03/livfancydress2111701_468x342.jpg"><br>Left to right: Harry Kewell (with his Emmerdale star wife Sheree Murphy) as a marathon runnner, Daniel Agger as a punk, and Fabio Aurelio as Sporty Spice<br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/01_03/lpoolfancydress211_468x340.jpg"><br><br>The only noticeable absentee was boss Rafa Benitez as the players partied into the early hours, feasting on food and drink from the menu at the bar owned by Jamie Carragher.<br><br>The team then crossed the road for a lock-in at Aldo's bar - where they joined owner and ex-Kop hero John Aldridge for more drinks. There Carra grabbed the mic and blasted out a hilarious impression of Rhydian and Kuyt tried to take off Elvis in a Stars in your Eyes style singing contest.<br><br>An onlooker said: "Carra couldn't resist getting up on the mic but he was dressed as Rhydian so I think he felt obliged to. "Although I don't think the Welshman will be quaking in his boots judging by that performance. "I would have loved to have been sitting at the players' table it looked like they were having a whale of a time."<br><br></div>
