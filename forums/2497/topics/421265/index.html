              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Sky Sports</em> presenter Richard Keys and pundit Andy Gray were 
              both dropped from the channel's coverage of Chelsea's Premier League 
              game against Bolton on Monday night following the sexism row that has 
              swamped the pair.</p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto">
              <p class="photoDesc"> </p>
              </div>
              <p>Keys
               has telephoned assistant referee Sian Massey to apologise for his 
              off-air remarks about her at the weekend, a Professional Game Match 
              Officials spokesman confirmed.</p>
              <p>The PGMO confirmed that Keys had telephoned Massey. She accepted the 
              apology and is now keen to move on from the matter, and will be an 
              assistant at the League Two match between Crewe and Bradford on Tuesday 
              night.</p>
              <p>Controversy arose after the <em>Mail on Sunday</em> was passed a recording of an off-air discussion the two men held during
               Saturday's game between Wolves and Liverpool, about female official 
              Sian Massey. Keys was recorded as saying "somebody better get down there
               and explain offside to her", while Gray agreed, saying of female 
              officials: "they probably don't know the offside rule".</p>
              <p>Gray 
              further criticised former Premier League assistant referee Wendy Toms 
              and Keys took issue with a column by Karren Brady in Saturday's <em>Sun</em> in which she commented on the level of sexism in the game. Keys said: 
              "See charming Karren Brady this morning complaining about sexism? Yeah. 
              Do me a favour, love."</p>
              <p>Their comments have generated plenty of 
              reaction with Sports Minister Hugh Robertson even weighing into the 
              debate when saying he was "disappointed to hear these comments at a time
               when we are trying to get more women participating in football."</p>
              <p><em>Sky Sports</em> has now responded to the outcry provoked by the pair's comments by 
              dropping them from the coverage of Monday night's game at the Reebok 
              Stadium.</p>
              <p>Barney Francis, managing director of <em>Sky Sports</em>, 
              said: "It has been made clear to each of them that their comments were 
              totally unacceptable. I have spoken directly to both Richard Keys and 
              Andy Gray this morning.</p>
              <p>"Those views are inexcusable, entirely 
              inconsistent with our ethos as a business and employer, and will rightly
               offend many of our customers, our people, and the wider public. They 
              are inexcusable from anyone at <em>Sky</em>, regardless of their role or seniority.</p>
              <p>"We
               have dealt with this matter by taking immediate disciplinary action. As
               with any employee it would not be right to go into detail on those 
              proceedings. However, they have been clearly warned about their 
              behaviour and reminded of their responsibilities. In addition, Richard 
              and Andy will not be involved in any way with tonight's live Monday 
              Night Football."</p>
              <p>Massey made a good call when adjudging Raul 
              Meireles was onside in the build-up to Liverpool's first goal at 
              Molineux, and the FA has issued a statement backing its female 
              officials.</p>
              <p>The statement read: "The FA has made real strides in 
              encouraging both male and female match officials to enter the game at 
              every level, and will continue to offer every encouragement to all 
              officials within the football family to progress to the highest levels 
              possible.</p>
              <p>"We are proud to have some of the world's best match 
              officials, both male and female. Overall the number of female referees 
              in England (Levels 1-8) stands at 853 and climbing, and all of our 
              female match officials act as fantastic ambassadors for the game. They 
              have our wholehearted and continuing support."</p>
              <p>Referees body 
              Professional Game Match Officials issued a statement from general 
              manager Mike Riley which read: "All PGMO referees and assistant referees
               are appointed on merit and ability. They are assessed on their 
              performances only."</p>
              <p>On Monday, Brady responded to the controversy when telling the <em>BBC</em>:
               "It makes my blood boil, if I'm absolutely honest. Forget myself for a 
              second, because what was said about me is a personal opinion and 
              everyone is entitled to that. What really upsets me is the fact only 
              females in our industry are judged by their gender. And that is 
              categorically wrong.</p>
              <p>"I'm genuinely disappointed. It never would 
              have occurred to me that they had those views, whether public or 
              private. It almost makes it worse that they're speaking when the 
              microphones are not on as opposed to when they are on, because (they 
              have) never really had the brass neck to say it publicly, they would 
              only say it privately. I have heard it and I don't believe it is just 
              banter.''</p>
              <p>England captain Rio Ferdinand has also come out to support Massey on his <em>Twitter</em> account, saying: "What's wrong with a woman being an official in a 
              football game? I'm cool with it. All that counts is do they get the 
              decisions right.</p>
              <p>"I'm all for women refereeing in football, 
              discrimination should not happen in our game at all...prehistoric views 
              if you think otherwise."</p>
              <p>FIFA-listed referee Morag Pirie has told 
              the duo to ''get with the times'' as she urged women not to be 
              discouraged from getting involved in the game.</p>
              <p>''That attitude you
               think would have gone out years ago, but it's obviously still there,'' 
              she said. ''How can that sort of attitude encourage more women to take 
              up refereeing?</p>
              <p>''You need encouragement for women and men to do 
              these sports. They should try
              it themselves and see what it's like. It's a hard enough job as it is. 
              Some men need to get with the times. More women are doing jobs that men 
              used to do and are being judged on their ability and skills.</p>
              <p>''If 
              there are girls out there who want to take it up then they should. Men 
              get negative comments as well, you just need to block them out.''</p>
              <p> </p>

              <h1 class="h2">Gray leaves Sky Sports</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pundit Andy Gray has left <em>Sky Sports</em> in the aftermath of his controversial comments on female officials.</p>

              <p><em>Sky</em> has confirmed it has terminated his contract in light of "new evidence of unacceptable and offensive behaviour".</p>
              <p>Along
               with presenter Richard Keys, Gray was caught off camera making 
              controversial comments about assistant referee Sian Massey ahead of 
              Liverpool's 3-0 victory over Wolves on Saturday.</p>
              <p>Keys suggested 
              that "somebody better get down there and explain offside to her", and 
              Gray added: "They probably don't know the offside rule".</p>
              <p><em>Sky News</em> released footage on Monday evening of Gray in conversation with <em>Sky Sports</em> reporter Andy Burton. Burton, who has now been stood down, referred to 
              Massey as a "bit of a looker" while Gray again said she would be unaware
               of the offside rule.</p>
              <p>Keys has since telephoned Massey to apologise and, although Gray had not been in contact, a <em>Sky</em> spokesman said: "It wasn't a case of Andy not apologising. It doesn't really make sense for both of them to call."</p>
              <p>However, after footage emerged of Gray joking that <em>Sky Sports News</em> presenter Charlotte Jackson should help him to tuck his shirt in, he has now left the company.</p>
              <p>It is believed that Massey has been stood down from the League Two game between Crewe and Bradford on Tuesday night.</p>
              <p><em>More to follow...</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>NoooO!!!! No more Andy Gray T.T</p>
