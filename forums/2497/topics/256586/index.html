            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/Beckham.jpg"><br><br><strong>DAVID BECKHAM has received his first call-up under boss Steve McClaren. McClaren has named the midfield ace in his squad for FridayÂ’s Wembley friendly against Brazil and the crucial Euro 2008 qualifier in Estonia five days later. McClaren said: "We've got a very big game in Estonia coming up that we have to win and I've got to pick a squad capable of doing that. "That's why I've picked David."</strong><br><br>McClaren revealed Becks was over the moon at his recall. He said: "David was absolutely delighted as I knew he would be. "He is coming into form and deserves to be here. "Winning away at international level is very difficult anywhere and we need as much experience as we can get." McClaren attributed Becks' recall to his form during the second half of the season. He added: "Since Christmas his form has been very good, I think he can help us win in Estonia and that's why I picked him. "I feel at this moment, that for the Estonia game, we need experience and David certainly provides that.<br><br>"He is in very, very good form. The team needs that. "David comes back as David Beckham the player, that's what we want on the field, doing what we know he can do." It marks an incredible turnaround for Becks, who was ditched when Mac announced his first squad 288 days ago.<br><br>There was also a strong hint at the time that the former skipper, 32, would never play for England again. But BecksÂ’ part in Real MadridÂ’s revival, coupled with EnglandÂ’s poor form under McClaren has forced a change of heart. The recall may cause a split in MaccaÂ’s backroom staff.<br><br>Assistant Terry Venables does not believe it is the right route to go down and some reckon the midfielder can no longer be considered for international duty when he completes his move to MLS side LA Galaxy this summer. Yet Becks, who has 94 caps, believes he can still do a job for his country - wherever he is playing.<br><br>He has earned rave reviews, and, according to Madrid coach Fabio Capello, Beckham is in the "best form of his life". "I told David the other day that I thought he has never been in such good form either mentally or physically and he agreed with me." "I can't understand how a player who is playing so well can be left out of any national side," said Capello. He said: "I'll be a lot fitter when I play in LA. At least as fit as I am now, maybe more fit. "The training will be difficult in America with the humidity so I still feel I'd be able to play for England." A successful comeback might open the door for a possible loan deal back to England over the winter so he can keep ticking over ready for the Euro 2008 finals, if the Three Lions qualify.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Steve McClaren has denied David Beckham's England recall is a panic measure and revealed that but for injury the Real Madrid winger would have been in the squad for the past two internationals, against Israel and Andorra. Poor performances in those games brought abuse from supporters and accusations that McClaren was stubbornly refusing to consider the former captain he dropped last summer, but the coach now says he began to rethink his plans drastically after the friendly defeat by Spain at Old Trafford in February. </strong><br><br>McClaren dropped Beckham on the grounds that he wanted a change of direction and thought he had plenty of younger, quicker alternatives. Recalling him now looks like a panic measure to get fans back onside and help win what has become a make-or-break qualifier in Estonia a week on Wednesday, not to mention creating extra interest in the friendly against Brazil at Wembley on Friday. But McClaren insists he changed his mind on Beckham three months ago, after the 1-0 defeat by Spain.<br><br>'This is certainly not a panic measure because David would have come into contention for the last two games but for his knee injury,' McClaren said. 'The Spain game was a big disappointment, the get-together and the whole week was disappointing, and we had a major reassessment of where we where. It was clear things needed changing and David came into the reckoning then.'<br><br>This explanation sounds reasonable, yet plenty of questions arise. When McClaren says 'we' he means himself and his assistant, yet Terry Venables is understood to have reservations about bringing Beckham back. Some of the senior England players are believed to think the same, while the younger set will interpret the U-turn as an indication that they have failed. but McClaren simply has no need to think of the future. He believes Beckham can help the team win in Estonia and on the evidence of performances without him he could well be right.<br><br>'You can't talk about the future because you can't think beyond Estonia,' McClaren said. 'The situation we are in is that I need to pick a team to win in. Estonia and I know David can help us do that. There's no point looking any further ahead. I still think my decision [to drop him] was the right one at the time and I wouldn't go back on it, but I always said I wouldn't close the door on anyone. 'I haven't been able to see David play live, but I've monitored his progress. He's fit and strong and playing well, he has shown great appetite since the New Year, and I believe he will strengthen the team. I met him about 10 days ago, had a chat, he was passionate about playing and that's what we need. Michael Owen and Alan Smith are just the same.'<br><br>With 32-year-old Beckham on the right and Joe Cole on the left, and presumably Owen partnering Peter Crouch up front (Wayne Rooney is suspended), the absence of the injured Owen Hargreaves brings up another dilemma for McClaren, the return of the Steve Gerrard-Frank Lampard question. He can play the pair together if he wishes, but history suggests he might be better ditching one of them and bringing in Michael Carrick. Lampard missed out in the last game while Gerrard scored two goals and was credited with turning the game around, so it looks as if the Liverpool captain is here to stay. And in his preferred central role.<br><br>'Initially we had Stevie G on the right, but I've looked at things and I now see him as a focal figure in the middle of the park,' McClaren said. There will of course, only be one focal figure in England's next two games, and it will not be Gerrard. If nothing else, McClaren must be hoping Beckham's return and England's performances spare him from the ferocious abuse he received in Barcelona two months ago.<br><br>'That was a bad night, but sometimes you have to go through adversity,' he said. 'The criticism we took after Andorra made me even more determined to get it right and give the fans a team to be proud of. I'm not looking for sympathy, there's no head in the sand from me, we have got to get better and we know that. I was pleased with the response from the players against Andorra, people really stepped forward in that second half. It wasn't a pleasant experience but I'm hoping it was a watershed, and we can now start pulling together and getting results.'<br><br></div>

The Liverpool winger had been hoping to be involved in this weekÂ’s friendly against Brazil, and the European Championship qualifier against Estonia the following week.</strong><br><br>It would have completed a remarkable 12 months for the one-time Arsenal youngster who ended last season being relegated with Birmingham City. Â“For me personally it has been a real turnaround,Â” he said. Â“To play in the Champions League final and to finish third in the Premiership, I couldnÂ’t have expected any more.<br><br>Â“After losing in the Champions League final, it would have been a great pick up to be selected by England. Â“I hope I am knocking on the England door. If you are not knocking on the door playing in a Champions League final for Liverpool, then there must be something wrong. Â“The Champions League has been good for me as a player. I wasnÂ’t fazed to play in the final.Â”<br><br>Now Liverpool and Pennant must attempt to translate their Champions League form into more Premiership points to place the heat on Manchester United and Chelsea next season. Pennant believes the Reds lost their way against the lower sides. He said: Â“When you are playing the lower teams, they make it difficult for you, and maybe we donÂ’t show as much respect for them as we should have. You get a bit complacent.<br></div>

The Liverpool winger had been hoping to be involved in this weekÂ’s friendly against Brazil, and the European Championship qualifier against Estonia the following week.</strong><br><br>It would have completed a remarkable 12 months for the one-time Arsenal youngster who ended last season being relegated with Birmingham City. Â“For me personally it has been a real turnaround,Â” he said. Â“To play in the Champions League final and to finish third in the Premiership, I couldnÂ’t have expected any more.<br><br>Â“After losing in the Champions League final, it would have been a great pick up to be selected by England. Â“I hope I am knocking on the England door. If you are not knocking on the door playing in a Champions League final for Liverpool, then there must be something wrong. Â“The Champions League has been good for me as a player. I wasnÂ’t fazed to play in the final.Â”<br><br>Now Liverpool and Pennant must attempt to translate their Champions League form into more Premiership points to place the heat on Manchester United and Chelsea next season. Pennant believes the Reds lost their way against the lower sides. He said: Â“When you are playing the lower teams, they make it difficult for you, and maybe we donÂ’t show as much respect for them as we should have. You get a bit complacent.<br>[/b]</blockquote>because Pennat, you did not perform.<br><br>so what if you are in the UCL finals, if you can't perform, you can't be selected.<br><br>No doubt football is a team game, but it is also down to individual's brilliance that wins games.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/BeckGerr.jpg"><br><br><strong>STEVEN GERRARD needs only one word to sum up David BeckhamÂ’s return for England . . . brilliant. Steve McClaren named the Real Madrid star in his squad to face Brazil on Friday and Estonia next week. Despite suggestions some of the squad are unhappy at BecksÂ’ call-up, Gerrard is 100 per cent behind boss MaccaÂ’s decision.</strong><br><br>The Liverpool skipper is a big admirer of Beckham and was disappointed when he was axed by McClaren last August. The pair have an enormous respect for one another and Beckham even sent Gerrard a Â‘good luckÂ’ text before last WednesdayÂ’s Champions League final against AC Milan. And Gerrard, 27, is not backing the former skipperÂ’s return just because it will mean he gets to play in the centre of midfield instead of on the right, either.<br><br>He believes it is absolutely the right thing for the country. A friend of GerrardÂ’s said: Â“Stevie is a big Beckham fan. Â‘He is looking forward to his comeback and thinks it is brilliant. He believes it will give the team a real boost.Â” Still, Beckham was made to sweat by McClaren before his return was confirmed. The manager only told him the news 45 minutes ahead of Satur-dayÂ’s official announcement. He rang Becks, 32, in Madrid to deliver the news he was back to face Brazil and Estonia in the crucial Euro 2008 qualifier. The pair chatted only briefly, but after hearing the words Â‘you are in the squadÂ’ Beckham was ecstatic.<br><br>Ruud van Nistelrooy was among the first of BeckhamÂ’s close pals to be told the news by the grinning former England captain. And Beckham celebrated his call-up with an electric display, setting up two goals in a 3-1 La Liga victory over Deportivo La Coruna.<br><br>Now Dutch ace Van Nistelrooy, who also formed a devastating partnership with Becks at Manchester United, believes his Madrid team-mate has made a mistake by bowing out and going off to play in America too soon. Van Nistelrooy, 30, shares many peopleÂ’s fears that BecksÂ’ move to LA Galaxy this summer will bring his career at the highest level to a premature end. The Dutch hitman said: Â“I feel itÂ’s too early for David to be going to America. Â“With the level heÂ’s at now he can continue it for a lot of years, but IÂ’m not sure he can change it around now.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t know if it will damage his game, weÂ’ll have to see how things go. But at the moment he is at his best, the players around him benefit from that and itÂ’s very enjoyable for him too.Â” Becks agreed his move to the US in January when he was an international outcast and could not get a game for Real.<br><br>On Saturday night he walked off with his name echoing around the Bernabeu after inspiring RealÂ’s 3-1 win over Deportivo which kept them top on goal difference from rivals Barcelona. He is now just two games away from grabbing his first silverware in in four seasons in Spain. But first, Becks is finally ready to add to his 94 England caps.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>PETER SHILTON, EnglandÂ’s most-capped player, says David Beckham should be barred from the 100 Club. Becks, 32, is set to make his 95th appearance for his country against Brazil on Friday after his recall. And he has been promised a chance to make it to his ton if he continues to shine in Estonia next month.</strong><br><br>But Shilts, who won 125 caps, said: Â“Once a manager has made the decision to leave out one of his major players he should not go back on it. Â“Steve McClaren felt Beckham wasnÂ’t the player he once was. "It was a big decision but one I agreed with. I donÂ’t see what has happened to alter that opinion.Â”<br><br></div>
