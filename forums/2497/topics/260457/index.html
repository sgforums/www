            <div class='col-md body'>Blues Scout Doubts Nani Ability<br><br>Chelsea scout Piet de Visser has had a dig at Manchester United, claiming new signing Nani may not be good enough for the Premiership.<br><br>De Visser has been asked by Blues owner Roman Abramovich to identify young talent to bring to Stamford Bridge, but has cast doubt on whether United's big-money signing can cut it in the English league.<br><br>Dutchman De Visser admits the 20-year-old midfielder has huge potential, but reckons his crossing lets him down and claims he holds onto the ball for too long.<br><br>De Visser, who recommended John Obi Mikel to Chelsea, told The Sun: "This boy is, as far as his skills are concerned, a super talent.<br><br>"He had his training with Sporting Lisbon and technically he is so good, he is almost perfect.<br><br>"But I also stress that despite all his talent he may not be right for the Premier League.<br><br>"His crosses are sometimes OK, sometimes bad.<br><br>"He dribbles too much with the ball because he wants to entertain, not because he wants to be effective.<br><br>"Cristiano Ronaldo had the same problem when he first played for United."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Quite true though, Nani probably needs to work on his crosses, then, he would be a force together with C.Ronaldo and explode to the world stage, just like what C.Ronaldo did, then! Suddenly, Man U's wing would be one of the best!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe in EPL history, Fergie and Wenger are top managers who can get most out of their players esp youths.<br><br>And Fergie has the knowledge/experiences of working with youngsters, look at Giggs, beckham, Ronaldo, Rooney, most importantly also, the know-hows of nuturing/supporting them when they are in a slump. See how Beckham, Ronaldo and Rooney bouncing back from a dismay WC.<br><br>That's great advertisements for all youth players, "hey, this Fergie guy can protect and shelter, unless others".<br><br>So I think Nani is in good hands.<br><br>Yes, perhaps like the Blue Scout said, he is not good enough, but I believe Fergie has spotted some quality in him and willing to polish him.<br>Rem, Ronaldo only managed to shine after a season in MUFC.<br><br>And Nani has a few role models like Giggs, Ronaldo, Scholes to follow.<br><br>Perhaps everyone is too focus on Nani's rawness, but Fergie has seen the final product, like a master.  Well, time will prove everyone.. a flop or a diamond?!! We shall see.</div>
