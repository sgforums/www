            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Football Association will decide this weekend whether to hand Stuart Pearce the England Under-21 job on a full-time basis.</strong><br><br>Pearce took the Under-21s to the semi-finals of the European Championships earlier this month and is the frontrunner for the new position.<br><br>Although the tournament in Holland was his sole focus, Pearce was appointed in a part-time capacity in January before he lost his job at Manchester City the day after the Premier League season finished.<br><br>The plan is for the new Under-21 boss to have a wider role in youth development, with Ray Clemence also having an instrumental part with England's younger age groups.<br><br>Sir Trevor Brooking, the FA's director of football development, said: "I had a discussion with Stuart, and made recommendations, and this weekend there's the board meeting.<br><br>"We hope to have some news next week. It's a full-time position with the Under-21s, with other additional work with Academies, centres of excellence, looking at the teams to work the way through.<br><br>"Ray (Clemence) is head of the national teams, and Stuart would have a key role to work with Clem to identify individuals to fast-track.<br><br>"Stuart would also go out to a lot of clubs, deal with senior coaches as well as Academy coaches. Steve (McClaren) already goes out. So with two people with their credibility, that would help the club-versus-country issue which can be sensitive."<br><br>The relationship with clubs was tested in the build-up to the recent European Championships, with Gabriel Agbonlahor failing to contact the FA to confirm his call-up. Aston Villa boss Martin O'Neill blamed mis-communication.<br><br>David Bentley then pulled out of the squad - leaving them a player short for the tournament - citing fatigue after a gruelling season with Blackburn.<br><br>The coach's role being on a match-by-match basis or on a short-term contract was seen as a contributing factor to the perception of the Under-21s, prompting calls for a permanent man to be in place.<br><br>England boss Steve McClaren wanted a full-time Under-21 boss when he was appointed last summer, although the FA board never finalised the appointment meaning Sammy Lee was not offered the job he was earmarked for.<br><br>Brooking added: "We need a steer from the board and where we would get funding.<br><br>"We have to decide: A, can Stuart do it. B, does he want it. And C, who else is involved?<br><br>"We could resolve it sooner, or maybe later. I am conscious that Stuart wants to know what he is doing as well."</div>
