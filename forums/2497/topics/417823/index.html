              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p><strong><img title="Utd are Ji-Sung merrily on high" src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01183/PARK-SPLASH_1183612a.jpg" alt="Utd are Ji-Sung merrily on high" width="516" height="250"></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong> </p>
              <p><strong></strong> </p>
              <p><strong></strong> </p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson hailed Park Ji-sung for his matchwinning efforts as Manchester United beat Arsenal at Old Trafford on Monday night - then revealed the South Korean is set to miss seven games due to international commitments. </strong></p>
              <p>Park's excellent first-half header proved to be the difference as United marched two points clear at the top of the Barclays Premier League, with a game in hand.</p>
              <p>It should have been more than 1-0 too as Wayne Rooney missed a penalty 17 minutes from time.</p>
              <p>Indeed, Ferguson's only disappointment was that he must soon say goodbye as he competes for his country at the Asia Cup in Qatar.</p>
              <p>"Ji is in fantastic form," said Ferguson. "Unfortunately we are going to lose him for seven matches after December 26. It is disappointing."</p>
              <p>It is the second time in as many months United were indebted to Park, whose injury-time goal secured victory against Wolves in November.</p>
              <p>United still had to shred a few nerves after Rooney skied a spot-kick over the bar. "I have never seen him put one over the bar before," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>Nani also went close with a couple of opportunities, while Arsenal's only real chance came when Edwin van der Sar pushed a Samir Nasri shot into the path of Marouane Chamakh, only for skipper Nemanja Vidic to make a vital block.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Grounds for complaint: A familiar sight as Arsene Wenger protests on the sidelines</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>"Manchester United defended very well, but technically, the quality of the game was average," said Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, before outlining his unhappiness with the surface. </strong></p>
              <p>"We were not quick and sharp in possession. That was partly down to their defending but also the quality of the pitch.</p>
              <p>"If I ask you for a good or a bad pitch, what do you say? "They made technical mistakes as well. The pitch is not good enough."</p>
              <p>Arsenal have now gone seven games without a win against United and have a similarly poor record in their encounters with Chelsea, who they face at the Emirates Stadium on December 27.</p>
              <p>Not that Wenger was inclined to rise to the bait of such an apparent failing. "Calm down," he declared. "You have to be realistic and objective and not necessarily reach big conclusions.</p>
              <p>"I am here to analyse one game. You have to give credit to Manchester United for their defending."</p>
              <p>Wenger did reserve praise for 20-year-old keeper Wojciech Szczesny, who did well on his Premier League debut after a shaky start.</p>
              <p>"He didn't make any mistakes," said Wenger. "If you can do the job, the size of the game is not important.</p>
              <p>"I saw Edwin van der Sar playing in big games when he was 18." Van der Sar could not be keeping clean sheets at a more important time.</p>
              <p>After their own stuttering start, United have now taken 20 points from their last 24 and know victory at Chelsea on Sunday would make them overwhelming favourites to reclaim their title and secure a record 19th championship.</p>
              <p>"We have a difficult game against Chelsea on Sunday but it is also a very important game," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"We had to play well tonight, but we have been playing well. "The first-half was excellent and we should have done better on the counter-attack in the second.</p>
              <p>"But our back four did really well. They are really getting their form now. "If they maintain that consistency, we will have a good chance."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">SAMIR NASRI has ordered Arsenal to put away their 'flashy clothes' and start winning ugly in the Premier League.</h2>
              <p>The midfield star, who has been named French Footballer of the Year, reckons some of his team-mates are too worried about delivering glittering individual performances.</p>
              <p>Instead, in-form Nasri wants the Gunners to start producing more effective, workmanlike displays - even if they are not as pleasing on the eye.</p>
              <p>Nasri, part of the Arsenal team beaten 1-0 at Manchester United on Monday, said: "Goals and flamboyant football don't pose a problem for me.</p>
              <p>"The essential thing, though, is my team wins and we're in it at the end.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes you have to store away your flashy clothes in the cupboard and work for the team.</p>
              <p>"It was more of a tactical game against United, where you had to defend a lot. Patrice Evra was attacking well and combining well with Ji-Sung Park.</p>
              <p>"We were much more adventurous in the second half, given the fact we also had to respond after they took the lead.</p>
              <p>"In the first half, we sat back and waited for them a bit. We didn't want to push too high up, because they always find each other in space, whether it's Park or Wayne Rooney playing on his own up front.</p>
              <p>"We wanted to sit back and wait for them and we held out well until we conceded the goal four minutes from half-time.</p>
              <p>"We came back into the match and had one or two chances to score but, unfortunately, just couldn't do it."</p>
              <p>Nasri also admitted he had words with Evra following his fellow Frenchman's criticism of Arsenal before the clubs' latest showdown.</p>
              <p>He added: "I don't want to get involved in controversy too much. I spoke to Patrice a bit before the game and told him these are things he shouldn't have said and that the best answer is always given out on the pitch. To beat us and show they are the better team.</p>
              <p>"We've shown we're a good side but there's no point talking now. We'll see in May if we're champions or not.</p>
              <p>"It was a very physical match from both sides, a very tactical game without a lot of chances created.</p>
              <p>"We stood up well to the physical challenge but, sadly, lost this match to a small detail. It's a shame."</p>
              <p>Nasri won his Footballer of the Year award by topping a poll run by France Football. Chelsea's Florent Malouda was second.</p>
