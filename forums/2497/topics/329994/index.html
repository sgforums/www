              <p><strong>Liverpool new boy Vitor Flora has played down any suggestions that
              he was signed purely on the back of a YouTube video of his skills.</strong></p>
              <p>The deadline day arrival admits footage of his work initially
              alerted a Reds representative to his talents but insists there was
              still much to be done before he could earn a dream switch to Merseyside.</p>
              <p>The 18-year-old forward, who has an Italian passport, is delighted
              to be at Anfield after clinching a free transfer move from Botafogo.</p>
              <p>"The English football is the one most desired by all players and one
              of the most difficult to succeed in," he told Gazeta Esportiva.</p>
              <p>"I am very happy here. I already felt that Liverpool were great and
              now, knowing the structure and organization more closely, the club has
              become even greater.</p>
              <p>"I have already had four training sessions with the first team and I participated in a friendly against them on Friday.</p>
              <p>"Although the majority of them are with their international teams,
              it was a great experience as, before, I had only been working with the
              ball or possession.</p>
              <p>"I am not afraid of pressure. I think there is also pressure in the big teams in Brazil.</p>
              <p>"I have received tremendous support from Lucas and Fabio Aurelio since I came here and also Diego Cavalieri.</p>
              <p>"Rafa Benitez is like a father figure, I say, a good person and very simplistic.</p>
              <p>"It was the videos that prompted a representative of Liverpool to
              take an interest in my football and to go and see the training and the
              games.</p>
              <p>"So these videos were just the beginning. The representative was
              interested and then assessed my performance, watching the games, seeing
              my performance in training and analysing my behaviour on and off the
              field.</p>
              <p>"As a representative of a great club, he analysed me and came to the conclusion that I could go to Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"Hence, the controversy of the videos does not concern me. Those who
              comment do not speak knowingly and think it was just based on that
              video."</p>

              <p>I don't expect to see Senor Flora playing for the first team this year.</p>
              <p>In fact , I think he will spend a few years in the reserves and then go to another European side.  It must be too cold and wet in Liverpool for the boys from Brazil and Argentina!</p>
