And Alan CurbishleyÂ’s men, backed by Eggert MagnussonÂ’s dosh, are happy to pay his Â£70,000- a-week wages to help save them from relegation.<br><br>West HamÂ’s move came as they feared missing out on Chelsea winger Shaun Wright-Phillips, despite agreeing a Â£9.8m fee. Ljungberg, 29, was stunned after being told he was no longer wanted by Arsenal and still has two years left on his current deal.<br><br>Curbs has also made a move to bag the GunnersÂ’ Cameroon full-back Lauren, 29, on loan.<br><br></div>

Now Ljungberg is ready to demand that Arsenal pay the remaining 18 months of his Â£65,000-per-week contract if they want him out that badly.<br><br>A close friend explained: "Freddie did not see it coming at all. He knows he's not had a great season with injuries but he expected to be given time to recover. "Instead he was told that Arsenal have to sell in order to buy and that he is one of the players to go.<br><br>"From what they have said it's not about where he wants to go, but where he's told to go. He was told in no uncertain terms he should take any offer that is on the table, otherwise he will not play again."<br><br>Ljungberg was stunned to be told last week that he is surplus to requirements after more than seven years service to the club he joined in 1999.<br><br>West Ham are known to be interested in him but Ljungberg is more likely to favour a move across north London to bitter rivals Tottenham - if they are prepared to meet his wage demands. But with Arsenal having revealed their hand the Swede's price may go down, with a figure of Â£3m likely to secure his services.<br></div>

Ljungy will stay. he's a loyal man </div></blockquote>He is loyal but Arsenal don't want or need him anymore... sad end for him after all that he has done for them...<br><br><span style="color: olive;">It is not the first time that Arsenal have lost patience with one of their high-profile players. Just last season the Arsenal board called time on Sol Campbell after a series of dramas involving the Â£100,000-a-week star.<br><br>Now Ljungberg appears to be paying the penalty for a run of injuries that have restricted him to a total of 54 appearances and three goals in the last 18 months. The marauding midfielder originally signed for Arsenal in 1998 from Halmstads for just Â£3million and two years ago signed a new lucrative four year deal which made him one of club's highest-paid players on around Â£70,000 a week.<br><br>That was the 29 year old's reward after he became one of boss Arsene Wenger's key players, helping the Gunners win two Premiership titles, three FA Cups and three Charity Shields.<br><br>He also played in last season's epic 2-1 Champions League Final defeat against Barcelona. But long spells out injured have made his bumper pay packet-which is twice that of rising young star Cesc Fabregas-look even more expensive to the Gunners.<br><br>And now they have taken dramatic action. Our source added: "Freddie will be very sad to leave Arsenal but he'd like to stay in the Premiership and feels he still has plenty to offer an ambitious club." </span><br></div>
