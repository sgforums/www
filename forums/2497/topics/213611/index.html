IÂ’m sure we can cope with it, we just need time to adjust to its high tempo.<br><br>Â“When we met Alan Pardew, the decision to sign was simple. He made us both feel really wanted.<br><br>Â“That was another attraction for coming here. The manager explained there is a great team spirit at the club and we want to be a part of that.Â”<br><br></div>
