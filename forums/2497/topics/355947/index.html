              <p class="small bold"> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">IT was a good weekend for Arsenal.</h2>
              <p class="article">A 4-1 victory at Wigan, coupled with Everton’s 3-3 draw at Aston Villa, means 
                  the Gunners look nailed on to finish fourth in the Premier League.</p>
              <p class="article">It seems everybody at The Emirates is happy — at least happier than they were 
                  a few months ago.</p>
              <p class="article">But I am not.</p>
              <p class="article">I am obviously pleased my old club have moved closer to qualifying for next 
                  season’s Champions League. But I am also saddened that finishing fourth in 
                  the top flight is seen as something of an achievement at Arsenal these days.</p>
              <p class="article">Is that enough?</p>
              <p class="article">Arsenal should be challenging for trophies, especially the Premier League 
                  title.</p>
              <p class="article">Unfortunately the Gunners have not looked like winning anything for ages. The 
                  last time they picked up a trophy was in 2005 when they won the FA Cup by 
                  beating Manchester United on penalties.</p>
              <p class="article">Four years without winning a trophy is not good for a club like Arsenal.</p>
              <p class="article">I know a lot of Gooners who are a bit peeved with the situation. But they have 
                  kept the faith because they believe manager Arsene Wenger is the Messiah.</p>
              <p class="article">For long spells this season they must have wondered if that faith was 
                  misplaced as their team looked like they would finish outside the top four. 
                  Now that really would have been a disaster.</p>
              <p class="article">Arsene maintained his confidence in his squad and the return of key players, 
                  such as Cesc Fabregas, Emmanuel Adebayor and Theo Walcott has coincided with 
                  an upturn in his team’s fortunes.</p>
              <p class="article">And while fourth place is no reason to celebrate, Theo’s form is.</p>
              <p class="article">Sven Goran Eriksson’s decision to include him in England’s 2006 World Cup 
                  squad before he had even kicked a ball for Arsenal was a jaw-dropping 
                  moment.</p>
              <p class="article">I was surprised Arsene rubber-stamped the debacle. It could have ruined the 
                  youngster’s career.</p>
              <p class="article">But, inadvertently, Theo seems to have benefited from the experience.</p>
              <p class="article">That is not down to Sven, who deserves no credit for Theo’s development. It is 
                  down to the work Theo and Arsenal have done on dealing with hype and 
                  becoming a better player.</p>
              <p class="article">It’s great to see the way he has developed from a shy teenager into one of the 
                  Premier League’s best young players.</p>
              <p class="article">I must admit there were times when I wondered if he would fulfil that 
                  potential. Arsene has had to be patient with him and played him on the wing 
                  for his own protection.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">That was so frustrating because while Theo could beat any full-back for pace, 
                  he never had a trick in him.</p>
              <p class="article">I have always believed he would be better playing as a striker. That view has 
                  not changed.</p>
              <p class="article">Not only does he have the pace to frighten defenders, but he is a great little 
                  finisher too.</p>
              <p class="article">I have racked my brains trying to figure out a frontman he is comparable with 
                  — and I cannot find the answer.</p>
              <p class="article">That’s because he is unique. There is no other forward like him.</p>
              <p class="article">I am sure he could play there for Arsenal and, in the not too distant future, 
                  for England.</p>
              <p class="article">Who knows? With Theo down the middle, supported by a few more quality 
                  signings, the Gunners might actually win something.</p>
              <p class="article">And that really would be something to celebrate.</p>
