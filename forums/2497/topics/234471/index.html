            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p143/zococl/Wenger.jpg"><br><br><strong>Arsene Wenger has hinted he may make a late move in the transfer market to ease the strain of Arsenal's increasingly lengthy injury list.</strong><br><br>Wenger had insisted he would not sign any new players before the transfer window closes on Wednesday night because he was happy with his squad. But Brazilian midfielder Julio Baptista became the latest Gunner to be struck by the injury jinx when he suffered a groin injury in Sunday's 1-1 FA Cup fourth round draw against Bolton.<br><br>Emmanuel Eboue, Alexander Hleb, Robin van Persie, Freddie Ljungberg and William Gallas are already sidelined, forcing Wenger to consider changing his transfer plans. Asked after the Bolton match if he would make a signing in the three remaining days of the window, Wenger said: "That is a good question, but I cannot give you an answer.<br><br>"Normally I would say no, we won't do anything, but we have lost van Persie and we will see what Baptista has. "I would see it as a panic buy because it was not planned." If Wenger does do any business, it will be completed by the time Arsenal meet Bolton again for their replay at the Reebok Stadium on February 14.<br><br>Arsenal needed a late goal from Kolo Toure to rescue them after Kevin Nolan had given Bolton the lead early in the second half.<br><br>Wenger's side have won just one of their last eight meetings with Bolton and, after being beaten at Allardyce's side at the same stage of the competition last season, they will not relish another trip to the Reebok Stadium, where they lost 3-1 in November.<br><br>With Arsenal also playing PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League a week after their Valentine's Day date with Bolton, Wenger is unsure if he will field a full-strength side at the Reebok.<br><br>Bolton's superiority over Arsenal in recent seasons is a source of great pride for Allardyce, who also revealed that Kevin Davies may miss Wednesday's match against Charlton after suffering a foot injury. He added: "We have a game plan to set out by stopping a side in every department. We needed to expose their weaknesses and we did that often."<br></div>

For $12m, you would have expected him to be more ready for the present... Andrew Johnson only cost Everton $7 or $8m and that Watford player only cost Villa $9.8m and he is playing 1st team liao... No wonder Wenger hardly use him...</div>

But that was back in November, and since then there has been little to speak of. So little, in fact, that he was virtually nonexistent in last Wednesday's Carling Cup semi-final first leg at Spurs despite the 2-2 scoreline.<br><br>Yesterday he produced little to disprove Wenger's feeling that the wide man could do with a goal or a performance to inject some renewed belief into his game. On several occasions during the first half he was unable to negotiate Bolton's Ricardo Gardner, who pretty much reduced the former Saint to a spectator.<br><br>In the second half when Walcott was handed the chance to draw Arsenal level from Emmanuel Adebayor's 53rd-minute cross, he volleyed wide with the goal at his mercy. But if anyone can nurse Walcott through his baby blues it is Wenger, who said: "He has developed well but recently he has had a little dip in form. He needs a goal because for me he looks a bit short of confidence right now."<br><br></div>
