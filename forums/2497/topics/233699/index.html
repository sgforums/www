Â£6million deal</strong></span><br><br><strong>ROMAN ABRAMOVICH has made Roberto Mancini his No 1 target to be the next Chelsea manager. </strong><br><br>The BluesÂ’ owner does not want to be left high and dry if Jose Mourinho leaves in the summer. He believes Inter MilanÂ’s chief would be the perfect replacement Â— and will offer him around Â£6million a year to take over.<br><br>A source told SunSport: Â“Abramovich has made up his mind that he wants Mancini. Chelsea know that he is now in demand.Â” Mancini won the Serie A title last season Â— InterÂ’s first for 18 years Â— even though it was by default as Juventus were relegated after the match-fixing scandal. He is out of contract in June and has indicated he is ready to switch to the Premiership.<br><br>The former Sampdoria, Lazio and Italy striker, who also had a short spell at Leicester, was expected to sign a new San Siro deal last week. But he stalled at the 11th hour. While Inter president Massimo Moratti has claimed the deal is agreed, it seems Mancini refused to commit.<br><br>With Inter currently leading Serie A by 11 points, and with a record 13 top-flight wins on the trot under their belt, the club dare not rock the boat. And Mancini is determined to weigh up his options before signing for anyone.<br><br>Red Rom has cooled on other possible coaches, such as Guus Hiddink, Marcello Lippi and Carlo Ancelotti, because of their age. Juve chief Didier Deschamps has ruled himself out of the running. The ex-Chelsea midfielder has bad memories of his time in London and will sign a new deal in Turin next month.<br><br>SevilleÂ’s Juande Ramos was also considered. But he cannot speak English and Abramovich has been advised he would be a risky appointment. Mancini is a close friend of Sven Goran Eriksson and has met all of the major power- brokers at Chelsea in the past two years.<br><br>Having worked for Moratti, he is also familiar with the club president having an interest and influence in signings. His agent, Jorge Mendes, is looking for a new job and Real Madrid remain favourites Â— though a vacancy at Inter could suit!<br><br>No attempt has been made either to extend the contracts of MourinhoÂ’s staff beyond their summer expiry date. Assistant boss Steve Clarke, assistant Baltemar Brito, goalkeeping coach Silvino Lauro, fitness coach Rui Faria and head of observation and scouting Andre Villas Boas are all still waiting for new terms.<br></div>

Mancini assisted Eriksson at Lazio</strong></span><br><br><strong>NOBODY should be shocked that Chelsea are making contingency plans for Jose MourinhoÂ’s departure. Roman Abramovich is not prepared to sit around twiddling his thumbs waiting to find out whether his unpredictable manager is going to leave him in the lurch.</strong><br><br>Men with AbramovichÂ’s power and money have to be in control. They will not be held to ransom and dictated to. So Chelsea are planning for life without Mourinho, and Roberto Mancini, boss of Serie A leaders Inter Milan, is the man in their sights.<br><br>The 4-0 home victory over Wycombe on Tuesday, which took the Blues to the Carling Cup final, means nothing in the world scheme of things. Abramovich wants trophies but he also wants a team that entertains and a manager he can get along with. Mancini is believed to fit the bill.<br><br>Mourinho says he Â“thinksÂ” he will still be at Chelsea next season and has told skipper John Terry so. But that is hardly an unequivocal commitment and Blues owner Abramovich has tired of MourinhoÂ’s games. At 42, Mancini is nearly two years younger than the Special One and has a pedigree which makes him an obvious attraction to a club which, in chief executive Peter KenyonÂ’s eyes, aims to be the worldÂ’s leading outfit by 2014.<br><br>Mancini is personable and, while he will not be pushed around as has been shown by his contract dispute with Inter president Massimo Moratti, he is a man the Blues hierarchy can get along with.<br><br>Abramovich ideally favours a young, dynamic motivator Â— like Mourinho with less aggro. InterÂ’s sporting director Marco Branca is believed to rate Mourinho highly, although Moratti is not so convinced.<br><br>Chelsea, of course, can spend as much money as they want when the desire takes them and blow Inter out of the water. They also know Mancini, whose Inter side lead Serie A by 11 points, has long held a desire to coach in England.<br><br></div>

Of the 20, i think only 40 to 50 % may have gone with him, the rest went with others but i feel if you look at the big picture, Is he really a good coach/manager?<br><br>The question is what makes is good manager? Just on the field alone or off the field as well? Present day management is such that "off the field" is just as important. And mourinho doesn't have this... If anything, he is probably the worst at it. No disrespect to him as a coach, he is a good coach/manager on the field but really terrible when out of it. He shows disrespect to everyone apparently even to his own boss i guess or we wouldn't see what's happening at chelsea right now... The guy just need to learn being a alittle more humble then he would be great.<br><br>Moreover, his success at chelsea is also mainly funded by more than $200 million spent over a short time... No other club will have that kind of money for him to build his success on. So how good is he as a coach/manager if he didn't have that kind of funds is still open for debate...<br><br>Anyway, i belief chelsea is not like by ordinary fans is more because of mourinho's behaviour rather than RA.<br><br>If rumour were true that Real may want him as their next coach... Then i would probably laugh if it happens cos their present coach is more than able and with mourinho... Real could probably end up replacing chelsea as the next most dislike club in Europe... and the good work Beck has done for them in the marketing area over the last 4 yrs will be undone with mour within 2 yrs...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Mancini: I'd love Chelsea job</strong></span><br><br>ROBERTO MANCINI admits he wants to become ChelseaÂ’s next boss. The Inter Milan chief is Roman AbramovichÂ’s No 1 target to replace Jose Mourinho this summer if the Special One quits, as revealed by SunSport. Mancini said: Â“IÂ’d really love to manage a Premiership side one day. Chelsea? It would be fantastic.Â”<br><br>Mancini has only six months left on his Inter contract and is now considering a move away from Serie A. The former Sampdoria, Lazio and Italy striker, who also had a short spell at Leicester in 2001, was expected to sign a new San Siro deal last week. But he stalled at the 11th hour and Abramovich is now confident of landing him on a Â£6million-a-year four-year deal.<br><br>SunSport can also reveal that MourinhoÂ’s entire backroom staff have NOT been offered new contracts Â— casting more doubts over the Blues managerÂ’s future. Assistant Steve Clarke has told some players he believes he will be leaving in the summer Â— and that suggests Mourinho will be going too.<br><br>The Portuguese chief says he would quit if Abramovich meddled with his backroom team. Clarke, coach Baltemar Brito, goalkeeping coach Silvino Lauro, fitness coach Rui Faria and scout Andre Villas Boas are all still waiting for new terms to be offered.<br><br>Ironically Clarke was presented with an award by the club on Wednesday marking 20 years since he joined Chelsea as a 23-year-old signing from St Mirren.<br><br><img src="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p143/zococl/mourinho1101.jpg"><br><span class="small">Mourinho... going?</span><br></div>

The Crystal Palace boss gave the Italian his first taste of English football with Leicester in 2001. And he insists the Inter Milan chief has all the qualities needed to be a massive Premiership success if he ends up replacing Jose Mourinho in the summer.<br><br>Taylor said: Â“Knowing him as well as I do, he wouldnÂ’t go into anything without taking it very seriously. Â“That is why he has been such a success and why he would go on and do well in the Premiership. "IÂ’m sure they see our Premiership in Italy and think itÂ’s the league to be in. So if he gets that opportunity, heÂ’ll do well. And good luck to him.Â”<br><br>Mancini played only four games at Leicester before returning to Italy to coach Fiorentina and then Lazio. Despite winning the Serie A title last season Â— InterÂ’s first for 18 years Â— he now looks likely to snub a new contract at the San Siro in favour of a fresh challenge in the Premiership. Taylor added: Â“Roberto is a top-drawer professional and his talents are there for everyone to see.<br><br>Â“Unfortunately, he was at Leicester for only a short while and it was difficult for him as we were at the wrong end of the table. Â“Then, all of a sudden he ended up in management. But that wasnÂ’t a surprise to me. He was always interested in it. He kept asking why certain things were done in certain ways.<br><br>Â“He wanted to get on to that managerial ladder and I could see he had a big future ahead of him.Â”<br></div>

He claims team spirit has disappeared and blames perpetual feuding for the dramatic slide in ChelseaÂ’s title defence.<br><br>Drogba also warned he would be tempted to follow Mourinho if he quit for another club, The striker, 28, said: Â“We have lacked aggression and determination in the last few games and against Liverpool looked nothing like a team challenging for our Premiership title. Â“Perhaps this is the end of the Mourinho era. Over the last few months it is true this Chelsea side has been unrecognisable. I only wish I knew where our team spirit has gone. Â“I just cannot understand why Mourinho is being attacked Â— particularly from within his own club. ItÂ’s now obvious to all of us this club is no longer a compact unit.Â”<br><br>Drogba recently signed a new Â£100,000-per-week contract taking him to 2010 but is already talking about quitting in protest at the treatment on Mourinho. The Ivory Coast star said: Â“I know people are just going to turn around and say I am MourinhoÂ’s pet but I simply donÂ’t care. Â“The truth is that not everyone at this club is pulling in the same direction Â— and that is immensely dangerous. Â“It is clear to the players that our bad results have only one explanation: The poor atmosphere around the club. ItÂ’s not rocket science or a big secret.<br><br>Â“As long as everybody is not on the same wavelength, the team will keep on struggling. Speaking personally I simply cannot understand why we have put ourselves in such a difficult situation. Â“If people dismiss what IÂ’m saying as keeping in with Mourinho then they are wrong. Â“I wouldnÂ’t simply follow him anywhere but if he left and wanted me then IÂ’d only have to ask myself a few questions.Â” DrogbaÂ’s outburst is likely to anger Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, who is already lining up Inter Milan coach Roberto Mancini to replace Mourinho.<br><br>But it will steel the resolve of fans, players and staff who support the BluesÂ’ boss. And they remain determined to retain their Premiership title for the boss. Drogba added: Â“I know we donÂ’t look or feel sure of ourselves at the moment. But we have to hang on to our belief and our dreams.<br><br>Â“The end of this season can still be wonderful and glorious. Perhaps we are only suffering a bad blip because of the atmosphere in the club. Â“ItÂ’s clear some people in England donÂ’t like him, but without Mourinho Chelsea simply wouldnÂ’t be where they are now.<br><br></div>

It won't be easy for jose as well even if he stays cos Arsenal &amp; Man u were going through a transitional period over the last 2, 3 yrs when they brought in a lot of young players... But these players are coming of age now... Look at the gunners team... Next year they will be even better compare to the last 2 and even this year.<br><br>Whoever it is, the next guy will have a even more difficult job on his hands than jose.<br></div>
