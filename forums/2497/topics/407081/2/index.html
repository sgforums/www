              <p>The 27-year-old, who featured in England's 2-1 win over Hungary, has been eyed by the Gunners following the departures of Sol Campbell, William Gallas and Mikael Silvestre.</p>

              <p>He said: "There's nothing I can do about the speculation, but the gaffer has pulled me aside and told me I'm not going anywhere.</p>
              <p>"I'm happy with that. I'm an Everton player, I love playing for the club, and I'm just going to get on with my job there."</p>

              <p>The Gunners are keen to snap up the Aussie veteran as competition for inconsistent keepers Manuel Almunia and Lukasz Fabianksi.</p>
              <p>But Hughes insists the Cottagers will not entertain any offers for the 37-year-old.</p>
              <p>He said: "From our point of view the situation has not changed. There was interest from Arsenal in May.</p>
              <p>"Their bid was refused. We have not had any more bids and we wouldn't encourage any."</p>
              <p>Hughes added: "Mark sees it as an opportunity with the current stage that he is at in his career.</p>
              <p>"I can appreciate that but he has to understand that we have to protect Fulham too.</p>
              <p>"It would be difficult to replace him. It's difficult to get the right quality into your football club.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">MARK HUGHES insists he can put the brakes on Mark Schwarzer's move to Arsenal.</h2>
              <p>The Gunners are hot on the trail of the Fulham keeper, who is keen on a switch to north London.</p>
              <p>Hughes made shackling his stopper a top priority when he took over at Craven Cottage.</p>
              <p>And asked if Schwarzer can be talked into staying at Fulham he said: "That is the intention, yes. Nothing has moved on.</p>
              <p>"Myself and Mark have had conversations and I fully understand the reasoning behind the fact that he maybe wants to take up the opportunity to join Arsenal.</p>
              <p>"But I think he also understands that we have to protect our position as well, and that is what we are doing.</p>
              <p>"We are not going to put Fulham's position or reputation at risk by making promises we can't fulfil, so at the moment it's very much the status quo and nothing has moved on."</p>
              <p>Schwarzer sat out the Cottagers' draw with Bolton today — but club officials say the Aussie failed a fitness test.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">MANUEL ALMUNIA is in despair at the prospect of Mark Schwarzer taking the Arsenal gloves from him.</h2>
              <p>Almunia was in goal and captained the side in Sunday's 1-1 draw at Liverpool but manager Arsene Wenger is closing in on a deal for Fulham ace Schwarzer.</p>
              <p>Spaniard Almunia cannot think of life beyond the Gunners but concedes he must talk to Wenger once Schwarzer turns up.</p>
              <p>He said: "I don't see anything else outside of Arsenal.</p>
              <p>"It will be very difficult to play for another team in England if it isn't Arsenal. Spain would also be difficult.</p>
              <p>"But I am 33 years old and only have a few more years left in football. I would like to enjoy them. I am a keeper who enjoys playing - just playing.</p>
              <p>"It is so difficult. Arsenal is a big club and speculation is always in the news and everywhere.</p>
              <p>"The only thing I can do is keep working because I have a contract here and I have to do what the manager wants.</p>
              <p>"If somebody comes in, I will have to talk about my future at Arsenal. That is it.</p>
              <p>"I have to work and if one day I am not good for Arsenal, I will talk. That is no problem. I am very happy here. Football is like life.</p>
              <p>"The only news I have is from third parties, people at the training ground. When I go out and when I come back from training, I switch off. I try to live in a bubble and give all my attention to my wife.</p>
              <p>"Every morning when I go out training, it is the time to think about football. But the rest of the day is the time to switch off."</p>
              <p>Arsenal are hoping to seal a deal for Schwarzer, 37, this week.</p>
              <p>The Aussie has put in a transfer request and was not even a sub in Fulham's draw at Bolton on Saturday. But the Cottagers are reluctant to let him go before finding a suitable replacement.</p>
              <p>Arsenal legend David Seaman yesterday joined those urging Wenger to sign either Schwarzer or Shay Given.</p>
              <p>The call followed Almunia's display at Anfield where he was criticised over David Ngog's goal.</p>
              <p>Manchester City keeper Given, 34, will hold talks over his future after boss Roberto Mancini started Joe Hart against Tottenham.</p>
              <p>Former England No 1 Seaman said: "Lukasz Fabianski has a great future at Arsenal but I think they need to look at bringing in a keeper who's going to calm the defence down and be consistent.</p>
              <p>"Neither Fabianski nor Almunia ended last season very well.</p>
              <p>"And if the likes of Schwarzer and Given are available, then I think Arsene Wenger has to be looking at them."</p>

              <p>Fulham goalkeeper Schwarzer has been linked with a £3million switch to the Emirates Stadium after Gunners boss Arsene Wenger refused to confirm the Polish international or Manuel Almunia as his first-choice stopper.</p>
              <p>But despite a number of high-profile errors — including horror shows in the 2009 FA Cup semi-final defeat to Chelsea and in the Champions League away to Porto last season — Fabianski continues to keep faith in his ability.</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old said: "As a player you have to prove you deserve a chance.</p>
              <p>"I can understand every single shout against me and it can only motivate me to play better and work harder.</p>
              <p>"Of course I am going to do everything in my power to show that I deserve to be respected, then maybe they the Arsenal fans will start singing my name — that would be wonderful."</p>

              <p>And the centre-back's current club, Seville, confirmed the Gunners have made an offer for the 30-year-old, who is rated at £6million.</p>
              <p>Squillaci asked to be left out of his side's Champions League play-off against Braga last night to avoid being cup-tied.</p>
              <p>A statement on Seville's website read: "Sebastien Squillaci's future is in the air.</p>
              <p>"As was confirmed by sporting director Ramon Rodriguez at the airport in Porto, the club have received an offer from Arsenal.</p>
              <p>"The player asked coaches not to play him in the match."</p>
              <p>But any deal for Squillaci appears unlikely to be pushed through in time for him to play in Arsenal's home match against Blackpool on Saturday.</p>
              <p>Rodriguez added: "The player asked not to play because of the offer from such a big team but, for the moment, we believe the offer is insufficient and Squillaci is still a Sevilla player."</p>
              <p>Seville have called an emergency board meeting today to discus the offer, which could hinge on whether they can bring in a replacement before the transfer window closes on September 1.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ARSENAL have angered Fulham with a second £2million bid for Mark Schwarzer - the SAME as one rejected in May.</h2>
              <p>Now talks have stalled after furious Fulham threw out the cheeky bid.</p>
              <p>Schwarzer, 37, has put in a transfer request as he is desperate to join Arsene Wenger's side.</p>
              <p>But the Gunners have not helped themselves by failing to raise their offer for the Aussie keeper.</p>
              <p>Arsenal have suffered another injury blow, losing Emmanuel Frimpong for up to nine months with a torn cruciate ligament.</p>
              <p>The midfielder, 18, had featured heavily in pre-season and was set to play in their Carling Cup ties.</p>
              <p>But Wenger should strengthen his defence with the signing of France centre-back Sebastien Squillaci, 30, from Sevilla.</p>
              <p>Squillaci sat out the Champions League play-off with Braga on Wednesday to avoid being cup-tied.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ARSENE WENGER admits transfer speculation is unsettling Arsenal keeper Manuel Almunia — but warned competition is part of life at a top football club.</h2>
              <p>The Gunners have been heavily linked with Australian international Mark Schwarzer all summer and Fulham have rejected two offers, believed to be in the region of £2million, for the 37-year-old.</p>
              <p>Almunia played in the opening game of the season at Liverpool, where he made a crucial save from Steven Gerrard's free-kick after a last-minute own goal by Reds goalkeeper Jose Reina hauled Arsenal level.</p>
              <p>But the Spaniard later revealed the constant rumours were distracting and hinted he would consider his future if an experienced stopper like Schwarzer came in.</p>
              <p>Wenger will keep faith with the 33-year-old for the visit of newcomers Blackpool but refuses to guarantee any player a place in the starting XI.</p>
              <p>The Arsenal boss said: "For us what is important at the moment in front of a big game is that we focus on the players we have.</p>
              <p>"Almunia is No1 — it is important that we give him the needed confidence, that we trust him, that we focus on tomorrow's game."</p>
              <p>He added: "It is a very sensitive subject which is difficult for me to talk about.</p>
              <p>"You can understand that he is unsettled by that situation, but on the other hand, when you play at Arsenal, that is what you have to deal with.</p>
              <p>"You have to be strong enough to deal with that and I believe he is.</p>
              <p>"Jens Lehmann had to deal with that situation because at some stage I took him out of the team and played Almunia, so competition is part of our world. We have to accept that."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">SHAY GIVEN is still behind Mark Schwarzer in Arsenal's keeper chase.</h2>
              <p>Boss Arsene Wenger remains on the trail of Fulham's Aussie ace Schwarzer, 37, with a £2million offer on the table.</p>
              <p>Given, 34, would jump at a move to the Emirates - having been displaced by Joe Hart at City.</p>
              <p>But Wenger says there are huge difficulties in trying to sign Given, not least financial.</p>
              <p>Wenger said: "You can't offload the players when the financial difference between the two clubs is too big as no one can pay the wages.</p>
              <p>"I don't know how much their keepers get each year but you must pay the players who go.</p>
              <p>"Anyway, City need two keepers. They offered Shay Given a new deal."</p>
              <p>Wenger insists Arsenal's conscience is clear in their pursuit of Schwarzer despite the fact it has been compared to Barcelona's courting of Cesc Fabregas.</p>
              <p>He said: "If a club says 'no' you don't continue. We always behave like that."</p>
              <p>Wenger laughed when told Blackpool boss Ian Holloway had called him a genius and replied: "He's the genius - not me. At the moment, he's higher in the table than Arsenal!"</p>

              <p>Scouts from both clubs have twice watched the ex-Grimsby defender, 20, who cost Posh a record £400,000 in January.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile Sunderland want to sign Peterborough keeper Joe Lewis - but will need to offer £2.5million to get him.</p>
              <p>A Posh source said: "We are ready to sell but the price has to be right as Joe is among the top three or four keepers in the League."</p>

              <p>The Croatian striker, 27, only left for Ukraine in a £6million move last month, after three tough years in North London.</p>
              <p>Eduardo, 27, who suffered an horrific leg injury at Birmingham in February 2008, said: "I always had a feeling that Arsenal and Shakhtar would be drawn together in the same group.</p>

              <p>Brazilian-born Eduardo, who signed for Arsenal in a £7.5m deal from Dinamo Zagreb back in 2007, scored the winner in the 1-0 triumph at Volyn on Saturday - his second goal for his new club.</p>
