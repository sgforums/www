              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">WILLIAM GALLAS has priced himself out of a move to Juventus after demanding £90,000 a week.</h2>
              <p>The former Arsenal captain, a free agent, was set to join the Italian giants before he stunned Juve with his wage requirements.</p>
              <p>Gallas, 32, is now considering offers from Paris St Germain and Panathinaikos.</p>
              <p>The Frenchman spent four years at Arsenal having played for Chelsea in the previous five.</p>
              <p><strong>NICKLAS BENDTNER</strong> admits he is uncertain when he will return to training as he recovers from a groin problem.</p>
              <p>Gunners boss Arsene Wenger had already ruled out the striker for the Premier League opener at Liverpool on Sunday week.</p>
              <p>Bendtner said: "It is a difficult injury and hard to say when I'll be back but hopefully I'll be training as soon as possible.</p>
              <p>"We haven't set a date yet, we're taking it easy."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">CESC FABREGAS was in tears as a 2,500-strong crowd in Spain paid homage to the Arsenal star but sang 'Cesc go to Barcelona'.</h2>
              <p>The Gunners midfielder broke down as his hometown of Arenys de Munt honoured him with a special medal to mark his World Cup heroics.</p>
              <p>The crowd cheered as pictures were shown of Fabregas in the Nou Camp youth team and he welled up as they sang 'Cesc go to Barca'.</p>
              <p>Arsenal are refusing to sell their skipper, 23, and now Barca may move for Everton's Mikel Arteta.</p>
              <p>Arteta, who has two years left on his contract, is currently negotiating a new £70,000-a-week deal but could double his money in Catalonia.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ARSENE WENGER admits he is desperate to sign another centre-half before the transfer window closes.</h2>
              <p>The Arsenal boss has seen Philippe Senderos, Mikael Silvestre, William Gallas and Sol Campbell all leave the Emirates Stadium this summer.</p>
              <p>And that leaves the Gunners with just Thomas Vermaelen, Laurent Koscielny and Johan Djourou as the only senior first-team defenders available for Wenger to choose from.</p>
              <p>Norwegian youngster Harvard Nordtveit, 20, is expected to break into the first team this term but Wenger claims he will sign at least one more experienced defender to bolster his backline.</p>
              <p>Arsenal have been linked with Dynamo Kiev's Pape Diakhate, Werder Bremen's Per Mertesacker and Stuttgart's Serdar Tasci.</p>
              <p>And the French boss revealed: "There are plenty of names that we consider and we analyse.</p>
              <p>"We are still on the search because at the moment we only have three centre backs and we have seen last season you needed five.</p>
              <p>"I believe we need at least four because we have some other players who can fill in this position but overall we are still on the search."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ARSENE WENGER is weighing up a swoop for Dutch World Cup star Ibrahim Afellay.</h2>
              <p>The midfielder, 24, is in the final year of his contract with PSV.</p>
              <p>And Arsene Wenger could tempt the Eredivisie giants to cash in now rather than risk losing him for nothing in 12 months.</p>
              <p>PSV rate Afellay at £7million and his agent Rob Jansen admitted: "It's possible Ibrahim will want to stay at PSV but there is a chance of a move elsewhere.</p>
              <p>"In football, you never know. There are teams interested in him for sure."</p>

              <p>The centre-back starred for Germany as Joachim Low's side finished third at the World Cup.</p>
              <p>And the 25-year-old's performances saw him emerge as one of Arsene Wenger's top transfer targets following the exits of William Gallas, Sol Campbell, Philippe Senderos and Mikael Silvestre.</p>
              <p>Gunners boss Wenger was said to be lining up a £10million bid for Mertesacker's services, but Werder general manager Klaus Allofs has warned the Frenchman off.</p>
              <p>Allofs said: "Per is 100 percent for Werder. I have already said several times. Nothing has changed.</p>
              <p>"He and his advisers have so far not reported [for training after the World Cup] due to a request from us."</p>

              <p>The Barcelona target will have talks with the Arsenal boss tomorrow, ahead of the team photocall and training session in front of 10,000 spectators.</p>
              <p>Fabregas' heart is set on a move to Barca but it seems increasingly likely the Spaniards do not have the funds to raise their initial £30million offer.</p>
              <p>Wenger, who has told Fabregas to report for 10am, is adamant the midfielder is going nowhere.</p>
              <p>Fabregas, 23, will arrive from Madrid after a holiday and will begin training tomorrow. But he will not play in Saturday's friendly at Legia Warsaw.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">BARCELONA target Cesc Fabregas reported back for training with Arsenal this morning.</h2>
              <p>The Spanish champions have courted the 23-year-old all summer and had a £29million bid turned down by the North Londoners in June.</p>
              <p>Gunners boss Arsene Wenger has refused to enter into any form of negotiation over the sale of his captain.</p>
              <p>But that has not stopped a host of Barca stars — including Xavi, Carles Puyol, Lionel Messi and Andres Iniesta — calling for the World Cup winner to join them at the Nou Camp.</p>
              <p>However, Fabregas' return to the Emirates Stadium will serve as a welcome boost to Wenger and come as a relief to the club's fans.</p>
              <p>He looked at ease as he lined up alongside Wenger and the rest of the Arsenal squad for the team photo on the pitch today.</p>
              <p>And it is perhaps an indication that he has finally decided to end speculation over his future by committing to the Gunners — at least for another season.</p>
              <p>Fabregas and Robin van Persie — who had also been granted an extended holiday following his World Cup exploits with Holland — will train in front of around 10,000 Arsenal fans at the club's members' day today.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">BOLTON manager Owen Coyle has backed calls for Jack Wilshere to be included in England's squad to face Hungary.</h2>
              <p>The 18-year-old Arsenal midfielder was omitted from the Under-21s and looks likely to win a place in Fabio Capello's new-look line-up when the teams meet at Wembley on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Wilshere spent six months on loan with Bolton last season and flourished under Coyle's guidance.</p>
              <p>And the Wanderers boss is keen to acquire the services of the playmaker for the forthcoming campaign — although Gunners chief Arsene Wenger is reluctant to do a deal.</p>
              <p>Coyle said: "It's well documented that we would like to have Jack back for another six months.</p>
              <p>"But I have to say it looks like Arsenal are going to keep a hold of him — and you can understand why.</p>
              <p>"He is absolutely quality and I'm led to believe there is a chance he could be in the England squad.</p>
              <p>"If he is, then it will be merited, it will be just, it will be a great reward for him and I think the football club will realise we have played a little part in that.</p>
              <p>"I've always left the door open with Arsenal and Arsene, saying that if he felt after the season starts that Jack is not going to start games, then we would welcome him with open arms for six months and hopefully give him back in January a far batter player than what we got — because we already did that."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ARSENAL star Cesc Fabregas will remain a Gunner.</h2>
              <p>That is the verdict from former Arsenal keeper and coach Bob Wilson, who was at the Emirates when Fabregas trained in front of around 7,000 fans.</p>
              <p>And the Spain star also took his place in the Gunners team photo.</p>
              <p>Wilson said: "There will be an announcement soon that tells everyone Cesc is staying this season and for maybe longer.</p>
              <p>"If you look at the team photo for the 2010-11 season, he is at the front of the picture.</p>
              <p>"That's the clearest indication you can get that Cesc will stay."</p>
              <p>Fabregas has five years to run on his current deal with boss Arsene Wenger turning down a £30million bid from Barcelona.</p>
              <p>Wilson added: "Cesc owes a lot to this club."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ARSENAL have launched a stunning £23million raid for Liverpool keeper Pepe Reina.</h2>
              <p>Arsene Wenger sees the Kop star as the man to solve his problem position.</p>
              <p>And the Gunners boss is prepared to go up to £25m to land the Spaniard.</p>
              <p>But Wenger knows he faces a massive battle to lure one of Liverpool's prize assets away from Anfield. He had been eyeing Fulham's Mark Schwarzer but the chance of getting Reina, 27, is far more mouth-watering.</p>
              <p>Reina, a £6million buy from Villarreal five years ago, signed a new six-year deal at Liverpool in April.</p>
              <p>He missed Thursday's Europa League win over Rabotnicki after only returning to training on Monday - together with the rest of the club's Spanish and Dutch World Cup stars.</p>
              <p>Wenger is desperate to sign a top keeper after both Manuel Almunia and Lukasz Fabianski copped a stream of criticism for a series of clangers over the past 12 months.</p>
              <p>But Liverpool insist they do not want - or need - to sell any of their big stars.</p>
              <p>And the prospect of new ownership bringing a huge cash injection to Anfield leaves Wenger with a major fight on his hands.</p>

              <p>The Gunners boss revealed his delight and relief last night after Fabregas finally admitted he was remaining at the club.</p>
              <p>Wenger, whose team face Polish side Legia Warsaw this afternoon, said: "I am over the moon Cesc is staying.</p>
              <p>"It is important for the whole of football that Arsenal are successful, so there is not only one way of success that involves just putting a huge amount of money in.</p>
              <p>"There has to be another way as well. It is important for football that players do not move when someone comes in and says 'we want him.'</p>
              <p>"We were never in a position where we wanted Cesc to go. We invested a lot of energy and work in creating a team of young players and we want them to stay at the club.</p>
              <p>"Cesc is our captain. You see in training how much he lifts everyone.</p>
              <p>"I met so many people at the World Cup and the first words were always 'don't let Fabregas go.'.</p>
              <p>"Cesc has cleared the air. It was very important he came out clearly and now we can move on.</p>
              <p>"We are only one week away from the start of the season and we needed everyone to be focused and settled."</p>
              <p>Wenger admitted Fabregas and Robin van Persie, who have just returned to training following post-World Cup holidays, will definitely <strong>NOT</strong> be ready for the season's opener at Liverpool next Sunday.</p>
              <p>He added: "Both of them will be short against Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"Fabregas came back on Thursday and on Monday he goes to Mexico with Spain to play an international friendly.</p>
              <p>"Mentally to go to the World Cup and be ready three weeks later is a massive thing. The same applies to Van Persie."</p>

              <p>Boss Arsene Wenger heads into next Sunday's Premier League opener at Liverpool with a major problem over his No1.</p>
              <p>Lukasz Fabianski was hauled off at the break after the Gunners found themselves 3-1 down.</p>
              <p>Wojciech Szczesny replaced his Polish counterpart and Arsenal won the second half 5-2 to complete an amazing victory.</p>
              <p>But Fabianski's latest horror show proves Wenger <strong>MUST</strong> sign a new keeper before deadline day.</p>
              <p>The Gunners chief has to yet to decide who will be his first choice stopper, with Manuel Almunia hoping to remain between the sticks.</p>
              <p>But this appalling display may force Wenger to step up his pursuit of Liverpool stopper Jose Reina.</p>
              <p>Arsenal found themselves 1-0 down after 17 minutes and Laurent Koscielny's own goal just after the half-hour doubled Legia's lead.</p>
              <p>Artur Jedrzejczyk soon put the home side three clear before Marouane Chamakh reduced the defecit with a close-range header.</p>
              <p>Emmanuel Eboue netted twice in quick succession after the restart to level the scores at 3-3. And Kieran Gibbs' rasping drive on 63 minutes put the Londoners in front.</p>
              <p>Fifteen minutes from time, Jedrzejczyk volleyed Legia back level again before Jay Emmanuel-Thomas escaped on the left to fire home from close range.</p>
              <p>Samir Nasri finally ended the argument with a free-kick and Maciej Iwanski's injury-time strike completed the crazy afternoon goalfest.</p>

              <p>The Bosnian centre-back was linked with a switch to the Gunners this summer.</p>

              <p>The Spanish champions had two bids for the midfielder turned down this summer, with Gunners boss Arsene Wenger standing firm and insisting he has no intention of selling his captain.</p>
              <p>Last week, Fabregas, 23, released a statement pledging his immediate future to the Londoners — despite admitting his love for old team Barca.</p>
              <p>And that has led Xavi to fire yet another dig at Arsenal by claiming Fabregas could still move to the Nou Camp if they fail to mount a serious challenge for silverware this term.</p>

              <p>The French defender was released by Arsenal, who were only prepared to offer him a further season at the Emirates.</p>
              <p>And it is unlikely that at 33 Spurs would come up with any more.</p>
              <p>Gallas also has a firm two-year deal on offer from Turkish side Fenerbahce while PSG in France are willing to take him home to see out his career.</p>
              <p>White Hart Lane boss Harry Redknapp has admitted he is looking for a centre-half - but insists he is nowhere near to completing a deal.</p>

              <p>But Mertesacker has dealt Wenger a blow by insisting he has no intention of leaving the Bundesliga. He said: "I'm staying at Bremen.</p>
              <p>"There have been so many rumours concerning me, but I've never had to be concerned because none were concrete."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">DAVID VILLA has told Cesc Fabregas to focus on his Arsenal career — to boost his chances of joining Barcelona next year.</h2>
              <p>The Spanish champions failed to lure Fabregas to the Nou Camp after the Gunners rejected a final bid of £35million for their captain earlier this month.</p>
              <p>But the 23-year-old World Cup winner admitted it would be a dream to return to the club where he started his career as a schoolboy.</p>
              <p>However, Barca new boy Villa has advised his Spain team-mate to concentrate on giving his all for Arsenal this season — in the hope it will help him engineer a move next summer.</p>
              <p>Villa said: "What I'd say to Cesc is to do what I did — concentrate on your club and give everything for your team.</p>
              <p>"Football does not stop here and, after all, sooner or later he'll end up playing for Barca.</p>
              <p>"What he should do is keep showing the great form he has been doing for the next season. He will have this opportunity again next year.</p>
              <p>"While he is with Arsenal, he should just play as well as he can."</p>
              <p>But Villa admitted he and the rest of the Barcelona squad are frustrated at the club's failure to secure Fabregas' services this summer.</p>
              <p>He added: "It is annoying because we wanted to have him here because he is a friend and a great player.</p>
              <p>"But mostly it's annoying because he's a great kid.</p>
              <p>"I'm sure he'll have another chance and end up wearing the Barca shirt."</p>
