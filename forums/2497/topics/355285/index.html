              <p> </p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>AC Milan boss Carlo Ancelotti is ready to take charge of Chelsea next season.</p>
              <p><em>The Sun</em> says Ancelotti has promised Roman Abramovich he will join the club this summer.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti was the Blues owner’s first choice to replace Big Phil Scolari but was unwilling to leave Milan during mid-season.</p>
              <p>However, sources at the Italian club have indicated that an agreement
              has been reached with Chelsea which will see Ancelotti named the new
              coach.</p>
              <p>A contract worth around £5.8million a season over three years has been discussed and should be signed in June.</p>
              <p>Real Madrid have courted the 52-year-old but Abramovich’s
              personal intervention is understood to have helped swing the deal in
              Chelsea’s favour.</p>

              <p><strong>Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti has brushed off reports in the English
              press that he has already agreed to manage Chelsea next season.</strong></p>
              <p>Numerous national newspapers have claimed that the Italian will
              arrive at Stamford Bridge in the summer as Guus Hiddink has made it
              clear that he will resume his job with the Russian national side on a
              full-time basis.</p>
              <p>This has come as news to Milan though and vice-president Adriano
              Galliani stated earlier in the week that he expects Ancelotti to
              fulfill his contract and take charge of the Rossoneri at the start of
              next season.</p>
              <p>The coach himself has also rubbished suggestions that he has an
              agreement with Roman Abramovich, teasing the inquisitive Italian media
              by referring them to reports that he will also join Real Madrid in the
              summer.</p>
              <p>“Me to Chelsea? Mr Galliani spoke clearly during the week and for me
              there is no need to say more,” Ancelotti told the Italian press.</p>
              <p>“On March 17 I met with Chelsea? But was I not in Geneva having
              lunch with [Real Madrid presidential candidate] Florentino Perez? You
              need to agree.</p>
              <p>“I think only of reaching the Champions League with Milan.”</p>
              <p>Reports in Italy have claimed that Milan are already lining up
              Cagliari manager Massimiliano Allegri as Ancelotti’s replacement but
              the incumbent has warned his rival that he will not be vacating the San
              Siro any time soon.</p>
              <p>“Allegri? If he wants to coach here he has to wait,” Ancelotti added. “He could train Chelsea.</p>
              <p>“We are not interested in what is said outside Milanello these days and we think only of preparing the team well.”</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">CARLO ANCELOTTI has been promised £1million for EVERY trophy he wins as Chelsea boss. And that is on top of a contract worth £5m-a-year tax free. </h2>
              <p class="article">Details of the amazing offer emerged as Guus Hiddink spelt out why it is impossible for him to stay on at Stamford Bridge beyond the end of the season. Sources in Italy claim the proposal was put to AC Milan boss Ancelotti by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich last month. And the extraordinary deal means it is now almost certain he will become Chelsea’s next boss after eight years at the San Siro. </p>
              <p class="article">The man who twice led Milan to Champions League glory has been promised a three-year deal which will pay £100K-a-week after tax. But it is the bonus payments for success which will most appeal to the highly-motivated Ancelotti, 49. </p>
              <p class="article">He has always been Abramovich’s first choice to succeed Phil Scolari, who was ruthlessly axed as Chelsea boss in February after just seven months in charge. Russian national boss Hiddink has been filling in ever since but last night made it clear he will not continue his jobshare scheme beyond this season. </p>
              <p class="article">Hiddink said: “I have a formal contract with Russia and it is very important for me to stick by my word. The moral standards in our business sometimes go up and down but I want to see my commitments wholeheartedly through to the end. </p>
              <p class="article">“I owe something to the Russia players. If I were to end a contract which had not yet expired, they could blame me for not standing by my own values.” </p>
              <p class="article">Hiddink also ruled out the possibility of staying on at Chelsea while continuing to orchestrate Russia’s 2010 World Cup campaign. He added: “I could help as Chelsea boss this season because Russia only had two games. </p>
              <p class="article">“But next season Russia has a friendly in August and a very tough sequence of qualifying matches in September and October. “Then there is also the chance they will be involved in the play-offs so the situation becomes impossible.”</p>
