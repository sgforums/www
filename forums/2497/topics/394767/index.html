              <div class="cnn_stryimg640captioned">Roma blew the Italian title race wide open with a 2-1 victory at home
               to Inter Milan on Saturday that saw Claudio Ranieri's team close to 
              within a point of the four-time defending champions.
              <p>The capital 
              club moved above AC Milan into second place after riding their luck 
              against Inter, who hit the woodwork three times.</p>
              <p>A mistake by 
              goalkeeper Julio Cesar gifted Daniele De Rossi a 17th-minute opener for 
              the hosts, then Inter defender Walter Samuel headed against the bar just
               before halftime and fellow Argentine Diego Milito hit the corner of the
               goalframe soon after the interval.</p>
              <p>Jose Mourinho's team drew 
              level in the 66th minute as Wesley Sneijder set up Milito despite Roma's
               claims for offside, but on-loan striker Luca Toni netted the winner six
               minutes later after a wayward shot by substitute Rodrigo Taddei dropped
               in his path.</p>
              <p>Milito was again left ruing a close miss as he hit 
              the post deep into injury-time, sealing a frustrating defeat ahead of 
              Wednesday's Champions League quarterfinal first leg against CSKA Moscow.</p>
              <p>Roma are now unbeaten in 21 league games, a run which began with a 
              1-1 draw at Inter in November when Ranieri's side were 14 points adrift 
              of the Nerazzuri.</p>
              <p>The result was satisfying for Ranieri, who was 
              replaced by Mourinho at English club Chelsea in 2004.</p>
              <p>"Now we 
              face a battle of nerves in our remaining games and the real deal begins.
               We will not give up although Inter are still one point ahead of us," he
               told reporters</p>
              <p>Third-placed <strong>AC Milan</strong>, who lost to Parma 
              in midweek, can join Roma on 62 points with seven matches to play by 
              beating <strong>Lazio</strong> on Sunday.</p>

              <p>Daniele de Rossi was delighted with his goal in <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Roma</span></abbr>'s
               2-1 win over <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Inter
               Milan</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>The victory saw <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Roma</span></abbr> cut Inter's lead to just one point.</p>
              <p>De Rossi celebrated by taking off his shin pad and kissing it, but 
              reveals there was an ulterior reason.</p>
              <p>“My daughter Gaia's picture is on the inside, so I was kissing her. I 
              also kissed the club symbol on my shirt, as I love <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Roma</span></abbr> too much, second only to my daughter. That's not a lie!</p>
              <p>“Now we have to believe in the Scudetto. Admittedly, at the start I was 
              very sceptical about our chances, but now we're here it would be 
              criminal not to give it our best.</p>
              <p>“Inter are a top side with everything it takes to win and we hope the 
              Champions League can distract them.”</p>
              <p>De Rossi was one of the most vocally critical when Inter took the 
              Scudetto on the last day of the 2007-08 campaign.</p>
              <p>“I have already had my say on that season and haven't changed my mind. 
              Nobody can take our performance that year away from us. There is rivalry
               with Inter, but not hate.</p>
              <p>“This season there is a certain consistency in the refereeing. There can
               be mistakes, but they have the guts to make the right decisions.”</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Roma</span></abbr> coach Claudio Ranieri says they're going for the Scudetto after victory

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Luca
               Toni</span></abbr> and Daniele de Rossi struck the goals for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Roma</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>“It was an important game, but not just for me, for all of Rome and the 
              people who follow us. We made sacrifices and fought back for five 
              months, now we have beaten a stratospheric side like Inter,” said 
              Ranieri.</p>
              <p>“I must praise my lads for always playing their football and seeking the
               goal. It was a fascinating game.</p>
              <p>“The first 40 minutes were excellent, playing it simple and passing the 
              ball around well. Towards the break Inter made their presence felt and 
              in the second half we struggled a little, but remained solid and united.
               Those who came off the bench were also aggressive and played their 
              part.</p>
              <p>“We're not hiding our Scudetto ambitions, but we are still a point 
              behind. There's a long way to go and it'll be a real battle of wills, as
               points can be dropped or picked up. We're in the final straight now, 
              the lads are in good shape and we can target the Scudetto.</p>
              <p>“Having Francesco Totti in the side is a great help, of course. It won't
               be easy from now on, as every side is scrapping for every point. We 
              must be humble and take it one game at a time.”</p>
