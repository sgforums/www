              <h1>England 2 Hungary 1: Steven Gerrard comes to Fabio Capello's rescue 
              with two fabulous goals at Wembley as England ease some of World Cup 
              misery</h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>F<span>ortunately for England, Steven 
              Gerrard dismissed those thoughts of international retirement as quickly 
              as they entered his mind in the wake of the World Cup.</span></p>
              <p><span>Because
               here at Wembley came yet more evidence of why this brilliant Liverpool 
              midfielder will be central to England's recovery after the bitter 
              disappointment of South Africa.</span></p>
              <p><span>Two
               goals in four second-half minutes arrived like a resuscitation trolley 
              in England's emergency ward, not least because of the manner in which 
              Hungary had seized the lead and the storm brewing over Fabio Capello's 
              untimely dumping of David Beckham.</span></p>

              <p><span>After what had happened in
              Bloemfontein little more than a month ago, it was extraordinary.
              Another goal-line decision that again went against Capello's side
              because of FIFA's refusal to employ modern technology.</span></p>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p><span>Against Germany,
              Frank Lampard was denied a goal that was. Against Hungary Phil Jagielka
              was credited with an own goal that wasn't, the French officials failing
              to see that Michael Dawson had made a brilliant clearance.</span></p>
              <p><span>When that moment came in the 61st
              minute, England were in serious danger of sliding into a deeper, darker
              depression. After the goal came the sight of Wayne Rooney waving
              sarcastically to the fans booing him as he left the field.</span></p>
              <p><span>But then up stepped Gerrard, so
              often the courageous captain of Liverpool and now England's skipper and
              saviour with the kind of goals that only players of his quality score.
              A trademark effort from 20 yards and then something even more special.</span></p>
              <p><span>After receiving the ball from Ashley
              Young, Gerrard turned and accelerated away from three defenders before
              guiding his close-range effort past Gabor Kiraly. Brilliant.</span></p>
              <p><span>The
              30-year-old had invited England's supporters to boo but it was an
              altogether more positive response when the stadium announcer then
              declared that he had quite rightly been voted the man of the match.</span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="artSplitter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/11/article-0-0AC45FB3000005DC-962_634x410.jpg" alt="Eye for goal: Gerrard shoots past Gabor Kiraly for England's winner" width="634" height="410">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Eye for goal: Gerrard shoots past Gabor Kiraly for England's winner</em></p>
              </div>
              <p><span>Jeers gave way to cheers and nobody
              was smiling more than Gerrard who, unlike some of his former
              international team-mates, recognises that representing England is a
              privilege rather than a right.</span></p>
              <p><span>Capello must understand that, even
              if his response to his captain's goals was strangely passive. A sign of
              his nerves perhaps, probably after seeing Hungary celebrate that
              controversial opening goal. As Beckham discovered, Capello was keen to
              make a fresh start. A case of out with the old, in with the new, the
              new on this occasion being the system England's manager has finally
              returned to for his stuttering team.</span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="artSplitter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/11/article-0-0AC458E6000005DC-15_634x450.jpg" alt="Fantastic strike: Steven Gerrard fires home England's equaliser at Wembley" width="634" height="450">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Fantastic strike: Steven Gerrard fires home England's equaliser at Wembley</em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>Whether he could have deployed
              Rooney as a lone striker at the World Cup when the Manchester United
              forward was so clearly short of fitness is something that continues to
              divide opinion. But Capello opted for such an approach, handing Rooney
              the role he so enjoys performing at club level and selecting a midfield
              boasting width and pace as well as a position more suited to the
              considerable quality of Gerrard.</span></p>
              <p><span>No longer England's wide man on the
              left, he was much happier joining Lampard and Gareth Barry in a central
              trio and happier still, dare it be said, when the Chelsea man went off.</span></p>
              <p><span>As the Italian quite rightly stressed earlier this week, England are
              not a team that can be cured of their many ailments overnight. But this
              was a tentative step in the right direction, and a reason to be more
              optimistic than we were after the World Cup.</span></p>
              <p><span>Capello still has much to learn,
              however. That he only gave his players 45 minutes before reverting to
              good old 4-4-2 with Bobby Zamora as partner to Rooney would have been a
              frustration for all but the Fulham striker making his debut.</span></p>

              <p><span>And in a week when the national
              coach has suffered one setback after another, the manner in which he
              chose to call time on Beckham's international career once again raised
              questions about his judgment.</span></p>
              <p><span>After 115 caps the former England
              skipper, and someone who gave his time to assist Capello in South
              Africa as a member of the backroom staff, deserved better than to be
              publicly dumped during a television interview. Especially when Beckham
              remains so central to England's bid for the 2018 World Cup.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="artSplitter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/11/article-1302302-0AC452F9000005DC-133_634x444.jpg" alt="Marked man: Wayne Rooney wasn't short of attention from the visitors at Wembley" width="634" height="444">

              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>Had Capello contacted the
              35-year-old prior to making the announcement? He said he had tried.
              Sorry, not good enough. With Beckham's representatives then announcing
              that their client had no intention of retiring, it all amounted to
              something of a mess. Yet another PR blunder for the FA to contend with.</span></p>
              <p><span>After a relatively promising, if
              goalless, first half came the changes that marked the start of the
              second. Dawson for John Terry, Kieran Gibbs for Ashley Cole, Young for
              a lively Theo Walcott and Zamora for Lampard.</span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Plenty of empty seats: The fans stayed away in numbers after England's woeful World Cup campaign</em></p>
              </div>
              <p><span>It did not exactly
              improve the way England played, and when Jagielka's interception of a
              ball that was delivered by Tamas Hajnal flew towards England's goal
              Dawson made a clearance that referee Stephane Lannoy mistakenly thought
              was a fraction too late.</span></p>
              <p><span>But two minutes later and Gerrard
              made the most of a fine run from Gibbs with that thumping 20-yard
              finish before scoring from closer range after receiving a neat pass
              from Young. Only then did Gerrard leave the field for Jack Wilshere,
              but it will be some time before the young Arsenal midf ielder replaces
              England's skipper permanently.</span></p>
