              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger is confident a goalless draw against Liverpool in the first-leg of their UEFA Champions League quarter-final at Emirates will not spell the end of Arsenal's European campaign.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Reds are notorious for their near invincibility at Anfield in the coveted competition, but the French mentor believes if the Gunners fail to win their home tie, they will still have a chance when they make the trip to Merseyside.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wenger also feels the team with the greater temperament will book their place in the semi-finals. He said: "Of course we would like to win the home game on Wednesday, but 0-0 is never a disappointing result in the first leg. "We have seen many times that it puts the other team under huge pressure in the second game because they are in two minds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"They don't really know whether to go for it or to sit back and wait - it gives you every chance. "But it is true that Liverpool have 12 men at Anfield. Their crowd have played a big part in their European success, they have turned so many games because the rules are different in Europe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"In this sort of game between two English teams, I feel mental strength will be the deciding factor. This will be a test of character, who wants it more."</p>

              <p><strong>Running scared: Kolo Toure insists Arsenal have the mental edge over Liverpool as the teams prepare to meet three times in a week. Kolo Toure has insisted Liverpool will be running scared of Arsenal as the teams prepare for three titanic battles inside a week.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Gunners host Liverpool in the first leg of their European Cup quarter-final on Wednesday, and then play them in the league at the Emirates on Saturday, before the European return at Anfield next week. And Toure believes the memory of last season and Arsenal's three wins over Liverpool, including a stunning 6-3 League Cup win at Anfield, will give them a mental advantage.</p>
              <p>"It is an exciting tie," he said. "Last season we played them four times and we showed how strong we were - we beat them in three of those games. "It is going to be really tight, we know that, but we have the quality and I think they will be scared to play against us. "We need to show them that we have continued to improve and are even stronger than last season."</p>
              <p>Toure added in the April edition of the official Arsenal magazine: "We are used to playing against them, so we know we are in for a battle." Toure's Arsenal team-mate Cesc Fabregas is determined to get past Liverpool and then win a semi-final to realise his dream of playing in another European Cup final.</p>
              <p>However, his isn't so keen on the prospect of an all-English climax to the tournament. Fabregas said: "Obviously, everybody dreams, but you have to work hard to make dreams become reality. If you stay in bed then you are never going to obtain your dream.</p>
              <p>"I am dreaming of playing in another Champions League final. If it is against Barcelona it will be difficult because they have a great team. "All I want is another chance of playing in a final, whoever that is against. If we won, then in five years' time nobody will care who the opposition was.</p>
              <p>"I would have preferred to play a European team. To play in the Champions League against the same players that you play every week and see on the television, well, I would have preferred Barcelona, Madrid, an Italian team. "But this is what we have been given and we have to deal with it. I am still a youngster here. "When you look at the team I am still one of the youngest and am still a boy really. I do feel important and for any player that is vital."</p>

              <h1>Ferguson positive about Roma test</h1>
              <p class="first"><strong>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson is confident his side can handle Roma in Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg tie.</strong></p>
              <p>It is the fifth time the two sides have met in the last year and Ferguson is expecting his side to have the upper hand at the Stadio Olimpico. "Roma have improved this season but we have played them twice already and we know what to expect," the Scot said. "It won't be easy but, the form we are in now, we are looking forward to it." </p>
              <p>United warmed up for Tuesday's big game in Rome with a superb 4-0 win over Aston Villa on Saturday to stretch their lead at the top of the Premiership to five points. Wayne Rooney ended his six-match goal drought with a brace against Villa and is expecting United to take their form into Europe.</p>
              <p>"Roma is going to be a massive game for us and we prepared the right way with the win against Villa," said the England striker. "To be at this club, with the football we play, is brilliant. It's something every player would want to be part of."</p>
              <p>In a repeat of the 2007 quarter-finals, Manchester United were drawn with Roma having already met in this season's group stages, United winning 1-0 at home before a 1-1 draw in Rome. Last season, Roma won the first leg quarter-final 2-1 before United administered a 7-1 thrashing at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>"The first time we came here we found the first 20 minutes very difficult, the way they pressed the game, and it took us a long time to adjust," added Ferguson. "Now we are playing them again and hopefully we have overcome those difficulties."</p>
              <p>However, Roma coach Luciano Spalletti is confident his team will rise to the occasion this time against Ferguson's men. "These are special games, which bring something extra out of the players," he said. "We are, as always, well prepared with the right sort of calmness to go out and express the right characteristics and the right quality."</p>

              <p><strong>UEFA THREATEN TO MOVE 2009 FINAL</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>UEFA have threatened to move the 2009 Champions League final from Rome's Stadio Olimpico if Manchester United fans are targeted in the Italian capital on Tuesday night. Ten United fans were stabbed last season when the club played Roma, and there was more trouble when Real Madrid visited last month.</strong></p>
              <p>Previously, three Middlesbrough fans were stabbed in 2006 and there have been numerous incidents involving knife-wielding gangs outside the stadium before domestic matches. UEFA communications director William Gaillard said they were serious about moving the final if there was more trouble.</p>
              <p>Gaillard said: "The situation inside the stadium has improved dramatically and we hope it will go well tomorrow and there are no reasons to expect problems inside the stadium. "But we cannot afford to organise the final of the Champions League in a city where people are getting knifed every game. "We will be watching and we are serious that if we have incidents like when Manchester United visited last year or Real Madrid last month, then we would have to reconsider our decision for the 2009 final."</p>
              <p>He added: "We cannot have responsibility for bringing 40,000 people to the final and risk them being knifed in the city. "We will be watching closely tomorrow and the rest of the season and next season. The police have to do their job. "It's a fantastic venue and a beautiful city, and we realise these people have nothing to do with football, but if fans are afraid and it's dangerous we will have to look at the whole matter."</p>
              <p>United have issued detailed advice for fans and warned them to use official free shuttle buses rather than travel independently on public transport. They have also warned supporters to avoid Rome's famous Campo de Fiori piazza, and metro routes used by 'ultras'.</p>
              <p>The club's advice states: "Please stay as far away as possible from Campo De Fiori which is the meeting point for the Roma fans and a place where there has been a lot of trouble in the past with 'Ultra' Roma fans. For your own safety please avoid this area."</p>

              <p><strong>ZICO READY TO ATTACK CHELSEA</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://clientimages.teamtalk.com/08/04/240/Zico_Fenerbahce_coach_762024.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180"></p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Fenerbahce boss Zico will remain faithful to his Brazilian heritage by sending out his side to attack Chelsea - but he may have to do it without his compatriot Roberto Carlos. The Turkish title-holders had been hoping for their left-back to help take the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final to Avram Grant's men after he recovered from a shin injury.</strong></p>
              <p>However, the veteran has only been in training for four days and Zico concedes he is likely to start on the bench at the Sukru Saracoglu Stadium. "He cannot complete 90 minutes at the moment but he is doing better," said the Fenerbahce boss.</p>
              <p>Zico played for Brazil in the 1982 World Cup - arguably the best team not to have won the tournament - and he has taken his attacking philosophy into management. Chelsea have not conceded a goal in six Champions League games but Zico feels his side have the quality to cause them trouble.</p>
              <p>"My philosophy as a player and a coach did not change, the entertainment side of football is about scoring goals. As a coach I have the same aims - clean performances with fair play and entertainment," he said. In Fenerbahce's favour is the fact that they are unbeaten in the Champions League at their Istanbul home this season.</p>
              <p>"We are ready for the game," Zico added. "We deserve the place we have now as we have shown our character is to attack. "Chelsea have a strong defence, we know that, but we also have a good attacking team and good attackers, so we believe we can break their defence."</p>
              <p>Chelsea can also expect the traditional hostile welcome from Fener fans. "Our fans are so passionate, it drives the team and the players. Chelsea players and fans can expect it to be no different," said Zico. Chelsea will be without Petr Cech in goal and Carlo Cudicini looked uncomfortable deputising against Middlesbrough at the weekend, but Zico added: "Apart from looking nervous, he also made good saves so it is not something we can focus on.</p>
              <p>"There are always mistakes in a match. The key is to reduce them to a minimum level ourselves and take advantage when our opponents make them." Zico has made huge strides in his short time in the Turkish capital and he feels facing Chelsea will be a measure of their progress. "There are three things that can show progress - improving the level of football, working hard and improving the squad. We will see how well we are doing when we face Chelsea," he said.</p>

              <p><strong>FC Schalke 04 will play in the quarter-finals of Europe's premier club competition for the first time since the 1958/59 season when they meet FC Barcelona. The Spanish side are striving for a second UEFA Champions League success in three years and have yet to lose in the competition this season. Mirko Slomka's side will be hoping to upset the odds again, as they did by qualifying from the group stage before ousting FC Porto on penalties to reach this juncture.</strong></p>

              <p><strong>Roma 0 - <span style="color: #ff0000;">2 Manchester United</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>

              <p><span><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #808080;">
              </span></span></span></p><p><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>The prolific Ronaldo gets his name on the scoresheet yet again as he heads home his seventh goal in this year's Champions League</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"></span></p>
              
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Manchester United took a giant stride towards the Champions League semi-finals with a clinical victory against AS Roma at the Stadio Olimpico.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Cristiano Ronaldo headed home his 36th goal of the season from Paul Scholes' cross six minutes before half-time. Roma rallied, with Christian Panucci missing from close range and Edwin van der Sar saving brilliantly from Mirko Vucinic's 61st-minute header. But Rooney bundled home United's crucial second five minutes later. </span> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The result leaves United clear favourites to reach a likely semi-final showdown against Barcelona. Sir Alex Ferguson made three changes from the side that won so emphatically against Aston Villa on Saturday - Van der Sar, Anderson and Ji-Sung Park replacing Tomasz Kuszczak, Ryan Giggs and Carlos Tevez.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Vucinic led the Roma attack in place of injured captain Francesco Totti, and he was a lively figure in a first 45 minutes that saw United relatively untroubled. Panucci posed an early threat when he rose to meet David Pizarro's corner but headed over the top. </span> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">It prompted a response from Ferguson after 55 minutes as Owen Hargreaves was sent on for the disappointing Anderson, who was also suffering a hamstring problem. Roma were testing United's resolve, and just after the hour Van der Sar needed to produce a stunning reflex save to turn away Vucinic's flicked header. But United survived the siege to break out and deliver a stunning counter-punch to double their advantage.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Park did well to head Wes Brown's long cross into the danger area and when Doni failed to collect, Rooney bundled home from inside the six-yard box. Roma, understandably, looked demoralised and United came within inches of adding a third and effectively putting the tie to bed late on.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">First Ronaldo fired a low shot against an upright before Michael Carrick was just inches off-target from 20 yards as United gathered momentum. Then, with seconds remaining, Ronaldo almost crowned the perfect in night in spectacular fashion when he volleyed just over from substitute Tevez's cross.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Vucinic was just off target before United suffered a blow after 29 minutes when Nemanja Vidic was carried off after landing awkwardly on his knee in an aerial challenge. However, United reacted well to the setback and took the lead with a priceless away goal from Ronaldo six minutes before the interval.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Scholes sat up an inviting cross and Ronaldo rose superbly to power a downward header past Doni. The Portuguese winger took a heavy bang to the head in scoring, but recovered quickly to carry on. Vucinic could have levelled two minutes later, but he jabbed a finish across the face of goal after escaping the attentions of the United defence.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Roma set about United with intent after the break, Max Tonetto sending a powerful drive just wide and Panucci wasting their best chance of the night when he blasted over from close range after United failed to deal with Vucinic's long throw.</span></p>
              <span style="color: #000000;">

              <p class="storycopy">The Spain international has scored 11 goals in his last 10 matches - including the winner in Sunday's Merseyside derby - and has found the net four times in his previous four European outings. "The first game at the Emirates will be very difficult. The most important thing is to score - if we score it is very good for the Anfield game but Arsenal play very well and it is very difficult to win," he said.<br><br>"They won a very difficult game on Saturday (beating Bolton 3-2 with 10 men) but we have confidence again now and we have the confidence to go and win against Arsenal."</p>
              <p class="storycopy">The team produced the perfect response to the defeat to Manchester United a week last Sunday by claiming derby day bragging rights thanks to Torres' solitary strike. And that goal, which saw him become only the fifth player in the club's history to score in six successive home games, has boosted the Spaniard ahead of the crucial European encounter.<br><br>"Whenever you have a bad result, you need a big game with a good result," added the 24-year-old. "Every player is over the Manchester United result and the important thing is to win. <br><br>"Now we have an important game coming against Arsenal and six games in the league."</p>

              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Great thinkers: Benitez and Wenger are plotting European success</span></p>
              <h1>Arsenal v Liverpool: Head to head</h1>
              <p>Two of England's finest are preparing for a Champions League match at the Emirates Stadium that starts a series of three games between the sides in the space of a week. Here Sportsmail sees how the rival squads match up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>MANAGERS</strong></p>
              <p>Arsene Wenger can count his time at Arsenal as an unqualified success, having transformed what was an underachieving side into regular title-challengers and one of the most admired footballing units on the planet.</p>
              <p>The Frenchman is rightly lauded for his uncanny knack of uncovering lavishly talented, but modestly priced, youngsters and is heralded for being one of the game's most astute tacticians.</p>
              <p>Liverpool counterpart Rafael Benitez has enjoyed mixed fortunes since replacing Gerard Houllier at Anfield.</p>
              <p>He has helped pen several chapters in the club's fabled European history and has made his players one of the hardest teams on the continent to beat in cup competition.</p>
              <p>On the down side, his failure to mount a credible title challenge domestically counts against him.</p>
              <p><strong>PAST MEETINGS</strong></p>
              <p>The Merseysiders have won just one of the last six meetings between the clubs in all competitions - albeit doing so in handsome fashion with a 4-1 victory at Anfield last March.</p>
              <p>The Gunners won the remaining fixtures last term, clocking up 12 goals in games spread across the league and both cup competitions.</p>
              <p>The most memorable of those came with a 6-3 victory in the Carling Cup quarter-final as both sides fielded under-strength line-ups.</p>
              <p>Earlier this season goals from respective midfield dynamos Cesc Fabregas and Steven Gerrard cancelled each other out.</p>
              <p><strong>EUROPEAN PEDIGREE</strong></p>
              <p>Liverpool have won the European Cup five times, the most recent coming on that incredible night in Istanbul in May 2005 where the Reds came from three goals down to beat AC Milan on penalties.</p>
              <p>They reached the final again last season, when Carlo Ancelotti's team took their revenge, and after seeing off Serie A leaders Inter Milan in the last round Benitez's men look ready for another tilt at the trophy.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_01/liverpool0204_468x335.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Arsenal have never quite become the European force under Wenger that the Frenchman would have hoped. They fell at the final hurdle in the 2006 Champions League to Barcelona and were UEFA Cup runners-up in 2000. The Gunners won the 1994 European Cup Winners' Cup under George Graham and the 1970 Fairs Cup.</span></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>FORM</strong></p>
              <p>Arsenal come into the match stung by their most worrying run of form for a year.</p>
              <p>They came from a man down and two goals behind to clinch a nail-biting win against relegation-threatened Bolton on Saturday - hardly an intimidating result, but one which ended a winless spell that brought just four points from a possible 15 in the league.</p>
              <p>Liverpool meanwhile, approach the tie having enjoyed both their most and least favourite results in the domestic calendar.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_01/arsenal0204_468x363.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>Loser: Thierry Henry walks past the trophy after missing to Barca in the 2006 final</strong></p>
              <p>A 3-0 reverse against perennial rivals Manchester United was a bitter pill to swallow but the Reds restored the feelgood factor by seeing off Merseyside derby opponents Everton at the weekend, to all but seal fourth place.</p>
              <p>Liverpool have won eight of their last nine fixtures.</p>

              <p><strong>Arsenal FC and Liverpool FC will soon be used to the sight of each other as they meet three times in seven days. Both sides have been runners-up in the past two seasons while each progressed to this stage by knocking out a team from Milan in the last round. But their progress prior to that was contrasting with the London club cruising to qualification in Group H while the Anfield outfit had to win their last three group games to avoid earlier elimination.</strong> </p>

              <h1>Arsenal 1-1 Liverpool</h1>
              <p class="first"><strong>Liverpool have the advantage after holding Arsenal to a draw in the Champions League quarter-final, first leg at The Emirates.</strong></p>
              <p>Emmanuel Adebayor headed Arsenal in front in powerful fashion from Robin van Persie's cross after 23 minutes.</p>
              <p>Arsenal's lead lasted only three minutes before Steven Gerrard set up Dirk Kuyt to score from close range.</p>
              <p>The Gunners had a clear penalty appeal turned down after the break when Kuyt hauled back Alexander Hleb in the area.</p>

              <h1>Fenerbahce 2-1 Chelsea</h1>
              <p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/44535000/jpg/_44535145_deividcel_getty.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="300"></p>
              <p><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Deivid makes amends for his own-goal as he rifles a stunning30-yard strike into the top corner of the net to earn the hosts a late win.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="first"><strong>Fenerbahce mounted a stunning comeback to shock Chelsea in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final.</strong></p>
              <p>Chelsea took the lead when Deivid diverted Florent Malouda's cross into his own net and Michael Essien also hit the bar in a one-sided first half.</p>
              <p>But the Turkish side levelled when London-born Colin Kazim-Richards smashed home Mehmet Aurelio's pass.</p>
              <p>And Deivid made amends for his early error to win the game with a superb 30-yard strike into the top corner.</p>
              <p>Teams of the calibre of Inter Milan, PSV Eindhoven and Sevilla have also come a cropper at the Sukru Saracoglu stadium this season but Chelsea's defeat was a huge surprise after the way they began the game.</p>
              <p>The hostile atmosphere provided by their fans has undoubtedly played a part in Fenerbahce's impressive home record in Europe but the Istanbul crowd were soon silenced here.</p>
              <p>Zico's tactic of pushing Fenerbahce's full-backs forward left Malouda and Joe Cole acres of space on the flanks in the early stages and it was from that route that the visitors' goal came.</p>
              <p>It seemed just a matter of time before Avram Grant's side got a second goal but instead, as the game wore on, Fenerbahce fought back.</p>
              <p>The former Bury and Brighton forward gave his side some much-needed energy up front alongside the lethargic Kezman and his pace also played a part in their equaliser.</p>
              <p>Richards ran clear to meet Aurelio's lobbed through ball and power his shot past a helpless Cudicini.</p>
              <p>That clearly rocked Chelsea and suddenly they were the side looking vulnerable, while Fenerbahce poured forward.</p>
              <p>Grant's side seemed to have weathered the storm, however, and they threatened again through Ballack before Deivid turned from villain to hero in dramatic style with nine minutes left.</p>
              <p>The Brazilian picked up the ball 30 yards from goal and considered his options before unleashing a thunderous strike that flew past Cudicini and into the roof of the net.</p>
              <p>Credit must go to Zico for masterminding his side's recovery but Chelsea's first defeat in Europe adds fuel to the fire for those who doubt Grant's ability in big games - and leaves the Blues boss with plenty to think about ahead of next Tuesday's second leg.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Fenerbahce:</strong> Demirel, Turaci, Lugano, Edu Dracena, Wederson, Maldonado, Aurelio, Boral (Kazim-Richards 54), Deivid, Alex, Kezman (Senturk 72). <br>Subs Not Used: Kulbilge, Cakmak, Aslan, Bilgin, Sahin.</p>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>ARSENE WENGER suffered ref rage as Liverpool edged closer to the Champions League semis.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Arsenal felt they were denied a penalty after Dirk Kuyt, who had earlier scored a vital away goal for the Reds, felled Alex Hleb.</p>
              <p class="article">Boss Wenger said: “There was a blatant penalty right under the eyes of the referee. That has happened a few times now and that makes it hard to accept.</p>
              <p class="article">“He was five yards away from Kuyt and didn’t give the penalty.</p>
              <p class="article">“It’s difficult to understand, frankly.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>

              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"><strong>Dutch ref Pieter Vink waved away Arsenal’s claims for a spot-kick when Hleb crashed to the ground under Kuyt’s challenge on 66 minutes with the score at 1-1.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Kuyt understood Wenger’s frustration but insisted fellow Dutchman Vink got it spot on. The striker said: “It’s just a split second you have to decide. I didn’t pull his shirt, it was never a penalty — but it was close.”</p>
              <p class="article">Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez added: “I watched the replay and it wasn’t clear.</p>
              <p class="article">“It wouldn’t have been given in the Premier League.”</p>
              <p class="article">Wenger admitted his young side lost their bottle after Liverpool equalised.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “We were unsettled. You could see that it was a big blow to take.</p>
              <p class="article">“We’d scored the first goal and, when we conceded, I felt straight away that was like a thunderstorm going through the team.</p>
              <p class="article">“We lost composure and showed our nerves a little bit.</p>
              <p class="article">“I feel we are not paid for what we produced tonight. To finish a game like that 1-1 is disappointing.</p>
              <p class="article">“Overall, we had the chances to win the game and Liverpool created very little. The whole of the second half was played in one half.”</p>
