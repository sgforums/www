              <h1>Roman Abramovich May Sack Carlo Ancelotti As Stars Such As Didier Drogba Set Their Sights On Leaving Chelsea In Summer – Report</h1>
              <div id="small_article_image_container"><img src="http://u.goal.com/120200/120256_news.jpg" alt="Didier Drogba - Chelsea (Getty Images)">

              <p> </p>
              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> </span></p>
              <p><em><a href="http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2559/rumours/archive/1"></a></em><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> striker </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Didier Drogba</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> is set to leave the club in the summer - and manager Carlo Ancelotti could also be heading for the Stamford Bridge exit door, according to a report in <em>The</em> <em>Sunday Times</em>.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Real Madrid remain strong contenders to secure the 32-year-old Ivorian’s signature, as Jose Mourinho seeks to add a striker to his squad.</p>
              <p>And despite Ancelotti’s good relationship with the players and backroom staff, few expect the Italian to remain at the helm for next season, as Chelsea’s owner Roman Abramovich is unhappy with the team's recent slump and apparently unconvinced by the manager's training methods.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti’s tenure at the club has been tainted following Ray Wilkins’ controversial exit and Chelsea’s sudden dip in form following a bright start to the season.</p>
              <p>There has been much debate about how significant an impact Wilkins' departure has actually had on the squad, while many feel the club have failed to appoint the right man to replace him as assistant manager by promoting under-qualified Michael Emanlo from the scouting staff.</p>
              <p>Further complaints have been aired about the medical staff, with Ancelotti apparently holding them partly responsible for the failure to get Frank Lampard, Michael Essien and Jose Bosingwa back from injury quickly enough following numerous operations.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Chelsea’s waning bargaining power was revealed when Steven Pienaar revealed that he had in fact snubbed the Blues in order to sign for Tottenham, after they offered him an extra £15,000-a-week in wages.</p>
              <p>The club are looking to add new recruits before the winter transfer window closes, and a deal for David Luiz may be secured by the end of the week, as Benfica president Luis Filipe Viera flew to London and dined with the player’s agent, reportedly discussing Luiz’s future.</p>
              <p>Chelsea originally offered Benfica £8.5 million for the 23-year-old, but it is reported that as much as £23m will be needed to acquire the player's services.</p>
              <p>Luiz’s Brazilian international team-mate Hulk has also been linked with Chelsea, who have been told that it will take £24.5m for them to lure the striker away from Porto.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">The Blues’ move for Sergio Aguero has reportedly gathered momentum since the new year, although it is thought that a deal is unlikely before the summer.</p>

              <div class="firstPar">
              <p><strong>The date was Sept 1, 2008 and, for the first time under the billionaire ownership of Roman Abramovich, </strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chelsea</span></strong></span></a><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> had lost out on a player to rivals with deeper pockets. </strong></span></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Robinho duly joined Manchester City for a British transfer record fee of £32.5 million and the Premier League</span> landscape has not been the same since.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>In a stroke, Chelsea’s reputation as the school playground’s ultimate bully was dismantled. And, although there have been three further trophies, the sense that this is an ageing Chelsea team with an excessive reliance on the core of John Terry, Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba has only heightened.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>It had been hoped that the inevitable transition could be managed rather than bought. The rationale was that the initial spending splurge had been necessary but, with millions also invested in the academy, Chelsea would produce a conveyor belt of young talent.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>One key consideration was missing: clubs with the best history of producing players — Manchester United, Arsenal and Crewe Alexandra — tend also to have had stability in the dugout.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>For Chelsea, with Abramovich also expecting instant success, no manager can have felt sufficient job security to risk the sort of faith in young talent as Arsène Wenger has at Arsenal.</p>
              <p>So if Chelsea are unable to organically grow their way out of the current slump, can we expect a return to the sort of spending to rival Manchester City?</p>
              <p>The evidence is mounting that Abramovich is no longer prepared to sign the sort of cheques that he once seemed to distribute like confetti.</p>
              <p>Andrei Shevchenko, Didier Drogba, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Ricardo Carvalho and Michael Essien all cost in excess of £19 million, but the last of the club’s five most expensive transfer fees was paid in 2006.</p>
              <p>Abramovich is certainly a less obvious presence at Chelsea matches than during the first few years and there is a long-standing suspicion that his interest may have waned.</p>
              <p>It is also difficult to ignore Russia’s 2018 World Cup bid. Abramovich has already ploughed millions into improving football facilities in his homeland and has been closely involved with the successful 2018 campaign.</p>
              <p>The expectation of significant financial support is no secret. “Let him dip into his pocket a bit,” said Vladimir Putin, the Russia president. “It’s no big deal; he won’t feel the pinch. He has plenty of money.”</p>
              <p>Abramovich’s spokesman has responded by stressing that his backing for Chelsea would “absolutely” continue.</p>
              <p>There are other pressures. It is no secret that Abramovich was affected by the global credit crunch. Estimates of his wealth vary but, from 11th on the Forbes rich list in 2006 with a worth of £11.4 billion, he had fallen to 50th last year at £7 billion.</p>
              <p>Uefa’s new rules on ‘financial fair-play’ are also significant. It was interesting that Abramovich was among those to give his personal support to Michel Platini’s principle that, from the accounting year 2011-12, clubs should not run at a loss.</p>
              <p>Yet without another major spending spree, it is difficult to see how Chelsea will keep pace with Manchester City or even the more stable environments for nurturing players of Arsenal and United.</p>
