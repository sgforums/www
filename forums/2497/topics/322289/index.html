              <p><strong>Robson de Souza or Robinho as he is more widely known has been linked to the Premier League for a number of seasons but rumours persist that at least Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea are still vying for his services this summer.</strong></p>
              <p>The 24-year-old’s agent Wagner Ribeiro is reportedly in <a title="Premier 10" href="http://www.footballpools.com/content/offers/premier10-scratch-freeplay.shtml"></a>England to drum up interest in the player whose contract renewal talks at the Bernebau have stalled. Whether his club would allow the talented star to leave remains to be seen particularly after Robinho enjoyed his most productive season so far in the last campaign as he scored 11 goals in 32 League appearances (27 starts).</p>
              <p>Since joining Real Madrid in July 2005 the Brazilian hasn’t quite lived up to the huge expectations placed on his young shoulders. However, in just 3 seasons Robinho has scored 25 goals in 101 League appearances despite playing under 4 different managers and has won 2 successive La Liga titles.</p>
              <p>This season he’s played much of his football on the left-wing whilst in his early career with Brazilian club Santos he was used in a far more attacking role which led to an impressive scoring rate of 44 goals in 104 League appearances. The 24-year-old’s form in his homeland led to personal accolades such as the Brazilian League’s top scorer, Player of the Year and the prestigious World Soccer Young Player of the Year award.</p>
              <p>Robinho has continued to flourish at international level where he’s won 54 caps despite his tender age and the competition for places whilst scoring 13 goals. He struggled to make an impact at the 2006 World Cup but was named Player of the tournament as well as finished top scorer in Brazil’s 2007 Copa America win.</p>
              <p>Prior to joining Real Madrid Arsene Wenger was a firm admirer of the youngster’s talent as were Tottenham and Liverpool. However, now it seems that United, Arsenal and Chelsea will be front runners for his signature if he were to become available as few can compete with their financial muscle.</p>
              <p>So would you like to see Robinho doing his many step-overs in the Premier League? Do you think he would be a major hit for your club or do you feel his skills are not suited to the English game? Let’s hear your views.</p>
