              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/43531/Samir-Nasri"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Samir Nasri</strong></span></a><strong> believes it could be Arsenal's "turn" to win the Premier League title after a weekend of favourable results saw the Gunners climb up to second and close the gap on leaders Chelsea.</strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=5"><span style="color: #000000;">Arsene Wenger</span></a>'s side registered a second away win in three days when they followed up victory at Wolves with a 2-1 success at Everton.</p>
              <p>It followed on from Manchester United gaining a fortunate 2-2 draw at Aston Villa, while Chelsea then suffered a shock 3-0 home reversal against Sunderland to leave the Gunners just two points behind the blues in second place.</p>
              <p>"You have got to say it was an excellent weekend for us with United drawing and Chelsea defeated," Nasri said.</p>
              <p>"Is it our title year? It is definitely a case of being optimistic for the future and, maybe, it could be our turn. We are in a good position, just behind Chelsea, which is quite exciting for us and the league as a whole.''</p>
              <p>Nasri believes Arsenal have restored their reputation after shock home defeats to newly promoted West Brom and Newcastle ahead of this weekend's derby with Tottenham.</p>
              <p>"Having done so well, now we must look ahead to what will be a very difficult game on Saturday (against Tottenham). We will have to fight hard to get the result but I feel our reputation is restored and we can do well.''</p>
              <p>The former Marseille midfielder is currently preparing for France's friendly international with England at Wembley on Wednesday and has mixed feelings about the timing of the international.</p>
              <p>"Arsenal have got big games coming up so maybe the fixture-wise, it is not ideal," he said. "But it is always a big game against England and no one would turn down the chance to play at Wembley. There is always extra rivalry between England and France.''</p>
              <p>Nasri will likely come face-to-face with club team-mate <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/122089/Jack-Wilshere"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Jack Wilshere</span></span></a> at Wembley, and he has no doubt that the young England midfielder is destined for the top.</p>
              <p>"I am not surprised at all by the progress Jack has made," Nasri said. "He had already shown signs in training about what a talented player he was. Like any young player, he needed to be given the opportunity to play.</p>
              <p>"Not all players can get a chance to play at the biggest clubs and Jack's time at Bolton helped him to progress. Jack is only 18 but he is already getting a regular slot at Arsenal.He has already shown he has the quality and technical ability.''</p>
              <p>"What he needs to do now is continue his progress without any fear of what is to come. The signs are good. He knows how important it is to go forward and play with a positive mindset. I like playing with him because he has so much technical ability and such great skill.''</p>

              <p>it's always better to cross your finger's and not say "we are optimistic". Look what happened to salomon kalou's chelsea after he claimed they could wrap up the title by Xmas. Chelsea got thrashed by sunderland and mauled by liverpool.</p>
              <p>After liverpool's recent good run, roy hodgson says "let's look forward to top four". And they lost to Stoke. Now nasri talks like that....haha....I shall bet that the jinx continues.</p>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Evra opened the scoring in the first half of Saturday's <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=292889&amp;cc=4716&amp;league=ENG.1">2-0 win over Wigan Athletic</a> with his first goal since 2007, and after Chelsea's loss to Birmingham, United are level on points with the league leaders.</p>
              <p>"I
              said before the game that if we beat Wigan and Blackburn next week we
              would be top of the league, and I am still confident of that," Evra
              said. "But I think the team can give much more than we are giving right
              now. We are still at the top of the league, but against Blackburn we
              need to play from the first minute, not just at the end of the game."</p>
              <p>The
              French full back called for his team to up their performance in their
              next match against Blackburn and for them to play the "United" way.</p>
              <p>"We
              are Manchester United and we need to be more aggressive and score more
              goals - and to bring back the way United play always," he said.</p>
              <p>He
              also acknowledged the contribution made by his teammate and close
              friend Park Ji-Sung, who put in the cross for Evra's headed goal.</p>
              <p>"I don't think my son was even born the last time I scored a goal for United,'' Evra said on <em>MUTV</em>. "It was a good cross from my best friend Park Ji-Sung, I think maybe I'll get him a big present for Christmas, maybe a car."</p>

              <p><em>Not so cheery: Samir Nasri's wonderful opening goal was overshadowed by William Gallas' match-winning performance</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Samir Nasri has continued his war of the words with William Gallas by claiming he'd never plunge the depths of the former Arsenal skipper and switch clubs to the 'sworn enemy'.</strong></p>
              <p>Frenchman Nasri was left with little to cheer on Saturday after his astonishing opening goal in the north London derby was overshadowed by a stunning Tottenham comeback and a man of the match performance from his old team-mate Gallas.</p>
              <p>The Arsenal man caused a stir prior to kick-off when he refused to shake hands with his international colleague over a feud dating back to a row on France duty at Euro 2008. The animosity intensified when Gallas wrote in his autobiography about the insolence of an unnamed youngster, now known to be Nasri.</p>
              <p>Only once before have players refused to shake hands since the Barclays Premier League introduced the pre-match goodwill gesture, when Wayne Bridge snubbed John Terry after allegations of Terry's affair with Bridge's former girlfriend.</p>
              <p>That day Bridge's Manchester City emerged victorious and the Englishman kept quiet. But after Saturday's shock result at Emirates Nasri couldn't resist another attack on Gallas.</p>
              <p>'There are always ups and downs in life but I have a lot of respect for the way a player stays loyal to his club,' the Arsenal man is quoted as saying in The Sun.</p>

              <p>When told about Nasri's outburst, Gallas, 10 years his senior, retorted: 'Yes, Nasri snubbed me but I think that he's still young, you have to understand him. It’s a shame that he reacted this way. Yes, let’s just say it’s a shame for him.'</p>

              <p><strong>Now he is even being compared to England icon Bobby Moore.</strong></p>
              <p>
              </p><p>Tottenham fans kicked up a stink when Harry Redknapp signed the former Arsenal skipper in the summer.</p>
              <p>But they were chanting the Frenchman's name after another impeccable performance in the 3-0 win over Werder Bremen,</p>
              <p>And boss Redknapp said: "William was fantastic again - one piece of defending from him was particularly marvellous to watch.</p>
              <p>"He shuffled Marko Marin down the line, held him up once, held him up again and the took the ball off him.</p>
              <p>"It was a little bit reminiscent - I know its a long time ago - but I remember Bobby Moore doing that to Jairzinho.</p>
              <p>"It looked like Bobby was in trouble but he stayed on his feet, used his brain, held him up, fantastic defending."</p>
              <p>Redknapp gave Gallas the Tottenham armband for the first time in Saturday's 3-2 win over his old club at the Emirates.</p>
              <p>And he kept it on Wednesday as Spurs clinched their place in the Champions League last 16 in their first year in the competition.</p>
              <p>Gallas said: "Maybe the reason we have settled so well in the Champions League is the manager has a little bit of magic.</p>
              <p>"After Saturday's win at Arsenal, I think the players know we can do something. We have to to believe in ourselves and fight for 90 minutes.</p>
              <p>"Now we have a big Premier League game against Liverpool on Sunday and I think with the squad we've got we can do everything."</p>
              <p>Striker Peter Crouch, who played in the 2007 Champions League final for Liverpool, believes Spurs' current squad is better than the one from his days at Anfield.</p>
              <p>He said: "We had some great individuals when I was at Liverpool and we managed to reach a Champions League final, which was fantastic.</p>
              <p>"But I think it might be a better group of players here. I don't think I've played with better, really."</p>
