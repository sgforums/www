              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> striker Michael Owen says he won't be fazed facing former club <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> this season.</p>
              <p>"I used to play for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> and I know a couple of the players, but there have been a lot of
              changes there," he said. "I am quite mature about football. I don't
              feel the need to react if people sing a song about me. Call me boring
              but it is not in my make-up."</p>
              <p>There is a certain irony in the shift of opinion on Owen's
              career that has taken place since his Old Trafford move was confirmed.</p>
              <p>From being a washed-up old has-been, destined for the scrap
              yard, the 29-year-old is now on the cusp of a complete rejuvenation,
              gone from Phil Brown's Hull to Ferguson's United.</p>
              <p>It is quite a transformation although, as ever, the truth is far more mundane.</p>
              <p>"There are some clubs from whom it is quite good if they say
              they want to sign you," he said. "It gives their fans a lift to think
              their team is going in for a player like Michael Owen.</p>
              <p>"But I could have gone to a number of other clubs who were doing things much more quietly.</p>
              <p>"And, in the end, the one man who in world football who you
              would want a good opinion from is the one man who wanted to sign me."</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Man Utd's Owen frustrated by Newcastle criticism</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> signing Michael Owen admits he's hurt by criticism of his time at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Newcastle United</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>The star striker has been stung by repeated criticism of his behaviour,
              particularly helicopter flights back to his Cheshire home from the
              north-east and a fledgling horse-breeding business being run by his
              wife Louise.</p>
              <p>Both have been used as evidence Owen's heart was not with the
              Tyneside outfit, a damning verdict on their Â£18million record signing
              which he is anxious to counter.</p>
              <p>"You learn to understand the reaction but if you do step back, you think it is strange or unfair," he said.</p>
              <p>"When you are being relegated, nobody is interested in listening to you. But I knew it was all to do with me not scoring.</p>
              <p>"If you don't score and you don't win, you are wrong to have a
              helicopter and fly home each week to see your kids. You are wrong to
              have a business outside of football. You are wrong to plan for the
              future.</p>
              <p>"If the goals had been going in I would have been a great lad,
              popping home to see my three kids and be a family man on a Tuesday
              after training. I would have been thoughtful and innocent little things
              would not be misrepresented."</p>

              <p>"There are so many players on my wavelength - world-class players. I just know this move is going to be fantastic for me.</p>
              <p>"When you sign for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> there are that many things you think about; the players alongside you,
