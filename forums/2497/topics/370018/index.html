              <h1>Official AC Milan Website Announces Signing Of Giuseppe Rossi, Then Removes Story</h1>
              <h2>Was the Milan website hacked, or was this a sensational gaffe by the Rossoneri press who announced the signing too soon?</h2>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/42097_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="131"></p>
              <p>The official club website of AC Milan this afternoon announced the
              signing of Villarreal star Giuseppe Rossi, only for the story to then
              mysteriously disappear just moments later, according to <em>Radio 24</em> and <em>Radio Radio</em>.<br><br>The
              Rossoneri are well known to be in the market for a top class attacker,
              and recently failed in their attempts to sign Wolfsburg's Edin Dzeko
              and Sevilla's Luis Fabiano.<br><br>Villarreal forward Giuseppe Rossi
              has made no secret in the past of his wish to join Milan, the team he
              supported as a boy, but any transfer this summer had always appeared
              unlikely due to the Italian club's financial problems.<br><br>However,
              Milan then dropped a bombshell this afternoon by announcing the signing
              of the Confederations Cup star on their official website, only for the
              story to be removed moments later.<br><br>It seems that there are two possible explanations. Either <em>acmilan.com</em> was hacked by an outsider playing a practical joke, or this was a
              sensational gaffe by a Milan employee who published the announcement
              too early.<br><br>All Milan fans will be hoping for the second
              explanation, and the fact that Villarreal signed Brazilian striker
              Nilmar at the weekend will certainly boost their hopes that Rossi is
              indeed set to join the Rossoneri.</p>

              <p><strong>AC Milan's official website reportedly announced the signing of Villarreal forward Giuseppe Rossi on Monday, before the story rapidly disappeared again.</strong></p>
              <p>The San Siro giants are actively seeking a new recruit up-front,
              with Leonardo's side having already failed to sign Wolfsburg
              goal-machine Edin Dzeko, former Arsenal striker Emmanuel Adebayor and Sevilla hit-man Luis Fabiano.</p>
              <p>Rossi, an American-born Italian international, made just five
              league appearances for Manchester United before moving to Spain in 2007,
              where he has been a revelation in la Liga, bagging 23 goals in 57
              league outings.</p>
              <p>And the diminutive front-man also recently starred for the <em>Azzurri</em> at the Confederations Cup in South Africa, netting twice against the United States.</p>
              <p>His impressive form was believed to have interested Serie A duo
              Milan and Juventus, while both Manchester United and Manchester City
              were thought to be keen on bringing the forward back to English shores.</p>
              <p>Speculation that Rossi could be on his way out of Villarreal
              intensified over the weekend after the Yellow Submarine agreed to sign
              Internacional starlet Nilmar for a club record fee.</p>
              <p>And, according to<em> Radio 24 </em>and <em>Radio Radio, </em>Milan's official webpage announced the signing of the 22-year-old on Monday, only for the story to quickly vanish again.</p>
              <p>Whether the club's website was the victim of a mischievous hacker,
              or the story was published by an over-eager Milan employee remains to
              be seen.</p>

              <h1>Rossi set for Old Trafford return?</h1>
              <p><br> <img src="http://fourfourtwo.com/contentimages/news/Rossi9.jpg" alt="Rossi9" align="right"> </p>
              <p><strong>Former Manchester United striker Giuseppe Rossi could be set for
              a return to Old Trafford this summer, with Sir Alex Ferguson reportedly
              keen on re-signing the Villarreal goal-getter to bolster his forward
              line.</strong></p>
              <p>The 22-year-old American-born Italian international made just five
              league appearances for the Red Devils before moving to Spain in 2007,
              where he has been a revelation in la Liga, bagging 23 goals in 57
              league outings.</p>
              <p>And the diminutive front-man also recently starred for the <em>Azzurri</em> at the Confederations Cup in South Africa, netting twice against the United States.</p>
              <p>His impressive form is reportedly interesting Serie A big-hitters
              Juventus, who are believed to be weighing up a move for the striker.</p>
              <p>However, with the Premier League champions losing forward duo
              Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez's services this summer, Ferguson is
              thought to be mulling over a surprise move to bring Rossi back to
              English shores.</p>
              <p>Rossi is thought to have a clause in his Villarreal contract giving
              United first option on buying back the Italian for a fee in the region
              of £15 million.</p>
              <p>Lyon talisman Karim Benzema and Valencia marksman David Villa - who
              have also been linked with the Old Trafford outfit - are likely to cost
              double that amount.</p>
              <p>“He has a complicated situation," Rossi's agent Federico Pastorello told <em>Radio Kiss Kiss</em>.</p>
              <p>"But without a shadow of a doubt he is a player who, the moment an
              offer from a great club should come in, would certainly answer 'yes'.”</p>

              <p><strong>Neither Manchester United nor Manchester City have made a bid for Villarreal hot-shot Giuseppe Rossi, according to the player's agent.</strong></p>
              <p>The 22-year-old American-born Italian international made just five
              league appearances for the Red Devils before moving to Spain in 2007,
              where he has been a revelation in la Liga, bagging 23 goals in 57

              <p>And the diminutive front-man also recently starred for the <em>Azzurri</em> at the Confederations Cup in South Africa, netting twice against the United States.</p>
              <p>His impressive form reportedly interested Serie A big-hitters
              Juventus, while both Manchester United and City were believed to be interested in bringing the forward back to English shores</p>
              <p>And following reports that Mark Hughes' cash-rich Blues had made a
              €23 million offer for the striker's services, Rossi's agent, Federico
              Pastorello, moved to set the record straight.</p>
              <p>"Nobody has offered the going price and I am 99 percent certain the
              player will be with Villarreal next season," he told the Spanish press.</p>
              <p>"Rossi is happy in Villarreal and would only consider leaving for one of Europe's six big clubs."</p>
