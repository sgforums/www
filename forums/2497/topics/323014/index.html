I guess he can easily get a $5m sign on fee from his next club... or Inter will give him a one time bonus for signing a new contract with them...</p></div>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>HERNAN CRESPO cost Chelsea almost a £1million a game after finally ending his time at Stamford Bridge yesterday. The Argentine striker signed a £25m contract over five years after a £16.8m move from Inter Milan in 2003.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">But he was left on the sidelines for long periods by former manager Jose Mourinho. Crespo was eventually farmed out on loan to AC, helping them reach the 2005 Champions League final, where they lost to Liverpool in a penalty shootout.</p>
              <p class="article">He has spent the last two seasons on loan with AC’s arch-rivals Inter. He started only 33 Premier League matches in his five years with the Blues and scored 25 goals in all competitions.</p>
              <p class="article">That works out at almost a million a game, as the Italian clubs paid around £2m each season towards his wages, while each Chelsea goal cost around £1.3m. </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Meanwhile Claude Makelele is ready to quit the Blues after re-opening talks with French club Paris Saint-Germain. The 35-year-old midfielder was signed from Real Madrid in a £16.8m deal five years ago. He had been expected to stay at Stamford Bridge another season after he was offered a one-year extension to his current £70,000-a-week deal. But the Frenchman, who will become a free agent in 2009, wants a longer contract and PSG are prepared to offer him two years.</p>
              <p class="article">Makelele, who won the Champions League with Real, had discussions with PSG boss Paul Le Guen earlier this week and is now considering their offer. Le Guen said: “I have spoken again to the player to tell him that, like last year, we have the intention to make him come to Paris.”</p>
