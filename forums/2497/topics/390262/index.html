              <h3>DISGRACED England star John Terry has bought the silence of at least FOUR MORE secret lovers as he fights to keep the full truth of his sordid sex life under wraps. </h3>
              <p>Shameless Terry paid mistress Vanessa Perroncel £750,000 hush money then instructed advisors to approach a string of other girls he fears could wreck his career. </p>
              <p>"This has now all gone much deeper than an affair with a teammate's old girlfriend," said a source last night. "It is all about Terry doing everything and anything to save his skin and reputation." </p>
              <p>The Chelsea defender's desperate move took place in a week of BITTER ROWS, LIES and THREATS seething below the surface of a scandal that has seen him stripped of the England captaincy and made his furious wife flee to Dubai with their three-year-old twins. </p>
              <p>Today we expose how Terry battled to silence Vanessa, the former partner of his England team-mate Wayne Bridge. </p>
              <p>We also reveal how furious Manchester City star Bridge put the boot into Terry on the day of his sacking by telling England boss Fabio Capello he had "lost all respect" for his fellow World Cup defender. And we uncover a bitter battle between Vanessa and Bridge over money. </p>
              <p>All 29-year-old Terry's concentration last week was focused on trying to get the spilt milk back into the bottle after the court ban on the News of the World story about his affair was lifted. </p>
              <p>The 2009 Dad of the Year had a series of meetings with a team of advisors, lawyers and business associates as they thrashed out a plan to try to save the player's image and his lucrative sponsorship deals with firms like Umbro. We can reveal that top of his list was the gagging of a string of beauties he feared would line up to do a Tiger Woods on him.</p>

              <p><strong>"He does not want any ex-lovers coming out of the woodwork," a source told us last night. "His people are throwing the money around to stop them talking.</strong> </p>
              <p>"He is going to astonishing lengths and spending huge sums. But whatever he does he can't prevent the truth from coming out. It is all unravelling." </p>
              <p>Terry will be hoping the other lovers on his substitutes bench prove a lot cheaper to silence than lingerie model Vanessa, 33. </p>
              <p>He thought he had done the trick when his best mate Paul Nicholls, of Elite Management, and partner Keith Cousins got her to sign two confidentiality agreements for a nominal £1 with a final sum to be negotiated in a hotel meeting. </p>
              <p>But doubts over the validity of the documents were raised by High Court judge Sir Michael Tugendhat who lifted the ban on our story. Wily Vanessa than teamed up with PR to the stars Max Clifford - and the pound signs began rolling in her eyes. Our source revealed: "Clifford has been doing what he does best. All Vanessa had to do was sit tight and let the offers flood in. She was in a win-win situation.</p>
              <p>"And Terry knew he could always beat any newspaper's price for her story and his account would not been dented. </p>
              <p>"It became a matter of making sure the contract was absolutely watertight. There were a lot of frantic phone calls and meetings. Terry was mightily relieved when the deal was done." </p>
              <p>But after getting a fortune from Terry, Vanessa was still not satisfied - and has had a series of furious rows over MONEY with Bridge, 29, the father of her three-year-old son Jaydon. Reports that the two had an "emotional but amicable reunion" for the sake of their son were scotched by a pal of the Manchester City star last night. He told us they had a "blazing row" after Bridge blasted her for allowing Terry round while his son was in their house in Oxshott, Surrey. </p>
              <p>The pal said: "Vanessa has crossed the line and Wayne let her know what he felt about it. It was one thing learning about the affair but when he found out it took place in his home and the child was present, he was livid." </p>
              <p>Bridge screamed at French-born Vanessa: "I can't believe you had sex with him in our house with Jaydon there. I pay you enough a month, you could have got a hotel room!" The pal said Vanessa is demanding more money from Bridge to live on - and even wants cash to look after her HAIR and NAILS. </p>
              <p>Meanwhile Terry is said by a source to be at his "lowest ebb" after losing the England captaincy. His love rival Bridge told Capello: "I can play in the same team as him. I am not that childish but I don't want him as my captain because I have lost all respect for him. He was meant to be my mate." </p>
              <p>A pal of Bridge also revealed that a number of senior players had told Capello they no longer wanted Terry as captain. </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Three thousand miles away, his devastated wife Toni, 28, is deciding whether she still wants him as her husband, still reeling from the news that Vanessa had fallen pregnant and Terry paid for her abortion.</strong> </p>
              <p>A friend of the beauty said: "Toni is going to make him pay and make him sweat over their future." A source close to Terry said he has been speaking regularly to Toni in Dubai - but only in the last two days has it been less frosty. Toni had a furious showdown on Friday with her love rat hubby and was livid he has not issued a public apology to her about his behaviour. </p>
              <p>We can reveal Terry's own advisors begged him to say sorry to his family and fans, in the 14-word official statement he released on Friday after his sacking. But he made no apology. </p>
              <p>An insider said: "He just wants to cover this up so it goes away without him having to admit anything."</p>
