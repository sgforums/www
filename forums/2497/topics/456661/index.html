              <p><strong>Manchester United's new shirt sponsorship deal with American carmakers Chevrolet is worth an "incredible" £357million between now and 2021, according to reports - more than double what their current package brings in.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">When the seven-year deal was announced</span> earlier this week, it was reported it would see the Old Trafford side rake in around £28m per season.</p>
              <p>Now however, reports originating in the US, where United are in the process of selling 10% of the club on the New York Stock Exchange, suggest that those figures were a massive underestimate.</p>
              <p>While Chevrolet won't replace insurers Aon as United's shirt sponsors until the 2014-15 season, figures presented to the US Securities and Exchange Commission by the club are said to claim they will receive 'fees' of about $18.6m (around £11m at current exchange rates) from them in the coming season and the 2013-14 campaign.</p>
              <p>Then, in 2014-15, United will receive a whopping $70m (£44.75m) in return for carrying the Chevrolet logo on their shirts, with the amount paid rising by 2.1 per cent in each following season until 2020-2021.</p>
              <p>One marketing sector expert, who was reportedly involved in negotiating one of United's previous shirt sponsorship deals, with Vodafone, marvelled at the agreement with Chevrolet.</p>
              <p>"It's incredible, unbelievable," he said.</p>
              <p>In another story, a sponsorship consultant said United's Chevrolet agreement smashed the previous record set by Barcelona's $39.1m-a-year - £25m - deal with the Qatar Foundation.</p>
              <p>"The increase between Aon and Chevrolet I'd say is unprecedented," he admitted.</p>
              <p>As recently as 2006, that same story adds, Vodafone were paying £8m-a-year to have their logo on United's shirts - they were replaced by a £14m-a-year deal with financial-services firm AIG that ran until 2010, when Aon took over at £19.6m per season.</p>
