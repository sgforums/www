It was last seen with the Chelsea boss who was arrested in a row over the dog. The pet was going to be quarantined amid fears it had been brought back into the country without observing anti-rabies laws. Mourinho told police he had to make a phone call outside his Belgravia home last night, taking the dog with him. When he returned the terrier was nowhere to be seen. </strong><br><br>Mourinho told the police it had run off. He had been arguing with officers who had come to take it away. When Mourinho, 44, came back without the dog, police arrested him for obstructing them in their duty. He was taken to a west London police station where he was cautioned, fingerprinted and a sample of DNA taken to go on the national database.<br><br>One onlooker at the event in a marquee told the Sun: "JosÃ© had obviously got bad news. He bolted for the exit, sprinting to a line of taxis." Mourinho, who is preparing for SaturdayÂ’s FA Cup final against Manchester United, pushed past autograph hunters. When he arrived home he found an official from the animal health and welfare service escorted by two constables.<br><br>It is illegal to bring dogs into Britain without a rabies jab and a blood test to confirm it has worked six months before travelling, to protect the country from the disease. BritainÂ’s rabies law is currently under review and could be relaxed, bringing the country into line with other EU nations where animals are allowed to enter 21 days after testing.<br><br>Last month Mourinho had to hide in a laundry skip to be smuggled into Stamford Bridge to get round a Uefa ban after one of his outbursts got him into trouble. He left his house this morning and got into a waiting car without making a comment. His other dog, a German shepherd called Gullit, after the former Chelsea player and manager, is not thought to be a suspect.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Train Your Dog The Mourinho Way</strong><br><br>It is vital at all times to project an air of total superiority. This can also apply to dog ownership.<br><br>Firstly, exercise is of course very important. I take my dogs to the park in a group. I like best to hurl a ball a long way into the distance and try to bounce it off the head of my big, lumpy rottweiler. This to me is beauty: man and beast working together. I also train all of my dogs to roll over, that is most important for a champion.<br><br>Sometimes the dogs will bite children in the park, but then that is because the children provoke them because they are Mourinho's dogs.<br><br>They even claim to catch rabies just to get me in trouble.<br><br>Sometimes, even though I have 30 of the most expensive dogs money can buy, it seems to me that none of them are fit to come to the park with me. When this happens I cry, and think about perhaps getting one more from Battersea Dogs' Home. If only I had just one more, everything would be different, I know for sure.<br><br>It is unfair, but that is the world of dog training. It is biased against me.<br><br>Choosing and acquiring a dog is a complicated process. For instance, my terrier belonged to somebody else before I got him. I would go round to my neighbour's house each day and tempt the little fellow with food, new dog treats, a nice hairy bitch named Cheryl for him to get his thing on with. My neighbour did not like me doing this, but that is tough for him. Eventually the little terrier come and live with me. That is life, no?<br><br>It is his choice to come and to say I put him in a garbage sack is crazy.<br><br>But that is not to say that any dog will just fit into my pack. I was forced to introduce a Ukrainian Moneyhound into the group and the others did not accept him. The leaders of the pack are a tough English bulldog that does not like foreign dogs because they smell funny and a fat little English poodle.<br><br>My neighbour, who trains mainly Spanish Longballs, is causing me great annoyance of late. For instance, I have had to take my dogs for 27 walkies in the last week; he has only had to make them do a business four times.<br><br>I laugh, or I would cry.<br><br><a href="http://www.football365.com/story/0,17033,8751_2130687,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.football365.com/story/0,17033,8751_2130687,00.html</a></div>
