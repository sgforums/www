              <p>Karim Benzema's transfer saga took more turns today than it has done in the previous few weeks combined. First the Spanish press said that Real Madrid had had an offer accepted; then Lyon angrily denied this and said that while they'd received a high offer, it was not necessarily Madrid's; then the player's agent said it was, in fact, that of the Blancos; and then Lyon announced their acceptance of a 41m euro bid for the striker!<br><br>In other big-spending news from the Casa Blanca, Real Madrid have sealed the transfer of Cristiano Ronaldo meanwhile; the £80m has been paid, in full, to Manchester United and he is free to join Kaka at the Galacticos mk II. <br><br>At Barcelona, Keirrison's arrival is now imminent. The Brazilian forward will sign by July 13. He could be joined by Javier Mascherano and David Villa in the near future. It is understood that the Blaugrana have officially made an approach towards Liverpool for the Argentinian midfielder while the club have reportedly held talks with Valencia's Villa. <br><br>There is still confusion over the future of Samuel Eto'o though. The player's agent says that his client would be happy to do business with Manchester City, despite the offer of a new deal at Camp Nou. <br><br>The Sky Blues welcomed Roque Santa Cruz this afternoon and are set to unveil Carlos Tevez by Monday.
