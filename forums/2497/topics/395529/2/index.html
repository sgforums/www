              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez had Liverpool fans asking whether winning the Europa League was 
                      more important than finishing fourth in the Barclays Premier League as he 
                      substituted Fernando Torres 25 minutes from the end of the 1-1 draw at 
                      Birmingham City.</strong></p>
              <p>Liverpool were level at the time and the draw leaves them four points behind 
                      fourth-placed Manchester City, having played a game more.</p>
              <p>Benitez decided to take off 20-goal leading scorer Fernando Torres midway through the second half, even though the player looked disappointed with the decision to replace him with David N'Gog.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">Torres played up front on his own in Liverpool's 2-1 Europa League 
                      quarter-final first leg defeat by Benfica 72 hours earlier, and manager Benitez 
                      said: 'He was exhausted. He had some ice just to protect his knee, but he was 
                      really tired, like the other players who played on Thursday against Benfica.</div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><br></div>
              <div class="thinCenter">'He knew we needed to win, but he was really tired, like all the players, and 
                      N'Gog had fresh legs, as did Ryan Babel, and that made a big difference in the 
                      last few minutes.'</div>
              <p>Benitez admitted his side now have "no margin for error" if they are to have 
                      any hope of qualifying for the Champions League next season. 'It is not a good 
                      point, despite Birmingham playing so well here this season.  </p>
              <p>'We deserved to win. We had a very good chance in the first half and a lot in 
                      the second half.   </p>

              <p><strong>'We didn't have any margin for error beforehand and now we have less margin

              <p>'But it depends on the other teams and how they do as well. We have to 
                      believe we can win all our remaining games and have confidence the other sides 
                      will lose.  </p>
              <p>'We just have to keep going because there are still a lot of points to play 
                      for.  </p>
              <p>'But we said beforehand that we had to win the final six matches, or possibly 
                      draw one and win five. Now we have to win all remaining five

              <p>Maybe Rafa feels next season he might not be there anymore so even if Pool don't make it to the CL, it's not his problem... It's for the next guy to crack his head over...</p>
              <p>And if he manage to win the Europa cup (which i feel shouldn't be too much of a problem), Pool fans might remember him as a manager who won trophies... At least he will leave having won something to his name i guess... a Europa cup...</p>

              <p>i cant understand the logic. if he know torres is tired after benfica game. he should use him as a substitue towards the end especially when birmingham player are tired. more chances to score right? let ngog to the running until 65minutes and sent on torres to create  havoc ma. torres is those player that need one chance to make a difference.</p>
