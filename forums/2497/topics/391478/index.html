              <p><strong>Manchester City striker Emmanuel Adebayor has revealed he sent his parents a text message saying he was about to die in last month's terrorist attack on the Togo team bus at the African Nations Cup in Angola.</strong></p>
              <p>Togo pulled out of the tournament after a gun attack on the team bus left two people dead. And Adebayor revealed on Saturday: "I sent texts to my mum and dad saying 'I'm going to die'.</p>
              <p>"To explain what happened (on the coach) is difficult...you can't imagine the sound of the bullets. "I have one more chance to be alive - but what God has given to you he can take back.</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old admits his recent subdued goal celebrations with City are as a result of his changed outlook following the attack. Prior to the attack Adebayor had celebrated goals enthusiastically, notably on September 12 when he netted twice against former club Arsenal at Eastlands and was fined Â£25,000 and given a suspended two-match ban for his reaction.</p>
              <p>He continued on BBC1's Football Focus: "When I came back to Manchester City all the players were very nice to me - they gave me more confidence. But I have a different perspective on everything now. I'm happy to be alive.</p>
              <p>"When I scored a goal before the joy came into my body, it was an emotion. That's gone, I don't know why. I hope it comes back. "I haven't lost my motivation for scoring goals but when I hear the noise (of the crowd celebrating) it's not giving me anything inside my body at all."</p>
              <p>Togo were banned from taking part in the next two editions of the African Nations Cup and hit with a fine following their withdrawal from this year's tournament.</p>
              <p>They have appealed against to the Court of Arbitration for Sport against the decision, which has dismayed Adebayor.</p>
              <p>He added: "We went to play in the African Nations Cup and suffered a terrorist attack where two people died, our goalkeeper is still in hospital and we don't know if he can play again, some players have bullets in their body - and we got banned.</p>
              <p>"Every single night I try to understand what is going on - but I can't."</p>
