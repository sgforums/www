              <p>you can have your view, I cant, I see.</p>
              <p>you can say liverpool likely to finish 4th and I cant say Villa? liverpool has ever finished 5th and yet they are in the CL due to them being the CL holder in 2005 season. everton finished 4th that season for your info.</p>
              <p>so what you are saying is you are talking sense and I dun? I see. I am still backing Villa to finish 4th and I dunno how liverpool may finish. it could be well they finish 5th or even 6th.</p>

              <p>why not, it may well happen. its not cast in stone yet. all the teams are very close in points. liverpool still need to travel to united and host chelsea at home. if they lose both, their rivals will steal a march on them.</p>

              <p>haha. i was thinking more towards 'factual' facts like remaining fixtures, form and key players returning back. based on that(* and reasons cited from other forumers). i have crossed out tottemham and man city. hence leaving only aston villa and liverpool.</p>
              <p>technically speaking, aston villa shld get 4th.but judging from other factors, i think liverpool may edge past just by a tiny bit.</p>

              <p>it may happen or it may not. its still too early to call now isnt it. it will go down to the wire, on the last day of matches. whoever loses one match, all the teams mentioned will gain a march if they win their matches.</p>

              <p>Getting lesser games left... Spurs look to have the toughest fixtures... Playing the 'new' big four out of their last 10 matches... lol.</p>

              <p>true also luh.</p>
              <p>but situation as such will make villa a much more dangerous team in future, they will gain experience from all these tight fixtures.</p>
              <p>i think the talking point about this season is not who win the title, not who end up fourth, is rather which 2 other teams are going down with portsmouth</p>

              <p>City dropped points against a team they were not expected to... And now it gets tougher when they have to go away to Fulham who have been fantastic at home all season...</p>

              <p>Spurs will have a tricky one this weekend... Away to Stoke. Winning this could be very important as it will give them some cushion before they take on the big 3 in April along with their make-up match with City.</p>
