              <p>Arsenal match will be on 14th since Spurs will be playing Pompey on the 11th in the SF of the FA Cup.</p>
              <p>It is a tough fixtures coming April, but Spurs will have Defoe, Corluka and King back for the fight and possibly even Lennon as well as he was seen sitting on the bench with the team on Sat, perhaps the surprise that Redknapp wanted to unveil later.</p>
              <p>The long term injuries are Cudicini,Woodgate,Jenas &amp; Lennon? , so I believe Spurs will certainly give a good fight against Chelsea and Arsenal as they are at home, especially Spurs are in good form atm with 5 consecutive PL wins.</p>

              <p>Arsenal match will be on 14th since Spurs will be playing Pompey on the 11th in the SF of the FA Cup.</p>
              <p>It is a tough fixtures coming April, but Spurs will have Defoe, Corluka and King back for the fight and possibly even Lennon as well as he was seen sitting on the bench with the team on Sat, perhaps the surprise that Redknapp wanted to unveil later.</p>
              <p>The long term injuries are Cudicini,Woodgate,Jenas &amp; Lennon? , so I believe Spurs will certainly give a good fight against Chelsea and Arsenal as they are at home, especially Spurs are in good form atm with 5 consecutive PL wins.</p>

              <p>Fatigue, a bit perhaps but in the month of Feb, Spurs were playing mid week matches almost every week, but Spurs has a big squad with capable replacement, so it should not be a very big problem.</p>
              <p>Plus Palacios,BAE, Hudd, Defoe,Bentley,Pav, Gud,Kranjcar,Corluka,Kaboul etc all have been rested due to injuries or rotations during Feb or Mar, the only players that played non stop for the couple of months were Dawson,Bassong, Gomes, Modric &amp; Bale.</p>
              <p>Dawson &amp; Bassong could cover by King and Kaboul,Gomes should not be a problem unless injury, Modric is tough and Bale is young and could probably play like that for another month or so.</p>
              <p>Spurs atm are in form and have good strength in depth, none of the top 3 will be taking it easy especially away at WHL.</p>

              This thread is getting active for the wrong reason.
              
              Anyway back to something more relevant to the topic, i've got all my 7 predictions (win-lose-draw) last weekend spot on (see thread on BPL title prediction). Going with the trend, matches involving those tussling for 4th spot this weekend would look like this:
              
              1. Villa losing to Bolton at Reebok
              2. Spurs draw with Sunderland at Stadium of light
              3. Man City draw with burnley at turf moor
              4. Liverpool draw with birmingham at st andrews
              5. Everton beat west ham at goodison
