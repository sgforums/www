            <div class='col-md body'>Fluminense FC left-back Marcelo will become Real Madrid CF's sixth Brazilian player in January when he arrives at the Santiago BernabÃ©u in a reported Â€7m deal.<br><br>'Freshness'<br>Club president RamÃ³n CalderÃ³n said: "He is an important signing for us. He is a young player who will inject some freshness into the side and is part of our plan to bring younger players into the squad. We're very happy because he's a pearl that half of Europe wanted." The 18-year-old has signed on until 2012 and could spend the second half of the season in Madrid's youth team, second division Real Madrid Castilla, to aid his transition to European football.<br><br>International goal<br>Marcelo, who will be presented after a medical on Wednesday, is seen as a long-term replacement for Roberto Carlos, and has many similar characteristics in that he is very quick and likes to join the attack. "Roberto Carlos is very happy and Marcelo is coming to replace him - when he allows him to," added CalderÃ³n. The teenager scored on his international debut as Brazil defeated Wales 2-0 in early September.</div>

It will be very good to have him here (in Madrid). It is very difficult to maintain a high level when you play all the matches in a season."<br><br>Roberto Carlos is Madrids longest-serving overseas player and he has revealed that he is close to agreeing to extend his stay to a dozen years.<br><br>"Everything is arranged," he said. "Im very happy to conclude my European career at Real Madrid."<br><br>When he finally severs his ties with the nine-time European champions, the former Palmeiras man wants to finish his career back in his homeland.<br><br>He added: "I still think of playing in Brazil. I would like Santos to be the team as Im fan of them, but I still have two more years to decide."<br><br>After the World Cup in Germany, in which Brazil were eliminated at the quarter-finals, Roberto Carlos hung up his international boots and the Brazilian Football Confederation is rumoured to be organising a farewell game for him and fellow veteran defender Cafu.<br><br>"I havent thought about that really. If I am invited, Id accept with pleasure", he said.</div>
