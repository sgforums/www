              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Arsene Wenger is fuming after rumours that Inter Milan tried to tap up Alexander Hleb before Arsenal's match with AC Milan. </span> </p>
              <p><strong>Arsène Wenger is considering reporting Internazionale to Uefa for tapping up Alexander Hleb. The Arsenal midfielder left the team's hotel the night before the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Milan two weeks ago with the agent Claudio Vigorelli and is believed to have travelled to Inter's offices on Via Durini.</strong></p>
              <p>Vigorelli is an associate of Vincenzo Morabito, a leading international agent who has dealt frequently with Premier League clubs and is a director of the leading English agency First Artist. Yesterday Morabito denied there had been a meeting with Inter but conceded that Vigorelli and Hleb had shared a taxi from the Melia Felix hotel, where Arsenal were staying, and that Wenger had made a complaint.</p>
              <p>"It's true that Hleb saw Vigorelli and they went out from the Melia Felix but it's not true that they went to talk to Inter Milan," said Morabito. "They went for an ice-cream. We are sorry that Mr Wenger took it badly and complained because we have a good relationship with him."</p>
              <p>Hleb joined Arsenal from Stuttgart for £11.2m in 2005 and is under contract until 2010. There have been no talks about an extension as he approaches the final two years of his deal.</p>
              <p>The 26-year-old Belarusian sparked claims that he wanted to leave Arsenal in February 2006 when he was seen dining with Hamburg's chief scout, Michael Schröder, at a London restaurant. Wenger dismissed the rumours, pointing out that Hleb and Schröder had a friendship through Hleb's younger brother, Vyacheslav, who used to play for Hamburg. But Arsenal's manager has not taken the Inter link so lightly. The Italian club have been tracking Hleb for some weeks and, despite his form slipping of late, they are expected to approach Arsenal with an offer in the summer. Barcelona have also been reported as an interested party.</p>
              <p>Wenger might like to rest Hleb but his midfield options have been restricted by Tomas Rosicky's continued absence. The Czech international last played against Newcastle United in the FA Cup on January 26 and his hamstring injury is not responding to treatment as had been hoped. "It is pretty irksome. I still cannot start full training," he said. "There is nothing I can do but wait and hope that the injury goes away."</p>

              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Wenger: anger over 'tapping up'</span></p>
              <p><strong>Arsenal have a reputation for giving short shrift to clubs who try to unsettle their players. In 2005, the club complained to the Premier League about their bitter rivals Chelsea's “tapping up” of England defender Ashley Cole, while Wenger has frequently had to fend off interest from Barcelona and Real Madrid for his star midfielder Cesc Fabregas.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the past, former captains Vieira and Thierry Henry were also the frequent targets of approaches from some of the continent's biggest sides.</p>

              <p>Ice cream? Hurr...but anyhoo,</p>
              <p>Aleks released a statement today denying meeting with Inter.
              <br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Friends, 
              <br> <br> It is true that I went out for a drive before the Milan game.....Just
              for an ice cream at Inters offices. I saw a fantastic parking spot
              across the road, but whilst I mulled it over- some bastard on a Vespa
              nipped in. Amazingly another space appeared this time right in front-
              as I waited and waited, just to be sure nothing was coming, this nun in
              a Fiat bambino chugged into the spot. <br> Well I drove around for the next few hours trying to find another
              another place, but everyone had gone home by that stage and I never met
              with anyone.</span></p>

              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold">Internazionale have
                  moved to deny reports that they made an illegal approach for Alexander
                  Hleb and insist they have received no complaint from Arsenal.</p>
              <p> Reports earlier this week claimed Arsenal were considering
                  reporting Inter to Uefa for an alleged illegal approach for Belarus
                  international Hleb.</p>
              <p> The alleged incident is reported to have occurred prior to
                  Arsenal's UEFA Champions League clash with Milan at San Siro a
                  fortnight ago.</p>
              <p> It was suggested Hleb left Arsenal's team hotel with his agent
                  to hold secret talks with Inter officials over a possible move to the
                  Nerazzurri.</p>
              <p> However, Inter have officially rejected the claims, issusing a
                  statement to declare they had no meeting with Hleb and that they had
                  received no complaint from Arsenal.</p>
              <p> The statement read: "With regard to yesterday's report in La
                  Stampa newspaper and today's articles in the British press, carried
                  also by Italian news agencies, F.C. Internazionale denies having met
                  with the player Alexander Hleb, and has received no letter of complaint
                  from Arsenal."</p>
