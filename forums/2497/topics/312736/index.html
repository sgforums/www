              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Chelsea have accused the football authorities of
              handing their rivals an advantage after their game with Everton was
              brought forward two days.</span></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Chelsea issued a statement on their official
              website insisting the decision, taken for television purposes,
              undermines the integrity of the competition.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's statement read: "Chelsea is extremely disappointed with the announcement today regarding the Everton fixture.</p>
              <p>"We believe the decision to hold the match on Thursday April 17
              undermines the sporting integrity of the competition by giving our
              rivals for the Premier League title an unnecessary competitive
              advantage at a critical time of the season, with more recovery time
              from their previous match and preparation time for their next fixture
              when we have to play two games during the same period.</p>
              <p>"Secondly there has been no consideration given to our fans who will be presented with serious travel, work and other issues.</p>
              <p>"And lastly, the decision sets a dangerous precedent in changing
              match days still further when fixture congestion does not exist and
              when a sensible solution regarding other television matches that
              weekend was suggested.</p>
              <p>"Football has benefited greatly from the backing of television
              and Chelsea as much as anyone else. However this decision is one step
              too far and we reserve all rights on our position.''</p>

              <h1>Fans get stuck into free Toffees tickets</h1>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Chelsea are giving their supporters free tickets
              for this month's rescheduled Premier League match against Everton at
              Goodison Park.</span></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The Blues are unhappy at being asked to play
              two league games in the space of 72 hours after their trip to Goodison
              Park was rescheduled for television.</p>
              <p>The club insist the change, which sees the game put back two
              days to Thursday April 17, "undermines the sporting integrity of the
              competition", as it comes three days after they host Wigan.</p>
              <p>Chelsea will use the TV money gained from the game to pay for tickets and travel for their supporters.</p>
              <p>"We've continued to make very strong representations for the
              date of the Everton away game to be changed," Chelsea said in a
              statement. "This now seems unlikely.</p>
              <p>"Under these circumstances, Chelsea believes it would be
              inappropriate to profit from the television fee for this match as per
              normal."</p>
              <p>Chelsea have been allocated 2,900 seats for the game and will offer refunds to fans who have already bought tickets.</p>
              <p>They also plan to pay for train or bus tickets to get supporters to and from the game.</p>
              <p>Everton have previously described the fixture change as an "uncomfortable precedent".</p>
              <p>At the time of the switch, the Premier League defended the move,
              saying: "The compilation of the fixture list is a complex procedure.</p>
              <p>"It faces enormous pressure from international match and
              European competition dates, as well as the need to balance the
              important requirements of the police and our broadcasters.</p>
              <p>"We are also required by the European Commission to televise 138 matches per season, which brings its own inevitable pressures."</p>
