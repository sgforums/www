            <div class='col-md body'>WILLIAM GALLAS has reopened old wounds with his former club Chelsea by insisting: Â“They hurt meÂ”.<br><br>The France ace is scarred and still angered by the way Blues tried to make his name dirt earlier this season. His reputation with Stamford Bridge fans was destroyed for ever when Chelsea claimed that Gallas threatened to score an OWN GOAL if he was not allowed to join Arsenal.<br><br>But Gallas, 29, insisted: Â“I do not see myself as a rebel but as someone who is fair and has principles. Â“It was really hard to listen to certain things that they said about me just to hurt me Â— like the story that I would score an own goal if I played for Chelsea again.<br><br>Â“I went through some really bad days. If I donÂ’t hurt anybody why do they have to hurt me? ThatÂ’s how I am, itÂ’s not a question of being a rebel. Â“From the moment IÂ’m shown respect, I give respect. If they donÂ’t do that, then I wonÂ’t do it either. To the good, IÂ’m good. But to the bad, IÂ’m bad as well.Â”<br><br>Gallas took a pounding from his former bosses after deciding he wanted out as he could no longer accept being played as a left-back by Chelsea chief Jose Mourinho.<br><br>But the ugliness continued with Chelsea claiming on their official website that Gallas had threatened to miss crucial games as well as the own goal accusation.<br><br>Now Gallas insists the pain and suffering of his acrimonious departure was deliberately caused by Chelsea despite Mourinho previously hailing him as one of the best defenders in the world.<br><br>In an interview with a Spanish magazine, Gallas added: Â“This shows that there was, and is, a problem at Chelsea. Â“To find out exactly what we are dealing with we would have to ask the coach and chief executive Peter Kenyon.<br><br>Â“ThatÂ’s football. Sadly, people know full well who I am and my way of being. Â“Only those who have no idea about me can end up thinking that IÂ’m capable of doing something like that, scoring an own goal.<br><br>Mourinho admitted this week that Chelsea miss GallasÂ’ qualities, Â— but the player has found happiness under Arsene Wenger.<br><br>He said: Â“Since IÂ’ve trained with him and my new team-mates I understand perfectly how and why Wenger wants this style of play.<br><br>Â“We move the ball at incredible speed, using only one or two touches. I love this style and I havenÂ’t seen it at any other club in England.Â”<br><br></div>
