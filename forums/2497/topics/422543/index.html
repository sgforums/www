              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">FERNANDO TORRES was rapped last night by former team-mate Daniel Agger for being disloyal to Liverpool.</h2>
              <p>The Kop's Danish star, who elbowed Torres at the weekend on his Chelsea debut, insisted: "It is unacceptable to play for one of Liverpool's arch-rivals.</p>
              <p>"For a Dane, it's about having respect for the club you play at.</p>
              <p>"I am proud to be able to pull on my Liverpool jersey and will never go to another club in England.</p>
              <p>"I will never go to Manchester United or Everton. It's about respect for the club."</p>
              <p>The comments from Denmark centre-half Agger will delight Liverpool fans still stunned at Spaniard Torres' departure.</p>
              <p>After Agger's elbow caught Torres, the Dane said: "Football is a contact sport."</p>

              <p>yea. but not to utd or chelsea or everton.</p>
              <p>leaving is one thing. leaving for ur club's arch rivals is another. thats why u dun see it happen often.</p>
              <p>he could go to man city if they are willing to offer like huge amount of money, but i feel as a player u shuldnt go declare ur "love" for a club then after a couple of years sign for one of their arch rivals. you can sign for another english club or other clubs but if u sign for ur arch-rivals like i said, dun expect ur ex-fans to forgive u.</p>

              <p>Well, for Torres, the  field was actually quite narrow... Cos if Real and Barce didn't come in for him, where does he go from Liverpool? Who can afford him? pay him better and also offer CL football?</p>
              <p>I recalled he once criticized Owen for joining United and said he would never do something like that to Pool... But I guess times change and people change as well...</p>
              <p>This is probably one of the most unexpected deals in recent times cos I think it took many by surprise. The window was open for like 28 days and not one news about it. Then suddenly... it just happen so fast... Personally I didn't expected it either cos there was no serious rumour or gossip going around recently... Most expected he could move in June or something... But not in the last 3, 4 days of this window.</p>
              <p>But at least the guy is trying to be nice to Pool fans now and trying to explain his side to them...</p>

              <p>My take on this is Torres is tired of seeing how successful his international team mates are, especially the Barca lot. And since Barca had splash the cash on Villa and letting Ibrahimovic leave, I doubt they can fit another Torres.</p>
              <p>Same goes for Real Madrid, who has spent 80m last term on Ronaldo, 50m on Kaka, and some spare change for Benzema and co, roughly 30-40m for Khedija and Ozil this term, I doubt they can cough out more for Torres.</p>
              <p>Which leaves Torres with the only other 2 options: Man City or Chelsea. Man City cannot afford another striker, with Tevez, Dzeko, Balotelli, Jo, Adebayor, Bellamy, Santa Cruz and Caiceido. Therefore, Chelsea seems to be the wisest choice if he leaves Anfield - both the strikers Anelka and Drogba are getting old and Sturridge is inexperienced. He'll be certain of a starting spot.</p>

              <p>You lick your boss' ass by showing how committed you are with the company and bla bla shit. but one fine day you throw your resignation letter and gave him 4 days notice! Is that right?</p>
              <p>Most Liverpool fans have had this coming in the summer but not at this kind of circumstances. And Liverpool was right to sell Torres and got doubled the amount paid for him 3 yrs+ back... I have said last year that Liverpool need to sell Torres if he not want to be there, so good riddance.</p>
