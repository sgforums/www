              <p>Deco says Chelsea boss Luiz Felipe Scolari is struggling to win over fans because of Jose Mourinho's shadow across the club.</p>
              <p>He said: "At Chelsea, the fans still have in their minds the Mourinho era but it is not always easy to repeat these things.</p>
              <p>"That is the great problem for Scolari - people compare him to Mourinho
              and he has just arrived to a new country and a new and very competitive
              league."</p>
              <p>Deco has played under both managers but insisted it was time to get behind Scolari once and for all.</p>
              <p>"I have worked with them both and they are very different," he said.</p>
              <p>"They are both excellent coaches but Scolari needs time before people judge him."</p>

              <p>The problem lies with the composition of the squad. This squad now is pretty much the same as last season squad. Yet, the football that Scolari plays is very much different from that of Mourinho and Grant. Scolari doesnt have the players to play the system that he truly desires.</p>
              <p>Comparing Chelsea's squad to that of the others in the Big Four, Chelsea by far has the weakest squad. Weakest not as in the strength of the first eleven but by the composition of the squad. Whether there are enough youth to blend with the experience in the team and whether there are adequate replacements for the various positions. The average age of Chelsea's squad is rather high and the most of the first teamers are either on the wrong side of 30 or approaching 30. To make matters fist, there isnt any quality youth that is really upcoming in the Blues camp.</p>
              <p>The future is bleak for Chelsea unless Roman is willing to open up his wallet again.</p>

              <p>I belief there are a few problems that Chelsea are having this season... One is the training style is not good enough and Scolari seem to favour a more relax kind of way... Lampard and Terry have openly come out to questioned his relax style in training and feel that they are not doing enough. I also think we can see that the current Chelsea players are not as fit as say just 9 months ago... So to say their age is the main factor, I don't think so cos all their defenders are in their prime... Bosingwa 26, Terry 28, Carvalho 30 , A Cole 28... Even Alex is only 26... Cech also 20+ only. </p>
              <p>Another thing could be Scolari inexperience in the Premiership cos Chelsea started the season rather well without too much problems... They were even leading the table with Pool. The Dec / Jan period was probably the difficult part Scolari isn't aware of... There are lots of matches to be played this period and playing his first team for the Carling and FA cup is rather silly... Top players need their rest or they won't be able to perform at the highest level week in, week out...</p>
              <p>I honestly belief the problem is Scolari and not the players... Scolari don't know how to handle them, just like Drogba who also played well for Grant but he don't seem to be interested to play for Scolari... Maybe its because Scolari don't show enough concern for him...</p>
              <p>Change Scolari and Chelsea will be back again...</p>

              <p><br>Lampard won't go lah... He just got his 5 yrs contract worth $150k a week where he want to go? We can already imagine 2 yrs down the road when Lampard is no longer as good as he was, he would be sitting on the bench watching the match and getting paid $150k for doing nothing much till he is 35 yrs old...</p>
              <p>It was silly of Chelsea to give him that contract... 5 yrs is too long already. He won't even need to fight for a new contract every year or two so where is the fire to play well going to come from? His confirm pay packet?</p>
              <p>Really, there is nothing stopping him to becoming a Fat Frank...</p>
