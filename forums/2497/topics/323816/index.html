              <p>Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo has backed FIFA president Sepp
              Blatter's condemnation of 'modern slavery' in the modern game.</p>
              <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="300" align="right">
              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td><br></td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>
              </table>
              <p>When asked about Ronaldo's long-mooted prospective transfer to Real Madrid,
              Blatter yesterday suggested that there was a trend towards treating players like
              slaves in the transfer process.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>His comments have been met with criticism in some areas, with Professional
              Footballers' Association chairman Chris Powell calling for him to retract the
              comments while UEFA president Michel Platini reacted by highlighting the
              spiralling wage demands of players.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But Ronaldo, who is currently recovering from ankle surgery after taking part
              for Portugal in Euro 2008, has failed to commit himself to United and has given
              mixed messages about Real's obvious interest.
              He has now supported Blatter's stand, but refused to shed any more light on the
              proposed transfer.<strong> 'I agree with the comments of the president of FIFA. What he said is right,'</strong> he told Portuguese channel TVI.
              'At the moment there is no agreement with Real Madrid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We have to wait for the
              next few days to see, but I do not know where I will begin next season.
              'This is all I have to say at the moment.'
              Regarding his injury, the winger confirmed he would be out for as long as three
              months but remained upbeat about his rehabilitation.
              'I'm very well. I'm optimistic. My recovery is going well. Everything is
              fine.'</p>

              <p><strong>Slave Players ?</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>RONALDO was last night branded a mercenary. The Manchester United star faced a torrent of condemnation for his latest outrageous outburst — claiming he has been treated like a slave.</strong> </p>
              <p class="article">The soccer world also united against FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who sparked the ‘slave’ scandal and claimed United should let Ronaldo have his dream move to Real Madrid. </p>
              <p class="article">Premier League chairmen have called for Blatter to resign, labelling his comments as insulting, drivel and complete nonsense. And one former England star insisted Blatter had insulted black players across the globe, raging: “Slaves were hung, drawn and quartered rather than paid millions of pounds to play football.” </p>
              <p class="article">But it was United winger Ronaldo, 23, one of the world’s richest and most famous sportsmen, who ignited the furious backlash.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Birmingham City chief executive <strong>KARREN BRADY</strong> was incensed by his comments. She said: “Slaves? That’s not a word I’d use. I think I’d use mercenaries. “We are talking about players earning six figures a week who want to ignore contracts. If this is allowed to happen there will be anarchy. “What he’s said is unbelievable. With all the FIFA regulations it is becoming harder and harder for clubs to retain their assets. “A player signs a contract and he should understand that he can’t just relieve himself of the contract when something else comes along.” Ronaldo’s comments were triggered by Blatter’s astonishing claims that players were being treated like slaves and should be free to leave whenever they like.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Wigan chairman <strong>DAVE WHELAN</strong> immediately called for the FIFA chief to step down. Whelan said: “The man is a complete idiot. You’ve got to ask whether Blatter is fit for purpose after what he’s said. The answer over the years is that he clearly isn’t. To even indicate that players are treated like modern-day slaves is outrageous. How stupid can that man be?”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Birmingham chairman <strong>DAVID GOLD</strong> said: “I can’t think of anyone who has stayed in such a similar position of power for so long, who has come out with such drivel. “It’s arrogant nonsense and complete and utter rubbish. “If he was comparing lower league players with slaves — those who are not earning big money — maybe you could see where he was coming from. “But to use the word in the same breath as Ronaldo, on £120,000 a week, is looking at one side of the coin.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"><strong>MILAN MANDARIC</strong>, the former Portsmouth owner, now at Leicester, said: “Blatter has said some daft things over the years, but this has to be the most disgusting thing he’s ever come out with. It is obscene. “Footballers these days being modern-day slaves? Well, don’t you just feel so sorry for these poor little rich souls, earning massive money for doing something they love.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Former Watford, AC Milan and England striker <strong>LUTHER BLISSETT </strong>blasted: “Does he not realise how much offence he is causing by throwing in a word like ‘slavery’ in the context of footballers earning millions of pounds a year? It’s totally outrageous. “He obviously does not understand the significance of the term. It’s insulting to all the people who have been real slaves through the ages. The guys who would get hung, drawn and quartered or beaten for being slaves rather than paid millions. “The man doesn’t think before he opens his mouth and I’m sure every black player who heard his words will be wondering what planet he’s living on. It’s just a completely inappropriate comparison to make.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"><strong>JOHN BARNWELL</strong>, chief executive of the League Managers Association, said: “For someone of Mr Blatter’s standing to come out and say that is a bit mind-boggling. It shows he is out of touch with the professional game. "The transfer system is written by Mr Blatter’s own organisation and a comparison to players on £120,000 a week to a modern-day slave is a very poor choice of words.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"><strong>RICHARD BEVAN</strong>, chief of the League Managers’ Association, said: “What Blatter has said about Ronaldo and United is ridiculous. “For someone at FIFA to say such a thing is embarrassing. It is so ill-considered. “All this proves yet again is that Blatter is so out of touch with professional football.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">PFA chief executive <strong>GORDON TAYLOR</strong> said: “Sepp Blatter’s comments are slightly bizarre. “He and FIFA should be doing more to stop Real Madrid clearly destabilising a contracted player. “Contracts need to be honoured by players unless there is mutuality with the club.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">And former Charlton defender <strong>CHRIS POWELL</strong>, another PFA official, said: “I really hope Sepp will retract what he has said. “There are plenty who go and watch, spending their hard-earned money every week, who will not be happy with Blatter saying Ronaldo is being treated like a slave. He is far from it.” Even UEFA distanced themselves from Blatter and his comments.</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">UEFA slam Blatter</span></p>
              <p>Communications director William Gaillard, who also serves as special advisor to UEFA president Michel Platini, gave a different point of view and claimed salaries are 'spiralling out of control'.  'It would be useful to remind people that slaves in all of the slavery systems never earned a wage,' Gaillard said. The Bosman ruling came into effect in 1995, allowing players free transfers at the end of contracts, and those coming to the conclusion of their deals have become prey for other clubs. 'It seems that both clubs and players are trying to negotiate an exit before the player is free,' Gaillard added. 'It is a consequence of the Bosman ruling - there is nothing we can do about that. 'It is obvious that today players have a lot more power than they did 20 years ago, undoubtedly, and agents have a lot more power than they did 20 years ago. It is true that salaries are spiralling out of control. Many clubs have pointed that out.'</p>

              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"><img class="smallArticleImage" src="http://images.dailyexpress.co.uk/img/dynamic/67/285x214/51978_1.jpg" alt="Story Image" width="285" height="214"></p>

              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"><strong>FIFA president Sepp Blatter’s latest controversial outburst, Ronaldo has further widened the rift between himself and Sir Alex Ferguson.</strong></p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">The Portugal star has also passed up yet another chance to clarify his future. Despite revealing his ankle injury will keep him out until October, he refused to rule out a move to Real Madrid before the August 31 transfer deadline.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Blatter had waded into the transfer tug-of-war between United and Real by urging the Premier League champions to grant his dream move and sell him to Spain.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">He then described the trend for clubs to keep players against their will as like “modern slavery,” a remark that earned him all-round condemnation from some of football’s most influential figures.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">United contemptuously dismissed Blatter’s latest comments as the muddled thinking of a publicity-seeking clown who is out of touch with his sport.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Significantly, Blatter has been exposed not only as a ‘member’ of Real – allowing him a vote in the club elections – but also a personal friend of current president Ramon Calderon.</p>

              <p>`modern slavery'? stop kidding la....with that kind of money
              they got, is slavery an even close association? so ronaldo
              deserves our sympathy becos he can't go to where he wants?</p>
              <p>if he really wants to go, it's easy. sign a pre-contract
              with RM, then in the coming season, miss a few sitters and suddenly
              go off-form. Man u will sell him on the cheap and everybody
              wins. </p>

              <p>Ronaldo is a smart as... Seems like he knows how to play politics rather well... He said he agree with Sepp Blatter's comment of 'modern slavery' in the modern game and yet he never mention he is a slave himself at United... This will leave him some room to change his words again should he have no choice and made to stay...</p>
              <p>But I feel its better to sell now than in another year or two time cos we never know if his value will continue to stay at a record breaking price... $60m is a lot for a player... It can help bring in about 3 more good players...</p>
