              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> Birmingham City boss Alex McLeish was on cloud nine after his side defeated a lacklustre Everton 2-1 in the FA Cup.<br><br>First half goals from Christian Benitez and Barry Ferguson were enough to overcome David Moyes' Everton and advance to the fifth round of the FA Cup. <br><br>McLeish hailed his side's match-winning performance and their 'incredible' 15-game unbeaten run.<br><br>"I'm extremely proud with this group of players and what they've achieved," McLeish told Birmingham's official website.<br><br>"I
                  think it's fair to use adjectives such as incredible when you describe
                  a 15-match unbeaten run in this day and age and at this level of
                  football."<br><br>"The lads were magnificent once again today against a
                  very good Everton side, and as well as showing that we are hard to beat
                  once again proved we are capable of playing some excellent football."
              </span></p><p>"The goals epitomise that quality - the second one in particular
                  must be a contender for goal of the month because it was an excellent
                  move and finish."</p>
              <p>McLeish is already looking ahead, and is hoping for a home draw is the next round of the cup.</p>
              <p>"The FA Cup hasn't been overly kind to me since I arrived, but then
                  again neither has the draw really - being pitted against Everton at
                  Goodison was never going to be easy.</p>
              <p>"There's nothing better for a club and its fans than a good cup run,
                  so hopefully our name will come out of the hat first and we'll get a
                  decent fifth round draw."</p>
              <p>McLeish also praised 18-year old Jake Jervis who came on as a substitute.</p>
              <p>"Jake showed up well in training with the first team this week and deserved his chance.</p>
              <p>"He's a tall frontman and we knew he'd be able to cause their centre-halves a few problems and that's exactly what he did."</p>
              <p>"The pace of the game meant he was absolutely knackered after about
                  ten minutes but it's a great step up for him and he's a player who we
                  believe he's got a chance in the game.</p>
              <p>"I'm sure that the Academy will be very proud of him tonight."</p>
