              <h1>Villa boss O'Neill says Liverpool manager Benitez's comments are 'absolutely crazy' as row escalates</h1>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/10_03/oneillG1810_468x430.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Martin O'Neill last night launched a stinging attack on Rafael Benítez, accusing the Liverpool manager of being "disingenuous" and "not respecting anything" after the Spaniard intimated that talks about Gareth Barry's future were continuing.</strong></p>
              <p>Having reacted with disbelief when he learned that Liverpool's £10m offer for Barry had been leaked on Merseyside last week, O'Neill was furious yesterday when he read that Benítez had told reporters that the Villa manager "knew my idea".</p>
              <p>O'Neill said he had never given Benítez any encouragement regarding Barry and revealed: "It's a long time since I've been this angry." His resolve to keep the England international is likely to have been strengthened by the simmering row.</p>
              <p>"Rafa Benítez is quoted as saying he knew my idea and I knew his," O'Neill said. "The only idea I had was to get him off the phone and to say no. He spoke to me about Gareth Barry and I told him I was not interested in selling but I would put it to my owner [Randy Lerner] who deserved to be told about these things.</p>
              <p>"But I said to him I would assume Randy's viewpoint would be concurring with my own. That was the case. The next time I spoke to Rafa was last Friday when he rang me to ask if I'd seen his offer. I told him I had seen it. It was only after I put the phone down that I realised the story had broken in the Liverpool Echo. He was on the phone to cover his backside. I phoned him back immediately to say I was amazed to find out the story had appeared.</p>
              <p>"All this about a prolonged conversation is simply untrue. It's disingenuous of him and he knows that. Rafa said something about wanting to respect our viewpoint by waiting until the end of the season. In my view Rafa does not respect anything."</p>

              <p><strong>LETO PASSPORT FARCE</strong></p>
              <p><strong>LIVERPOOL'S Sebastian Leto may see his Kop career cut short by a passport fiasco.</strong></p>
              <p>Leto, 21, has not played for the club since December as Italian cops are probing the validity of thousands of citizenship decisions.</p>
              <p>The Argentinian, who has an Italian grandparent, has been caught up in the mess and Liverpool are not prepared to risk playing him until the probe is concluded.</p>

              <h2>BENITEZ TELLS O`NEILL TO GET OVER IT</h2>
              <div><span id="intelliTXT"><img src="http://clientimages.teamtalk.com/08/05/240/Rafael_Benitez_claps_fans_lap_of_honour_844853.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180"></span></div>

              <div></div>
              <div><span><strong>Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez on Monday suggested Martin O'Neill should come to terms with the prospect of losing captain Gareth Barry. Aston Villa manager O'Neill insisted he and American owner Randy Lerner will make a last-ditch attempt to keep Barry - a £10million target for the Reds - at the club. But Benitez said in the Liverpool Echo: "If your captain wants to leave, it's a problem, but that's football." </strong><strong>The Spaniard's latest comments are bound to further anger O'Neill, who was furious last week at the manner of Liverpool's approach for the England midfielder.</strong> </span></div>
              <div><span></span></div>
              <div id="articlebody">
              <p>The Villa boss attacked Benitez when he was told the Spaniard had claimed to have had "prolonged discussions" with him about Barry, even though Benitez had never been quoted as saying that. Liverpool's manager has staunchly defended his actions, saying: "I think the right approach when you want to sign a player is to talk to the manager.</p>
              <p>"I was talking to Martin O'Neill. I said we would like to sign Gareth Barry and asked what the situation was. "He just said he needed to talk to the owner and I said okay. He will not have any problems with his supporters because he never said to me he wanted to sell Barry.</p>
              <p>"We were also talking about (Liverpool goalkeeper) Scott Carson because they have the option to sign him. "We were just talking about football so why he was so angry, I do not know. "I have been very clear. The player had said before that he wanted to play Champions League football. We knew that and so tried to sign a good player. It is that simple.</p>
              <p>"If your captain wants to leave, it is a problem, but that's football." O'Neill and Lerner will make one last bid to keep hold of Barry in the next 48 hours. O'Neill said: "I wouldn't want to be saying how confident we are (of keeping Barry). It's a different era we live in. We will see.</p>
              <p>"All I know is he has never expressed one iota of unhappiness in my time at Villa Park. He might not have stayed that long had he been really unhappy before. "We are going to be sitting down very shortly and discussing Gareth's future. We won't let this lie.</p>
              <p>"I am going to see the chairman in the next couple of days and, with a bit of luck, the two of us together might be able to persuade him to stay. "I say persuade him - but he still has two years left on his contract."</p>
              <p>Barry admitted he had been affected by all the speculation over his future but was outstanding Sunday's 2-2 draw at West Ham which secured an Intertoto Cup spot for Villa. O'Neill said: "Gareth might have been affected by the speculation last week but I thought he was back to his best at against West Ham.</p>
              <p>"He did splendidly for us. You would not have thought he had anything else other than a win on his mind." O'Neill also criticised Benitez, suggesting Liverpool had leaked their initial bid for the player to the media. But Benitez said: "We made an offer but I think we were straight. When you make an official offer, you do so by fax. Some people see the fax and you cannot control everything.</p>
              <p>"The Birmingham press found out about the offer and it was not our fault. They were very clever and used that information. "I was talking with Martin O'Neill 20 days before that and nobody knew. We were doing things properly. We are waiting now to see what happens next."</p>
