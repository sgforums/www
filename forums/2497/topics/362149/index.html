              <h2>Eastlands bosses believe they have clinched deal</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div>
              <h3>MANCHESTER CITY believe they have won a £42million race for Carlos Tevez and Gareth Barry.</h3>
              <p>The richest club in the world are ready to rubber-stamp a £32m deal to steal Tevez away from city rivals United. And they will offer £10m-rated Barry £90,000 a week to see off Liverpool, Arsenal and Spurs.</p>
              <p>The move for Argentinian striker Tevez, 25, also blows Liverpool and Chelsea out of the chase with City happy to meet Kia Joorabchian's £32m asking price.</p>
              <p>Liverpool's bid for the former West Ham forward was the lowest offer received. Boss Mark Hughes will also pay Tevez nearly £140,000 a week in a four-year deal. </p>
              <p>Joorabchian will have one final meeting with Old Trafford chiefs this week to find out whether Sir Alex Ferguson sees Tevez as anything more than a bit-part player. </p>
              <p>Those assurances are unlikely - leaving the way clear for City. Hughes is in the Middle East to talk about transfer targets with City's Abu Dhabi owners and has made it clear he sees Tevez as vital to the club. </p>
              <p>City are much further down the road with Tevez than Barry. But they are confident their financial clout will get them the Aston Villa captain. </p>
              <p>Liverpool felt they were in pole position after their abortive attempt to land Barry, 28, last summer. But the Reds are unable to match the Arabs' vast wealth. Barry could yet decide he values Champions League football over money but Eastlands officials are confident of getting their man.</p>

              <p>Staying at Villa , u got 70,000pound per week.  Staying at Man City, u got 120,000pound per week. Big different wo.</p>

              <p>And Villa can't offer CL football too.   Liverpool are broke. So they can't even get a nod from Villa to meet Barry.</p>

              <p>If given a choice what would all of you choose money or trophies? Tough call??... i dont think so..</p>
              <p>Simply for me i would choose the cash... knn 120000 pounds per week.. after tax still left with 60000pounds per week. Convert to sing dollars its about 170000 dollars per week. one month how much liao more than half a million. na bei like that will be rich damn fast.</p>
              <p>Who cares about trophy... you may be Champions league trophy holder but you go less money, leave in a smaller house, drive a smaller car, have less money to spent in the future blah blah blah...</p>
              <p>Anyway, how many footballers that have won world cup, european cup, champions league cup, EPL, LA Liga, Serie A cup in the past that we remember now? not many right? So for me its definitely money... go where the money is.. your playing career is short therefore earn more money is more important. Trophies and medal cannot be eaten right?</p>

              <p>I agree... But there are 2 ways to look at it... If the player is coming to a stage where he knows it could be his last big contract... I belief he would go for the money... cos he will need it for the rest of his days after football... But if the player is still much younger, maybe going for the trophies would attract him more cos he won't be exactly getting peanuts at the other club either...</p>
              <p>But overall, City is looking to be a good place to be... Cos not only are they paying much higher, they will be potential challenger next season... Cos last season, they took over a little too late... Almost end of Sep... This time around, they will have one full pre-season to work out everything... From transfers right down to training...</p>
              <p>And joining them don't just represent money... They will be a force to be reckon with next season... Cos this will be the owners first season in charge...</p>

And, it is believed, that the club may even reignite their interest in AC Milan's playmaker Kaka.<br><br>Without the distraction of European football next season, City believe that they have a chance to break into the top four and have identified the Premier League as their main priority.<br><br>They are, therefore, looking to bolster their squad, particularly their defence and front line, with many big name players expected to be linked with the club over the next few weeks and months.</p>
