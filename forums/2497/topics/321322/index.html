              </p><p><strong>Germany captain Michael Ballack wants to knock his new Chelsea boss Luiz Felipe Scolari out of Euro 2008 after setting up a quarter-final against Portugal with a stunning winner in Vienna. </strong></p>
              <p>The pair will be working with each other next season but Ballack is set to put club loyalties aside when he faces the Brazilian on Thursday at St Jakob-Park in Basel.</p>
              <p>Germany only needed a point against Austria at Ernst Happel Stadium to progress from Group B but Ballack's 25-yard free-kick in the 49th minute gave them victory.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Ballack was part of the Germany side who beat Scolari's Portugal 3-1 in the third place play-off at the last World Cup and he said: "From that point of view I look forward to winning against them again.</p>
              <p>"I know several players from Portugal from Chelsea and other occasions, all of them are good individuals, they play well attacking and are great footballers. They also have Ronaldo, who has had a great season in England.</p>
              <p>"It will be a difficult game but both teams are capable of going far, they are probably favourites but that may favour our game." Ballack admitted a lack of respect from Austria was a motivating factor in knocking out the Euro 2008 co-hosts.</p>
              <p>The midfielder's head was superimposed on a naked body in one Austrian newspaper, with Josef Hickersberger's men urged to "rip their trousers off ", while there was a ticket home printed inside for the Chelsea star.</p>
              <p>"A lot was said before the match," said Ballack. "The Austrians bit off more than they could chew. Listening to them it was like they had been world champions three times over." There was controversy during the game, as Germany coach Joachim Low and Hickersberger were sent to the stands after rowing on the touchline with each other and the fourth official.</p>
              <p>Low is expected to find out within the next 24 hours if he faces a touchline ban for the Portugal clash. William Gaillard, UEFA director of communications, said: "The referee will write a report to the control and disciplinary body and it will be up to them if any sanctions will be applied."</p>
