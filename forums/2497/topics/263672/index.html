            <div class='col-md body'><strong>David Nugent has gone away on holiday as the Preston striker delayed making a decision over his future.</strong><br><br>Nugent, 22, will be away for a week following talks at one club on Friday, after Sunderland and another club were given permission to negotiate with him.<br><br>Preston chairman Derek Shaw said: "Of the two clubs we gave David permission to speak to, he met one on Friday. We don't know if he met the other club.<br><br>"He's now on holiday and we're hoping to hear from his representative."<br><br>Nugent returned from playing for England's Under-21 side in the European Championship in Holland last week and was given permission to speak with two clubs.<br><br>One is believed to be Sunderland, while West Ham and Everton have been linked with him too.<br><br>Nugent joined Preston from Bury in January 2005 for a fee believed to be in the region of Â£100,000.<br><br>The Liverpool-born forward has made 94 Championship appearances for Preston, scoring 33 goals.<br><br>Sheffield United tried to buy him in the January 2007 transfer window but North End rejected the offer.<br><br>But the striker made it clear last season that he saw his future in the Premiership.<br><br>"I want to be playing in the Premiership week in, week out, that's where I need to be," he said.<br><br>"I want it to be with Preston, but if not, it'll have to be somewhere else."<br><br>Preston finished seventh in last season's Championship, missing out on a place in the play-offs.<br><br>Nugent is an Everton fan and has previously said: "My hero was Duncan Ferguson and, hopefully, I will play for them in my career and I'm confident I will do."<br><br>He made his full England debut in the win over Andorra in March, scoring in the final minute of the game.<br><br>The cap was the first by a Preston player since Sir Tom Finney and he became England's first outfield player from outside the top-flight since Michael Gray in 1999.</div>
