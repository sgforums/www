            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://resources.sportingo.com/gallery/4136.image?mod=image&amp;ac=8&amp;dpersist=true&amp;mimeType=image/jpeg&amp;imageId=4136"><br><span class="small">Gillett and Hicks (gettyimages.com)</span><br><br><strong>Liverpool fans' growing antipathy towards their club's co-owner Tom Hicks, who is close to strengthening his position at Anfield through refinancing the debt he incurred in buying the club, will be increased by the revelation of a US interview in which the American said that he intended to plough profits from the club into his US sports franchises.</strong><br><br>Prospective suitor Dubai International Capital was waiting to see if the level of opposition against Hicks and his partner George Gillett before last night's home match with Aston Villa might make Gillett any keener to sell up. But the hard bargain being driven by Hicks is illustrated in a video interview with the Major League Baseball (MLB) website which deals with the fears expressed by fans of his Texas Rangers baseball and Dallas Stars ice hockey franchises, that the Â£218m American Anfield takeover last February would damage their own clubs.<br><br>"People are worried that I might take money away from the [Texas] Rangers [Hicks' baseball franchise] to go to Liverpool," Hicks said. "But it is just the reverse. Liverpool is going to throw off lots of extra money which, if I choose to, I can use for the Rangers or the [Dallas] Stars [ice hockey team]."<br><br>It was revealed yesterday that Hicks intends to appear at the SoccerEx event in London in April, which hardly suggests that he is planning to move out of the sport any time soon.<br><br>The interview also provides a sense of how Hicks Â– whose Dallas Stars, purchased for $84m (43m), are now worth an estimated $254m Â– sees his sports franchises as business commodities. When he bought the Stars, he said, they were "a lousy franchise, playing in a crumbling arena... so I figured I could change all that; put them in a new arena, make them worth a lot more money and sell it and make money, because I'm a businessman. What I didn't count on was that I fell in love with hockey."<br><br>The angry Merseyside response to Hicks' revelation that he had approached JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann about the manager's job will hardly have left him "in love" with Liverpool and DIC may also find encouragement in Hicks' saying in the interview that he finds partisan Liverpool fans an alien entity. "There's a difference between American fans and not just European but UK," he tells MLB. "Liverpool football fans are on a different planet but God bless 'em they're proud of it."<br><br>The last line is really funny for him to say something like that... This fellow... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>*Reds in refinancing blow*<br><br>Liverpool could be plunged into fresh turmoil amid reports their American owners have suffered a setback in their refinancing plans.</strong><br><br>Already destabilised by speculation that George Gillett and Tom Hicks are considering selling the club, reports have emerged that the American duo's plans to refinance their loan have been hit.<br><br>The pair are understood to be struggling to secure the loan they require to pay back the original loan with which they bought the club last February.<br><br>The Daily Telegraph claims that the 'refinancing deal is on the verge of collapse' while The Times states that 'sources in the City believe that the Americans' regime is crumbling by the day'.<br><br>The news will not be met with disappointment by the club's supporters who made their antipathy with the American regime loud and clear during Monday's 2-2 draw with Aston Villa.<br><br>If Hicks and Gillett are to be thwarted in their plans, then the pair may conclude they have no choice but to sell their club to the Dubai-based Dubai International Capital (DIC) group.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Defiant</span></strong><br><br>'Time is running out for the Americans to conclude the loan agreement. Contrary to reports that they had until the end of February to sign the deal, it is now understood their one-year loan with RBS expires in just under two weeks,' reports The Telegraph.<br><br>Speculation was rife at the weekend that DIC had formally bid Â£500m for the Anfield club. However, it is now believed that the offer was informal and only in the region of Â£300m - prompting Hicks to issue a defiant statement announcing he had no intention of selling his stake.<br><br>DIC, however, will not launch a formal offer until they have held talks with RBS but Hicks has refused to grant DIC permission to talk to the bank until any refinancing deal is completed.<br><br>Should the refinancing collapse, then DIC - run by ardent Liverpool fan Sameer Al Ansari - would be in a position to move in.</div>
