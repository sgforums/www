              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Trust: Benitez enjoyed huge support</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1221934" rel="1221934|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1221934/This-Anfield-time-Why-Liverpool-boss-Rafa-Benitez-go.html"></a></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span><strong> fans have always had a succinct way of outlining their support for Rafa Benitez. 'In Rafa We Trust...', they say. One wonders now, though, if the limits of that loyalty have been reached.</strong></p>
              <p>One Champions League trophy - however uplifting and magical a memory - and one FA Cup (both secured by penalty shoot-outs) do not represent a reasonable return on five years of emotional and financial investment on Merseyside.</p>
              <p>Benitez has always been a peculiar Liverpool manager, never connecting either with his players or the Anfield community in the same manner as many of his predecessors.</p>
              <p>A cold, clinical man, the Spaniard has been tolerated, admired and forgiven largely because of the trophy he secured in Istanbul in May 2005.</p>
              <p>That night is fast becoming a distant memory, though, and Benitez's failings as a coach and as a mover in the transfer market have only become more apparent as the weeks have stretched in to months and years.</p>
              <p>The Barclays Premier League title should have been won by Benitez last season. That it wasn't was arguably down to him. That it is not going to be won this year either definitely is.</p>
              <p>Benitez may argue that he has not spent as much money as some of his rivals at other clubs. But he has certainly spent enough. He has certainly bought enough players. This is undoubtedly his team. And it is a team that is not good enough.</p>
              <p>Without the remarkable Fernando Torres to play against Lyon on Tuesday, Benitez used Dirk Kuyt, David N'Gog and Andrei Voronin as forwards. With the possible exception of Kuyt, these are the not the type of players a Liverpool manager should be falling back on just because his main centre-forward is absent.</p>
              <p>In the Premier League today, players such as Craig Bellamy, Peter Crouch and Robbie Keane are flourishing. These are forwards bought - and then sold - by Benitez during his time at Anfield</p>
              <p> </p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>They could not prosper at Anfield but can excel elsewhere. Why is this? It is because of the manager. Benitez has also bought numerous wide players during his time at Liverpool and even more full-backs.</strong></p>
              <p>The names read like a cast list from a European and South American football B movie. Babel, Riera, Pennant, Nunez, Insua, Aurelio, Arbeloa, Josemi, Kromkamp, Degen, Dossena, Gonzalez, Leto. Not good enough. Not any of them.</p>
              <p>Each transfer window Benitez pleads for more money from a club that hasn't got any. But maybe now the time has come to stop.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/10/21/article-1221934-06E646DE000005DC-501_468x304.jpg" alt="Cesar Delgado" width="468" height="304">

              </div>
              <p><strong>He has bought good players. Torres, Pepe Reina, Xabi Alonso, Martin Skrtel and - in his earlier days - Luis Garcia. But he hasn't bought enough of them and he certainly hasn't been able to mould them into a fully functioning and reliable team.</strong></p>
              <p>Tuesday must have been a miserable night to be at Anfield but the really sad thing is that few would have been surprised by what they saw.</p>
              <p>Benitez has fought a long and dirty war with Liverpool's American owners in a bid to gain total control of playing affairs. He got his way and this is what he has given his public. He has failed.</p>
              <p>The result of Sunday's meeting with Manchester United at Anfield should not be viewed as decisive. Whatever happens, it is time for him to go.</p>

              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez's future at Liverpool is secure for now - because the troubled club cannot afford to sack him.</strong></p>
              <p>Not even the prospect of missing out on Champions League football next season would persuade the owners to dismiss him.</p>
              <p>While failure to reach Europe's premier competition would cost Liverpool around £20million, the bill for ditching Benitez and his staff would be even more.</p>
              <p>The Spaniard has four-and-a-half years to run on the £4.5m-a-season contract he signed in March. Sacking Benitez alone would cost in the region of £20m, while getting rid of the staff he brought in after sacking 16 members of the back-room team in the summer would add considerably to the overall cost.</p>
              <p>Chelsea paid more than £23m in compensation when they dismissed first Jose Mourinho and then Avram Grant - plus members of their back-room teams.</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool's owners last night confirmed their manager was safe despite calls for his head from angry fans after a fourth successive defeat, against Lyon on Tuesday.</strong></p>
              <p>Lyon's injury-time winner condemned Liverpool to their worst sequence of results in 22 years and sparked sporadic squabbling in parts of the ground between Benitez's supporters and detractors, as well as demands for a change of manager on radio phone-ins.</p>
              <p>George Gillett put a brave face on the crisis as Liverpool prepare to face Manchester United on Sunday and insisted he and co-owner Tom Hicks were solidly behind the manager.</p>
              <p>Gillett said: 'The recent run of results has disappointed everybody. It disappoints the fans and it disappoints Rafa. I have seen his television interview and I know he is disappointed. But we are in this together.'</p>
              <p>Gillett would not be drawn on further transfer backing for Benitez in January, though it is understood a modest budget will be available.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/10/22/article-0-06E5FDD1000005DC-692_314x313.jpg" alt="George Gillett" width="314" height="313">

              </div>
              <p><strong>Explaining a policy on signings that has often looked flawed, and his view on the constant bickering between Hicks and Gillett, Benitez said: 'You have to buy players you know, or there will be a margin for error. You can't take risks. I was looking for a type of player I could incorporate into the system successfully.</strong></p>
              <p>'As for the owners, you have a situation you must try to accept and not think of too negatively. Sometimes you manage that, sometimes not. You have to manage with what you have but the relationship between myself and Gillett is good.</p>
              <p>'We just have to concentrate on football but a change in owner would be a very big deal for everyone at the club.'</p>
              <p>Midfielder Javier Mascherano attempted to deflect blame from Benitez by claiming he and his team-mates had failed to follow instructions against Lyon.</p>
              <p>'It's not the manager's fault,' he said. 'It's the players' responsibility. The manager can say how to play but on the pitch it's down to us. We were not intelligent.'</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Spurs boss Redknapp jumps to defence of Liverpool's Benitez</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Harry Redknapp</span></abbr> has jumped to the defence of underfire <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> counterpart <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rafa Benitez</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Benitez is overseeing the worst period at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> in 22 years, but Redknapp said in his column for <em>The Sun</em>: "<abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rafa Benitez</span></abbr> is going through one of those agonising, painful periods that all managers have to endure from time to time.</p>
              <p>"It's when nothing goes right and every night you go home and rely on
              those closest to you to remind you that you can still do the job.
              Confidence takes a knock, it's a brittle thing in football.</p>
              <p>"But I do not doubt Benitez's credentials or his ability for one second - despite a relatively poor run for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>. People should not forget that Benitez has won the Champions League for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> and taken them to another final.</p>
              <p>"He has won the FA Cup and has maintained the high standards of
              success at one of the world's greatest football clubs. Benitez is a
              top-class manager and that has not changed.</p>
              <p>"Despite the defeat to Lyon on Tuesday I still predict they
              will beat Fiorentina at home and then go on to qualify for the knockout
              stages of this season's Champions League. I could not predict a top
              four this season now because things are getting so much tighter with
              teams like <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr>, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Aston Villa</span></abbr>, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Everton</span></abbr> and my <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> side pushing hard.</p>
              <p>"But <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> will be up there when the honours are being dished out at the end of this season."</p>

              <p>It will take two seasons to re-organise the squad to win.</p>
              <p>If Ah Ben is being sacked, dun expect miracle as the team consists of a bunch of losers who are not hungry to fight for the ball.</p>
              <p>Imagine injuring yourself and cannot play for your country.</p>
              <p>Unless Ah Ben can revert his formation to 4-4-2, it will allow better balance in the squad as we can get another guy to score the goal.</p>
              <p>But, Ah Ben got one track mind and one formula and he is not going to change.</p>
              <p>Imagine the major insult from the fans after the match when the beach ball were thrown at Ah Ben from all corners of Anfield.</p>
              <p>This will be a miserable season for Liverpool.</p>

              <p>If I recall correctly, Crouch had a barren spell when he was playing at Liverpool but Rafa stubbornly stuck with him until he regained his scoring form.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Trouble was, the moment Crouch started scoring, Rafa kind of lost interest in him and soon after sold him off.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Go figure.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br>but it's oso partly the owners fault as 1stly, they didn't provide fresh investments to the club ,2ndly, by putting so much debts on the club and quoting a huge price per share , they have made the club more unattractive to any investor in the world..</p>

              <p><br>How can you say they didn't provide fresh investments? The year they took over in 2007, Rafa bought 27 players!</p>
              <p>27! There is no record on it so I am not sure if any other club ever bought so many players in one year... Enough to put 2 teams on the field... And look at his increased spending since 2007 as well...</p>
              <p>And forget how much debts they put on the club, that should not be used as an excuse on how the team operates... Arsenal and United also have them. Has Wenger spent a lot more than Rafa these last few years? No... Has United spend more than Liverpool these last few years? A check done by the Press said there wasn't a great deal difference, in fact United may have spent a little lesser than Pool according to some Press but it isn't important as they are quite close, not too far apart in terms of spending... and if we take how much they recover from selling players... Pool didn't recover a lot from Rafa's purchased while United still got back a decent sum especially when Ronaldo's sale sets in...</p>
              <p>What I am saying is the Owners may be easy to blame... But at the end of the day, the buck has to stop at Rafa's desk cos its he who purchased these players, plan match strategies, select the players to start, make decisions during matches, choose who to keep and to get rid off from his backroom staff and training coaches... All these are not done by the owners...</p>
