              <p><br>How can you say they didn't provide fresh investments? The year they took over in 2007, Rafa bought 27 players!</p>
              <p>27! There is no record on it so I am not sure if any other club ever bought so many players in one year... Enough to put 2 teams on the field... And look at his increased spending since 2007 as well...</p>
              <p>And forget how much debts they put on the club, that should not be used as an excuse on how the team operates... Arsenal and United also have them. Has Wenger spent a lot more than Rafa these last few years? No... Has United spend more than Liverpool these last few years? A check done by the Press said there wasn't a great deal difference, in fact United may have spent a little lesser than Pool according to some Press but it isn't important as they are quite close, not too far apart in terms of spending... and if we take how much they recover from selling players... Pool didn't recover a lot from Rafa's purchased while United still got back a decent sum especially when Ronaldo's sale sets in...</p>
              <p>What I am saying is the Owners may be easy to blame... But at the end of the day, the buck has to stop at Rafa's desk cos its he who purchased these players, plan match strategies, select the players to start, make decisions during matches, choose who to keep and to get rid off from his backroom staff and training coaches... All these are not done by the owners...</p>

              <p>sure..they did give some investments, but are all these 27 players the quality we nid?out of maybe 1 or 2, the rest r either basement finds or youth players..w/o much $$, ur hands are pretty much tied up..i'm not saying that RB is absolved of all the blame. for recruitment of players , i say it's abt 70% rafa's responsibility to find gd and cheap players...as for match tactics, that is fully rafa's problem..so does this sounds like a more balanced arguement?</p>

              <p><br>I guess it does sound more balanced, But it's not just some investment, but more or less equal sum to United's... which is not too little i would say. And whether they are quality of not, Rafa is responsible for them being there right and not the 2 Yankees...</p>
              <p>Its how he spend the money that I think most are questioning... Quantity over Quality? And even free players are not totally free, you need to pay them salaries as well. And with the large numbers there, obviously would incur more cost as well correct? So that is also one area that could add to their spending.</p>
              <p>And I am just curious why Rafa hardly make any returns from his youth purchased over the years... United sold Richardson, Rossi, Ryan Shawcross, Fraizer Campbell, Manucho, Danny Higginbotham... just to name a few who came out from their youth side and sold for a decent profit... Rafa seriously need to change the people that gives him these info of youth purchases...</p>

              <p><strong>Jermaine Pennant has accused </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/rafael-benitez"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Rafael Benítez</strong></span></a><strong> of "restricting" his players and failing to get the best out of the </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong> squad. The winger, who left the club to join Real Zaragoza in the summer, believes the Spaniard's managerial style and cautious tactics have resulted in some high-profile players finding their best form elsewhere.</strong></p>
              <p>"I don't see how a player can play at an average team and be great and go to Liverpool and be not as great. It should be a lot easier," Pennant said. "Liverpool have had some great strikers come and go – Robbie Keane is scoring goals at Tottenham, Peter Crouch is scoring now. It didn't happen at Liverpool: it must be about how the manager relates to players, how the tactics are and how he restricts players. The coach plays a big part when you arrive at a new team. If he restricts you, it's going to make you play differently."</p>
              <p>Liverpool prepare to face Manchester United this weekend on the back of four consecutive defeats – their worst run in 22 years – knowing that a fifth would leave them 10 points behind their greatest rivals. In the absence of the injured Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres Liverpool have created fewer chances and Pennant, who played for the club for three seasons after Benítez paid Birmingham £6.7m for his services, believes that the Spaniard's tactical demands hamper his squad.</p>
              <p>"I have no qualms or bad feelings about Rafa and I still love the club but there are times when you feel restricted at Liverpool," added Pennant, who was freed by Liverpool last summer. "He's a great manager and there are times when he is a genius but sometimes his approach can take the best out of you. Liverpool are a great side but they need to let loose and express themselves a bit. Look at Barcelona – you don't see them restricted, you see them breaking all sorts of shackles and they win things. Maybe if Liverpool went that way a bit they would be even better."</p>
              <p>Pennant was just one of a number of players whose signing should have provided Liverpool with the width and creativity they lacked but he departed having failed to progress and feeling that the coach did not believe in him. Others have followed suit while there has been little progress made by the former Brazilian footballer of the year Lucas or Ryan Babel, touted as the most exciting young player in the Netherlands before his move to Anfield. Pennant believes it is not coincidence.</p>
              <p>"When I was there, sometimes I would like to get the ball and not even beat the man, just put it straight in. And he would be shouting: 'Go to the byline.' He'd say it before the game and, if I had put a ball in early, as I was jogging back he'd be there gesturing for me to get to the byline. You think, 'Give it a rest. Can I just play like this? Can't I just express myself?' He's a great manager but his approach can take the best out of you."</p>
              <p>Benítez is enduring his most troublesome spell at Anfield since joining in the summer of 2004. The home defeat against Lyon in the Champions League on Tuesday leaves Liverpool facing an uphill task to avoid elimination from the tournament and poor form domestically has seen them lose four <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span></a> matches this season – double the number they lost throughout the whole of the last campaign.</p>
              <p>It is hardly ideal preparation for the fixture against United on Sunday, but the club's US owners have responded by offering their backing. "We have just entered into a long-term agreement with Rafa," George Gillett said this week. "Our family is extraordinarily pleased with him, we think he is absolutely as good as there is in the business and I am sure the [co-owning] Hicks [family] feel the same way. We just extended his contract [last March]." Thousands of fans are expected to march in protest at Gillett and Hicks before Sunday's match.</p>

              <p>Why nobody mention Jamie Carragher. He is a poor defender. Like second rate or worse, the kind you see at Hull City or Wolverhampton.</p>
              <p>Anyway I remember he consistently scores two own goals every season. Not to mention he is lousy at defending. I dont know why almost nobody criticises him at all. If he is the heart of the pool defence I can understand why pool lets in goals like a sieve.</p>
              <p>And Reina world class? I dont think so. Since this season started I think the only world class goalkeeper is Van der Saar. Almunia long ago can tell he is lousy. And this season Cech also getting worse. I think his brain damage getting worse. Reina also has consistently made mistakes. It's just several good saves that make him "world class".</p>
              <p>Many crap goalkeepers can also make these kind of saves once in a while, but consistency is something that is very hard to maintain and that makes you world class. And Ben Foster should not even be in EPL.</p>
              <p>Anyway tomorrow is Man Utd trash Pool day. The ominous signs that Pool was in decadence was already couple seasons ago. Lack of consistency; especially against lower teams. Last season was so obvious - Trash Man Utd then very happy and turn off, then lose to Middlesbrough a relegation team in next match. Either game was 3 points but Benitez dont seem to understand that. You can lose all your games with the big 4 but win all the rest and you would still do very well.</p>
