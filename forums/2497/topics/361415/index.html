              <p>"We have spent all our money already in keeping the club in the Premier League," said Redknapp.</p>
              <p>"We saw against Liverpool (during a 3-1 defeat on Sunday) that we are a little short because we had some key players missing.</p>
              <p>"We would like to add some players in the summer and I have some targets, but I will have to raise the money to go after them.</p>
              <p>"We will have to wheel and deal because we used what money there was to
              bring in (Robbie) Keane and (Wilson) Palacios to keep us in this
              league."</p>

              sell that bentley for 10-15m pounds, then you have funds.
              
              maybe consider selling alan hutton, that injury prone right back, can fetch 5m pounds or more.
              
              and sell that error prone goalie, Gomez and maybe can fetch 5-7m pounds.
              
              so there you go, 20m pounds to spend if you sell these players. If need more funds, sell that russian striker too for a few million pounds more.

              <h1>Redknapp ready to offload Spurs flops to fund £30m spending spree<br></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/05/25/article-0-05142144000005DC-990_468x370.jpg" alt="Alan Hutton plays Liverpool" width="468" height="370"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Run out: Alan Hutton made only his 11th appearance of the season at Liverpool after a season blighted by injury.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Harry Redknapp is predicting a busy summer as he tries to wheel and deal to raise a £30million transfer budget. The </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Tottenham Hotspur </strong></span></a><strong>manager wants to bring in three quality players but admits he will have to sell to raise funds after his spending spree in January.</strong></p>
              <p>Redknapp is determined to muscle in next season on the qualification places for European football, after narrowly missing out to Fulham for seventh spot this time around.</p>
              <p>'We need three players of the highest quality who can come in and make a difference,' he said.</p>
              <p>'There are certain parts of the team that need improving. I have targets and I know what I want, and the chairman knows who I am after.</p>
              <p>'We will be working hard in the summer to bring a few in, if I can create the money. We will have to be a bit creative with a few in and a few out.</p>
              <p>'We do not have enough money, things are going to be tight all round. People will have to sell to spend, and so will we. It is the same in business anywhere around the country, not just football.'</p>
              <p>The former Portsmouth boss was quick to trumpet his achievements since taking over from Juande Ramos in the autumn.</p>
              <p>'We have just missed out on a Europa League place, which is in contrast to when I arrived at Spurs hoping to miss out on a Championship place,' he said.</p>
              <p>'That was all that mattered. It would have been nice to qualify for Europe, but five months ago we were down at the bottom and we have now finished eighth. That's a tremendous achievement considering what we were like at the beginning of the season.'</p>
              <p>Redknapp made a few changes for the final-day visit to Liverpool, but indicated he was not impressed by what he saw during his side's 3-1 defeat.</p>
              <p>'I used the Liverpool game to see a few lads who have not been involved too much, and it gives you a few answers. Probably telling me what I already knew,' he said.</p>
              <p>'But it has still been a remarkable season for us, after such a bad start. Now we must improve. We can't sit back. That was probably why we had such a bad start, you must keep getting the best out of what you have got.</p>
              <p>'I know who I would really like. There will not be wholesale changes because we do not have many we can get rid of straight away.'</p>
              <p>Those that could be sold...</p>
