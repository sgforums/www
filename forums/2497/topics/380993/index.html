              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ALEX McLEISH is sharpening his knife in a bid to inflict another gaping wound on Rafa Benitez.</h2>
              <p class="article">McLeish's Birmingham visit Anfield on Monday with Benitez's position under increasing threat following Liverpool's draw at Lyon. Wednesday's result has left the Kop on the brink of a shock Champions League exit.</p>
              <p class="article">Now, it's all about the Premier League for Benitez and the table makes uncomfortable reading with Liverpool already written off as title contenders.</p>
              <p class="article">McLeish, as an ex-manager of Rangers, knows better than most exactly what pressure the Spaniard is under having experienced the football cauldron of Glasgow. And he said: "If you wear the badge at Liverpool or Rangers you are supposed to win every single week, every game."</p>
              <p class="article">'Big Eck', who won seven trophies in 4½ years at Ibrox, made £10million profit in the transfer market but was still pilloried in his final season because the Gers were trailing behind Celtic.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: "It's not so much sympathy I have for Rafa, it's more empathy because I had a tough time in my last season at Rangers. "I had a stack of injuries like he has now but fans aren't really interested in that as an excuse. You have to find a way of putting out a team which can still win.</p>
              <p class="article">"Sometimes you don't want to go out of the front door. You are hiding behind the wheel of the car and thinking 'I hope nobody spots me today.' "Whereas when you've had a great victory you are thinking 'hey did that guy see me.'</p>
              <p class="article">"You've got to get things into perspective but it's hard. I don't think you ever get used to it. You start thinking life's unfair. "I cannot imagine Rafa is under any more pressure than I was up there.</p>
              <p class="article">"Believe me, when Celtic are ahead of you it can never be worse than that, not if you are manager of Real Madrid trailing Barcelona, AC Milan behind Inter Milan or Liverpool struggling behind Man United.</p>
              <p class="article">"Benitez has had a great career. He had some fantastic triumphs with Valencia and then won a European Cup with Liverpool so he's obviously a good manager. "He is hugely experienced and I'm sure he's got through trauma before as a coach. But the problem is when you are at a huge club like Liverpool it intensifies. "But I'm sure Rafa's a strong person and you know what they say 'What does nae kill you makes you stronger.'"</p>
              <p class="article">McLeish insisted: "I think a lot of managers have a shelf-life at a big club unless the circumstances are absolutely right. "People have come up to me and said how they remember me in my last year at Rangers and how I was looking tired and looking older.</p>
              <p class="article">"I wasn't really aware of it but I never fell out of love with the game. It was great to get back into it again first with the Scottish national team and now I'm loving it at Birmingham. "We played really well against Manchester City last weekend and should have won and I want to see us carry that on at Liverpool.</p>
              <p class="article">"Arsene Wenger was asked what made him a great manager and he said 'great players.' "But the greatness is finding players, knowing they are going to be great and then gelling them as a team and Wenger is one of the best in the business at that."</p>
              <p class="article">As Liverpool fans cringe at the likes of Voronin, Insua and Lucas floundering around, they may wonder whether the art of talent spotting has deserted Benitez.</p>

              <p><br></p>
              <p><strong>Fernando Torres does not need surgery on his groin injury but has been told to take three weeks' rest, according to reports in Spain.</strong> </p>
              <p>However, <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>understands that Anfield boss Rafa Benitez is considering risking his talisman in Monday's fixture at home to Birmingham.</p>
              <p>If Torres was to listen to the Spanish diagnosis, the striker would miss <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool</span></a>'s next four matches, including the must-win Champions League match at Debrecen and the Merseyside derby on November 29.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">The 25-year-old was assessed in Valencia on Thursday afternoon after seeking a second opinion on his injury from Spanish expert Dr Ramon Cugat. He has so far played through the pain of a problem described as not a full hernia but a deeper groin injury affecting his adductor muscle.</p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>Torres has now returned to Merseyside and the Reds hope he will be able to train lightly. Liverpool have not confirmed the diagnosis coming out of Spain and indicate he will be monitored in the run-up to Monday's home match against Birmingham.</strong></p>
              <p>Cugat is said to have concluded that Torres has got his wish to avoid surgery, but a three-week lay-off would still be a huge blow to Liverpool, who have lost Steven Gerrard to a similar injury.</p>
              <p>In that case, the former Atletico Madrid star would miss the Reds' home matches against Birmingham and Manchester City on November 21. More crucially, he would sit out the game in Debrecen on November 24 and the derby at Everton on November 29.</p>
              <p>He is also thought to want to play for Spain against Argentina next Saturday at his former home ground, the Vicente Calderon stadium of Atletico Madrid.</p>
              <p>Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez is under huge pressure after seeing his team beaten in six of their last eight matches.</p>
              <p>The Reds saw matches turn in their last two matches after substituting Torres. Last week they lost 3-1 to Fulham after he had made the score 1-1.</p>
              <p>And the No 9 looked a long way from match fitness as Liverpool were held to a 1-1 draw in France on Wednesday night, which takes their hopes of progress to the Champions League last 16 out of their hands.</p>
              <p>Before the latest news, Benitez admitted Torres had been close to surgery.</p>
              <p>And, of the Lyon match, he said: 'Fernando played with pain, and after the game he still had the same problems that have troubled him for a few weeks.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>'He wants to wait, rather than have an operation. He wants to work with the physios to  try to solve his problems, but still he has pain. 'He told me he needed to keep stopping during the game because of the pain.</strong></p>
              <p>'Whether there is the need for him or Steven (Gerrard) to have an operation is a decision we will probably not take straight away. 'We must see how they can improve, and by how much. Then we will decide about any possible operation.'</p>
              <p>Major doubts remain over whether Gerrard will have overcome his groin injury. There is better news over defender Martin Skrtel, who may be back for Monday's match, following a virus.</p>
              <p>However, Glen Johnson and Fabio Aurelio will miss out with calf problems, while Albert Riera (hamstring) and Martin Kelly (ankle) remain sidelined.</p>
              <p>Benitez said: 'We should have Martin Skrtel back at least. And we have some days now to work with the rest of the injured players. 'It is too early to say who else may be fit, the physios have a lot of work to do.'</p>

              <h2>AQUILANI POISED FOR ANFIELD BOW</h2>
              <div><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/09/10/240/aquilani3_2374722.jpg" border="0" alt="Alberto Aquilani - set for Anfield debut."></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Liverpool's fans will finally get the chance to welcome £20million Alberto Aquilani to Anfield on Monday night. The Italy international, signed in August, has been recovering from a knee operation since.</strong></p>
              <p>Now, having also overcome a recent virus problem, the 25-year-old seems certain to make his Barclays Premier League debut for the club against Birmingham at Anfield.</p>
              <p>The fans have waited so long to see the man bought to replace Xabi Alonso, so he can expect a hero's reception.</p>
              <p>Certainly his appearance in the squad will give Liverpool's worried support something to cheer with fitness doubts surrounding Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard.</p>
              <p>Manager Rafael Benitez looks likely to name Aquilani on the bench, and give him the opportunity of a cameo appearance in the second half.</p>
              <p>Benitez said: "It could be the time to let the Anfield fans see Aquilani at last.</p>
              <p>"He has been getting fitter and had a short spell in a reserve game and then a few minutes at Arsenal in the Carling Cup.</p>
              <p>"We had him with us in Lyon last week and I did want to bring him on. But Lucas and Javier Mascherano were controlling the game.</p>
              <p>"So we waited a bit, we did not want to change they way the side were playing, even though he could have come on. Then we scored and there was no need to use him, it was just a shame we conceded so late.</p>
              <p>"He was almost over the virus and he will certainly be much better on Monday.</p>
              <p>"He has trained well. He does not have match fitness, but the only way to improve that is to play him in games.</p>
              <p>"We have more players available now, so maybe he can be on the bench and then come on to change the game if necessary. He will certainly be involved."</p>
              <p>Torres has the better chance of being involved against the Midlanders as he struggles with a groin problem.</p>
              <p>Gerrard has barely trained for a fortnight, but Benitez was pleased with his involvement in a training session yesterday and his chances of facing Birmingham improved.</p>
              <p>Fabio Aurelio, Martin Skrtel and Albert Riera are also likely to return from injuries. Glen Johnson has also improved his after training this weekend, but he and Martin Kelly are still struggling.</p>
              <p>Benitez at least needs Torres on the pitch for a game Liverpool must win to keep themselves in contention for a top four place.</p>
              <p>He said: "We hope to be able to keep going with Fernando. Maybe he can be available for Birmingham, we will see how it goes.</p>
              <p>"It was a risk to play him against Manchester United, but he scored a fantastic goal and everyone was saying what a massive difference he makes.</p>
              <p>"He played, and scored, at Fulham and I was criticised by a lot of 'experts' because he was taken off in the second half.</p>
              <p>"They can see that he has a problem, but the same thing happened in Lyon when I took him off.</p>

              <h2>AQUILANI POISED FOR ANFIELD BOW</h2>
              <div><img src="http://images.football365.com/09/10/240/aquilani3_2374722.jpg" alt="Alberto Aquilani - set for Anfield debut."></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div>
              <p><span><strong>Liverpool's fans will finally get the chance to welcome £20million Alberto Aquilani to Anfield on Monday night. The Italy international, signed in August, has been recovering from a knee operation since.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Now, having also overcome a recent virus problem, the 25-year-old seems certain to make his Barclays Premier League debut for the club against Birmingham at Anfield.</p>
              <p>The fans have waited so long to see the man bought to replace Xabi Alonso, so he can expect a hero's reception.</p>
              <p>Certainly his appearance in the squad will give Liverpool's worried support something to cheer with fitness doubts surrounding Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard.</p>
              <p>Manager Rafael Benitez looks likely to name Aquilani on the bench, and give him the opportunity of a cameo appearance in the second half.</p>
              <p>Benitez said: "It could be the time to let the Anfield fans see Aquilani at last.</p>
              <p>"He has been getting fitter and had a short spell in a reserve game and then a few minutes at Arsenal in the Carling Cup.</p>
              <p>"We had him with us in Lyon last week and I did want to bring him on. But Lucas and Javier Mascherano were controlling the game.</p>
              <p>"So we waited a bit, we did not want to change they way the side were playing, even though he could have come on. Then we scored and there was no need to use him, it was just a shame we conceded so late.</p>
              <p>"He was almost over the virus and he will certainly be much better on Monday.</p>
              <p>"He has trained well. He does not have match fitness, but the only way to improve that is to play him in games.</p>
              <p>"We have more players available now, so maybe he can be on the bench and then come on to change the game if necessary. He will certainly be involved."</p>
              <p>Torres has the better chance of being involved against the Midlanders as he struggles with a groin problem.</p>
              <p>Gerrard has barely trained for a fortnight, but Benitez was pleased with his involvement in a training session yesterday and his chances of facing Birmingham improved.</p>
              <p>Fabio Aurelio, Martin Skrtel and Albert Riera are also likely to return from injuries. Glen Johnson has also improved his after training this weekend, but he and Martin Kelly are still struggling.</p>
              <p>Benitez at least needs Torres on the pitch for a game Liverpool must win to keep themselves in contention for a top four place.</p>
              <p>He said: "We hope to be able to keep going with Fernando. Maybe he can be available for Birmingham, we will see how it goes.</p>
              <p>"It was a risk to play him against Manchester United, but he scored a fantastic goal and everyone was saying what a massive difference he makes.</p>
              <p>"He played, and scored, at Fulham and I was criticised by a lot of 'experts' because he was taken off in the second half.</p>
              <p>"They can see that he has a problem, but the same thing happened in Lyon when I took him off.</p>
              <p>"You cannot win. It does not matter what you do, someone will always criticise you. It is too easy.</p>
              <p>"Fernando will play if he continues to have less pain than before. Does he need an operation? Nobody really knows, we'll wait and see.</p>
              <p>"I have had many players with this problem under my management over the years. They carried on, and sometimes you can play for the whole season with such a problem.</p>

              <p><strong>A controversial penalty by Steven Gerrard
                                      salvaged a draw for Liverpool as their faltering season continued
                                      against Birmingham at Anfield.</strong></p>
              <p>Gerrard scored from the spot to make it 2-2 after David Ngog had
                                      appeared to dive over a Lee Carsely tackle.</p>
              <p>Ngog had earlier put the Reds ahead when he smashed in a far
                                      post volley but Christian Benitez levelled when he nodded in a
                                      well-worked set piece.</p>
              <p>Cameron Jerome's 30-yard strike shocked the Reds before
                                      Gerrard's equaliser.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Birmingham will be furious at the penalty given by referee Peter
                                      Walton as Carsley did not seem to make any contact with Ngog as the
                                      under siege visitors valiantly kept the Reds at bay.</p>
              <p>However, despite a half-fit Gerrard, who had only come on
                                      because of an injury to Albert Riera, slotting in from 12 yards the
                                      result will only heap further pressure on Reds manager Rafael
                                      Benitez after a game Liverpool were expected to win.</p>
              <p>Liverpool's defensive solidity has been their strength in
                                      Benitez's reign but the foundations he has laid have been on rocky
                                      ground this season and again undermined their play.</p>
              <p>The home side took a patient and calm approach to the match
                                      before gradually raising the tempo and taking the lead.</p>
              <p>Glen Johnson was having plenty of joy down the right flank and,
                                      after weaving between two defenders, he pulled the ball back for
                                      Ngog, whose initial shot was saved by Joe Hart.</p>
              <p>Hart scampered across his goal to fend away Dirk Kuyt's
                                      follow-up but the Blues keeper had no chance when Riera crossed to
                                      the far post where Ngog smashed a left-foot volley into the roof of
                                      the net.</p>
              <p>The Reds seemed in control only to let their weakness at the
                                      back let the visitors back into a game they rarely looked like
                                      making an impact on.</p>
              <p>Former Everton midfielder James McFadden swung a Blues free-kick
                                      to the far post and, after being headed on by Roger Johnson and
                                      Scott Dann, Christian Benitez nodded in from close range.</p>
              <p>The goal had given Birmingham encouragement and the visitors had
                                      an extra air of belief about them as they repelled some concerted
                                      Liverpool pressure as the home side looked to re-establish their
                                      grip on the game.</p>
              <p>Hart tipped over a 25-yard strike from Javier Mascherano before
                                      the Blues defence cleared a tamely struck Lucas Leiva sidefooted
                                      15-yard shot off the line.</p>
              <p>Liverpool brought Gerrard on when Riera went off with a
                                      hamstring problem but their half-fit captain could do little as the
                                      visitors took the lead in spectacular fashion.</p>
              <p>Jerome controlled Dann's head ball forward, fended off the
                                      irritation of Mascherano and unleashed a thunderous shot which
                                      dipped over keeper Reina.</p>
              <p>The Reds piled on the pressure with wave after wave of attack
                                      and it almost paid off only for Gerrard to head a Glen Johnson
                                      cross against the outside of the post from eight yards.</p>
              <p>Birmingham defended in numbers with a bravery which saw the
                                      likes of centre-backs Scott Dann and Roger Johnson flinging their
                                      bodies at crosses and shots to keep the home side at bay.</p>
              <p>However, they conceded an equaliser in controversial
                                      circumstances as Gerrard sent hart the wrong way from the spot.</p>
              <p>The Anfield crowd were now staunchly behind their team and Ngog
                                      sidefooted wide after Gerrard powered in a cross to the near post
                                      but a winner eluded the Reds as they stay seventh in the Premier
                                      League.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">DAVID NGOG was branded a cheat for the outrageous dive that saved Liverpool.</h2>
              <p class="article">Ref Peter Walton awarded a penalty for Lee Carsley's tackle on the Kop striker. But Carsley rapped: "It was an embarrassing case of cheating."</p>
              <p class="article">Brum boss Alex McLeish also labelled Ngog a "conman" over the 71st-minute flashpoint that spared the blushes of under-fire Rafa Benitez's side. </p>

              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"><strong>Furious Carsley added: "I'm sure Ngog has got a family - well if I went home having done that I'd be embarrassed. "You're supposed to be teaching your kids an example, and that is just an embarrassing case of cheating. I was absolutely nowhere near him. It's a joke.</strong> </p>
              <p class="article">"I knew I didn't touch him and I said to the referee to book me or send me off. It would have made me feel better. "But the lad's taken a chance and got his team a point so I'm sure they'll be patting him on the back."</p>
              <p class="article">There was clearly no contact when Carsley challenged Ngog in the box - and boss Benitez sheepishly admitted that his player had told him even he did not feel it was a penalty. </p>
              <p class="article">McLeish insisted the incident had cast a shadow over a battling performance by his team. He added: "This is a shame for the game. He conned the referee and got his team a penalty. </p>
              <p class="article">"Peter Walton is a good referee but he got that one wrong. If it hadn't been for the penalty, I thought we'd have gone on to win it." </p>
              <p class="article">Ngog had earlier opened the scoring after just 13 minutes with with a spectacular volley. But Birmingham took a shock 2-1 lead through Christian Benitez and a Cameron Jerome cracker.</p>
              <p class="article">It looked as if Liverpool were heading for a seventh defeat in nine games but skipper Steven Gerrard, a 45th-minute sub, kept his cool to convert the controversial spot-kick. </p>
              <p class="article">Benitez added: "Maybe it wasn't a penalty but we deserved to score. It could be that it was not a penalty but we have had many decisions like that go against us this season. </p>
              <p class="article">"I spoke with David and he thinks maybe it wasn't a penalty. "I am disappointed because it was a draw at home but the performance was pretty good," </p>
              <p class="article">Benitez refused to throw in the towel on his team's title chances, even though they are 11 points adrift of leaders Chelsea. </p>
              <p class="article">He added: "We showed when we won six in a row early in the season what we can do. And we were under pressure when we beat Manchester United. The team is not playing badly."</p>

              <p>i think that talking point has to be the ref.</p>
              <p>it's such an obvious dive but somehow the ref didnt see it.</p>
              <p>some more from the ref's view, he has one of the best angles on the field to withness the incident.</p>
              <p>bad ref-ing, well timed-dive. stupid pool to be struggling against such a team.</p>
