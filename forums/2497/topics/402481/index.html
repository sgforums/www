              <p>TV viewers could soon be able to cut 
              out the annoying sound of the vuvuzela when they watch World Cup 
              matches.</p>
              <p>The BBC is thinking about the possibility of offering 
              ‘vuvuzela free’ coverage via its red button after hundreds of 
              complaints.</p>
              <p>Fans say the droning sound of the plastic horns, which
               has been likened to the buzzing of millions of angry bees, is drowning 
              out coverage and leaving them with aching eardrums.</p>

              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p>Vuvuzelas can generate a drone of up to 144
               decibels inside stadiums, which is louder than fireworks, a plane 
              taking off or a rock concert.</p>
              <p>Now the BBC is looking into 
              providing ‘clean’ coverage, which would strip out most crowd noise.</p>
              <p>A
               BBC spokesman said last night: ‘We have already taken steps to minimise
               the noise and are continuing to monitor the situation. If the vuvuzela 
              continues to impact on audience enjoyment, we will look at what other 
              options we can take to reduce the volume further.’</p>
              <p>The BBC’s 
              plans emerged after World Cup officials said yesterday that the vuvuzela
               will stay at the tournament, despite earlier claims that the horns 
              could be banned.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Spokesman
               Rich Mkhondo said: ‘Vuvuzelas are here to stay and will never be 
              banned. Look at them as part of our culture in South Africa to celebrate
               the 2010 FIFA World Cup.’</p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/15/article-1286406-0A09790E000005DC-14_233x348.jpg" alt="Pugh " width="233" height="348"></div>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><br></div>
              <p>He said the noise is part of the fabric of football in Africa, 
              similar to English rattles, the football flares of Italy, the air horns 
              of Holland and the ticker tape that greets teams in South America.</p>
              <p>Many
               fans have been surprised by the noise created by the £2 plastic horns –
               which are blasted by thousands of supporters during games – with some 
              forced to wear ear plugs to combat the din.</p>
              <p>To TV viewers the 
              trumpets simply sound like a constant buzzing through 90 minutes of 
              football.</p>
              <p>Mr Mkhondo’s confirmation that vuvuzelas would continue 
              to be allowed into World Cup stadia followed weekend reports that 
              officials were considering banning the horns.</p>
              <p>Yesterday the 
              England Supporters’ Band backed the use of the vuvuzela, arguing that 
              ‘when in Rome’ the local culture should be respected.</p>
              <p>Sheffield-based
               trumpeter John Hemmingham – who leads the eight-man England orchestra 
              which has not missed a game since 1996 – said the horns were a good 
              thing.‘It’s the way South Africans express their joy and pleasure at the
               tournament being here,’ he said.</p>

              </div>
              <p>A recent survey found that the sound emitted by a vuvuzela was the 
              equivalent to 127 decibels - louder than a drum's 122 decibels, or a 
              referee's whistle at 121.8 decibels.</p>
              <p>Vuvuzelas are modern 
              spin-offs of traditional instruments made from spiralling kudu horns.</p>
              <p>Van Schalkwyk said he decided to develop a plastic version after
              spotting the original versions of the horn being blown at games.</p>
              <p>They
               are sold by vendors outside the grounds for the equivalent of £2.50.</p>
              <p>The company says it had sold 1.5 million vuvuzelas in Europe since
              October in addition to the millions it has sold in South Africa.</p>
              <p>Masincedane
               Sport expects the tournament will generate sales of up to 20
              million rand (around £1.8 million).</p>
              <p>South African shopkeepers have also reported a boom in earplug sales 
              as visiting fans try to avoid the noise at matches.</p>
              <p>Portugal's
               Cristiano Ronaldo was the latest World Cup star to voice unease about 
              the trumpet, telling reporters that it affected players' focus.</p>

              <p><br>The vuvuzela's musical ancestor is said to be the kudu horn 
              (pictured) - ixilongo in isiXhosa, mhalamhala in Tshivenda - blown to 
              summon African villagers to meetings, according to South African tourism
               chiefs.</p>
              <p>Later versions were made of tin.<br>The trumpet 
              became so popular at football matches in the late 1990s that a company, 
              Masincedane Sport, was formed in 2001 to mass-produce it.</p>
              <p>Made
               of plastic, they come in a variety of colours - black or white for fans
               of Orlando Pirates, yellow for Kaizer Chiefs, and so on.</p>
              <p>There's
               uncertainty on the origin of the word 'vuvuzela'.</p>
              <p>Some say 
              it comes from the isiZulu for 'making noise'.</p>
              <p>Others say it's 
              from township slang related to the word 'shower', because it 'showers 
              people with music'. Or, more prosaically, looks a little like a shower 
              head.</p>
              <p>The announcement, on 15 May 2004, that South Africa 
              would host the 2010 Fifa World Cup gave the vuvuzela a huge boost, to 
              say the least - some 20 000 were sold on the day by enterprising street 
              vendors.</p>
              <p>It's a noisy thing, so there's no surprise some don't
               like it. Journalist Jon Qwelane once quipped that he had taken to 
              watching football matches at home - with the volume turned low - because
               of what he described as 'an instrument of hell'.</p>

              <p>'It is difficult for anyone on the pitch to concentrate,' the 
              Real Madrid star told a press conference.</p>
              <p>'A lot of players 
              don't like them, but they are going to have to get used to them.'</p>
              <p>France
               captain Patrice Evra has blamed the noise for waking the team in
              their hotel and stopping the players from hearing each other on the
              pitch.</p>
              <p>And Argentina's Lionel Messi complained they made it 
              impossible for players to communicate on the pitch.</p>
              <p>But England 
              defender Jamie Carragher said he's been asked to take some back.</p>
              <p>'My
               kids have been on the phone and they want two. I've got two in my bag 
              already,' Carragher added.</p>
              <p>The vuvuzela also secured support from 
              the England Supporters' Band as the travelling musicians vowed to 
              compete with the deafening sound of the vuvuzela.</p>
              <p>The brass 
              orchestra, which has not missed an England game home or away since 1996,
               promised 'the band will play on' despite the din of the South African 
              horns.</p>
              <p>After England took on the US in Rustenburg on Saturday,
               football pundit Chris Kamara complained the noise was stopping fans 
              from generating chants around the ground.</p>
              <p>But Mr Hemmingham 
              said: 'We didn't have any problem. The fans around us were all singing 
              along. And a lot of our fans were joining in with us using their 
              vuvuzelas. It all added to the atmosphere.</p>
              <p>'There was 
              definitely a different vibe about the place.<br>'The South Africans are 
              loving it. And when in Rome, you just have to go along with it.</p>
              <p>'I
               bet there is not a single South African player complaining about the 
              vuvuzela. They see it as more than just a noise, it's about the whole 
              spirit of the thing.'</p>
              <p>He added: 'They have certainly created a
               great new market in ear plugs.'</p>
              <p>Travelling England fans are 
              subjected to the vuvuzela not just at the stadiums but also around town,
               early in the morning and late at night.</p>
              <p>Mr Hemmingham said: 
              'You hear them when you land at the airport, you hear them in the 
              shopping malls, and the streets are full of them - it's a 24-hour a day 
              experience.'</p>
              <p>But England fans at home are being turned off by 
              the annoying buzz.</p>
              <p>Research revealed six out of ten fans who watch games at home are
              now doing so with the volume turned down to cut out the incessant
              horn-blowing.</p>

              their enjoyment of the tournament and seven out of ten want the

              <p>A string of vuvuzela
              tales also emerged from the study, including one old lady who rang her
              cable provider to complain about the 'loud buzzing' coming from her
              television.</p>
              <p>Another pensioner called pest control in
              over the weekend amid fears her house was being attacked by a swarm of
              bees as she watched England draw with the USA.</p>
              <p>It
              also emerged thousands of husbands have been asked to turn the volume
              down by long-suffering wives due to the infuriating hum which
              accompanies every game.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p>In the run-up to the World Cup experts 
              revealed the noise from the vuvuzelas is similar to that generated by a 
              chainsaw.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p>A spokesman for OnePoll.com, 
              which carried out the research said: 'The
              Vuvuzelas are even more unpopular than Robert Green at the moment.'</p>
              <p>'They are incredibly annoying. Walking around the 
              strees you can hear the buzz coming from people's houses.</p>
              <p>'They really are spoiling the enjoyment of the competition for 
              millions of viewers.</p>
              <p>'Women
              are finding them particularly annoying and they are causing people who
              would have liked to watch games to avoid them because of the noise.</p>
              <p>'One
              respondent said he had watched every game so far with the sound turned
              down.'  OnePoll carried out the study among 3,000 fans via their
              iPhones.</p>

              by the constant droning - an internet download promises to eliminate
              the sound from broadcasts.</p>
              <p>Fans play the £2.45 MP3 file on
              their HiFi or computer while watching football and it uses 'active
              noise cancellation' to silence the horns.</p>
              <p>The download
              generates a series of inverted sound waves that 'clash' with the waves
              of the vuvuzela to effectively cancel each other out.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Italy's Mauro Camoranesi (right) and Simone Pepe

              Green Point Stadium</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The download lasts 45 minutes - enough for one half of football - and
               can be put on repeat for the second half.</p>
              <p>The
              website, antivuvuzelafilter.com, says: 'This is your chance to enjoy
              the FIFA World Cup 2010 WITHOUT the annoying vuvuzela noise!</p>
              <p>'Get rid of the vuvuzela noise through active noise cancellation.'</p>
              <p>For
              maximum effect, antivuvuzelafilter.com say their download should be
              played through a speaker placed next to the television and set to the
              same volume.</p>
              <p>If done properly it should make the vuvuzelas 'so 
              faint as to be inaudible to human ears'.</p>

              <p>Ban the damn thing already, for goodness' sake.</p>
              <p>Some people are making the stupid charge that the calls for the ban are racist. Hell, no. By all means, play the trumpets, but at least play with some harmony! It's the damn uncoordinated playing that's the real issue..... the end result is a humongous buzzing sound like a huge swarm of bees! I was very, very, turned off at all that buzzing!</p>
              <p>I mean, imagine that the World Cup was played in China and everyone in the stadium decided to bang gongs.</p>
