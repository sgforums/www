              <p class="introcopy"><strong>CESC FABREGAS has put the boot into former club Arsenal by saying they face a bleak future behind the Manchester teams and Chelsea.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="padding7north" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 17px; margin: 4px 5px 4px 0px; font-size: 12px;">
              <p class="storycopy"> </p>
              <p class="storycopy">Wenger knew in the final months of last season that Fabregas had lost faith in his promise to deliver a young team who could first take over the Premier League and then go on to rule Europe.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">But to hear Fabregas publicly say it will be tough for Wenger. The Frenchman protected the 24-year-old throughout this summer’s negotiations with Barca.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">So Wenger might wonder why Fabregas has chosen to cast doubt over Arsenal’s future just when the beleaguered boss needs shielding from his critics.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Fabregas also claimed that Wenger is suffering similar frustrations after seeing Samir Nasri refuse to sign a new contract and quit for Manchester City.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“I needed a change in my life, that’s the truth,” Fabregas told Sport magazine. “We weren’t winning any titles and it was very frustrating for me. I didn’t feel like I was developing any more as I should do.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“I want to be in a club that is able to win the big titles year after year and I don’t see that kind of future for Arsenal. I still have many feelings for Arsenal, but I fear that they won’t be able to push the other big clubs in England away.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“If you look at the team this season I can’t see them finishing in front of Manchester United or City. Or Chelsea. There’s just too big a gulf between the squads.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“I respect that Arsenal don’t have the same financial opportunities as the others, but it was part of my decision to leave that I find it hard to see Arsenal winning the Premier League or Champions League in the near future.</p>
              <div class="padding7north">
              <p class="storycopy"> </p>
              <p class="storycopy">“I understand [Wenger’s] frustrations. It’s not easy seeing City getting every player they want because they have a rich owner.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“I hope Arsenal will replace me and the others that have left with some quality players, and maybe they can take the club back to their level as champions.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“I want to win some of the big titles with Barca. That’s one of the main reasons why I’m here. I can win the Spanish League and the Champions League with this club, and that’s what I’m dreaming of.”</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Arsenal insisted on having a buy-back clause inserted into the Fabregas deal, which gives them first option to re-sign him if Barca ever decide to sell. Fabregas, however, added: “I enjoyed my time in Arsenal, I had some great years there. I finished as captain of the club and I will still follow the club and their results. I don’t know if it’s realistic that I would return one day. But maybe I said the same when I left Barca, so you never know.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“Leaving Arsene Wenger was one of the hardest things for me. I owe a lot to him. I still remember him quitting his vacation to come and watch me as a 16-year-old.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“He came and saw things in me that I didn’t feel Barca did at that point. I thanked him for many great years together when we said goodbye.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“But this is where my heart belongs. I have known that for a long time, but I never knew if it would be possible to return to Barca.”</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Wenger has revealed he expects defender Thomas Vermaelen, who is recovering from surgery on his ankle, to be available for the clash against Sunderland on October 16.</p>

              <p>He still believe in his kid policy... Trust me, this wenger is out of times. Unless Arsenal is contend to finish 4-5th place every season. Winning anything major is out of question for Arsenal as long as Wenger is around.</p>

              <p>Well, I guess most of us are looking from a fans point of view... But if you were a director at Arsenal, you can't be unhappy what Wenger has done or continue to do for them...</p>
              <p>They are the 2nd most profitable club and has a sold-out stadium week in, week out not to mention the most expensive ticket to a premier league match... All these are what most profit driven directors will kill for... A team on low wages that plays attractive and exciting football that keeps the fans coming back for more despite they don't win anything... And the best part of it is... He takes all the shit from the Press and fans and shield all the negative away from the directors... This type of employee hard to find... You don't see the Arsenal fans protesting against the directors do we?</p>
              <p>To be very realistic, the directors may not even bother what goes on win or not as long as they continue to remain profitable... Winning titles is not their objective, making profits is their main intention...</p>
              <p>Arsenal as a club is in a very healthy state... They have reduced their debts from over $300m in 2008 to now about $135m only... They have like reduce $200m of debts all by their prudent style of management... No sugar daddies hand-outs... They might not have won anything but their directors certainly would be happy... They are the 3rd most valuable club in 2010, valued at $770m pounds...</p>
              <p>If anything, the last 3 to 5 years have been the best years for the Arsenal directors if not for the fans... Cos they see their club value increased, their debts reduced significantly all in these last few years...</p>
              <p>Who cares about the title if your bank account keeps getting fatter and fatter? From the multiply directors point of view, I would also rather have a fatter bank account than a meaningless silver pot lock up somewhere in the office right?... lol. </p>

              <p>This is a short term thinking... I am not telling Arsenal to start spending without doing their maths.. But right now, they are under spending. If you want fans to come out and keep buying your expensive ticket. You need to win things. Fans may come back this season but what about next season and forth coming season when you start to drop out of CL? I bet most of the fans who come to Emirate are those still remember the 'The Invincible' times... But surely time will erode those memories if you do not renew it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why Man Utd is so popular and successful? Cos they will die die win something every 2-3 years..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I still remember Barcelona is not very famous in sg soccer scene 5 years ago. But now,you mention Barcelona to any sg soccer fan. They will love to talk about it. Why?</p>
              <p>Cos they win many titles and world beaters.</p>
              <p>As long as you keep winning titles, I dare the club will not bankrupt. They are plenty of billionaries sugar daddy ready to takeover any title winning clubs.</p>
