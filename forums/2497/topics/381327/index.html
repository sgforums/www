              <p class="first"><strong>A controversial penalty by Steven
              Gerrard salvaged a draw for Liverpool as their faltering season
              continued against Birmingham at Anfield.</strong></p>
              <p>Gerrard scored from the spot to make it 2-2 after David Ngog had appeared to dive over a Lee Carsely tackle.</p>
              <p>Ngog
              had earlier put the Reds ahead when he smashed in a far post volley but
              Christian Benitez levelled when he nodded in a well-worked set piece.</p>
              <p>Cameron Jerome's 30-yard strike shocked the Reds before Gerrard's equaliser.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Birmingham
              will be furious at the penalty given by referee Peter Walton as Carsley
              did not seem to make any contact with Ngog as the under siege visitors
              valiantly kept the Reds at bay.</p>
              <p>However, despite a half-fit
              Gerrard, who had only come on because of an injury to Albert Riera,
              slotting in from 12 yards the result will only heap further pressure on
              Reds manager Rafael Benitez after a game Liverpool were expected to
              win.</p>
              <p>Liverpool's defensive solidity has been their strength in
              Benitez's reign but the foundations he has laid have been on rocky
              ground this season and again undermined their play.</p>
              <p>The home side took a patient and calm approach to the match before gradually raising the tempo and taking the lead.</p>
              <p>Glen
              Johnson was having plenty of joy down the right flank and, after
              weaving between two defenders, he pulled the ball back for Ngog, whose
              initial shot was saved by Joe Hart.</p>
              <p>Hart scampered across his
              goal to fend away Dirk Kuyt's follow-up but the Blues keeper had no
              chance when Riera crossed to the far post where Ngog smashed a
              left-foot volley into the roof of the net.</p>
              <p>The Reds seemed in
              control only to let their weakness at the back let the visitors back
              into a game they rarely looked like making an impact on.</p>
              <p>Former
              Everton midfielder James McFadden swung a Blues free-kick to the far
              post and, after being headed on by Roger Johnson and Scott Dann,
              Christian Benitez nodded in from close range.</p>
              <p>The goal had
              given Birmingham encouragement and the visitors had an extra air of
              belief about them as they repelled some concerted Liverpool pressure as
              the home side looked to re-establish their grip on the game.</p>
              <p>Hart
              tipped over a 25-yard strike from Javier Mascherano before the Blues
              defence cleared a tamely struck Lucas Leiva sidefooted 15-yard shot off
              the line.</p>
              <p>Liverpool brought Gerrard on when Riera went off with
              a hamstring problem but their half-fit captain could do little as the
              visitors took the lead in spectacular fashion.</p>
              <p>Jerome
              controlled Dann's head ball forward, fended off the irritation of
              Mascherano and unleashed a thunderous shot which dipped over keeper
              Reina.</p>
              <p>The Reds piled on the pressure with wave after wave of
              attack and it almost paid off only for Gerrard to head a Glen Johnson
              cross against the outside of the post from eight yards.</p>
              <p>Birmingham
              defended in numbers with a bravery which saw the likes of centre-backs
              Scott Dann and Roger Johnson flinging their bodies at crosses and shots
              to keep the home side at bay.</p>
              <p>However, they conceded an equaliser in controversial circumstances as Gerrard sent hart the wrong way from the spot.</p>
              <p>The
              Anfield crowd were now staunchly behind their team and Ngog sidefooted
              wide after Gerrard powered in a cross to the near post but a winner
              eluded the Reds as they stay seventh in the Premier League.</p>
