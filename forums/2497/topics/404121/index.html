              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ROY HODGSON admits he will be powerless to keep Steven Gerrard if the skipper wants to leave Liverpool. </h2>
              <p>Fernando Torres and Javier Mascherano are also considering their Anfield futures. And new Kop boss Hodgson said: "We'll fight tooth and nail to keep our best players but I can't nail their feet to the floor.</p>
              <p>"I can only try and persuade them that if they stay we'll have a good season and it's a good club to play for. We're all very anxious to keep them. </p>
              <p>"It's not words Steven wants, it's actions to see that the club is going to make strides forward, that there will be players of his quality alongside him. </p>
              <p>"He's wise enough to know I couldn't give him that guarantee right now, and he wouldn't respect me if I gave him a load of bull**** which he could see through." </p>
              <p>Hodgson, who has replaced Rafa Benitez on a three-year deal, knows his first job is to convince Gerrard, Torres and Mascherano to stay. </p>
              <p>But he knows if the three prize guys are keen to quit, there is little he can do about it. </p>
              <p>Real Madrid are keen on Gerrard, Torres is a target for Manchester City, Chelsea and Barcelona, while Benitez wants Mascherano with him at Inter Milan. </p>
              <p>And although Gerrard backed the choice of manager, he pointedly did not go as far as to say he will still be leading the team next term. </p>
              <p>Gerrard said: "The club have made a good appointment in Roy. I know they were determined to take their time and get the right man for the job. </p>
              <p>"Well I think it's been worth the wait and I'm sure he's just keen to get on with it and start to put his plans in place for the new season." </p>
              <p>Gerrard met the new boss at the club's Melwood training ground yesterday afternoon but knows his biggest decision will come when he returns from a family holiday to Portugal.</p>
              <p>He wants to see the ownership position, what funds are available and what offers are in from elsewhere before he commits.</p>
              <p>Hodgson added: "I'll explain I've come here to work with people like him and I'm hoping he'll have enough loyalty to at least give it some time together. </p>
              <p>"It's a question of trying to sell myself and what we are doing, and hope he buys into it. </p>
              <p>"I always saw him as the heart and soul of the team, Liverpool through and through, and on the way to becoming as big a legend as any you can name from the past. </p>
              <p>"I am prepared for life WITH Steven Gerrard and the other top players. That's why I came." </p>
              <p>Hodgson will talk to all of Liverpool's big guns over the coming days and is ready to fly to Spain after the World Cup for a chat with Torres to convince him he should stay too. </p>
              <p>Hodgson, 62, added: "It wouldn't be the right time to disturb him now as he is preparing for a World Cup match. </p>
              <p>"But, hopefully, he will go back to Spain before he goes on holiday and I will fly out to meet him." </p>

              <div id="printsaveline"><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/10/07/240/Roy-Hodgson-Shirt-Anfield-Liverpool-PA3_2472894.jpg" border="0" alt="Hodgson - new Liverpool manager."></div>
              <p><br><br></p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>New Liverpool boss Roy Hodgson admits he has to sell himself and his ideals to the club's star players but hopes they will not be tempted to "jump ship".</strong></p>
              <p>The 62-year-old has taken over at Anfield with much uncertainty still surrounding the futures of captain Steven Gerrard, striker Fernando Torres and midfielder Javier Mascherano.</p>
              <p>That trio are undoubtedly the club's most marketable assets and have all been linked with summer moves following the departure of Rafael Benitez last month after a disappointing campaign saw the Reds finish seventh - their worst position for 11 years.</p>
              <p>Hodgson knows he is not the glamour name some were maybe expecting but hopes the players will stick around long enough to judge his credentials for themselves.</p>
              <p>The former Fulham boss was due to speak to Gerrard and Jamie Carragher after his press conference at Anfield on Thursday, when he would outline his vision.</p>
              <p>He also plans to have conversations with other key members of the playing staff.</p>
              <p>"It will be actions more than words," said Hodgson.</p>
              <p>"It's out of my hands to an extent, but I do know the club is anxious to keep the players, I'm anxious to keep the players. "We'll do all in our power to keep them. The fans are intelligent and know the situation.</p>
              <p>"They can't expect me to give guarantees they'll stay on."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/01/article-1291361-0A48786C000005DC-891_634x414.jpg" alt="Welcome: Martin Broughton (left) with new Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson" width="634" height="414"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Welcome: Martin Broughton (left) with new Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson</em></p>
              <p><br></p>
              <p><strong>Hodgson was flanked by chairman Martin Broughton at his press conference in Anfield's trophy room.</strong></p>
              <p>And the man brought in to oversee the sale of the club by co-owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett again reiterated players would not have to be sold to pay down Liverpool's £351million debt and he was hopeful of hanging on to their star players.</p>
              <p>"I haven't personally had any conversations with them but conversations have taken place and we remain optimistic on that," said Broughton, who did confirm any money raised from player sales would be reinvested in the squad.</p>
              <p>"I know there are rumours out there about the club needing to sell players. "If I can just go on record again and say they are not for sale, we don't need the money. "We don't have any desire or need to sell players in order to pay down the debt."</p>
              <p>Hodgson was unwilling to discuss the transfer funds likely to be available. "It's not the right time to talk about that," he said. "It's a bit disappointing that the matters of money have been spoken about over football on my first day.</p>
              <p>"I took this job because I wanted to be manager of Liverpool. I want to benefit from the huge fan base and the incredible support.</p>
              <p>"I wanted to be part of that. I'd like to sign off on the financial part and leave that to the man sat beside me (chairman) Martin Broughton because he knows more about these things than me."</p>
              <p>Hodgson's name had been linked with England in the wake of the national team's woeful performance at the World Cup under Fabio Capello. But he dismissed suggestions he had been waiting to see what happened to the Italian before making his choice.</p>
              <p>"There was never a question that I should hold on and hedge my bets for something different because I wanted to be here - it was quite simply that," said Hodgson, whose appointment came from a shortlist of two who were interviewed at the weekend.</p>
              <p>Hodgson has targeted a return to the Champions League for the Reds. He said: "This is a very big club, a club with enormous tradition and when the club is sold it will get stronger rather than weaker.</p>
              <p>"My priority is to try to get the team doing better than last season and get them back into the Champions League spots."</p>
              <p>Hodgson led Fulham into the final of the Europa League last season "I am here on merit, I know the club did their homework before asking me to be their manager and my aim is to work for the club and the people of Liverpool."</p>
              <p>Asked if he saw the club as bigger than Inter Milan, one of the clubs he has previously managed, Hodgson was keen not to offend the Italian club's owner.</p>
              <p>Hodgson said: "Making comparisons with Inter would be very harsh - I don't want to make that comparison because I am friends with Massimo Moratti.</p>
              <p>"It's (Liverpool) as big, there's no doubt about that and certainly the challenge is as big as when I went to Inter."</p>
              <p>Broughton also clarified the situation regarding Kenny Dalglish by revealing the man who won the double for Liverpool in his first year in charge in 1986 was never a candidate this time round.</p>
              <p>Club ambassador Dalglish was asked to advise on Benitez's successor and put his own name forward. But Broughton said: "Kenny put his name in for the job and we appreciated the fact he wanted to do it but he was never a candidate.</p>
              <p>"He is happy in his current ambassadorial role."</p>

              <p><strong>Real Madrid hope to tempt </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool </strong></span></a><strong>to part with Steven Gerrard by offering midfielders Rafael van der Vaart or Fernando Gago in part-exchange.</strong></p>
              <p>Jose Mourinho has made capturing the England midfielder his No 1 priority after passing over the chance to sign David Silva, who instead left Valencia for <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester City </span></a>this week.</p>
              <p>Madrid have made several informal enquiries about the 29-year-old and believe he is open to a move to the Bernabeu.</p>
              <p>However, new Liverpool boss Roy Hodgson insists he wants to hold on to his senior players and set out his vision to captain Gerrard in face-to-face talks on Thursday evening.</p>
              <p>The Reds also face a raid from Barcelona for Fernando Torres and Javier Mascherano, while the latter is also wanted by former Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez at Inter Milan.</p>
              <p>Madrid are reluctant to pay anywhere near the £35million valuation mooted for Gerrard but reports in the Spanish capital say they would be willing to offer players in exchange.</p>
              <p>Mourinho also wants to raid his former clubs <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea </span></a>and Inter Milan for full backs Ashley Cole and Maicon and must make room in the burgeoning squad.</p>
              <p>Spanish newspaper Marca - which has close links to the Bernabeu hierarchy - say that Holland midfielder Van der Vaart and Argentina's Gago are the prime candidates to put on the table.</p>

              <p><strong>Although Hodgson does not want to lose Gerrard, he is keen on signing former Hamburg playmaker Van der Vaart.</strong> </p>
              <p>Sportsmail revealed this week that the former Fulham boss already had Van der Vaart on a short list of targets to bring in should Mascherano's proposed £25m move to Barcelona and Yossi Benayoun's £6m transfer to Chelsea go through.</p>
              <p>Approaches for Panathinaikos's Gilberto Silva, plus <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/fulham.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Fulham</span></a>'s Brede Hangeland and Danny Murphy are on the cards. </p>

              <p>Pool should sell Gerrard now as he is getting older... Get what they can before he becomes an expensive liability to the club... His salary is in the over $100k bracket and second only to Glen Johnson... His form may not be as what he used to be from next season so, it would be a smart thing to do now if they cash in...</p>
              <p>Let Aquilani take over as the creative player, I think he will come good this season with Roy in charge now... The money generate from the Gerrard sale would go a long way to helping Roy rebuild the team with new young players...</p>
