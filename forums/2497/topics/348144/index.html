              <h1>Adriano’s Hand Guides Inter Towards Scudetto</h1>
              <h2>The Nerazzurri were triumphant earlier tonight, as they roared to a 2-1 victory in the Derby della Madonnina at the San Siro stadium…</h2>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/02/16/article-0-0387E724000005DC-346_306x423.jpg" alt="Jose Mourinho" width="306" height="423"></p>
              <p><em>Brazilian Adriano: who controversially put the ball into the back of the net with the assistance of his arm.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Prior to the commencement of this contest, many believed that the eventual result would have a major impact in the race for this season’s Italian championship. Heading into the match, Inter were eight points clear of their neighbouring rivals, and six clear of Juventus, a team that managed a disappointing 1-1 home draw against Sampdoria earlier in the day.</strong><br><br>The Nerazzurri were dealt a massive blow on Friday, as their right back Maicon was ruled out through injury, however incredibly he was declared fit to play prior to this match, meaning that the only absentee was Mario Balotelli who was suspended. Jose Mourinho opted to start Adriano alongside Zlatan Ibrahimovic in attack, whilst the impressive Davide Santon was handed another start at left-back.<br><br>Meanwhile, Milan had a number of problems to deal with in the lead up to this contest, as Alessandro Nesta, Gennaro Gattuso, Marco Borriello, Emerson and even Kaka, who was given a chance earlier in the week, all missed through injury. In addition to this, Daniele Bonera was forced to miss through suspension, whilst Kakha Kaladze made a timely return from injury, and earned a start along side Paolo Maldini in the centre of defence.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">However it was Inter that took the lead completely against the run of play, when Adriano headed home the first of the night. Maicon’s glorious ball into the area was met by the Brazilian at the back post, who controversially put the ball into the back of the net with the assistance of his arm. It was 1-0 to Inter after 29 minutes of play.<br><br>The red half of Milan tried to respond immediately, however they failed to find the target through the likes of Pato, Seedorf and Jankulovski, all of whom unsuccessfully tested their luck from the edge of the area, following Adriano’s controversial opener.<br><br>Inter doubled their advantage through Stankovic after 43 minutes, as the Serbian managed to get on the end of an Ibrahimovic header and smash the ball into the bottom right corner of the net. Muntari’s long ball in was met by the Swede, who out muscled Kaladze to head the ball on to Stankovic, who then made no mistake from close range, to all but end Milan’s hopes of emerging triumphant in the 270th <em>Derby della Madonnina</em>.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>TEAMS<br><br>Inter (4-3-1-2): </strong>Julio Cesar; Maicon, Samuel, Chivu, Santon; Zanetti, Cambiasso, Muntari (Maxwell 88’); Stankovic (Burdisso 84’); Adriano (Vieira 80’), Ibrahimovic<br><br><strong>Milan (4-3-2-1):</strong> Abbiati; Zambrotta, Kaladze (Senderos 77’), Maldini, Jankulovski; Ambrosini, Pirlo, Beckham (Inzaghi 57’); Seedorf, Ronaldinho; Pato<br><br></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>GOALS<br><br></strong>29’ Adriano (Inter)<br><br>43’ Stankovic (Inter)<br><br>70’ Pato (Milan)</span></p>
