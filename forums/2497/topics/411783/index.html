              <h2>Star sues over lies as we reveal hooker has no proof of sex romp</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3><strong>DAVID Beckham's lawyers were waiting to pounce on hooker Irma Nici last night to serve a massive $25 MILLION libel writ. </strong></h3>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="inline-image-right-280"><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00162/beckham2_280_162982a.jpg" alt="">

              <p> </p>
              <p>Two burly off-duty cops armed with the 21-page document were staking out a New York hotel where the prostitute has been holed up since her three-in-a-bed lies were published in downmarket US magazine In Touch.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The £16 million lawsuit accuses Irma of damaging Becks' reputation and causing him "mental anguish".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>News of the World reporters tracked down Nici to the room in the New York hotel just hours before off-duty New York cops arrived there with the writ from the angry football superstar and his wife Victoria.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The celebrity couple are claiming the huge sum - around £16 million - <strong>PLUS</strong> punitive damages from the call girl and almost everyone connected with In Touch that printed her pack of lies, including writers, photographers, editors and distributors.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 21-page document, already lodged with the Los Angeles court, accuses publisher Bauer and editor Michelle Lee of libel and intentional infliction of emotional distress, despite being expressly warned that the story was total fabrication.</p>
              <p>The writ states: "The case arises from defendants' publication of lies to make money for themselves and to embarrass and inflict emotional distress upon Beckham, a world-famous athlete. Defendants published these statements with actual malice and with intent to profit by causing harm to Beckham."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nevertheless prostitute Irma, who told the mag she slept with Becks <strong>FIVE TIMES</strong>, has spent this week attempting to extort another £200,000 from other media organisations for her lies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="inline-image-right-280">
              <div class="caption">But incredibly the brazen Bosnian-born call girl failed to provide a single shred of evidence to support her ludicrous claims. We discovered even her name is fake.</div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We played along with her in order to expose her scam as the price tag on her story spiralled up and up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All the way through the discussions Irma, her notorious madam and agent Kristin Davis, and executives from the American mag In Touch - fooled into printing the allegations - confidently insisted they had evidence to prove their accusations that Beckham paid a total of £9,400 in cash for two sex sessions was true. But in the end they could come up with nothing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Their tale unravelled in a series of meetings with nervy Irma after we traced her to the hotel on New York's East Side.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00163/becks_280_163028a.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <div class="caption">ANGRY: Becks is claiming damages</div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>LIE!</strong> First we pressed Davis and Irma to back up the hooker's claims that dad-of-three Beckham had sex with her in a junior suite at Manhattan's Le Parker Meridien hotel in August 2007.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But senior hotel staff vowed to us that neither Becks nor Nici had been there when she said they were.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A senior marketing manager insisted: "I would know if David Beckham was ever here, even for a fleeting drink. We've checked our records and neither he nor the woman named were here."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And amazingly Irma confessed she's not even sure of the exact date the supposed encounter happened.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>LIE!</strong> Irma, 26, claims she met Becks after an introduction through a mutual friend. But tellingly she refused to give us the pal's name.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>LIE!</strong> Irma alleged she had sex with Becks several times and then phoned Davis asking her to supply a "brunette with curves" for a threesome. But they refused to corroborate the story by identifing the mystery second vice-girl, referring to her only as Jess.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="inline-image-right-280"><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00163/becksgirl_280_163061a.jpg" alt="">
              <div class="caption">BRAZEN: Bosnian-born call girl failed to back up claims</div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Davis, who served four months in prison for supplying prostitutes to New York's elite, claimed: "Jess will never meet or talk to you in person about it. She's out of the game, and not even in this state. She wants nothing to do with it. She will not talk for all the money in the world."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>LIE!</strong> Irma claimed she had phone records of Beckham calling her from the Manhattan hotel. But when pressed she could not produce any. Lamely she claimed she had lost the password for internet access to her mobile account and admitted she didn't have paper records.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>LIE!</strong> Olive-skinned Irma insisted she keeps detailed notes on all her client bookings. But she could not provide a phone number for Beckham. "I never wrote it down," she said. "It wasn't a big deal."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>LIE!</strong> The vice girl offered to show us evidence of US immigration stamps in her passport to prove she was in New York at the time she alleges she was with Beckham. Sadly, she didn't have the document with her. And later she claimed her handbag had been "stolen".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>LIE!</strong> Irma claimed she had a second sex romp with Beckham at London's Claridges a month later. But she said credit card receipts to show she was there were unavailable.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>LIE!</strong> The hooker swore to us in her rasping East European accent: "It is all true what I wrote in the magazine - I was very happy with it."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But she refused to take a lie detector test - standard practice in the USA on such stories. Her excuse was that the results would give police the opportunity to convict her as a prostitute - although she had already admitted that in print.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <div class="caption"><em>TAKE THAT: Beckham's £16 million writ for damages</em></div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>LIE!</strong> Irma told us her surname Nici, used by In Touch, was real. But a day later she admitted it was a "professional name". Then she insisted it's her mum's "maiden name". But we can reveal her genuine surname is Nezirovic and her family live in Holland.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Crazy demands for Irma's story included clauses that would indemnify the US magazine publisher from legal action by Beckham - even if their story proved to be untrue!</p>
              <p>At our first meeting with Irma, she had clearly been crying. She acted shifty as she lounged on the bed, often glancing at Davis for assurance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Looking solemn in a tarty see-through black sweater dress, with huge bags under her eyes, she had clearly not slept well for days. She picked at chocolate frosted cupcakes, spilling crumbs on her bedspread, while feverishly necking energy drink Red Bull.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="inline-image-right-280"><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00162/beckham3_280_162983a.jpg" alt="">
              <div class="caption"><em>MADAM: 'Hooker booker' Davis leaves our meeting</em></div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>"I've had ten today," she said, fighting to stay awake. Having sold her scandalous fantasy - touted as "the greatest story in the world" - Irma now had the nerve to snivel about the attention she had attracted. My mother sort of knew what I did but she isn't happy," she whined. "And my uncle is furious. The TV in Bosnia is running the stories about me. This is bad for me."</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Instead of the glamorous courtesan, she now looked a gibbering wreck, terrified of leaving the room, scared of the tsunami of outrage and curiosity that has swept the world. With straggly hair and no make-up, she seemed a far cry from the image portrayed in near-naked pin-up shots flogged around by her agent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the busty 36DD brunette cheekily managed to conjure up several more allegations about former England captain Beckham's performance in the sack. "He was no big deal," she claimed. "I've had other, more famous clients."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Despite the glaring lack of credibility, gullible In Touch executives told the News of the World: "Once you meet Irma you will know she is telling the truth. Her story is consistent." But the magazine bosses, also served with a Beckham writ on Friday, had got it wrong again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nevertheless, conniving agent Davis demanded $300,000 (£190,000) for an interview, photo and video shoot with Irma and bragged: "I love the negotiating."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The mouthy madam - running as a candidate for Governor of New York on a platform of legalising prostitution and marijuana - added: "My girl is telling the truth. She was good at her job. I want control over her image. Tramp sells." The meeting was abandoned after an hour, with a promise to reconvene next morning, Friday, at 11am. Irma stretched out and yawned: "I just wanna go to sleep."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But at around 2.25am Irma, wearing the same black dress, walked out of the front entrance of the hotel with a suited driver carrying a black bag. She tried to hide her face as our photographer spotted her. She then quickly retreated back to her room. The photographer said: "It was was all very weird - it makes you wonder if she was out for some extra business."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In her six-page In Touch story Irma depicted herself as a jet-setting happy hooker, who has banked hundreds of thousands from her dodgy lifestyle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But during our meetings it was plain that she was really miserable, unhappy with her career choice and desperate for fame.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In an extraordinary few minutes she tried to blame her childhood and disastrous relationships with men for putting her on the road to maligning David Beckham - who yesterday flew to Trinidad after playing Friday night for LA Galaxy, losing 2-0 to New York's Red Bulls.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She claimed she was forced to go public about her life of vice after an ex-boyfriend found her secret diary and threatened to sell it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Irma, who lived for a while in London's Paddington, said: "But I made notes on my clients. I wrote about all my experiences. My ex threatened to expose me so I asked Kristin for help. I'm still worried about him, I think he still has the diary."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Brassy blonde Davis, 49 - known as "the hooker booker" after exposing shamed ex-New York Governor Eliot Spitzer's sexual habits - bragged: "Irma was one of my best girls. She flew backwards and forwards from London. Sometimes she was so busy she'd be here in New York for four months at a stretch.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I had to have words with her ex boyfriend but we couldn't take the risk Irma would be exposed. We needed to take control, and she trusts me. So we decided to do it."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Irma claimed she fell into prostitution after meeting a jet-set crowd in St Tropez when she was 17, then moving to London. Irma said her diary was "more real" than Belle de Jour's bestseller and she planned to write her own kiss-and-tell book.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But yesterday afternoon Irma had a change of heart and insisted she regretted her decision to sell her story. "I never wanted to do it in the first place," she moaned.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I haven't even got money from Kristin. Everyone is making money besides me. I plan to leave tonight. I'm done with everyone, including Kristin. They're selling me out. I have contacted someone who's going to guide me there. I've had enough."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Last night publicist Max Clifford revealed Irma had contacted him to sell her story in the UK. He said they had agreed to meet in London and he had warned her not to speak to anyone.</p>

              <h2>Vice girl family is stunned</h2>
              <p><strong>by James Weatherup in Velp, Holland</strong></p>
              <p>THE stunned brother of hooker Irma Nezirovic last night told how her family only learned of her vice girl life on TV.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Damier Nezirovic, 23, insisted relatives had no idea about her seedy job until news of her claims against Becks was broadcast in Holland.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It has come as a big shock. We didn't know she was working as an escort," he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We traced Nezirovic's brother and stunned mother Nadia down to the quiet town of Velp near Arnhem on the Dutch-German border.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>"I haven't spoken to my sister for about a year but I'm backing her," said Damien. Mum Nadia refused to comment. But a neighbour said there had been suspicions about what she did for a living.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"She was here last year and was very done up. When she comes she is always plastered in make-up and wears posh clothes and high heels. I've seen men arrive in big cars and take her out."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We also traced the one-bedroom flat in Paddington, north-west London, where Nezirovic lived until three months ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A neighbour said: "The walls here are pretty thin and so you can hear most of what goes on next door.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It's fair to say it was obvious that she was a prostitute."</p>
