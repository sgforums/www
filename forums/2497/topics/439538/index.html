              <p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Manchester City’s dispute with Carlos Tevez looks set to run until Christmas after the club told their former captain they will formally discipline him for ‘breaches of contract’.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Tevez met City officials on Wednesday and the club, following a two-week investigation, have concluded that he did refuse to come on as a substitute against Bayern Munich. The striker, for his part, continues to claim he merely refused to warm up.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>It is understood Tevez was ready to apologise for not warming up provided Mancini apologised for accusing him of refusing to play. City rejected this.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The Argentine will resume training today after a fortnight’s suspension. It is an unhappy situation for both parties and West Ham are monitoring developments to see if they can sign the 27-year-old on an emergency loan move until January.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>In the meantime, Tevez must attend a disciplinary hearing before a member of the City hierarchy at which he will be informed of his punishment. In all likelihood this will be a British record fine in excess of £1million and suspension of between four and six weeks. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Tevez is expected to appeal against the decision to the City board and — if that fails — he can take his case to the Premier League. This process could last well into December.</span></p>

              <p>looks like Tevez is a pest wherever he goes to.. he refused to play when he was in Corinthians, his stay in West Ham was mired in controversy and he threw enough tantrums in there during his time, his tantrums in MUFC are well-known and flat out wanted out.. now in Citeh, he's doing the same...</p>
              <p>i think no sane manager would want such a disruptive farce in their team</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">CARLOS TEVEZ last night demanded an apology from Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini. </h2>
              <p>The striker, 27, is furious he has to answer charges he may have broken his contract over his Bayern Munich sit-in. </p>
              <p>And the Argy — back from a two-week ban today — is ready to take the club all the way to the Premier League to prove he did not go on strike. </p>
              <p>Tevez was willing to apologise for refusing to warm up if Mancini also said sorry for claiming he refused to play. </p>
              <p>Tevez now faces a disciplinary club hearing, likely to be held next Monday. </p>
              <p>A source said: "Tevez is furious. He wants Mancini to apologise for saying he refused to play. </p>
              <p>"The whole thing could have been settled if both men had apologised but City rejected the idea. </p>
              <p>"It's quite clear City do not have a water-tight case against him. Tevez will take this all the way to the Premier League. The process could take over six weeks." </p>
              <p>Tevez insists he refused to warm-up as he had already gone through his routine. </p>
              <p>The club have 15 statements confirming he did not want to prepare to come on. </p>
              <p>City view this as proof he staged a one-man mutiny. </p>
              <p>Tevez will be told to stay away from the first-team squad at training this morning. </p>
              <p>City are more determined than ever to fine him £1.5million and ban him for an additional four weeks.</p>
