            <div class='col-md body'>Summer 2006 belonged to the Wags. Unless you were lucky enough to spend the months between May and August in the most remote regions of the Himalayas you will know that "Wag" was the less than affectionate collective term for the wives and girlfriends of England's footballers during the World Cup.<br><br>Their all-night drinking sessions, marathon Â£60,000 shopping sprees and extravagant beauty regimes earned them unprecedented coverage across the globe. "These girls are hooligans with Visas," screamed the incandescent European press.<br><br>"The public were obsessed because the media deliberately stirred up an obsession," said the PR guru Max Clifford. "To sell papers you need a continual stream of new faces and the Wags were perfect because they were ordinary girls whose lives were touched by the extraordinary lives of their partners.<br><br>But six months on, which of the Wags has capitalised? The first to fall was <strong>Abigail Clancy</strong>. <img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/0200633164200.jpg"><br>The 20-year-old was dumped by Peter Crouch during the tournament after pictures were circulated of her snorting cocaine. She was ostracised by the Wags but her relationship is back on and she turned her "drugs shame" to her advantage with confessional interviews and modelling shoots in GQ, OK! and FHM.<br><br>Less can be said for <strong>Alex Curran</strong>, <img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/EGerrard.jpg"><br>Steven Gerrard's other half, who was ridiculed for her frumpy World Cup wardrobe and questioned by police after a guest was assaulted with an alcopop bottle outside a restaurant.<br><br>Pictures of a bikini-clad <strong>Carly Zucker </strong><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/EJoeCarly.jpg"><br>a perfectly formed brunette and personal trainer But Joe Cole's girlfriend has a lot to learn about what it takes to stay in the spotlight. Six months on, nothing has materialised and she has been ousted by the other Wags for being a shameless exhibitionist.<br><br>But it has not all been bad news for the Wags. Which have made the most of their World Cup exposure? In third place is <strong>Cheryl Tweedy</strong>. <img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/EACole.jpg"><br>"Cheryl saw her place cemented in Wag aristocracy and fast-tracked her celebrity status with her high-profile wedding to Ashley Cole in a Beckham-style ceremony in July," Victoria Beckham rewarded Cheryl for her loyalty, friendship and deferential attitude with a personal introduction to the celebrity designer Robert Cavalli, who made her Â£110,000 wedding dress.<br><br>But even Cheryl's successes pale beside Super Wag <strong>Coleen McLoughlin</strong>,<img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/colroo.jpg"><br>Wayne Rooney's fiancee. "There's no doubt that 2006 has been Coleen's year. With more advertising deals and magazine features than ever she's now a multimillion-pound brand in her own right. She's a worthy successor to Victoria Beckham," said Draude.<br><br>McLoughlin has a Â£1.5m contract to promote Asda and, after losing a stone since the World Cup, secured a deal with Diet Coke. With an existing Â£500,000 contract with LG Mobile and an estimated Â£6m in further advertising deals including a Â£1.5m deal with Nike to promote its womenswear, her reputation as a shrewd businesswoman is fast replacing her former one as a shopaholic.<br><br>But no one came close to taking <strong>Victoria Beckham's </strong>crown. <img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/0200638159800.jpg"> Desperate to distance herself from the other Wags, she ditched her trademark hair extensions, copied by wannabes, for a cutting-edge bob. Then came the release of his'n'hers fragrances in August and the publication of her "fashion bible" That Extra Half an Inch. She elevated herself to A-List status by securing a ticket to Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes's celebrity wedding of the year.<br><br>But according to Clifford, 2007 may prove tough for the Queen Wag. "Watching if she remains in the top spot next year will be interesting," he said. "Her husband has been the superstar of football for seven years but this is rapidly fading - he's no longer captaining England, which takes off a bit of his golden glow and will make her shine a little less. Everything she's achieved has been through him. The real test will be when she no longer has his status to rely on."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>How the Wags were born</strong></span><br><br>The term "Wags" became a buzz word which seemed to fit perfectly with England's shambolic World Cup campaign. It was first used in a newspaper on June 10, the day after the tournament started, but Andrea Thompson coined the phrase when writing for Grazia magazine in their edition of May 29. With a front page headline of "Exclusive: Secret Feuds of the World Cup Wives", the magazine highlighted the "Competitive Dieting Wardrobe Mania!" of the Wags, taking a keen interest even in Sabrina Keogh, partner of Jermaine Jenas. "Welcome to the competitive world of the Wags," Thompson wrote. "You think footballers take the World Cup seriously? They've got nothing on their womenfolk ... whose rivalry is so intense that boutiques have been pushed to breaking point by demands for show-stopping designer outfits. Not to mention the round-the-clock tanning, waxing and hair extension sessions the Wags' therapists are laying on. Forget out-playing the opposition - the name of the game here is how to out-bling it."<br><br>Other Wags...<br><br>Lampard<br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/Lampard2.jpg"><br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/Lampardsfin.jpg"><br><br>Theo<br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/Theo1.jpg"><br><br>Not Wag Shev's wife<br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/Shevchenko.jpg"><br><br>Real Ronaldo's GF<br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/RealRon.jpg"><br><br>Red Rom's Girl<br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/n1_01.jpg"></div>
