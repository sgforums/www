              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Steve Bruce will try his
              "utmost" to keep Amr Zaki and Emile Heskey at Wigan next term and
              insists Latics are very much in the "driving seat".</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The pair's great form of late is attracting other clubs' interest but Bruce hopes he came keep them at The JJB.</p>
              <p>Zaki is currently on loan from Zamalek and leads the Premier
              League scoring table with seven goals in his first eight games,
              including a memorable double against Liverpool on Saturday.</p>
              <p>Bruce insists that Wigan have an agreement in principle with the Cairo club to sign Zaki at the end of his loan stint.</p>
              <p>But among possible suitors is Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez, who has confirmed he is checking on the Egyptian striker.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile Heskey is enjoying a renaissance at present, earning a regular starting berth under new England boss Fabio Capello.</p>
              <p>The striker is out of contract in the summer and recently admitted it would be 'lovely' if he made a return to Liverpool.</p>
              <p>But Bruce hopes he can keep the pair and says talks are ongoing with both players.</p>
              <p>"We are in the driving seat because we have got them until June
              so we will very gradually and slowly and bit by bit try - they know
              that we want to try and keep them," Bruce told Sky Sports, adding the
              club have been in talks with the players' representatives for weeks.</p>
              <p>"We will try our utmost - whether something will crack this week, next month, the month after who knows."</p>
              <p>He agreed it was great that the club had players of such stature in its ranks.</p>
              <p>"Who would have thought 15 years ago that Wigan would have the
              top goal-scorer in the Premier League and an England centre-forward -
              that shows how far the club has come," he said.</p>
              <p>Zaki himself said he appreciated the favour which he owed to
              the manager, to the supporters and the players, adding he was happy at
              Wigan.</p>
              <p>He said: "I think it is a great achievement to play in Wigan
              and I would like to show my loyalty to them by playing and showing
              myself as best as I can."</p>
