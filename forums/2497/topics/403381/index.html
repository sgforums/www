              <h1>WORLD CUP 2010: Denmark 1 Japan 3 - Keisuke Honda helps Samurai Blue
               motor into last 16</h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Japan booked their place in the last 16 of the World Cup after 
              outstanding first-half free-kicks from Keisuke Honda and Yasuhito Endo 
              sent them on their way to victory over Denmark in Rustenburg.</p>
              <p>Needing
               only a draw to qualify from Group E, the Asians took the lead in the 
              17th minute when CSKA Moscow midfielder Honda bent in his set piece from
               30-yards out on the right.</p>
              <p>Although not as spectacular, Endo's 
              20-yard effort followed on the half-hour mark when the outstretched 
              Thomas Sorensen was beaten for the second time.</p>
              <p>Jon Dahl Tomasson 
              saw his penalty saved nine minutes from the end, but bundled in the 
              rebound to give his side a glimmer of hope, only for Shinji Okazaki to 
              seal Japan's triumph and book a last 16 tie against Paraguay.</p>

              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Japan coach Takeshi Okada named an unchanged team for the third 
              match
              in succession, while his counterpart Morten Olsen was boosted by the 
              availability of Nicklas Bendtner, who passed a late fitness test.</p>
              <p>Per Kroldrup was drafted in for the suspended Simon Kjaer, with 
              Jesper Gronkjaer replaced by Thomas Kahlenberg.</p>
              <p>The Scandinavians had the first real chance inside five minutes, but 
              Tomasson found himself in the wrong position as he tried to deal with a 
              deflected Simon Poulsen cross and the chance went begging.</p>
              <p>Yoshito Okubo then sent in a low cross from the left that was flicked
              on nicely by Daisuke Matsui 10 yards out, only for Sorensen to 
              intervene outstandingly with his feet.</p>
              <p>Moments later Makoto Hasebe latched on to a defence-splitting pass, 
              but wastefully shot over.</p>
              <p>At the other end captain Tomasson was again played in, on the left 
              side of the box this time, but his low shot curled agonisingly wide.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/24/article-1289338-0A3011BF000005DC-815_468x286.jpg" alt="Dead ball experts: Yasuhito Endo curls in Japan's second" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Dead ball experts: Yasuhito Endo curls in 
              Japan's second</em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The deadlock was broken the next time Japan went up-field thanks 
              to 
              Honda's stunning free-kick, his second goal so far at the finals.</p>
              <p>It came after Matsui was fouled 30-yards out on the right and a 
              curling and dipping shot was sent over the wall into the far corner 
              beyond an outstretched Sorensen.</p>
              <p>Tomasson had his third chance inside the opening quarter when 
              Christian Poulsen lifted the ball over the defence, but the Feyenoord 
              front-man failed to connect cleanly and Eiji Kawashima parried the ball 
              away to safety.</p>
              <p>Endo then made it 2-0 when he bent his free-kick around the wall into
              the right-hand corner.</p>
              <p>After Christian Poulsen tried his luck from distance, Sorensen 
              prevented his side falling further behind before half-time when he 
              tipped over Yuichi Komano's effort from the right.</p>
              <p>The Stoke City goalkeeper was saved from embarrassment by his 
              right-hand upright less than three minutes after the restart when he 
              spilt a routine catch from an Endo free-kick.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/24/article-1289338-0A303D93000005DC-336_468x406.jpg" alt="Lucky boy: Thomas Sorensen palmed Endo's free kick onto the

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Lucky boy: Thomas Sorensen palmed Endo's free 
              kick onto the crossbar</em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Kahlenberg then seemed to be taken by surprise when the ball came
               to 
              him at the back post, guiding the ball wide from a tight angle, while 
              Tomasson was again let down by his control in the six-yard box after 
              Lars Jacobsen swung over a useful cross from the right.</p>
              <p>Denmark continued to pile on the pressure and substitute Jakob 
              Poulsen was next to come close, with his long-range effort punched away 
              by Kawashima.</p>
              <p>Christian Eriksen, another replacement, then saw his strike from 
              outside the box fade away as the Danes looked short of ideas.</p>
              <p>When they did manage to get into the penalty area, the out-of-form 
              Tomasson, on a 15-match goal drought before tonight, was unable to 
              convert.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/24/article-1289338-0A3054F4000005DC-653_468x286.jpg" alt="Unbridled glee: Japan celebrate at the final whistle" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Unbridled glee: Japan celebrate at the final 
              whistle</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>With 11 minutes to play, another effort from distance by Soren Larsen
              left the cross-bar shaking, but seconds later Tomasson finally managed 
              to hit the back of the net.</p>
              <p>After Daniel Agger received a shove in the back to win a penalty, the
              veteran striker saw his shot stopped by Kawashima, but the rebound was 
              unconvincingly sliced hope.</p>
              <p>It gave Denmark hope, but substitute Okazaki killed their spirit in 
              the 87th minute when Honda teed him up to send Japan through.</p>
