              <p><strong>Owen Coyle has admitted </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/bolton-wanderers.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Bolton</strong></span></a><strong>’s Wembley nightmare will haunt him for the rest of his life but still challenged his shattered players to show their true colours against Arsenal at the Reebok.</strong></p>
              <p>The Bolton boss has spent all week working on the mental scars from last Sunday’s FA Cup 5-0 semi-final mauling by Stoke but is unsure the healing process will ever run its course.</p>
              <p>‘The early part of the week was particularly difficult,’ he said, ahead of Sunday's return to action. ‘We would be kidding ourselves if we tried to make out we were not hurting at what happened to us, because no-one envisaged a scoreline like that.</p>
              <p>‘As manager, it will hurt until the day I die, and the same applies to the players. If anyone thought those boys walked off the pitch not bothered, they are sadly wrong. This was the biggest stage they have played on, a chance to reach the FA Cup final, and it hit them hard.</p>
              <p>‘But you have to take that hurt and use it to motivate yourself. It was a terrible day, just horrible, but sometimes you have to take your medicine.</p>

              <p><strong>‘I had a meeting with them collectively, as well as speaking to them individually, and the message was simple enough. Football can take the rug from under your feet at times, but are you going to wallow in self-pity or get up in the morning with a smile on your face and get yourself going again? </strong></p>
              <p>‘We’re trying to get their mental state back to 100 per cent, and we’ll see how close we are on Sunday. Terrible moments can make you stronger. You’ve got to get back on the horse as quickly as possible, and this is a fantastic opportunity for them, in what should be a great game in an electric atmosphere.’</p>

              <p>‘They are right in the mix,’ he said. ‘They still have plenty to play for, and Arsene Wenger will have them highly motivated. He has been, and still is, an outstanding manager.’ </p>

              <p>if arsenal dun win any trophy next season, maybe the board will consider replacing him.</p>
              <p>the only thing that stop the board from sacking him is this.</p>
              <p>1) he bring a revolutionised and scientific training method unheard of in england when he joined in 1996.</p>
              <p>2) arsenal under george graham, was boring boring football until wenger join and gave it passing football</p>
              <p>3) arsenal moved to emirates under enormous debt and wenger is able to galvanise his team for these few years without spending much money on players and still challenging for EPL title and CL. hey arsenal still qualify for CL every season isnt it.</p>
              <p>4) his investment in youth is legendary and is able to bring players to the first team without having to spend a bomb such as wilshere, febregas, ramsay, walcott etc</p>

              <p>yes and no. arsenal problem is their inexperienced goalie and defence. their defence is so porous, any other teams would have no problem scoring against them.</p>
              <p>would arsenal be able to stop Rooney and Hernandez from scoring? I doubt so</p>
