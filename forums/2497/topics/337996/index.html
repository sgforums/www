              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard wants to sign a
              new contract when his current deal ends and plans stay at Anfield for
              the rest of his career.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Gerrard made the announcement as he approaches the 10-year anniversary of his Liverpool debut next week.</p>
              <p>He is currently injured with a groin muscle tear and out of Saturday's home league match with Fulham.</p>
              <p>Gerrard is back in light training and battling to be fit for
              Wednesday's Champions League home clash with Marseille but his clear
              indication he never wants to leave Anfield will delight the club's
              fans.</p>
              <p>"I do not know what is going to happen over the next 10 years
              but certainly for the next five or six I hope I am playing in
              Liverpool's first team," he said.</p>
              <p>"I have two and a half years left on my contract and hopefully I will sign another one and stay for the remainder of my career.</p>
              <p>"We will have to wait and see about management but I certainly
              want to get my qualifications to enable me to coach and manage. Then I
              will have to decide what I want to do."</p>
              <p>He added: "Whether I will be interested in the Gary Ablett
              (reserve coach) type role, the Sammy Lee (assistant manager) role or
              the Rafa Benitez role, I do not know.</p>
              <p>"I just want to get all my badges and then we will see. But I
              have a lot more football to play before we get to that stage and that
              is what I want to focus on at the moment.</p>
              <p>"All I can say at this stage is the last 10 years have been the
              best of my life. I have lived the dream doing something I have always
              wanted to do and if my working life carries on being with Liverpool
              then I will be very happy."</p>
              <p>On his 10 years in the first team, Gerrard, speaking in a
              liverpoolfc.tv interview, said: "It is hard to believe I have been in
              the first team for so long because the time has just flown by.</p>
              <p>"I am very proud to be able to say I have played for the first
              team for 10 years. If someone had said all those years ago that I would
              go on to be captain and lift the European Cup, then I wouldn't have
              believed them.</p>
              <p>"But I have had to work very hard to get to where I am and to win trophies both on a personal level and as part of the team.</p>
              <p>"Looking back, I have had some unbelievable highs playing for
              this team but I have had some lows as well. It is the lows that have
              helped drive me on.</p>
              <p>"It is disappointing to lose games or to be sent off, but those experiences have helped me achieve the highs."</p>
