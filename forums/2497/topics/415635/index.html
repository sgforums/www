              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">MANCHESTER CITY chiefs have decided to take a £50million hit on five players.</h2>
              <p>The world's richest club will listen to offers in the January transfer window for Emmanuel Adebayor, Wayne Bridge, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Roque Santa Cruz and Jo.</p>
              <p>Keeper Shay Given will also be made available — but for the £7m he was originally bought for.</p>
              <p>All six stars were signed by Mark Hughes, City boss Roberto Mancini's predecessor, at a total cost of £87.5million.</p>
              <p>But few have figured regularly this season and Mancini fears the presence of some of them is having a negative influence at the club.</p>
              <p>City chief executive Garry Cook and chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak discussed the transfer window with Mancini before flying to Abu Dhabi to meet owner Sheikh Mansour for a board meeting.</p>
              <p>There, they delivered Mancini's plans for the restructuring of the squad for a second-half title push.</p>
              <p>They include landing two new strikers, with Wolfsburg's Bosnian frontman Edin Dzeko topping the list as a £35m target.</p>
              <p>City will take the biggest hits on strikers Adebayor, 26, and Santa Cruz, 29.</p>
              <p>Adebayor cost £25m from Arsenal but is available for £12m after failing to set the world alight following his move in July 2009.</p>
              <p>Paraguayan Santa Cruz, meanwhile, was an £18m buy from Hughes' former club Blackburn but will be up for grabs at a mere £4m.</p>
              <p>City, though, seem prepared to make losses in all areas of the pitch.</p>
              <p>Left-back Bridge, 30, cost £12m from Chelsea in January 2009 but City will now accept £5m.</p>
              <p>And then there is winger Wright-Phillips, 28, who returned for a second spell at City following an £8.5m move to Stamford Bridge in August 2008.</p>
              <p>He spoke about his desire to see it out at City this season but talks on a new deal have stalled and the club will take £5m for him.</p>
              <p>The £17m deal for Brazilian flop Jo, 23, was agreed by former boss Sven Goran Eriksson but completed under Hughes and City know they will now be lucky to get £4m.</p>
              <p>In fact, the only player City bosses want their full money back on is Given, 34, who they bought from Newcastle in January 2009.</p>
              <p>The Republic of Ireland stopper lost his place to Joe Hart at the start of the season and said this week he had to get a move in the New Year.</p>
              <p>Ironically, Given will play his first Premier League game of the season away to Fulham on Sunday when he replaces Hart, who is out for a week with a back injury picked up on England duty.</p>
              <p>What City will not do is compensate the highly-paid players if they move. The six stars in question earn between £60,000 and £130,000 a week and will struggle to get the same wages elsewhere.</p>
              <p>But City will tell them and their agents they are knocking down asking prices, so the players can get the moves they want - and return to action again.</p>
              <p>In short, any make-up in wages will have to be organised with the buying club.</p>
              <p>City have already lost just over £10m this year on British record signing Robinho, who was bought for £32.5m and sold to AC Milan for £22m in August.</p>
              <p>And striker Craig Bellamy, 31, a £14m buy from West Ham, is currently on loan at Cardiff.</p>
              <p>But the City hierarchy are determined to back Mancini in his plans despite outside pressures.</p>
              <p>Mancini told the club's board in the summer it was his way or no way if he was going to continue as manager.</p>
              <p>City lie fourth in the table after an incredible £320m investment in the squad in just over two years.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Emmanuel Adebayor claims he will quit Manchester City for Juventus in January - but the move is under threat beacuse the Italian giants already have their full quota of non-EU players for this season.</strong></p>
              <p>The Togolese striker launched a stinging attack on boss Roberto Mancini as he prepared to leave the Blues.</p>
              <p>He said: "I don't know what I have done to Mancini but he never lets me play. I know I cannot stay here, and I expect to leave in December. I can tell you that the club already has a loan agreement with Juventus."</p>
              <p>But for Adebayor to make his dream move, the Old Lady would have to first get rid of Serbian Milos Krasic as Serie A rules prevent them from bringing in more than one player from outside the EU per season.</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>And that seems highly unlikely, as the winger has been Juve's outstanding performer this season and returned from injury and suspension to be the key factor in their 2-0 win over Genoa at the weekend.</p>

                                      £12m</span></strong></p>
              <p>I doubt anyone would shell out that much for Adebayor. Maybe somewhere in the region of 8-10m. He seems to be more interested to count cash than to perform on the pitch.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Wayne Bridge    (£12m)   available
                                      for £5m</strong></span></p>
              <p>5m?! How old is he again? 30 right? Just because he is an English doesn't mean he warrant that price tag. 2m the most.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Shaun Wright-Phillips    (£8.5m)  
                                      available for £5m</strong></span></p>
              <p>I think City should pay others to get rid of SWP. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Roque Santa Cruz   (£18m)   available
                                      for £4m</strong></span></p>
              <p>Could be the steal of the season for any mid table clubs. Maybe Blackburn could consider getting him back since they have lack of attacking options up front.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Jo   (£17m)   available for £4m</strong></span></p>
              <p>Again, I think City should pay others to get rid of Jo. A troublemaker who cant score</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Shay Given   (£7m)   available for
                                      £7m</strong></span></p>
              <p>Possibly one of the most wasteful talents dropped because he is not an Englishman. Arsenal, Manchester United and even Newcastle could fight for him.</p>
