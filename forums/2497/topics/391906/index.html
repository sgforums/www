              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez was quizzed about his weight in a bizarre press conference in Bucharest, prior to </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool's</strong></span></a><strong> Europa League last 32 return leg with Unirea Urziceni.</strong></p>
              <p>The Liverpool manager has occasionally complained of harsh treatment from the English press but has never experienced anything like the line of interrogation adopted by Romania's media, in a first-floor suite of the team's hotel barely an hour-and-a-half after their charter jet touched down at Bucharest Airport.</p>
              <p>He had already been grilled about travel arrangements that have been viewed in some quarters as a sign of disrespect towards Unirea, when local journalists turned up the heat with a string of provocative questions.</p>
              <p>One asked how it felt to be taunted about the sack by opposing fans, another wanted to know the salary he would demand to coach a Romanian club and a third told him he had piled on the pounds since Liverpool's Champions' League final triumph over AC Milan nearly five years ago.</p>
              <p>To Benitez's credit, he answered each one with a broad smile after stoutly defending his decision to delay departure from Liverpool until the middle of the afternoon, thereby foregoing the chance to train at Thursday night's venue, the Steaua Stadium in Bucharest.</p>
              <p>The inquisition began with a suggestion that, by flying in late and heading back to Liverpool straight after the final whistle, he was taking the threat of the Romanian champions lightly.</p>
              <p>'Not at all,' he replied. 'I just had to work out what would be the best preparation for the team, and I just felt that working on formations and set-pieces at Melwood before, rather than after, a three-hour flight would be the right option.</p>
              <p>'As for after the game, if it goes to extra-time, the plane will wait, because it is a charter. Don't make the mistake of thinking we are taking anything for granted.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/24/article-1253570-08562276000005DC-121_468x341.jpg" alt="Rafa Benitez " width="468" height="341">
              <p class="imageCaption">In the line of fire: Benitez was quizzed about Liverpool's travel arrangements</p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>It got personal after that, as he was bluntly asked how he coped with standing in the technical area and hearing opposing supporters chant: 'You're getting sacked in the morning.'</strong></p>
              <p>Unruffled, the under-pressure Spaniard claimed: 'I don't listen to them. When you are on the sidelines, watching your team, you are not aware of anything else. You are in the zone and concentrating only on what is happening on the pitch. Anyway, I don't always understand. My English still isn't all that good.'</p>
              <p>Benitez was just as diplomatic over another direct query about what 'fee' he would expect to take over a side in Romania.</p>
              <p>'It's not just about money,' he said. 'It's about being at the right club, and I feel I've got the right job now at Liverpool.'</p>
              <p>With press officer Ian Cotton trying to wind up proceedings, the best was saved until last as the gentleman who brought up the subject of sack-related chants had the final word.</p>
              <p>'Mr.Benitez,' he said. 'The last time I saw you was at the 2005 Champions' League final, and your, erm, silhouette seems to have changed since then. Why is that?'</p>
              <p>Breaking out into a grin, Benitez responded: 'It is the stress of having to answer so many questions from the press. Thank you and goodnight.'</p>

              <p>However, Javier Mascherano from long-range, and Ryan Babel from close, turned things around before the interval before Steven Gerrard's 33rd European goal wrapped things up after the break.</p>
              <p>It was the first time since the 6-1 win over Hull in September that Liverpool had scored more than twice in a game, a run of 29 matches.</p>
              <p>A year ago today they beat Real Madrid 1-0 in the Bernabeu on the way to a 5-0 aggregate win before their eventual Champions League quarter-final defeat by Chelsea.</p>
              <p>But their early struggles in the Steaua Stadium showed just how far the club's fortunes have plummeted in 12 months as Unirea created a number of chances, mainly from free-kicks and corners, which the visitors almost shambolically failed to deal with.</p>
              <p>Backed by a vociferous crowd, the Romanian champions created their first opening in only the second minute.</p>
              <p>Jamie Carragher's header from Iulian Apostol's free-kick only reached the edge of the penalty area and Sorin Frunza lashed a dipping volley onto the top of Jose Reina's net.</p>
              <p>Less than 60 seconds later, Lucas Leiva picked out Gerrard with a through-ball but the Liverpool captain's fierce low drive was parried into the air by goalkeeper Giedrius Arlauskis.</p>
              <p>Liverpool were retaining possession for long periods without really hurting their opponents but it was to cost them as, in the 19th minute, Unirea levelled the tie on aggregate.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><strong>Daniel Agger's last-ditch tackle on Marius Onofras gave the hosts a corner from the left and Razvan Paduretu's inviting delivery was perfect for centre-back Fernandes to power home a header virtually unchallenged.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <p>George Galamaz's foul on Martin Skrtel resulted in the Unirea captain coming off worst and, despite trying to run off his injury, he was replaced by Ersin Mehmedovic in the 28th minute.</p>
              <p>Two minutes later Liverpool seized control of the tie from the most unlikely of sources. Yossi Benayoun and David Ngog combined to allow Carragher to cross and, although Babel mis-controlled Gerrard's far post header with only the goalkeeper to the beat, the ball broke to Mascherano outside the penalty area to lash a shot past Arlauskis.</p>
              <p>But they almost handed the initiative back to Unirea in the 36th minute when Paduretu's inswinging corner caused chaos in the six-yard area, hitting Agger but bouncing inches wide.</p>
              <p>The Romanian midfielder's low 25-yard shot then had Reina diving to his right to tip around the post.</p>
              <p>However, Liverpool gave themselves the cushion they so desperately needed five minutes before half-time.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Gerrard swung in a free-kick from the right and Babel took one touch before swivelling to fire home from close range.</strong></p>
              <p>Early in the second half Gerrard fired wide of Arlauskis' right-hand post and also forced him into a low save on the same side, as Liverpool started to play with slightly more freedom.</p>
              <p>If there was any doubt about Unirea staging an unlikely comeback it was snuffed out by Gerrard in the 57th minute.</p>
              <p>Babel broke down the left, moving the ball to Lucas and he picked out Benayoun, whose mazy dribble into the area was only half-stopped to allow the Liverpool captain to run onto the loose ball and blast a low shot under Arlauskis.</p>
              <p>That strike was his 33rd in Europe, taking him past Alan Shearer, who scored 30 for Newcastle and two for Blackburn.</p>
              <p>That prompted the introduction of youngster Martin Kelly for Carragher at right-back and, almost immediately, Sotirios Kyrgiakos after Unirea substitute Antonio Semedo caught Skrtel in a challenge.</p>
              <p>With thoughts turning to Blackburn on Sunday in the Barclays Premier League, manager Rafael Benitez replaced Benayoun with Fabio Aurelio for the final 15 minutes.</p>
              <p>Emiliano Insua's late intervention poked the ball off the toe of Paduretu just as he was about to pull the trigger in the six-yard area but otherwise there were no other scares.</p>
              <p>But their first-half defensive lapses will not have gone unnoticed by Rovers boss Sam Allardyce ahead of his side's visit to Anfield.</p>
              <p>Much greater challenges lie ahead for Benitez and his Liverpool team.</p>

              <p>Steven Gerrard chalked up another landmark in a glittering career after becoming a European recordbreaker in the Steaua Stadium.</p>
              <p>The Liverpool
              skipper rounded off a convincing Europa League win with a 57th-minute
              strike to become Britain's highest scorer in Europe, eclipsing Alan

              <p>Gerrard said: 'It's always nice to break 
              records. I've been working really hard 
              to get back among the goals, but the

              <p>However, Javier Mascherano showed 
              his shot-shy team-mates as a perfect 
              first-time connection on the bobbliest 
              of surfaces beat Unirea keeper Giedrius 
              Arlauskis comprehensively from 30 
              yards.</p>
              <p>The contact and timing could hardly 
              have been better as it took the sting out of a Unirea side who were good value for their 18th-minute lead.</p>
              <p>Bruno Fernandes' header put an extra spring in Unirea's sprightly step,
              but they were stopped in their tracks when Mascherano struck in the
              29th minute.</p>
              <p>Ryan Babel fired Liverpool in front in 
              the 40th minute, and it became a comfortable 
              passage into the last 16 - 
              where they will play French club Lille 
              - when Gerrard pounced from close 
              range to establish their first three-goal 
              return since Hull were demolished 6-1 
              in September.</p>

              <p>The one worry was a second-half 
              injury to Martin Skrtel, carried off with 
              a suspected broken foot after a block 
              tackle by substitute Antonio Semedo 
              that went unpunished.</p>
              <p>Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez said: 'It was a bad tackle, and it looks
              like a break. It's great for a club with our history that Stevie should
              have set a new record in Europe, and I was pleased with our character
              after we came back so well from their early goal.'</p>
              <p>Liverpool's defence could have done with being as tight as the security
              outside. Turnstile staff frisked fans and confiscated bottles and even
              coins. Scores of Liverpool followers took their seats pounds lighter.</p>

              <p>Unirea levelled the tie with a deserved 
              breakthrough. Daniel Agger nicked the 
              ball away from Marius Onofras with the 
              goal at his mercy, but there was no 
              reprieve from the resulting corner, Fernandes 
              ring to power a header high into 
              the net from Razvan Paduretu's kick.</p>
              <p>Liverpool looked in danger of another 
              embarrassment in a season that has 
              already had its fair share, but Mascherano 
              stunned a raucous home crowd 
              with a brilliantly struck equaliser.</p>
              <p>Unirea failed to deal decisively with 
              Jamie Carragher's right-wing cross but 
              could hardly have envisaged Mascherano's 
              first-time thunderbolt from an 
              unconvincing clearance which flew high 
              into the net for his second goal of the 
              season and third for the club.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Still the plucky Romanian champions 
              refused to lie down as Emiliano Insua 
              almost deflected another Paduretu 
              corner into his own net, and the little 
              midfield playmaker forced a full-length 
              save from Pepe Reina seconds later.</p>
              <p>But a Gerrard free-kick delivered with 
              pace and bend gave Babel, making a 
              rare start, the chance to register his 
              fourth goal of the season from close 
              range in the 40th minute. Gerrard then 
              added another after going close twice.</p>
              <p>Yossi Benayoun weaved into the area 
              and Gerrard whipped the ball off his 
              toes with a swing of the right boot.</p>
