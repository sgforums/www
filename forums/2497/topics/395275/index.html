              ... Albert Riera is out of favour with Kop boss Rafa Benitez after his 
              'sinking ship' attack</em></p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">ALBERT RIERA has back-tracked on his controversial comments when he 
              branded 
              Liverpool a "sinking ship".</h2>
              <p class="article">Spain star Riera, 27, was suspended for his outburst last month, in 
              which he 
              also criticised boss Rafa Benitez for failing to communicate with his 
              players.</p>
              <p class="article">Benitez immediately sanctioned a loan move to Spartak Moscow and froze 
              Riera 
              out of his first-team plans.</p>
              <p class="article">But the Reds winger admits his planned switch to Russia is on hold.</p>
              <p class="article">Riera said: "Negotiations with Spartak Moscow have stalled and my 
              intention is 
              to decide my future in the summer.</p>
              <p class="article">"I want to continue my career at Liverpool because it is one of the best
               clubs 
              in the world.</p>
              <p class="article">"The feeling is spectacular, we have a great stadium and I feel very 
              good 
              here.</p>
              <p class="article">"I speak with Fernando Torres and Jose Reina and agree on the greatness 
              of 
              Liverpool."</p>

              <p>His propose move has been stall so he got no choice but to stay on the "sinking ship" for the time being... Otherwise you expect him to jump into the deep blue sea meh?</p>
              <p>Iguess he will still run on the first opportunity that comes along... A rather good player in his first season but another wasted talent lost on Rafa...</p>

              <p class="article">Riera's fate is already sealed after he branded Liverpool a sinking ship and questioned the manager's methods.</p>
              <p class="article">But Benitez's dig at £20million Aquilani hints all is not well with the man asked - and so far failing - to fill Xabi Alonso's boots.</p>
              <p class="article">The Italy international is adamant he has injured the same right ankle which kept him out for the first few months of his Anfield career, as he recovered from surgery at Roma. But Benitez implied much of the problem could be psychological.</p>
              <p class="article">The Reds chief said: "He was complaining of pain in his ankle and said he couldn't train. "We'll have to talk with the doctors to see what's going on because at the moment we don't know. "He has some pain and we will just analyse that with the doctor. It's the same ankle he did before.</p>
              <p class="article">"Some players maybe can manage with the pain, but some - when they have pain - cannot. "When you talk of pain you never know, it depends on each individual and that makes it really difficult."</p>
              <p class="article">Aquilani, 25, has made only eight starts and missed the Europa League trip to Benfica because of his ankle.  </p>
              <p class="article">There are even fears he may sit out the rest of the season. He has already had to deny tales he could leave for Juventus, although the inference from Benitez was clearly one of suspicion over the severity of his latest problem.</p>
              <p class="article">Yet there could be no hiding Rafa's feelings on Riera.</p>

              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"><strong>The Spanish winger, 27, had become such a disruptive influence that Benitez had to send him away from training three times even BEFORE his radio outburst ahead of the recent Euro clash with Lille.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Benitez insists he gave at least four reasons to Riera why he was not in the side. Riera tried to broker a fragile - and transparent - peace on Thursday, insisting he wanted to stay.</p>
              <p class="article">Yet that only came after Spartak Moscow, who were set to sign him on loan, refused to meet his demands for double his current wages.</p>
              <p class="article">Benitez, whose side visit Birmingham tomorrow, revealed: "We still have some time until the end of the Russian transfer window so we'll see what happens.</p>
              <p class="article">"I didn't see his latest comments but for me, on the day before a massive game when he was talking this way it was disappointing.  </p>
              <p class="article">"It was especially so when he was saying things that weren't true. "He also said he wants to play, that's why he had to go, but our fans are not stupid and they will know what's going on."</p>
