              <p> </p>
              <p class="article">Manchester United have now gone 14 matches without conceding a goal and will 
              fancy another shut-out against Blackburn.</p>
              <p class="article">If the champions can keep out 18th-placed Rovers for 89 minutes, they will 
              shatter the European best.</p>
              <p class="article">But Santa Cruz, who ended his own drought by scoring against Coventry last 
              week, is in bullish mood.</p>
              <p class="article">The Paraguayan said: “I think every scorer is thinking of scoring against them 
              and breaking that run.</p>
              <p class="article">“It is about being focused on waiting for that moment. They are playing so 
              many games without conceding a goal and you know just how good they are both 
              defensively and as a team.</p>
              <p class="article">“They focus their game on clean sheets and that gives you the chance to win.</p>
              <p class="article">“Every goal is the same, though. If you score and still lose it ruins 
              everything — even if you were to break that record.”</p>

              <h1>United surge on despite rare defensive glitch.</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By Martyn Herman</p>
              <p>LONDON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Cracks finally appeared in
              Manchester United's defensive armour on Saturday although the
              champions still rolled on towards the Premier League title with
              a 2-1 home victory over struggling Blackburn Rovers.</p>
              <p>Roque Santa Cruz's first-half equaliser for Blackburn after
              Wayne Rooney had put United ahead ended a record run of 14
              consecutive clean sheets in the league before Cristiano
              Ronaldo's firecracker free kick sealed victory after the break.</p>
              <p>United's 10th consecutive league win, achieved despite a
              ragged performance, moved them to 62 points, eight ahead of
              second-placed Liverpool who face Manchester City on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Nicolas Anelka marked the start of Dutch coach Guus
              Hiddink's spell in charge of Chelsea with the only goal in a 1-0
              victory at Aston Villa. Chelsea moved above Villa into third
              spot but are a distant 10 points behind United.</p>
              <p>Villa, who had last tasted a league defeat in November, were
              hoping to bolster their ambition of breaking the top-four
              monopoly with a win that would have knocked Chelsea out of
              contention, but were disappointing with their best effort being
              an Ashley Young free kick against the crossbar.</p>
              <p>"We had good possession, good triangles and were dangerous
              in the box," Hiddink, who took over from the sacked Luiz Felipe
              Scolari until the end of the season, told Sky Sports.</p>
              <p>"The only thing we didn't do was kill the game with the
              second goal and the second half we leaned back a little too
              much. But on the other hand we could have scored more."</p>
              <p>Villa have 51 points, six more than fifth-placed Arsenal who
              gave a debut to record signing Andrei Arshavin in a
              disappointing 0-0 home draw with Sunderland. The Russian
              playmaker was substituted in the second half.</p>
              <p>Stoke City drew 2-2 with relegation rivals Portsmouth while
              Middlesbrough remained in the bottom three after a 0-0 stalemate
              with Wigan Athletic. Bolton Wanderers boosted their survival
              hopes with a 2-1 defeat of West Ham.</p>
              <p>RONALDO WINNER</p>
              <p>United manager Alex Ferguson admitted his jittery side had
              been given a wake-up call by Rovers who were unlucky not to get
              a point after hitting the post and having a strong penalty claim
              turned down.</p>
              <p>"We just deserved it, no more than just," Ferguson told
              Setanta Sport. "We gave away a bad goal and that was not
              indicative of our performances recently.</p>
              <p>"They made it a real fight for us. This was a great lesson
              today, it just shows what this league is like."</p>
              <p>United badly missed Edwin van der Sar in goal and Nemanja
              Vidic at the heart of their defence, both of whom were rested.</p>
              <p>Rooney struck early with a close-range finish but Rovers
              stunned the Old Trafford crowd when Santa Cruz nudged the ball
              past keeper Tomasz Kuszczak and rolled it into the net from a
              tight angle.</p>
              <p>United defender Jonny Evans had a headed goal unluckily
              disallowed by referee Howard Webb just before halftime while
              Rovers' Ryan Nelsen stabbed a shot against the post shortly
              after the interval.</p>
              <p>United were not themselves, but Ronaldo can usually be
              relied upon to provide some inspiration and he did it again on
              the hour when he whipped a fierce free kick past the flailing
              arms of Rovers keeper Paul Robinson.</p>
              <p>Rovers manager Sam Allardyce was annoyed that Ronaldo had
              escaped a possible sending off for a kick at David Dunn moments
              earlier and enraged when his side were denied a late penalty
              after Morten Gamst Pedersen was pulled back by United's young
              right back Rafael.
