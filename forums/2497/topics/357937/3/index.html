              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">ANGRY Barcelona stars have branded Chelsea a bunch of thugs. </h2>
              <p class="article">The Spanish giants were left fuming after their Champions League semi-final first leg ended 0-0 in the Nou Camp on Tuesday. They slated ref Wolfgang Stark for letting bad tackles go, snubbing a penalty and for not sending off Michael Ballack. </p>
              <p class="article">Barca ace Xavi said: “It’s an outrage. There were scandalous incidents. Chelsea players made challenges that were clear bookings and the referee didn’t blow for a foul. </p>
              <p class="article">“In one of them he booked Yaya Toure for protesting his rival didn’t get a booking for a bad foul from behind. “There was a team that wanted to play and another that didn’t. </p>
              <p class="article">“It’s a pity. In England they talk about fair play so much. It’s a shame they don’t put that talk into practice. “There was no fair play from Chelsea at all. We played football, they did not play anything at all.” </p>
              <p class="article">Jose Bosingwa pulled Thierry Henry down in the box after 70 minutes but Stark waved it off. Soon after he failed to book Ballack for the second time for bringing Andres Iniesta down from behind. </p>
              <p class="article">And Xavi added: “The Ballack challenge was a blatant red card but the referee did nothing. “We had them holed up in their own penalty area. They did not create a single chance.” </p>
              <p class="article">Toure said: “The referee was more than sad. It seems he came here to help Chelsea. “Players like Ballack and John Obi Mikel committed so many fouls and didn’t even get a yellow.” But bullish Barcelona defender Gerard Pique said: “With our team we can win anywhere.”</p>

              <p><strong>John Terry left the Nou Camp claiming he had just been involved in the perfect defensive performance, yet the football world turned against Chelsea and their negative tactics yesterday.</strong></p>
              <p>Barcelona's players and manager, along with their former coach Johan Cruyff, were queuing up to criticise Guus Hiddink for showing so little ambition, suffocating Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o and Thierry Henry during a one-sided Champions League semi-final, first leg.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">Revenge at Stamford Bridge is high on the agenda for Barcelona's aggrieved players, insulted by the way Chelsea's interim coach set his team out to swarm all over the man in possession of the ball and stop Barca scoring at the Nou Camp for the first time in a year.</div>
              <div class="thinCenter">They believed they were bullied out of the game, continually kicked up in the air by Michael Ballack, the clumsy challenges of that liability John Mikel Obi or barged off the ball by the imposing physical presence of Didier Drogba. 'We are a clean team, as clear as water,' claimed Barca coach Pep Guardiola during a long, rambling interview yesterday, airing his grievance when his time would have been better spent solving next week's tactical riddle.</div>
              <p>Xavi and Andres Iniesta, the two central midfielders who skim the ball across the surface at the Nou Camp at bewildering speed, were left frustrated, surprised that a team of Chelsea's quality were capable of using a smothering strategy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="lightboxPopupLink" href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/29/article-1175144-04BC93A4000005DC-584_306x742_popup.jpg"> <span class="clickToEnlargeButton"> </span> <img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/29/article-1175144-04BC93A4000005DC-584_306x742.jpg" alt="Chelsea reaction" width="306" height="742"> </a></p>
              <p><strong>'In England, they talk about fair play so much, but it's a shame they don't put that talk into practice when their teams get on the pitch,' said a shaken Xavi.</strong></p>
              <p>'There was no fair play from Chelsea at all. We played football, they did not play anything at all. Ballack's challenge in the second half was a red card.</p>
              <p>I was screaming at the referee (Wolfgang Stark) to send him off, but he did nothing. 'We had them holed up in their penalty area. They did not create a single chance.'</p>
              <p>That is not strictly true, as 92,000 Catalonians will even admit that they feared the worst when Drogba raced through after Rafael Marquez's back-pass pulled up short. Beyond that, Xavi was right, with Barcelona involved in a classic game of attack versus defence, dominating possession with nearly 71 per cent of the ball and marking their territory with their trademark passes across the pitch.</p>
              <p>'We know referees allow more in European competition than they do in the Spanish league, but there is a difference between that and simply letting teams do whatever they wanted to do, which is exactly what happened,' added Iniesta.</p>
              <p>'Chelsea were given the freedom to make all the challenges they wanted. When I was brought down by Ballack I was in on goal and yet the referee let him off a second yellow card. Chelsea were organised, but they did not come out and they made no attempt to play.'</p>

              <p><strong>The Spanish press were damning in their verdict, too, with the Barcelona newspaper E l 9 declaring: El mur de la vergonya- The Wall of Shame.</strong></p>
              <p>Nevertheless, despite Chelsea's reluctance to attack, it was a thoroughly professional job, the finest defensive performance since Manchester United drew 0-0 with Barcelona in last season's Champions League semi-final.</p>
              <p>Cruyff, who led Barcelona to the European Cup in 1992, claimed Chelsea destroyed the game, using delaying tactics to upset the rhythm of one of the most aesthetically pleasing teams in Europe.</p>
              <p>'I have to confess I thought that after the first 20 minutes Chelsea would look to do something on the counter-attack, or at least want to play some football, but I was wrong. 'They just continued with the idea of trying to upset Barcelona by interrupting their flow by fouling and time-wasting.</p>
              <p>'All the refereeing was against Barcelona. It was against the spectacle and it penalised the team who were trying to play football.'</p>
              <p>But, crucially, Chelsea trust Hiddink, placing their faith in the Dutch coach as he attempts to outwit Guardiola over two legs, defending in Spain and then plotting their path to next month's final in Rome when they return to Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>'It was almost the perfect defensive performance to keep them out,' said Terry. 'It was as good a performance as I have been involved in. We did not get the goal, but as a performance collectively the team put in a shift and it was definitely up there with the best of them.</p>
              <p>'I did not expect them to come at us and get in our faces as much as they did. They didn't let us play the ball around at the back or have any time in midfield, so credit to them because they stopped us playing. Nine times out of 10 we played the long ball, but we didn't get frustrated. If anything, they were getting more frustrated.'</p>
              <p>That resentment will roll over into Wednesday's second leg, but this time the recriminations will go on a lot longer for the losers.</p>

              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1175900" rel="1175900|3| nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1175900/Chelsea-boss-Hiddink-Guus-tactics-betrayed-fear-envy.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Fury at </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea’s</strong></span><strong> supposed strong-arm tactics against Barcelona continued to dominate the Catalan sports pages yesterday. Guus Hiddink bore the brunt of the attacks for the way the Chelsea coach stifled Barca’s flowing football.</strong></p>
              <p>El Periodico columnist Emilio Perez de Rozas wrote: ‘Hiddink might think he has<br>won, but he has won nothing yet. He has drawn to lose. Chelsea’s display was one of fear, or one of pure envy, and nothing to do with strategy. Scared of being thrashed, they went face to face with Barca.’</p>
              <p>Hiddink took another hit in El Mundo Deportivo. ‘Barca expected a different Chelsea, not the hard, crude and ultra-defensive team they faced,’ commented the Catalan daily’s leader column, which added: ‘Chelsea unashamedly entrenched themselves, leaving Drogba shipwrecked on his own in attack, while in the middle Hiddink mounted a ‘Maginot Line’ formed by the five ‘beasts’ of Essien, Ballack, Lampard, Mikel and Malouda.’</p>
              <p>Getting their excuses in early ahead of the top-of-the-table clash with Real Madrid<br>tomorrow night, Barcelona newspaper Sport blamed Chelsea for leaving Pep<br>Guardiola’s stars ‘shattered’.</p>
              <p>‘The toughness exhibited by Chelsea, and the complicity of referee Wolfgang Stark, has had repercussions,’ wrote Santi Gimenez. ‘The players returned to work for a recuperation session which was of special importance to three players who suffered most from the forcefulness of the English. Thierry Henry, Andres Iniesta and Leo Messi stayed in the dressing room receiving treatment for the numerous blows they<br>received.’</p>
              <p>Gimenez then turned his fire on referee Stark. ‘Premier League directors begged<br>UEFA to assign this Bavarian sympathiser of Bayern Munich and personal friend<br>of Michael Ballack. They knew that with Stark they were playing with a safety<br>net, something which was demonstrated by his grotesque refereeing.’</p>

              <p>i thought RA wanted attacking football.  it was this exact reason he sacked mourihno right?</p>
              <p>playing that way was worst then when they were under mourihno.</p>
              <p>frankly even if chelsea win the tie i wont applaud them.</p>
              <p>a champion shouldnt play that way.</p>
              <p>if winning is all that matters then it is sad for soccer.</p>
              <p>remember the old arsenal???  defend, defend ,defend then win on penalties.</p>

              <p>I believed Chelsea could win lah... Before the match I already said Barce have so far played against the weaker sides and got through rather easily... They have not come up against a side like Chelsea or any of the Premiership sides... So they got an easy ride till now...</p>
              <p>I think even Pool would have given them problems but only difference is while Pool will employ their "rush and chase" tactics to prevent them space to play, Chelsea uses their physical strength and kicking the hell out of them before they can start to put a string of dangerous runs together lah...</p>
              <p>Its like Bolton or Blackburn taking on the top 4 in the Premiership... If you can't match them in the skill department, you think of another route... lol</p>
