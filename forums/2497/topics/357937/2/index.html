              <h1>Hiddink surrenders moral high ground with total eclipse of Barca's favourite son</h1>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/28/article-0-04B76815000005DC-926_468x367.jpg" alt="Lionel Messi" width="468" height="367"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Lionel Messi trudges off disconsolately after Barcelona were held to a 0-0 draw by Chelsea.</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><strong>It is a bit of a myth about the Dutch and total football. A coach plays total football when he has total footballers. Guus Hiddink, manager of </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span><strong>, has athletes. Great athletes, undoubtedly.</strong></p>
              <p>Some of the greatest in modern football, in fact, but not the sort of team that could come to the Nou Camp and, as Hiddink promised, fight fire with fire.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">So Hiddink did not fight fire with fire. He fought fire with five hulking great individuals strung across midfield. He fought fire by removing Frank Lampard midway through the second half and introducing another defensive player, Juliano Belletti.</p>
              </div>
              <p>He fought fire with desperate, heroic defence. Not so much total football as a total blanket thrown over the most attack-minded team in Europe.</p>
              <p>Chelsea even banished the magnificent Lionel Messi to the periphery, his brilliance showing only in tiny flashes, a run here, a dink there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/28/article-0-04B7380E000005DC-789_468x346.jpg" alt="Jose Bosingwa" width="468" height="346"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Jose Bosingwa stifled the threat of Lionel Messi in the Nou Camp</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The widely predicated destruction of Jose Bosingwa, deputising as left-back for the suspended Ashley Cole, did not take place. Chelsea took out Messi’s supply line and left him to starve on the flank. He was not taken off, but he could have been.</strong></p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Genius is a fleeting gift. In a footballer those peak years, the period in which a man can claim to be the greatest player in the world, passes all too quickly.</p>
              </div>
              <p>How long did Ronaldinho have at the top? The years could be counted on one hand.<br>He had to make the most of them, and did: the World Cup in 2002, the Champions League in 2006.</p>
              <p>If this is indeed Messi in his prime, if he has, as some claim, usurped Cristiano Ronaldo’s place at the summit this season, he needs to make the great games, the biggest games, count. Here one passed him by.</p>
              <p>Messi has never scored against English opposition and that record remained intact.</p>

              <p>giving some credit to chelsea, it seems to me chelsea was struggling to get their play together, but when they tried to hit barca on the counter, they were still able to attack convincingly. there were a few moments of danger for the barca defence. drogba is a quality striker but wasted, valdes made a brilliant double save.</p>
              <p>But there was no doubt, barca fluid midfield and attacking play was too powerful and forced chelsea to defend for most of the play time. there is no team I have ever seen before with such quick-thinking short passes and brilliant link up play. I don't blame Chelsea for committing so many fouls. Thats the only way to stop Barca! Easily, barca could have scored a lot of goals but too bad they are up against one of the best teams in England and I have always believe, English teams have the best defence in the world.</p>
              <p>Stalemate score, but I was in awe with the football by barca. Joga Bonito guys, joga bonito.. Heck the score, heck the competition, its all about football at its best..</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chelsea</span></strong> <strong>were terrifically pleased with themselves after kicking their way to a <span style="color: #0000ff;">0-0</span> draw against Barcelona last night, but the Catalans were less impressed. "One team wanted to play and the other one didn't" said <span style="color: #0000ff;">Xavi</span>, while Gerard Pique claimed Barca knew they "were superior". <span style="color: #0000ff;">Pep Guardiola</span> wasn't happy either, saying the refereeing was "unfair".</strong></p>

              <p> </p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Barcelona's players rounded on what they deemed a negative and cynical Chelsea side following the teams' 0-0 draw in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final on Tuesday night. Barcelona failed to score at home for the first time this season against a Chelsea side which defended in numbers and committed almost three times as many fouls as the Catalans.</strong></p>
              <p>Chelsea often had nine men behind the ball, with just Didier Drogba alone up front. And the Londoners' lack of ambition failed to impress Barcelona.</p>
              <p>Defender Gerard Pique believes only his side played any football over the 90 minutes. "Barcelona were the only team who wanted to play, and yet the reward is for Chelsea, even though it seems like they came for a draw," he said.</p>
              <p>Pique came through the youth system at Barcelona and returned to the club in the summer following a spell at Manchester United. He was preferred to captain Carles Puyol at the back this time for the locals, though, and says Barcelona can hold their heads high after a game which they dominated from start to finish.</p>
              <p>"At least we know we're superior because we showed that on the pitch," he said. Xavi, meanwhile, accused Chelsea of anti-fair play.</p>
              <p>"There were some actions which were clear yellow cards and not even a foul was given, and then (Yaya) Toure was booked for protesting.</p>
              <p>"One team wanted to play and the other one didn't, it's a shame... there's all this talk about fair play, but I haven't seen any from them tonight," he said.</p>
              <p>Toure, who was booked for protesting a refereeing decision, believes German official Wolfgang Stark should have punished Chelsea players for their persistent fouls.</p>
              <p>"It was worse than deplorable - it looked as if he had come to help Chelsea," he said. Barca and Chelsea ended up with two yellow cards apiece, but Toure says Hiddink's men should have had more.</p>
              <p>"Players like (Michael) Ballack and (John Obi) Mikel made so many fouls, it's unbelievable to think they weren't booked," he said.</p>
              <p>Like Pique, Barca President Joan Laporta also believes Chelsea were happy to play for a draw. "They defended a lot and very well, although it looked as if that is exactly what they came to do: defend," he said.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, Laporta is confident Barcelona can reach a second Champions League final since he took control of the club in 2003. "They didn't score and that's the most important thing; we know a goal for us at Stamford Bridge will make life very difficult for them," he said.</p>
              <p>And striker Samuel Eto'o believes Chelsea will be obliged to play a more open and positive game when the two sides meet in London on May 6. "We will try to score there in order to relax, but they won't be able to play like they did today, with nearly all of their players waiting in their own half," he said.</p>
              <p>Eto'o feels the Catalans still have a great chance of making the final in Rome next month. "0-0 is not a bad result and we still have a great chance of getting to the final - a goal in London will change everything," he said.</p>
              <p>Barca coach Pep Guardiola will have problems in central defence for that match, though. Rafa Marquez broke down with a knee injury on Tuesday night and will be sidelined for the rest of the season, while Puyol's booking means he is suspended for the return leg.</p>
              <p>Gabi Milito is still out with a long-term injury, meaning Uruguay defender Martin Caceres - the club's only other senior centre-back - is likely to come in for a rare start.</p>

              <p><strong>Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien believes Chelsea will be more adventurous when they face Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final second leg.</strong> </p>
              <p>The Blues frustrated their opponents at the Camp Nou on Tuesday as they looked to sit back and absorb the pressure. </p>
              <p>Chelsea got the result they came for after the game ended 0-0 following 90 minutes despite Barca substitute Bojan Krkic throwing away a chance to win the game when he headed wide in the final moments. </p>
              <p>But Essien, who played most of the match out of position on the right wing as manager Guus Hiddink looked to keep things tight, is expecting the Blues to show more attacking intent in the return leg. </p>
              <p>"We really frustrate them, we have not played our attacking cards yet hopefully we will be much better to test them at the Bridge," he told <em>skysports.com</em>. </p>
              <p>"We are a confident team at home, we will create more and need to go for it a bit because to qualify we need to win and score more than them. </p>
              <p>"We defended very well and they did not create enough to win the game. Didier was unlucky with his chances but I think he will redeem himself if there is another chance at the Bridge."</p>
