He previously won the accolade in August 2001, November 2003 and January 2004.<br><br>Hytner added: Â“Allardyce's award recognises the commitment and strength shown by Bolton during the current season.<br><br>"Their impressive form at the end of the year, which saw them score 10 goals in December, suggests that they will continue to impress in 2007.Â”<br><br>Both winners were selected by the Barclays Awards Panel, which includes representatives from football's governing bodies, the media and fans.</div>
