              <h1>It's official: UEFA reckon this bloke really is playing van Nistelrooy onside</h1>
              <p><a class="addStoriesLink" rel="1025575_3" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/euro2008/article-1025575/Its-official-UEFA-reckon-bloke-really-playing-van-Nistelrooy-onside.html"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Refereeing chiefs and their UEFA counterparts have joined forces to insist the Swedish officials who allowed Ruud van Nistelrooy's controversial goal against Italy made the right decision.</strong></p>
              <p>Van Nistelrooy scored Holland's opener in a 3-0 win on Monday from what appeared to be a clear offside position, diverting Wesley Sneijder's shot home from close range.</p>
              <p>The Italians were furious and their fans reacted angrily when they saw replays on the big screen outside the Stade de Suisse in Berne. Dutch players expected it to be disallowed but there was no flag from linesman Stefan Wittberg and referee Peter Frojdfeldt indicated a goal.</p>
              <p>Sportsmail's refereeing expert Graham Poll branded the decision an 'indefensible error ' by Wi t t b e r g but yesterday UEFA general secretary David Taylor applauded Frojdfeldt and his assistant for making the right call. Taylor pointed to Law 11, the offside law in the rules of the game, and the fact that Italy defender Christian Panucci had been bundled from the pitch by his own goalkeeper, Gianluigi Buffon.</p>
              <p>Panucci was lying injured at least a yard out of play but was still technically 'active' and, therefore, he and Buffon had played van Nistelrooy onside. 'Not many people, even in the game - and I include the players - know this interpretation,' said Taylor.</p>
              <p>'Even though the defender was off the field because of his momentum, he is still deemed to be part of the game and is therefore taken into consideration as one of the last two defending players.</p>
              <p>'As a result Ruud van Nistelrooy was not nearer the opponents' goal-line than the second last defender and therefore could not be in an offside position.'</p>
              <p>Taylor admitted the law does not confront this issue 'directly' - in fact, it does not confront it at all - but he claimed this interpretation was common knowledge among referees, stopping players from deliberately stepping off the pitch to catch an opponent offside.</p>
              <p>Barclays Premier League referees' boss Keith Hackett backed Taylor's viewpoint, as did Gerhard Kapl of the Austrian Refereeing Commission, who said the decision was '100 per cent correct'.</p>
              <p>Hackett said: 'The fact is the assistant was correct, the defender off the field is still regarded as active. Panucci went off through contact with his own goalkeeper. He is still considered part of the game.'</p>
              <p>Taylor quoted a similar incident in a Swiss league game between FC Basel and Sion last season when a TV commentator made a public apology for not knowing the rules.</p>

              <p><em><strong>Scolari: </strong>"To allow the goal creates confusion amongst the players, it was not valid, it shouldn't have been allowed."</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article-para"><strong>Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari described Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy on Tuesday as the "King of Off-side" insisting the Real Madrid forward's controversial goal against Italy was off-side.</strong></p>
              <p class="article-para">Van Nistelrooy's opening goal for Holland in their 3-0 trouncing of world champions Italy in Monday's Euro 2008 Group C match was legal despite a clear offside said European football's governing body UEFA on Tuesday.</p>
              <p class="article-para">But Scolari disagreed with UEFA's ruling, saying the goal should not have been allowed, and said van Nistelrooy is an expert at pushing defences to the limits. "He is the king of Off-side and is the best player in the world at beating the off-side trap," said Scolari at Portugal's Euro 2008 base here on Tuesday.</p>
              <p class="article-para">"To allow the goal creates confusion amongst the players, it was not valid, it shouldn't have been allowed." But UEFA's secretary-general David Taylor said that even though van Nistelrooy was clearly offside the fact Italian defender Christian Panucci was behind the goalline without seeking permission from the officials placed the goalscorer onside.</p>

              <p>it was really a tough call.</p>
              <p>however, i think the goal shouldn't have been allowed. based on the youtube clip, i think panucci wasn't feigning to be injured, can't really see from the clip (i would like to see a better quality footage of it though.) but it was quite obvious he clashed with buffon. its not like he walked out of the pitch.</p>
              <p>this case is just like handball, refs have to determine if its deliberate or not.</p>

              <p>this certainly calls fo fifa to implement video replays aka video referees .... in a case like this .. it will definitely help the ref n asst refs to make more accurate decisions n not cause such a great controversy ....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>by using the video replay .. ref can stop the game for a moment .. view the replay n make the decision .... or the fourth official can be used to do this .. den convey his decision to the match ref .... from there the ref makes the final decision ....</p>
