            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Gareth Southgate has brushed off Neil Warnock's criticism of his team selection for Middlesbrough's defeat to Manchester City.<br><br>Sheffield United boss Warnock was incensed that Southgate left Jonathan Woodgate, Julio Arca and Mark Viduka out of his starting line-up for Saturday's 2-0 home loss to City.<br><br>Warnock had suggested Southgate was doing his 'friend' Stuart Pearce a favour and that his decisions were 'disrespectful' to other teams battling against relegation.<br><br>"Personally I think it is a disgrace," Warnock told one of the sources. "I know Stuart is a friend of Gareth Southgate's and I know they've got Manchester United, but I'd love to see them lose the next six games, Middlesbrough, and see how they feel in the last couple of games when they are under that sort of pressure.<br><br>"I think it's scandalous and I don't think a club like Middlesbrough should disrespect Sheffield United or Charlton or anyone else scrapping for their lives.<br><br>"I'm absolutely disgusted to say the least."<br><br>But, speaking after Boro's 1-0 replay defeat to The Red Devils on Monday night, Southgate refused to be drawn into a war of words with Warnock.<br><br>Southgate said: "Some people have had plenty to say about the team I picked on Saturday.<br><br>"It was not just Neil Warnock, there were others as well.<br><br>"I make decisions for the benefit of this football club and I will pick whatever team I want."</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Warnock's behaviour is quite disgusting at the least.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>It's none of his business how another manager picks his team. Besides, it's not as if Middlesbrough were having a match with Watford that day, or a victory by Middlesbrough would change Watford's current position. What's his problem?<br><br>I think he's just trying to shift the attention to Middlesbrough. What a loser.</div>
