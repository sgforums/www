The Brazilian ace captained the Gunners for much of last season in the absence of the injured Thierry Henry, who has joined Barcelona in the summer.</strong><br><br>But Silva, 30, has revealed he was stunned to discover boss Arsene Wenger had opted to give the armband to defender William Gallas. And to make matters worse, the midfielder only found out when he switched on his computer.<br><br>Silva said: Â“Of course I was surprised because I was captain all last season when Henry didnÂ’t play and I thought I would be this time. Â“Arsene is the manager and it is his decision and I have to accept that. Life goes on and I will get on with my job like I always have. Â“But I was surprised he didnÂ’t speak to me about his decision. He had the time to do it because I was at the training ground before it was made public.<br><br>Â“He didnÂ’t say anything to me and I just found out about it that evening when I saw it on the Arsenal website. Â“I wasnÂ’t upset about not being captain, but I was about the way I learnt about it.Â”<br><br></div>

It seemed an odd decision by Wenger, akin to promoting the school's problem child to head boy in an effort to channel his energy with extra responsibility.</strong><br><br>Gilberto admitted he was shocked and "upset" to read the story on the club's official website and Wenger was forced to explain his thinking in a meeting with the Brazil midfielder. The manager appeared uncharacteristically sensitive on the subject when it was raised in the build-up to the Champions League qualifier against Sparta Prague here tonight.<br><br>Gallas developed a reputation as a serial moaner and a disruptive dressing-room influence during his time at Chelsea and it was one of the reasons Jose Mourinho agreed to let him join Arsenal a year ago. Wenger said: "Gallas has to be an example everywhere Â— not just on the pitch Â— and I have spoken to him about that. I don't know how he behaved at Chelsea but this year he is a very positive influence.<br><br>"I respect Gilberto a lot. He did a good job last year. We have had an eye-to-eye meeting and I told him what I wanted to tell him and that's it. "He was not in the group last week and that's why what happened happened. I've nothing more to say. I cannot justify every small decision and explain it to everybody."<br><br>Gilberto started his pre-season late after captaining Brazil in the Copa America but he was an impressive stand-in Arsenal skipper for much of last season. Mentally strong and calm, he was seen by many as the natural successor to Thierry Henry and had expected to inherit the job full time when Henry left for Barcelona.<br><br>Gallas, in contrast, grumbled his way out of Chelsea last year, often complaining publicly about being forced to play out of position and unhappy that he was not offered the contract he felt he deserved. His attitude did not appear to have changed this summer when he criticised Arsenal on his website for failing replace Henry with bigname signings.<br><br>But he admits his new role brings new demands and promised to change. "I'm aware that being club captain is not only a job on the pitch but also away from it," said 29-year-old Gallas. "I have to give a good example in everything I do and I will do that. You will see a new William Gallas this year.<br><br>Wenger will hope his controversial decision will inspire a response from Gallas similar to the one from Patrick Vieira when the captaincy helped the midfielder overcome his own disciplinary problems to mature into one of Arsenal's finest players.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The last 3 captains of Arsenal have all been frenchman... Patrick Vieira, Thierry Henry and now Gallas... Coincidence or favouritism from Wenger? Anyway who was their captain before Vieira anyone know?</span></div>
