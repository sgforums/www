              <div class="text-center padding-top-5">
              <p class="small bold"><em>WARNING ...
               Fernando Torres</em></p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">FERNANDO TORRES is ready to quit Liverpool if they don't make BIG 
              signings 
              next summer.</h2>
              <p class="article"><strong>And he did NOT rule out going to Manchester United. </strong></p>
              <p class="article">It is a devastating blow for Reds fans who fear their best player will 
              walk 
              out of the club to fulfil his ambition of winning trophies.</p>
              <p class="article">Fed-up Torres openly admitted the possibility of quitting <strong>UNLESS</strong> the 
              club can form a competitive side by signing <strong>FIVE</strong> world-class 
              players 
              in the summer.</p>
              <p class="article">Asked whether he is planning to quit Anfield if they fail to make the 
              top four 
              and a Champions League spot, Torres gave a far from appeasing response 
              for 
              the Reds faithful.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "It's too early to talk. Sincerely I believe we are going to be
               
              fourth but qualifying for the Champions League is not that important for
               me.</p>
              <p class="article">"What is really important is that the club makes a big effort and brings
               
              great players that are above the quality of the squad.</p>
              <p class="article">"We need four or five players of the highest level to compete, better 
              than the ones we have, that make all of us grit our teeth and make us 
              fight 
              for our place.</p>
              <p class="article">"Without strengthening, what's the point of finishing fourth and fight 
              once 
              again next season just to be in the top four."</p>
              <p class="article">This is the worst season the Anfield giants have had in years. Nine 
              defeats in 
              the league — the latest at Wigan on Monday — have left 
              them huffing and puffing for a Champions League spot.</p>
              <p class="article">The Reds are out of this season's Champions League, the FA Cup and the 
              Carling 
              Cup, and also crashed to a 1-0 loss at Lille in the first leg of their 
              Europa League tie on Thursday.</p>
              <p class="article">Torres made it clear that next season he wants to be in a team that is 
              challenging for honours and admitted that Liverpool currently do not 
              have a 
              team good enough to do that.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: "Next season I want to fight to win the Premier League, to win
               the 
              Champions or the Europa League but to achieve that we have to make 
              signings.</p>
              <p class="article">"There are many circumstances and a lot of things have to happen so it's
               very 
              early to talk about that but I have this one and three more years of 
              contract."</p>
              <p class="article">Even more worryingly, though, Torres left open the possibility of a move
               to 
              hated rivals Manchester United.</p>
              <p class="article">The question in Spanish newspaper AS could not be clearer. When asked if
               it is 
              as impossible to join Manchester United as it is for him to go to Real 
              Madrid as a former Atletico player, Torres replied: "No, but I have 
              left my home and it's clear that I owe a lot to Liverpool, and I am very
               
              happy here, the people have treated me as if I were from here.</p>
              <p class="article">"But I am going to think about my future and I hope it is here, I think 
              these people deserve to win. Above than thinking about me I think the 
              club 
              deserves to get back to winning ways, but even themselves right now know
               
              they are far from that."</p>
              <p class="article">He added: "The fans are worried that players might leave, that is a 
              problem 
              when you start fearing that your players will go.</p>
              <p class="article">"It's because you know the club is not going forward but I think this is
               
              not the course that the club will follow.</p>
              <p class="article">"Since the arrival of Christian Purslow, Liverpool had an important 
              injection of cash. We signed a new sponsor with a lot of money, the same
               
              level as Real Madrid, so things will move forward."</p>
              <div id="TixyyLink" style="overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;">
              <p class="article">But Torres admitted that the side's failings have left him 
              disillusioned.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "I expected this season would be fundamental for me. It seemed 
              we had 
              aspirations to win the League and in the Champions League we would be 
              the 
              same competitive team as always, fighting till the end, and of course 
              with 
              the season finishing in South Africa.</p>
              <p class="article">"It seemed it could be the best season and it's been the complete 
              opposite. 
              There have been despairing moments, of frustration, moments where 
              everything 
              went wrong and it turned around in your mind a thousand times.</p>
              <p class="article">"But you still look for positives and at this stage of the season let's 
              see if we can win the Europa League, we will try to finish fourth and 
              demand 
              that next season they make signings of a high level so we can compete."</p>
              <p class="article">And he once again left open a possible departure from Anfield, adding: 
              "I owe 
              a lot to Liverpool and I am proud to be part of its history and to 
              continue 
              to break records and within a few years, I don't know for how many clubs
               I 
              will have played but it's certain that I will be proud to have played 
              for 
              Liverpool."</p>

              <p>He joined Liverpool to improve his gameplay.</p>
              <p>Now, Liverpool have only him, stevie and reina as the pillar of the team.</p>
              <p>The rest of the team are either not motivated or being isolated by the stubborn manager.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben already bought a world class player as in Aquaman and he is rarely used cos pet Lucas need to play.</p>
              <p>So, with the purchase of world class players, Ah Ben is also clueless on how to use them.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the key of the issue is still Ah Ben who does not know how to use, motivate and buy players.</p>
              <p>Torres is being smart not to direct his attack at his manager.</p>
              <p>But, he should be leaving soon.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I don't doubt he is a good striker but I don't think he will fit in at United now cos Rooney is doing very well as the out and out striker so if he comes along, where is Rooney going to play? move to the left again? I don't think its a smart move if United go for him... Cos Roon seem to be a better header of the ball nowadays and his finishing is also improving by the season... Moreover, Roon is younger and this Torres is rather injury prone... United need a play maker more important and this Torres will blow a big hole on their budget making purchasing a quality play maker impossible...</p></div>
