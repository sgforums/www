              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Two poachers goals from Liverpool
                  striker Fernando Torres sparked joyous scenes at Anfield on
                  Sunday and television executives would have raised a glass to
                  the Spaniard for at least keeping the title race interesting.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It was only a few weeks ago that the Premier League looked
                  like being the closest run thing for years but were it not for
                  Liverpool's 2-0 defeat of Chelsea, champions Manchester United
                  would have been disappearing over the horizon.</p>
              <p>United have been busy re-writing the record books with 12
                  consecutive clean sheets in the league, a run containing a burst
                  of seven straight victories that has left the chasing pack
                  hanging on by their fingertips.</p>
              <p>There are huge question marks about the ability of United's
                  pursuers to stay in touch much longer.</p>
              <p>Liverpool, who seemed firmly on course to land a first
                  league title since 1990 a few weeks ago, are just two points
                  behind, although United have played a game less.</p>
              <p>The league table does not tell the full story, however.</p>
              <p>On December 13 Liverpool could have opened up an eight-point
                  gap on United before the champions flew off to play in FIFA's
                  World Club championship -- instead they scraped a 2-2 draw at
                  home to Hull City.</p>
              <p>A week later they drew again, with Arsenal,
                  despite the Gunners being down to 10 men.</p>
              <p>Further points have been tossed away in January, notably
                  draws with Stoke City and Wigan Athletic, and on top of that
                  manager Rafael Benitez has baffled many with his conservative
                  tactics and team selections.</p>
              <p>His pre-scripted blast at United manager Alex Ferguson,
                  possibly designed to unsettle their bitter rivals, has backfired
                  so spectacularly that a galvanised United have hunted down
                  Liverpool with glee.</p>
              <p><strong>CHALLENGE OVER</strong></p>
              <p>Chelsea slipped to third on Sunday, five points behind
                  United and the gap will grow to eight if United win their game
                  in hand. They have not beaten United, Liverpool or Arsenal this
                  season and look to have gone backwards this season.</p>
              <p>With no signings in the transfer window to speak of, they
                  are desperately lacking width, guile and goals. The free-scoring
                  days of early-season are a distant memory.</p>
              <p>Didier Drogba is a shadow of the player who has terrorised
                  Premier League defences in recent seasons while Nicolas Anelka's
                  early-season form has evaporated and Michael Ballack seems stuck
                  in second gear.</p>
              <p>Against Liverpool Chelsea managed just one attempt on goal
                  and trudged off with the look of a side knowing their title
                  challenge is as good as over.</p>
              <p>At least fourth-placed Aston Villa have performed way above
                  expectations but Martin O'Neil's side lack the depth to keep
                  pace with United and will be more concerned with making sure an
                  enterprising season is rewarded with Champions League football.</p>
              <p>Arsenal are a distant fifth, 10 points behind United and
                  even the return of injured players like Theo Walcott and Cesc
                  Fabregas would not get them back in the mix.</p>
              <p>Worryingly for those hoping that United's charge towards an
                  18th league title might slow down, they have managed to put
                  together their latest run despite an injury list that has
                  reached double figures at times.</p>
              <p>With Wayne Rooney soon to return from a hamstring injury to
                  bolster manager Alex Ferguson's formidable array of firepower,
                  the 1-0 wins that have become something of a United speciality
                  of late may be replaced by some real thumpings.</p>
