            <div class='col-md body'>ANDRIY SHEVCHENKO last night revealed he is ready to pack his bags and leave Chelsea Â— if Jose Mourinho wants him out.<br><br>The Ukraine striker has scored just three league goals since his Â£30.8million summer move to Stamford Bridge from AC Milan. Now his future in London is in doubt as the January transfer window approaches.<br><br>Shevchenko, 30, said: Â“I feel at home at Chelsea and itÂ’s felt like my team for a long time. But unfortunately my game doesnÂ’t suit Mourinho.<br><br>Â“Everyone has been writing about me being sent on loan to Milan. I still havenÂ’t discussed this question with the management Â— but the bosses themselves probably still havenÂ’t decided.<br><br>Â“But if it happens, I am ready to pack my bags. IÂ’m a completely self-confident person. Â“If I donÂ’t suit somebody then IÂ’ll go back to Italy and prove how good I can still be. Â“IÂ’m not finished as a player. On the other hand I have nothing to prove to anybody.<br><br>Â“Everybody already knows what Andriy Shevchenko is capable of.<br><br>Â“Roman Abramovich is my friend and completely on my side. But all he could do was insist on a loan deal instead of me being sold.<br><br>Â“I do understand Mourinho. I am not scoring as many as I would like to so even Abramovich isnÂ’t really putting his foot down over it, although he could do as the owner of the club.<br><br>Â“Of course I will be sorry to leave London if it comes to that. Firstly because of my family, who have already made a new life here.Â”<br><br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/shev.jpg"><br><br>Meanwhile, Chelsea midfielder Michael Ballack will be eager to put one over his German pal Jens Lehmann on Sunday. The two have shared barbecues and family outings following the German captainÂ’s move to Chelsea last summer.<br><br>But Ballack insisted: Â“I wonÂ’t be phoning Jens this week and I donÂ’t have to. Â“I know Arsenal is a special match and, even though the games come thick and fast, all the players know that some games are very special indeed.Â”<br></div>

You took the words right out of my mouth and gave us a very good example.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> That is the point i was referring to... He just try his luck even when he is not in the best of positions. He never consider the strikers who were in a better position than himself.<br><br>He may have scored in that match but that doesn't mean he can do it again right... Goals like that are probably 1 in 50 shots, in fact i think that is a once in a lifetime kind, if you get lucky it goes in for you but if you miss it, you will look at it as an almost impossible shot, but you would have wasted an opportunity to set up for your strikers and the team.<br><br>It is precisely this attitude that is what i was trying to say, even when there were others in a better position than himself, he will still go for the shot. Which is a selfish thing and the strikers will get lesser support when your attacking midfielder doesn't create for you.<br><br>We have all seen in the recent WC where lampard was taking pot-shots like nobodies business and i think he didn't even score one... if he would just pass to the strikers, and do what an attacking midfielders suppose to be doing... maybe the team would fair better.<br><br>It is no wonder why McClaren wants Paul Scholes back in the England setup... Gerrard could have done a better job too i believe.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Seen what Gerrard did for Bellamy?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And i do not think that it was right of mourinho to speak out and say which players in his teams are untouchable. As a manager, he's team morale comes first and he should rethink what he said when he quote that the nine players he has are untouchables. what sort of signals is he sending out to the reserve team who are comprised of internationals who are striving hard to break into the first 11 only to hear the manager say that.<br><br>Look at the teams of other managers, i do hear praises for their players when they perform well but i never heard of a manager implying that nine of his players are untouchable. that would not be right for both the team, players, clubs and fans.</div>
