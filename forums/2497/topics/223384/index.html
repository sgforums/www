            <div class='col-md body'>Ferguson to bring Rossi back in January<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson has branded Giuseppe Rossis loan spell at Newcastle a wasted exercise.<br><br>Rossi was allowed to join the Magpies to further his footballing education with Ferguson believing he would be a regular member of Glenn Roeders squad.<br><br>Instead, the promising 19-year-old has made just six Premiership appearances and four of those were as a late substitute.<br><br>Rossi has not been seen in league combat since completing the full 90 minutes in the home defeat to Sheffield United on November 4. And, with his own striking resources stretched to breaking point, Ferguson will call time on the Italian Under-21 stars spell in the north-east at the beginning of next month.<br><br>"Giuseppe will come back to us because he is just not getting enough football at Newcastle," said Ferguson.<br><br>"The understanding we had with them was that he would play more games. Every manager is subject to their own opinions on players, so I dont want to say too much about that. But we could have done with him here, so he might as well come back to us."<br><br>Rossi will return at a time when Henrik Larsson is about to arrive.<br><br>The legendary Swede may be 35 but most think he will have an instant impact at United, even though he has never played in England before.<br><br>Ferguson has not been put off by Larssons age, knowing the striker has kept himself in the peak of condition throughout his career.<br><br>And, it has not gone unnoticed by the United boss that Larsson is only the same age as Teddy Sheringham was when he left Old Trafford in 2001, since when the veteran forward has gone on to amass another 171 Premiership appearances for Tottenham, Portsmouth and West Ham.<br><br>"Some players look after themselves very well, so their age confuses you in terms of what you see on the football field," said Ferguson.<br><br>"I let Teddy go five years ago when he got an offer from Tottenham I told him he would be stupid to turn down. He has played for two other clubs since then, which is amazing."<br><br>Having decided to pursue no more striking options now Larssons arrival has been secured, Ferguson will instead concentrate on strengthening his midfield when the transfer window opens next month.<br><br>Another bid for Owen Hargreaves is possible, even though the England international has suffered a setback in his recovery from a broken leg.<br><br>Further Ferguson interest in the 25-year-old is not likely to be well received by Bayern Munich, who were so angry with Uniteds pursuit of the player at one stage they threatened to report the Red Devils to FIFA.<br><br>However, the Scot does not appear too worried by that.<br><br>"We are not sitting on our backsides," Ferguson said of Uniteds general transfer situation. "There could be another development."<br><br>As for Hargreaves? "I dont know what the situation is," he said.<br><br>"I have read some things about his injury but you never usually get the full story that way. Besides, I dont want to upset those poor Germans. They are very fragile."<br></div>
