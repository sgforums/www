              <h2>VALENCIA DENY VILLA TALKS</h2>
              <h2><img src="http://images.football365.com/09/06/240/david-villa_2320034.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180"></h2>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p><strong>Manuel Llorente has dismissed suggestions that Valencia are in negotiations with Barcelona over selling David Villa. </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The striker looked set to join Real Madrid earlier this summer
              but has more recently been linked with European champions Barcelona.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reports in the Spanish media on Thursday morning quoted Villa as saying he would be interested in a switch to Camp Nou.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Valencia president Llorente has now moved to reassure supporters, saying there have been no talks with Barca regarding Villa.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Valencia is not negotiating and has not negotiated with Barcelona, at all," he told <em>Europa Press</em>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Llorente does not yet know whether Barca have spoken with Villa
              and his agent, adding: "That I will find out when I meet people
              directly."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>David Silva has also attracted attention from some of the
              continent's finest clubs but Llorente is confident of keeping both the
              midfielder and Villa.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He said: "They are players who are wanted in international
              football and it is not strange that important teams want them. We are
              used to it."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Rm initially wanted to sign Villa, but for some reason, the deal was off and RM went to sign Benzema instead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I believe Barcelona has agreed a deal to buy Villa already, as Valencia is in huge debt. They have already sold Albiol to RM. next up to sell is David Silva.</p>

              <h1 class="storyTitle" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-size: 2.8em;">Real have given up on signing Villa</h1>
              <p><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/JonMC/April2009/villa-275.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="200"></p>
              <p><strong><br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Real Madrid have confirmed they have abandoned their pursuit of highly-rated Valencia striker David Villa after clinching a deal to sign Olympique Lyonnais forward Karim Benzema.</strong></p>
              <p>Benzema agreed a €35m (£29.7m) deal with the Spanish club on
              Wednesday and Madrid's director general Jorge Valdano said that his
              capture, along with that of Kaka and Cristiano Ronaldo, means they don't need another goalscorer.</p>
              <p>"Benzema fulfils the goal of having a striker, a goal scorer who brings a lot of presence and aggression to the forward
              line," Valdano said.</p>
              <p>When
              asked if the French international's arrival had put an end to their bid
              for Villa the Real chief said: "Benzema and Villa both have these [goal
              scoring] characteristics so the answer to your question is yes."</p>
              <p>Last month it appeared that Madrid were on the verge of signing Villa from cash-strapped <em>Los Che</em> but the club decided not to sell their star player at the last moment and Real later declared the deal to be "100% finished".</p>

              <p>I am very sure.</p>
              <p><strong>REASON</strong>: Valencia desperately need to sell him asap because of financial problem. This means that bidders are likely to make serious bids as late as possible during the transfer window. Time is not on Valencia's side. The later the bid, the more Valencia are prepared to give discount.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the interested clubs will start the real bidding war on the last day of the transfer window. The initial round was just to test the waters.</p>
