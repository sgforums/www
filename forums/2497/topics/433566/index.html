            <div class='col-md body'><p>Get set for a Red July<br><br>English giants Man United, Liverpool will be in town<br>by Alywin Chew <br><br>SINGAPORE - It is going to be a spectacular July for football fans in Singapore.<br><br>English Premier League champions Manchester United will be coming to town on July 6. Ten days later, it will be the turn of their great rivals Liverpool to visit the Republic.<br><br>But neither team are expected to be playing any matches here.<br><br>United's visit is part of their 12-day tour of Asia, during which they will be parading the Barclays Premier League trophy to their ardent fans in the region.<br><br>United's commercial director Richard Arnold told the club's website: "We know from the huge response from the Asian-based supporters in our 16 million Facebook followers and our commercial partners in the area just how much our Asian fans celebrated the historic 19th title win, so we wanted to make sure they could be part of that history by taking the trophy to them.<br><br>"Some of the players have taken time out of their summer holidays to say a big thank-you to those supporters and it promises to be a lot of fun."<br><br>The tour began in Hong Kong on Thursday and will end with the visit to Singapore on July 6. Sir Alex Ferguson's squad will depart the day after.<br><br>Liverpool will also be making a whirlwind stopover in Singapore. The Reds will take on a Malaysian Selection side at the National Stadium in Bukit Jalil on July 16 and leave for Singapore immediately after. According to the Liverpool website, they will have a training session "in front of invited supporters" on July 17 before flying home.<br><br>The Merseyside club decided to stop by here after their tour of Korea was cancelled. Reds manager Kenny Dalglish told the Daily Mail: "I'm looking forward to taking the team to Asia. Our last tour of Asia in 2009 was a great success and we're delighted to be returning this summer."<br><br>Liverpool last visited Singapore two years ago, thrilling their fans with a 5-0 victory over the Lions at the National Stadium on July 26, 2009.<br><br>It will be a very different outfit that will visit Singapore this time round. The likes of Xabi Alonso, Javier Mascherano and Fernando Torres have all left the club but fans will certainly look forward to catching a glimpse of January signings Luis Suarez and Andy Carroll, as well as Kop legend Dalglish.</p></div>

              <p><strong>Liverpool captain </strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/7935/Steven-Gerrard"><span style="color: #225fb2;"><strong>Steven Gerrard</strong></span></a><strong> has been ruled out of the club's pre-season tour to Asia in a bid to ensure he is fit for the start of the new Premier League season. </strong></p>
              <p>Gerrard, 31, missed the end of the 2010-11 campaign after undergoing surgery on his groin in March and will continue his rehabilitation at the Reds' Melwood training ground.</p>
              <p>The Liverpool squad fly out to the Far East this Sunday for matches in China and Malaysia, and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=182"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Kenny Dalglish</span></a> will be hoping that his captain will be closer to full fitness by the time they return eight days later.</p>
              <p>"Steven and the medical team have done fantastically well so far and they are in the final stages of getting him back to full training," Dalglish said.</p>
              <p>"I'm sure there will be supporters disappointed that Steven is unable to be with us in Asia, but I'm sure the same people will appreciate the importance of Steven giving himself the best possible opportunity of being fit to play against Sunderland on the opening day of the new campaign.</p>
              <p>"Steven continuing his rehabilitation programme at Melwood is in everybody's long-term interests."</p>
              <p>Gerrard apologiesd to those Liverpool fans in Asia who had been hoping to watch the skipper in action, but insisted that staying in England is necessary for him to be in the best shape possible to lead the Reds out for their Premier League opener againnst Sunderland on August 13.</p>
              <p>"I'd really been looking forward to travelling out to China, Malaysia and Singapore and meeting first hand as many of our fans as possible, and I'm really sorry that I won't now be able to do that," Gerrard said.</p>
              <p>"All of us at the club realise the incredible support we enjoy in these countries and how much it means to our supporters there.</p>
              <p>"But after sitting down and talking with the medical experts and technical staff, it's been decided that the best course of action is for me to continue my rehabilitation programme at Melwood.</p>
              <p>"It's disappointing I won't be with them, but I'm sure the lads who go out there will put a great show on for our fans."</p>
