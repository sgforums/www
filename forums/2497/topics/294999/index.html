            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2007/12/02/Mourinhobig3.jpg"><br><br><strong>Former Chelsea coach has prepared job blueprint<br>Terry the middle-man as Milan link is denied<br><br>Jose Mourinho has prepared a blueprint for English football success in anticipation that the Football Association will make formal contact this week for discussions over the vacant England manager's position. There have been several indirect approaches from managers and players led by the national captain, John Terry, amid a groundswell of public support for the Portuguese. Mourinho believes the approaches have been made on behalf of the FA, since Terry and others asked whether his personal contact details could be handed over to FA officials.</strong><br><br>The Portuguese declined, saying that all contact must be businesslike and directed through his agent, Jorge Mendes. The former Chelsea manager is preparing to go on a 10-day family holiday before Christmas but is beginning to miss being involved with football. If the FA wants to make its move, Mourinho is keen to hold discussions before the year is out. Mourinho's blueprint includes restarting the building of the National Football Centre at Burton, the creation of an organisation based on club structures and a full-time medical department unconnected with any Premier League team.<br><br>Although he has made no decisions about whether he would accept a job offer, Mourinho has certainly not ruled out becoming Steve McClaren's successor. That is in contrast with a report in one national newspaper yesterday, which declared that he was preparing to "defect" to Milan after being offered the job of managing the European champions.<br><br>The article suggested Mourinho is using the FA's putative interest as leverage to land a position at a top club in Spain or Italy. However Mourinho, who won the Champions League with Porto before lifting the Premier League trophy in successive seasons with Chelsea, has been angered by the report and was keen to send that message to the FA yesterday.<br><br>"These are lies; Jose is not waiting for an approach from these clubs," said Mourinho's media consultant, Eladio Parames. "Jose has had no approach from any club and no one has contacted Jorge [Mendes]. If there is an approach from the FA, Jose will decide."<br><br>Whether he would find any offer from the FA acceptable would depend on how Soho Square officials react to his vision for England's future. Unlike other foreign candidates, such as Fabio Capello and Guus Hiddink, Mourinho has intimate knowledge of the English game and has received intelligence on the workings of the international team from the England players at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>That has prompted him to formulate an outline of the reforms he believes would be required for England to have a chance of winning a first trophy in 44 years at the World Cup in South Africa in 2010. He would be excited at the opportunity to work with English players, having derived huge enjoyment from his involvement in the Premier League. His family have also enjoyed their stay in London and he would be keen to keep that lifestyle.<br><br>A friend of Mourinho said yesterday: "In my opinion if they want him - and I believe they do because there's a lot of pressure from the players and people in general in England - and if they accept his plans, I think he could be England's next boss."<br><br>Mourinho does, though, have some doubts about the role and would want to work these through with the FA. Like Hiddink he would be wary of the tabloid scrutiny into his private life that McClaren's predecessor, Sven-Goran Eriksson, had to endure.<br><br>Those close to Mourinho have sympathy for the position of the Football Association's chief executive, Brian Barwick, who has come under considerable pressure to appoint the Portuguese. Indeed, the FA also found yesterday's reports about Mourinho's supposed readiness to accept an alternative offer unhelpful.<br><br>One Soho Square source was keen to stress that no one at the FA had ever sought to give the impression that the organisation is wary of Mourinho and added that Mourinho had never given any indication that he would rule himself out of the running for the job.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Rival contenders</span><br><br>Fabio Capello</strong><br><br>Reported to be 'on course to land the job' in one Sunday tabloid, with Gianfranco Zola lined up as his assistant, after six of the eight managers consulted by the Football Association backed his appointment.<br><br>Odds 5-2<br><br><strong>Martin O'Neill</strong><br><br>What more can he do to distance himself? The Aston Villa manager has repeatedly ruled himself out of the running to succeed Steve McClaren. But his legendary indecisiveness is still worrying the bookmakers.<br><br>Odds 7-1<br><br><strong>JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann</strong><br><br>The former Tottenham striker, now based in California, proved a success when in charge of Germany at last year's World Cup, but the circumstances of that achievement have led to doubts.<br><br>Odds 16-1<br><br><strong>Alan Shearer</strong><br><br>The former England striker is believed to be keen on taking the Newcastle job should Sam Allardyce be sacked - if he takes either job it would test that famed temperament.<br><br>Odds 20-1<br><br><strong>Luis Felipe Scolari</strong><br><br>Odds 20-1<br><br>Harry Redknapp, Rafael BenÃ­tez, Marcelo Lippi, Louis van Gaal, Steve Coppell, GÃ©rard Houllier<br><br>Odds 25-1 Odds by Betfred<br><br></div>
