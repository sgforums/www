United have dropped only 15 points all season but Terry is sure that they will slip up between now and the end of the season. </strong><br><br>Chelsea are currently six points behind the leaders and that gap could increase to 12 points by the time the Blues play again. "Manchester United have been different class this year and fair play to them for that," said Terry. "They're playing very well and their key players are all at the top of their form.<br><br>"But they haven't been under pressure like this for a few years and it's written in the rules that people are going to drop points sooner or later. "Last season we dropped a few points and they closed the gap a bit towards the end and we're hoping for the same thing this time.<br><br>"This is where we really kick in. We're turning the corner into the home straight and it's just the two of us now battling it out. "They keep winning, but we're putting the pressure on them and sooner or later they're going to drop points.<br><br>"We need to worry about ourselves. There's no point worrying what United are doing and then dropping points ourselves. "They've got some tough fixtures coming up, so we need to keep winning our games and get as many points on the board as possible."<br><br>Chelsea have won four of their last five Premiership games, conceding just two goals in the process.<br><br></div>

The Blues boss refuses to accept United are favourites to win the Premiership, despite them having a six-point lead over the reigning champs.<br><br>Mourinho said: Â“The character I wanted to bring to Chelsea was that of a winner. Â“I wanted people to look at Chelsea and say Â‘They are the best, they win thingsÂ’. So far we have done well, so far we have been the best.<br><br>Â“Credit to Manchester United, they are doing it too this season. Â“When they play well they win. And when they have problems in a game, like at Middlesbrough or Tottenham, they get a penalty and they change the game.<br><br>Â“We are in a battle. We cannot afford to lose and neither can they. We are enjoying it and to go on enjoying it we must keep on winning. ItÂ’s a simple philosophy.Â”<br><br>Meanwhile, Stamford Bridge midfielder Lassana Diarra has made his peace with Mourinho after an FA Cup dressing-room bust-up. The Frenchman, 21, was fined Â£60,000 by his boss last month after turning up late for the game with Macclesfield.<br><br>Diarra wanted to join Paris St Germain on loan for the rest of the season. But Mourinho blocked the transfer-window move in protest at the lack of funds available for new signings. Diarra said: Â“We had a long discussion and both made our point.<br><br></div>
