              <p><br>Keane was not bought by Rafa leh...Rafa wanted to buy Barry but Rick Parry bought Keane instead. There was power struggle going on there. Parry was trying to show who is in charge but too bad the victim was Keane.</p>

              <p><br>Keane was not bought by Rafa leh...Rafa wanted to buy Barry but Rick Parry bought Keane instead. There was power struggle going on there. Parry was trying to show who is in charge but too bad the victim was Keane.</p>

              <p><br>I don't belief Rafa didn't want Keane at the start... Rafa wanted both players... At the beginning, I don't think he had any preference... He wanted a striker and a midfielder. But he needed a strike partner for Torres more important than another midfielder...</p>
              <p>If we can remember how much trouble Pool took to get Keane? Spurs Levy threaten to report Liverpool to the Premier League for tapping up Keane remember after reported comments made by Rafa... If he really didn't wanted him himself, he could have let this transfer drop instead he went on for almost 2 months...</p>
              <p>Parry had already got him Mascherano, they also got Lucas, Damien Plessis, Benayoun, Babel all in midfield... All purchased by Rafa's but later didn't used them much just like with Keane.</p>
              <p>I don't think Keane was mainly Parry choice, he bought him as it was the right thing at that time as after Torres, Pool had no one except David N'Gon as a 2nd striker...</p>
              <p>I feel Rafa is not being honest and was playing politic with Parry by pushing the blame onto Parry... Coming out later to say Barry was 1st choice... was like pushing the blame to Parry for signing Keane... Spurs Levy threaten to report Liverpool to the Premier League for tapping up cos of comments made by Rafa not Parry.</p>
              <p>Villa was very determine not to sell Barry or cheaply... So Parry got the next best thing for him... Keane is still a quality player... And they needed a 2nd striker too. Rafa just didn't know how to utilize him only... Is Keane any worse than Kuyt?</p>
              <p>Its not that Rafa didn't got anything... Albert Riera signed at $8m to replace their missed out on Barry... I don't think anyone could belief Riera was also Parry's choice right?</p>
              <p>Anyway, if we think about it... The condition of Barry's arrival was if Liverpool could sell Alonso... Liverpool were touting Alonso around at the beginning of the season but there was no takers as Rafa didn't got the price he valued Alonso... Rumour that Wenger or Juve would take at $12m but Rafa wanted $18m. So who is to blame? He didn't want to let Alonso go cheap yet expect Villa to sell Barry cheaply to them?</p>
              <p>Now that Rafa takes over the transfer dealing fully (as if he wasn't involve previously)... I belief he could mess it up even more with expensive flops this time... Only next time he won't have a scapegoat like Parry to blame.</p>
