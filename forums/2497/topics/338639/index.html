              <h1>Kaka tempted by Manchester City's interest</h1>
              <h2 id="stand-first">• 'I'm very happy they want to take me' says playmaker<br>• Premier League still an ambition for Brazilian</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2008/07/06/ADennisAFP.jpg" alt="Chelsea target Kaka" width="460" height="276"></p>
              <p><em>Kaka says he would like a move to the Premier League one day.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Milan</strong></span><strong> playmaker Kaka has said he is "very happy" that </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Manchester City</strong></span><strong> are interested in him, and has been speaking to his Brazilian compatriots Elano and Robinho about life at Eastlands.</strong></p>
              <p>Kaka, speaking ahead of tonight's <span style="color: #005689;">Uefa Cup</span> match at <span style="color: #005689;">Portsmouth</span>, said: "I've been speaking with Robinho and Elano sometimes about Manchester City, but I don't know. I'm very happy that they want to take me from Milan, but I think it is very difficult."</p>
              <p>He added that it would be "great" to play in the <span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span> at some point. "It is a very tough championship with a lot of big players and a lot of big teams. I think it is the best championship in the world so one day maybe, I don't know when, but it would be great to play in the Premier League. I have a lot of friends that are playing there, so I'm watching some games."</p>
              <p>The 2007 Ballon d'Or winner has been consistently linked with a move to England. Initially Chelsea were favourites to sign him, but since the Abu Dhabi group's takeover at Eastlands, City have emerged as contenders too. The arrival of Robinho from Real Madrid for a British transfer record fee during the summer has heightened speculation that other big names are set to follow.</p>
              <p>The Brazil international, who joined Milan from Sao Paulo in 2003, has a contract with the Rossoneri until February 2013. In the past, when linked to clubs such as Real Madrid, Kaka has spoken of his gratitude towards the Italian club for bringing him to Europe as a 21-year-old and has admitted he would find it hard to leave.</p>
              <p>However, he revealed that he would consider a move elsewhere if circumstances changed. "One day if I have to leave AC Milan it will be because my objectives, my targets, are not the same as AC Milan's targets," he said. "Maybe then it will be time to leave AC Milan. Now I think we are on the same road, so it is very difficult to leave, but I don't know."</p>

              <p>Maybe after 30 years old. Then I believe Kaka will leave for Manchester City.</p>
