            <div class='col-md body'>MEGA-WEALTHY Sheikh Mohammed swept all before him with his amazing Godolphin racing stable.<br><br>Now he is going head-to-head with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich in the greatest race of all Â— to dominate world football. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum is one of the worldÂ’s richest men and the power behind the group involved in Liverpool Â£450million takeover talks. He also:<br><br><span style="color: green;">Has a personal fortune of Â£7billion.<br>Pockets up to Â£1bn on his investments.<br>Has the backing of the United Arab Emirates, where he is the Prime Minister.<br>Red Rom now has a fight on his hands in making Chelsea the worldÂ’s most feared club.</span><br><br>Philip Beresford, the financial analyst who compiles the famous Sunday Times rich list, said: Â“ItÂ’s Arab oil money v Russian oil money. Â“If the Maktoums do for Liverpool what they have done for horse racing, then Liverpool will shoot up the Premiership table. Â“They will also challenge Chelsea for every big-name signing.Â”<br><br>Sheikh Mo, 57, became ruler of Dubai and Prime Minister of the UAE in January on the death of his elder brother. He has two wives and 16 children.<br><br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/2rom.jpg"></div>

Sheikh Mo has won virtually every major Flat race and also sponsors the worldÂ’s richest race, the Dubai World Cup. But he is also a huge camel racing enthusiast.<br><br>In September, he removed all the child jockeys from the UAE after being hit with a lawsuit in the USA accusing him and his brother of the enslavement of 30,000 children.<br><br>His Dubai International Capital Group (DIC) has paid Â£800m to buy the Tussauds entertainment empire and a further Â£675m in August this year for the Travelodge hotel chain. They are also major stakeholders in the Daimler-Chrysler car group and are currently constructing the tallest building in the world in Dubai. So the Â£450m needed for a Liverpool buy-out will be loose change for the oil-rich DIC.<br><br>The Â£450m package would include Â£170m to take controlling interest of the club from the Moores family, Â£80m to cover existing debts and Â£200m towards a new 60,000-seat stadium in Stanley Park.<br><br>And the SheikhÂ’s fortune would give Reds boss Rafa Benitez unlimited spending power in the transfer market. The company sees a Liverpool takeover as the ideal way of putting DubaiÂ’s name on the sporting map. It would also boost Sheikh MoÂ’s ambitions of hosting the World Cup and Olympics in the UAE.<br><br>Â“They have shown a full understanding and respect for the clubÂ’s values and heritage. Â“DIC share our passion for success and in investing in the businesses it acquires. This is very important in terms of the proposed new stadium.<br></div>
