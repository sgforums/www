              <p><strong>LONDON - Holders Manchester United soothed a painful old wound
              for Alex Ferguson by knocking Inter Milan out of the Champions League
              on Wednesday, as Barcelona mauled Olympique Lyon 5-2 in a thrilling
              return to form.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Arsenal </strong>made
              it four English teams in the quarter-finals for the second successive
              year, their youngsters showing great composure to see them home 7-6 on
              penalties away to <strong>AS Roma</strong>.</p>
              <p>The Stadio Olimpico in Rome
              will be the stage for the final in May and few would bet against at
              least one English team being back there to play in it.</p>
              <p>United and Arsenal joined
              Liverpool and Chelsea, who scored contrasting wins on Tuesday, when
              Bayern Munich and Villarreal also came through.</p>
              <p>If Tuesday's games were marked by wrecking-ball performances from <strong>Liverpool</strong>, who stunned <strong>Real Madrid </strong>4-0, and <strong>Bayern</strong>, who beat <strong>Sporting </strong>7-1 to notch up a record 12-1 aggregate victory, Wednesday's ties provided much more subtlety and tension.</p>
              <p><strong>United </strong>beat <strong>Inter Milan </strong>2-0 at Old Trafford thanks to headers early in each half from Nemanja Vidic and Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>The result gave United a record
              of 21 matches unbeaten in major European competitions and made it a
              satisfying night for Ferguson against his old nemesis Jose Mourinho.</p>
              <p>Five years ago Mourinho danced
              up the Old Trafford touchline after his Porto team pulled off a shock
              victory on their way to winning the 2004 Champions League.</p>
              <p>Mourinho continued to get the
              better of Ferguson on a regular basis after taking over at Chelsea and
              there were times on Wednesday when it looked like being a familiar
              story.</p>
              <p><strong>NO DANCING</strong></p>
              <p>Vidic's early goal still left
              Inter needing just one goal to edge ahead and they very nearly got it,
              with Dejan Stankovic twice going close and Zlatan Ibrahimovic heading
              against the bar.</p>
              <p>Inter continued to look the
              better side at the start of the second half before the deftest of chips
              from England striker Wayne Rooney set up Ronaldo to settle the tie.</p>
              <p>"My team was fantastic but they were not lucky," Mourinho said.</p>
              <p><strong>Barcelona </strong>led <strong>Lyon </strong>4-0
              at the Nou Camp after Thierry Henry had struck twice and Lionel Messi
              and Samuel Eto'o joined in the fun, before conceding two quick goals
              either side of halftime to the French side.</p>
              <p>The Catalans were flirting with
              disaster but they gradually regained their composure and a late strike
              from Seydou Keita rounded off a 6-3 aggregate win.</p>
              <p>"We had a little fright when they scored their second but we managed to plug the gaps," said Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola.</p>
              <p><strong>Arsenal </strong>held a 1-0 lead from the first leg against <strong>Roma </strong>but
              that was soon cancelled out by Juan, who had time to pick his spot
              after the visiting defence had inexplicably left him unmarked in the
              area.</p>
              <p>Eduardo's first penalty for
              Arsenal was saved but a weak effort from Mirko Vucinic levelled things
              up and the shootout went on, with inexperienced players like Theo
              Walcott and Denilson scoring before Max Tonetto blasted over the bar to
              dash Roma hopes of playing in a home final.</p>
              <p>The quarter-final line-up was completed by <strong>Porto</strong>, who squeezed through on the away goals rule after a 0-0 draw at home to <strong>Atletico Madrid</strong>.</p>
