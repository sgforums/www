It's ok I will explain a little bit here. Like I have said, after some thoughts, I was harsh on that statement. What I feel is, what will happen next. Will the FT stay here and help the locals to grow as better footballers? I'm afraid that (just afraid) after their football careers are over, they will leave here and forget about  helping in the football here. Is the FAS's plan on getting this batch of "established" FT to help in the future of our football (helping the youths I mean)? If yes, that's great. I would be the first one to admit that my thoughts initially are wrong.<br><br>If the plan is to continue giving citizenships to "established" FT footballers as the solution to bring up our standard of football, then no thanks. I don't want 11 "established then given citizenships" footballers starting all our International games. I will never accept and support the team, even if I get bashed or whatever. I want to support Singapore National Team, not Singapore Football Club.</div>

"Raddy has done well for Singapore and has helped us remain champions of South-east Asia for the second consecutive tournament," the body's president told Singapore's Today tabloid.<br><br>"We have something good going and we will have to do what it takes to keep him in Singapore."Ho fully endorsed Avramovich's policy of pushing his team to challenge ever stronger opposition.<br><br>"Raddy has always said Â… they have to be exposed to top level games. He was right. The experience of playing top teams like Iraq and China and going to the Asian Games in Doha (has) helped the boys.<br><br>"It gave them the belief that they would prevail and instilled in them a never-say-die attitude."<br></div>
