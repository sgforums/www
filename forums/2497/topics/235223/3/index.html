He made an error against Malaysia. While for strikers, you can miss 100 times, but if you score in important games, then you are a hero defintely.<br><br>Conclusion is that for GK, people remember 1 clear mistake more than 100 saves. For strikers, people remember a Cup Final winner more than 100 missed sitters. That's the difference.<br><br>For me, I would give to Lionel Lewis as well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by RvnRooRon84:</div><div class="quote_body">I honestly feel that the Lions truly didn't play their best tonight. Mistakes, poor clearence, delaying with the ball, lack of communication with one another...<br><br>Perhaps its the overbearing atmosphere away from home; all I can commend on is that final strike which is pure brilliance (or pure luck).  </div></blockquote>I think it's rather clear even before the match started that the Lions were the underdogs to begin with.<br><br>The Thais were going all out to take the fight to the Lions, and certainly caught the off balance as they were pure pwnage for most of the 1 half. They had every reason and motivation to equalize and I suppose the Lions just weren't ready for that kind of elephant onslaught and were put on the defensive for most of the match. Certainly something that can be improved.<br><br>However if you look at it in another way, somehow the (at times jury-rigged) defence managed to hold together against a regional powerhouse and fend them off long enough for us to sneak in the shot that mattered. I attribute the holding of the shaky defence in both parts individual brillance on the Lion's part to not rout under pressure, the poor finishing of the thais who could bring the fight up, but just lack the edge of skill to convert their chances, and often pure dumb luck that had our boys defend on the line at one instance.<br><br>In the end the Thais played brilliant football, but were hampered by their lack of a polished finish, and their own extremely offensive way of taking the fight to the lion's half proved to be their undoing as the fortunes of the game turned for just an moment, enough for the Lions to make their better finishing then the Thais count. The Thais just aren't used to getting balls netted against them and I suppose it proved to a flaw in what is their otherwise superior style.<br><br>So all in all a brilliant match, the Lions could still be improved but they did go up against a traditionally superior foe and proved that they can (shakily) hold their ground and even win the day. All things considered fair and the refs are error-free, even if the Thais had not gotten that penalty slapped on them we still would have won given we netted the ball more times then them.<br><br>So in conclusion there is ample reason to celebrate, but of course we should expect a better team the next time round!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Great strategy, soak up attacks and conserve energy in first half, ATTACK in 2nd half...<br><br>But kinda risky, sekali Thais up 3 goals in 1st half...<br><br>All in all, ROAR LIONS ROAR! Welldone!</div>
