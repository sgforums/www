            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><strong><span class="large">Singapore's penalty villain surprised by decision</span><br>By Ossian Shine</strong></span><br><br>SINGAPORE, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The Singaporean player who was awarded the penalty that sparked a bitter Thai protest in the ASEAN championships final on Wednesday has admitted he was as surprised as anyone when the referee pointed to the spot. "I was stunned, I did not expect a penalty," striker Noh Alam Shah said as the ramifications of Wednesday's antics continued to unfold.<br><br>Petulant scenes marred the first leg at Singapore's National Stadium as the Thai team stormed off the pitch after Alam Shah was adjudged to have been fouled in the penalty area when he collided with defender Niweat Siriwong and the pair fell to the ground in the 82nd minute.<br><br>Malaysian referee C. Ravichandran had no hesitation in pointing to the spot and flashing a yellow card at Niweat, whose team mates remonstrated with officials and rowed bitterly for 15 minutes before being persuaded to continue the match.<br><br>Alam Shah had initially thought the outcome would be very different, however. "When I first saw the referee walking towards me, I thought he was going to book me (for play-acting),  the striker told the Straits Times. When the incensed Thai players returned to the field, Mustafic Fahrudin fired the penalty high into the roof of the net to give Singapore a 2-1 aggregate lead going into Sunday's return match.<br><br><strong>SINGAPORE SURPRISE</strong><br><br>Alam Shah's team mates were equally surprised. Shahril Ishak was standing near Alam Shah when he fell, and said: "I was preparing to go back to my own half as I thought a freekick would be given to the Thais."<br><br>Defender Precious Emuejeraye agreed. "I thought the referee was going to book Alam Shah for a foul," he said. "I was surprised when he pointed to the spot instead."<br><br>The incident boiled over amid growing bad blood between the two countries following last year's takeover by Singapore state investment arm Temasek of telecoms firm Shin Corp, founded by ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Temasek's $3.8 billion acquisition of Shin Corp added fuel to anti-Thaksin street protests that led to his removal in a bloodless military coup on Sept. 19. A spat erupted two weeks ago when Bangkok summoned the Singaporean ambassador to protest a meeting between Thaksin and one of the city-state's senior cabinet ministers.<br><br>Bangkok police have said tight security arrangements were being made to prevent angry scenes at Sunday's match although many Singaporeans have already cancelled their travel plans.<br></div>

The second leg will be played at Bangkok's Supachalasai Stadium.<br><br>Speaking to reporters at the five-day Asean Tourism Forum here, he said: "You never know when something could be started. So, let us lean more on the cautious side than on the complacent side.<br><br>"We will do our best to ensure safety ... but I cannot say please come cheer for your side because I really don't know what's going to happen."<br><br>The minister said that the Thai football players and their fans were angry because the team was booed during the match.<br><br>"The players resented the fact that when the game ended, they were booed. When they got hurt, carried out on a stretcher, they were booed. This is something not done in this part of the world," he said, adding that this could fuel more tension during Sunday's match.<br><br>Wednesday's match ended in controversy after the Malaysian referee awarded the Lions a penalty in the 82nd minute, which the Thai players furiously disputed.<br><br>They threatened to abandon the match, stalling the game for 15 minutes before Mustafic Fahruddin converted the penalty to give Singapore its first competitive win over Thailand since 1977.<br><br>Some Singaporean fans are in two minds now about travelling to Bangkok to catch the final, said 73-year-old William Lee, who is trying to organise a group trip.<br><br>"What was written in the papers has frightened a lot of people ... I've been organising such trips for a long time, but this is the first time I've seen football fans being scared off," Mr Lee said.<br><br>Meanwhile, Mr John Koh, the general secretary of the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) advised Singapore fans to move around in groups. "I don't think things will get out of hand ... but for those Singaporean fans going up, our advice is to be a little bit more cautious. In the stadium, they will have to group together," he told 938Live.<br><br>For those still raring to go, some 2,000 grandstand tickets, priced at $14 each, will go on sale today from 1pm to 7pm at FAS' office in Jalan Besar Stadium. - TODAY/st</blockquote><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/256188/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/256188/1/.html</a><br><br>The second leg's attracting me for the wrong reasons.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Not for the football for what may happen.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Before  I place my bets can anyone tell me if any of the Thai players be suspended in this game?Because by right they should be for man handling the referee but by left I think everyone might act blurr over this.This coming match reminded me of another sport.The fight between Mike Tyson &amp; Evander Holyfield (after Tyson ate part of Holyfields ear).Thais will be strong and aggressive at home hoping for an early goal and a knockout blow.They will throw everything they have in the first half in search of that equaliser and perhaps even the winning strike.SIngapore need to absorb the body blows and keep jabbing at the same time keeping those long high balls coming to frustrate the thais.If nothing should happen in the first half the Thais (knowing what they are made of now)would start to get desperate and then eventually press the panic button as the clock starts to run out.From what I heard they are quite accurate in their freekicks not to mention their speed and stamina too can overwhelm any defence at this level.<br>SIngapore needs to win at any cost to remain the undisputed champion of ASEAN even if it means hitting below the belt once again.....I am refering to the Noh Shah Alam fakie but I still think its going to be a dramatic draw to the end.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WTF is up with all the prediction?<br><br>I think thais are feeling very fired up and will win this game by 1 or 2 goals. If goes down to penalty, thais will also beat singapore in shootout.<br><br>But then again ASEAN may award singapore 3 free goals due to thai's unprofessionalism and poor sportsmanship.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since we are all cho bo lan in this topic....might as well discuss the circumstances and score of the coming game.I will be meeting some people tomorrow who die die think Singapore will win tomorrow and they know that I will put my money on Thailand and besides I dont even have to give any handicap...how good deal of not?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  but then again do not write off the National team lah.4 million people shouted KNNBCCB in unison when the Thais scored but in the end also Singapore won 2-1 rite! .Many might say that the ball is round but for Asean soccer I must say it is still out of shape!</div>
