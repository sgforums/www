              <p><strong>NEW
              YORK - David Beckham says he expects to find another half-year loan
              deal ahead of the World Cup next year to keep himself in England
              manager Fabio Capello's plans for the tournament in South Africa.</strong></p>
              <p>Beckham spent the Major League
              Soccer (MLS) off-season - and the first part of this current season -
              on loan at AC Milan in Italy and said he hoped to find a similar
              arrangement next year.</p>
              <p>"Leading up to the World Cup,
              the England manager has made it very clear to me that I need to be
              playing at a European level," Beckham told reporters ahead of his
              return match for LA Galaxy against rivals New York Red Bulls.</p>
              <p>"So I will do everything
              possible... I'll always regret it if I didn't do everything and to give
              myself a chance to be involved in that.</p>
              <p>"At the moment my priority is
              the rest of the season and also playing and keeping in every squad for
              England and representing my country... Going forward of course I want
              to be involved in the World Cup, I've not hidden that fact."</p>
              <p>Beckham's extended loan with
              Milan upset many at the Galaxy, with resentment spilling over into a
              public spat with team-mate Landon Donovan who questioned his commitment
              to the team.</p>
              <p>The pair have said their
              differences are water under the bridge, but the prospect of Beckham not
              starting next season with the team he is contracted to is unlikely to
              win over sceptical fans.</p>
              <p><strong>COACH UNCONCERNED</strong></p>
              <p>Galaxy coach Bruce Arena, however, said he was unconcerned about any disruption that might be caused by Beckham's movements.</p>
              <p>"I think having David Beckham
              on our team is just a fabulous asset. It was a little bit awkward, the
              loan process, but fully within the conditions of his contract. And we
              were fully in agreement with it and signed off on it. We knew the pros
              and cons attributed with David leaving on loan," he said.</p>
              <p>"I've had a great 30 years
              coaching. This is a high point. Not a low point. It's fabulous to have
              a player of this calibre on our squad. I look forward to working with
              David the remainder of the season."</p>
              <p>Beckham, who previously stated
              he would like another stint with Milan, said re-joining the Serie A
              club would by no means lead to a place in the World Cup squad, were
              England to qualify.</p>
              <p>"At the moment all I'm
              concentrating on is being part of this team (L.A) and being successful
              with this team. Once the season is over, then I will decide and decide
              what I do from then on."</p>
              <p>Beckham said a six-month deal
              was necessary to be in top shape for selection, rather than a shorter
              January-to-March deal that would fit in the MLS off-season.</p>
              <p>"I think it would have to be
              (six months), obviously, leading up to the World Cup. But with the last
              loan, it worked out pretty well," he said.</p>
              <p>"I'm not going to sit here and say it was ideal and it was perfect, because at the end of the day it was great for myself."</p>
