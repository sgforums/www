              <p><em>Chelsea manager says goals should not decide outcome<br></em></p>
              <p><strong>Avram Grant said last night that Chelsea have been playing "the best football" over the Premier League run-in, though he conceded also that his side could end up losing the title on goal difference with the Israeli, albeit optimistically, suggesting the trophy should be decided in a play-off match if the top two finish level on points.</strong></p>
              <p>Chelsea host Bolton Wanderers tomorrow conscious that Manchester United must drop points at Wigan if the London club are to stand any realistic chance of regaining the title given that they begin the day with a goal difference 17 worse than that of the league leaders. Grant has long been aware that such a gulf was effectively unbridgeable and insisted that a winner-takes-all play-off, a system used in Italy until two years ago, would be a fairer way of determining the champions.</p>
              <p>"Of course I have an interest in saying this now but I liked the system in Italy," said Grant. "They played a play-off match if they were level and the title was decided like that. It is a better way, so ask the Premier League to change to this.</p>
              <p>I remember after the game against Derby County, which we won 6-1, saying to one of my players that I was disappointed because I wanted us to score more goals. He said: 'Why do you say that? We've scored six.' But I said it might be important at the end of the season. He came up to me last week and said: 'How did you know?'"</p>
              <p>Grant, much maligned not least at times by the home supporters at Stamford Bridge, can justifiably survey the campaign with satisfaction and, having promised a more attack-minded approach upon taking up the reins last September, can even point to more entertaining displays in recent weeks.</p>
              <p>"The doubts people had at the beginning were very reasonable but even a big coach has to be judged by his results. That's how I want people to judge me and I think those results have been good.</p>
              <p>People called it 'boring Chelsea' before but I don't think this team played boring football over the last three years. Our first priority when I took over was to make history by reaching the final of the Champions League. But now we are here in the Premiership, we want to win this too.</p>
              <p>"We will know from the reaction of the fans what is happening at Wigan. Everybody will be watching that game - it's more interesting, it's in the spotlight. The pitch will be ready, Wigan will be ready, everything will be ready. They've fought hard at home and have not lost there this year, drawing with Arsenal and fighting to the last moment here against us. So let's see what happens."</p>

              <p>I wonder where have Nicolas Anelka disappeared to in front of goal.</p>
              <p>And Didier Drogba is nowhere as consistent as last year.</p>
              <p>Not to mention a certain Andriy, who is as good as not being in Chelsea.  </p>
              <p>All these add up to Chelsea not quite scoring 'enough' goals this season.</p>

              <p>HAHAHAHAHA!!! As usual when things gets tough for chelsea they will say
              funny stuffs. Grant can't complain coz all season Chelsea played a very
              very boring football compared to Man U. Can someone remind me how much
              did Sheva costs Chelsea? To have a play-off is quite a stupid idea. If
              that happens we might not see clubs play attacking football. EPL might
              become Serie A. I don't know why Chelsea can't score goals like soon-to be champs when they bought guys like Sheva, Droba and Anelka.</p>
