              <p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Roberto Mancini backed his record signing Sergio Aguero to get even better after the Argentina striker scored twice on a sensational debut for Manchester City. </span></strong></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Aguero, a £38million buy from Atletico Madrid this summer, struck eight minutes after coming on as a substitute and added a stunning 30-yard strike in added time as City hammered newly promoted Swansea at the Etihad Stadium. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The 23-year-old, who also set up the third goal for David Silva, has been rested by Mancini after appearing for Argentina in the Copa America this summer, and the City boss believes his best is yet to come. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>‘It was the perfect start,’ said Mancini. ‘But he’s only worked with the team for the past 10 days and he needs another two or three weeks training with us to be 100 per cent. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>‘He’s not tired but he needs to recover because he only finished the Copa America three weeks ago. He will improve. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>‘His performance didn’t surprise me because I know Aguero very well. He’s scored a lot of goals in Spain and Argentina. He’s a fantastic striker. He and Silva play the same language. They’re both fantastic players.’</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Edin Dzeko scored City’s other goal but Swansea boss Brendan Rodgers was also full of praise for City’s new signing. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>‘It was a wonderful cameo,’ said Rodgers. ‘He’s a world-class player and his strength and power were superb. His two goals showed what he’s about with his desire to get in the box and his strike was wonderful quality.’</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>City goalkeeper Joe Hart added: ‘He’s decent isn’t he! I’ve not seen that much of him because the manager has kept him quite well protected, but he’s come in at £38m, which is a big price tag, but it looks like £38m well spent.’</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Mancini said that unsettled striker Carlos Tevez might yet stay at City to play alongside his compatriot Aguero after chief executive Garry Cook had earlier given a similar indication.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Tevez was not at the Etihad Stadium to see his team-mates start the season with a resounding win despite returning to training at the start of last week. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But Cook, who refused to be drawn on the progress of City’s pursuit of Arsenal’s Samir Nasri, said: ‘Carlos is still a Manchester City player and to see him playing alongside Aguero is going to be pretty exciting for all the City fans.’ </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Asked if Tevez will stay beyond the August 31 transfer deadline, Cook added: ‘I’ve not spoken to anybody about anything that will dispel that notion.’</span></p>
