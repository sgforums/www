            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Wigan 0-0 Aston Villa: Sorensen thwarts Latics</strong><br><br>Wigan were involved in their first goalless Premiership match at the 50th time of asking as they fought out a stalemate against Aston Villa.<br><br>The last time the Latics were involved in a scoreless league encounter was in April 2005, against QPR in the Championship.<br><br>A point ended a run of four successive wins for manager Paul Jewell's side, while Villa are fast becoming the away draw specialists, with this their fifth in seven games on the road.<br><br>Prior to this game the two sides had each only failed to score in one previous Premiership game. p&gt;Â• Managers happy to share spoils<br><br>It was perhaps inevitable this encounter would finish scoreless, and though the woodwork was rattled twice, that was as close as either side came to clinching the three points.<br><br>It all began so brightly as well, with Wigan almost living up to their new-found reputation as the fastest starters in the Premiership.<br><br>A quarter of all Wigan's goals ahead of this match - four of 16 - had arrived in the opening five minutes, and on this occasion they were nearly ahead after 48 seconds.<br><br>Henri Camara provided a perfect far-post cross from the right wing for Lee McCulloch, in attack with record signing Emile Heskey out due to a persistent calf injury.<br><br>McCulloch's angled header from inside the six-yard box was parried by Thomas Sorensen, with the Scotland international only able to spoon his attempt to latch onto the rebound into the air.<br><br>It signalled a dominant first 30 minutes from Wigan as the closing 15 petered out to what proved a welcome interval.<br><br>Before that, Paul Scharner curled a 20-yard right-footed shot a yard wide in the third minute as the Latics put Villa's defence under intense pressure.<br><br>The visiting rearguard, a significantly tighter unit this season under O'Neill, were forced to weather the storm of a barrage of crosses from both flanks.<br><br>But much was wasteful, with Jewell's side failing to take full advantage of the supremacy they were enjoying.<br><br>Due of that, Villa were forced to rely on counter-attacks, with their chances few and far between, although they ironically came closest to breaking the deadlock in the first half in the 13th minute.<br><br>After the Latics failed to clear their lines, the ball fell to Peter Whittingham for a first-time 20-yard shot that clipped the outside of the right-hand post.<br><br>McCulloch then snapped a right-foot effort wide from the edge of the area soon after, while Scharner looped a header over the bar from six yards in the 20th minute.<br><br>McCulloch was again unfortunate a few minutes later, heading over from eight yards after Gary Teale had supplied the cross courtesy of fine approach play from skipper Arjan de Zeeuw and Camara.<br><br>Wigan were flying at that stage, but in being denied a certain free-kick on the right wing in the 32nd minute when Wilfred Bouma fouled Teale, it led to a breakaway that almost proved costly.<br><br>Captain Gareth Barry, recovered from a back strain, and Juan Pablo Angel combined to play in Chris Sutton, but his curling 20-yard effort cleared the angle of bar and post.<br><br>At least, after the respite at the end of the first period, the start to the second was all action as both sides had chances to get on the scoresheet.<br><br>Initially, right-back Emmerson Boyce played a low cross into the heart of the area where a diving Isaiah Osbourne spectacularly attempted to clear.<br><br>However, the ball spun off his head and hit the inside of the right-hand post before Liam Ridgewell cleared the danger.<br><br>Within a minute another incisive delivery, this time from Josip Skoko, was played in behind the Villa defence where Scharner was left with just Sorensen to beat.<br><br>The Austrian's first touch was poor, however, allowing Sorensen time to close down and push wide the midfielder's flicked effort.<br><br>Not to be outdone, Villa soon countered in the 52nd minute, with Sutton playing in Barry for a 15-yard drive that fizzed over the crossbar.<br><br>A 60th-minute clash of heads between Scharner and Gary Cahill, which lead to both requiring treatment, disrupted the rhythm of the game at that stage.<br><br>Although Wigan resumed their dominance and continued to pepper the Villa area with more crosses, the visiting defence stayed resolute.<br><br>It allowed them a degree of pressure in the dying stages, but it was all frantic and frenetic, with little quality.<br><br>Â• Managers happy to share spoils<br><br>Wigan manager Paul Jewell could not fault his side despite the Latics producing their first goalless draw in the Premiership at the 50th time of asking.<br><br>Although the draw ends Wigan's run of four successive victories, Jewell said: 'I thought we were terrific. In the first half that's as well as we have played in the Premiership. We were really good, and all that was missing for the icing on the cake was a goal or goals.<br><br>'We missed some really good chances, especially with Lee in the first minute, but that happens. At least we are creating chances and we do look like we can score goals, although not on this occasion.<br><br>'But I cannot tell you how pleased I am with the players. They were great, and for a nil-nil it was a good game. There was no diving, no time wasting. It was just two very honest teams trying to win the game.'<br><br>Jewell was unconcerned by the fact that his side had finally registered a goalless draw adding: 'I wish it had been away from home. It would have felt a bit better.<br><br>'But taking the last five games into account, we have won four, drawn one and kept four clean sheets.<br><br>'We are starting to improve and go along the right lines.'<br><br>Aston Villa manager Martin O'Neill also adopted a positive stance when it was put to him that his side had now drawn five of their seven league games on the road this season.<br><br>He said: 'I would prefer to look at the other side of the coin and say we have only lost one of 13 matches in the Premiership.<br><br>'I also look at the fact that Liverpool are a much better side than us, yet they have not won away from home so far this season.<br><br>'Eventually we are hoping that by the end of the season we would have won our fair share of away games.<br><br>'But you have to remember we have played Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool in that time, and we knew it would not be easy coming here today, and so it proved.'<br><br>O'Neill appreciated the fact his side were perhaps fortunate to come away with a point, adding: 'I am happy with a draw. If you had told me 10 days ago that we would take four points from these last two away games, then of course I would have taken that.<br><br>'Thomas (Sorensen) made a great save in the first minute for us and that set the tone for Wigan. They were miles better than us in the first half, but then after half-time we came into the game more and looked more dangerous.<br><br>'But it would have been harsh on Wigan if we had sneaked the three points, so overall I think we have done well.'<img src="http://soccernet-att.espn.go.com/design05/DJ/20061118/kilbbarry_sb.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Furious Hughes calls for video replays<br><br>Mark Hughes believes video replays should be introduced as a matter of priority in the Premiership.<br><br>The Blackburn manager is demanding a meeting with referees' chief Keith Hackett following the controversial 1-1 draw against Tottenham at Ewood Park.<br><br>Hughes and his opposite number Martin Jol were both highly critical of the match officials, led by referee Phil Dowd.<br><br>'I have never been an advocate of technology. But when huge decisions at the top level have an impact on teams, management and players then something has to be done,' said the Blackburn boss.<br><br>'There are clear breaks in play whenever there is a penalty claim or a goal is scored.<br><br>'In that short period of time it can be established very quickly whether it was a genuine penalty kick or a genuine goal.<br><br>'Sooner rather than later they should bring it in, and I think it will happen.'<br><br>Blackburn took the lead thanks to a superb 25-yard volley from Tugay. But the former Turkey playmaker was later red-carded after being adjudged to have brought down Hossam Ghaly.<br><br>Jermain Defoe equalised from the penalty spot, and Ghaly was dismissed later for appearing to elbow Michael Gray.<br><br>Jol was then told to 'stand away' from the touchline, after questioning the decision.<br><br>He initially intended to appeal against what he thought was a dismissal - but a Premier League spokesman later made it clear Dowd had not sent the manager off.<br><br>That does not alter Jol's irritation about Ghaly's red card.<br><br>'I know Hossam, and he never used his elbow. He misjudged it. It was never intentional,' said the Spurs boss.<br><br>'The referee reacted to the crowd, who were crying out for a red card.<br><br>'I told him [the referee] he was totally wrong. He was a bit emotional.<br><br>'I was not abusive to him - afterwards maybe.'<br><br>Hughes was livid at the seventh penalty awarded against his side this season. He will appeal against Tugay's red card, as well as demanding a meeting with Hackett.<br><br>'It is important we highlight these things to the powers-that-be,' he said.<br><br>'Performance level is what we are all about - players, management and referees.<br><br>'Their performance has to be of the required standard.<br><br>'I do not think Mr Dowd would have been proud of his performance.<br><br>'Tugay did not make any contact. The guy lost his footing and has gone over. The referee is in a decent position to make a decision himself.<br><br>'We asked to speak to his assistant because we think he is going to overrule him.<br><br>'He comes back and ends up sending him off. We are scratching our heads.'<br><br>Hughes felt Rovers should have had a penalty when Mido appeared to handle in the area, after Defoe's equaliser.<br><br>'The assistant is 15 yards away, and I am 120 yards away. I saw it, and everyone else did,' said the Blackburn boss.<br><br>'These are big decisions that have a direct effect on the outcome of the game. On too many occasions this season, it has it happened to us.'<br></div>
