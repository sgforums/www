We would rather see him coming from the middle and running wide, it is very difficult to run anywhere when you are already out on the right.<br><br>Â“It is through the middle where he causes problems, and had he been given the chance to take passes slipped through to him from Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney or Frank Lampard, Andy would have done better than he did.Â”<br><br>Now Moyes wants Johnson to respond in an Everton shirt where he has failed to score in his last seven matches.<br><br>Moyes said: Â“What has been missing from AndyÂ’s play since the start of the season is goals.<br><br>Â“The rest of his game hasnÂ’t changed that much.Â”<br><br>Bolton assistant manager Sammy Lee insists the club are happy with the progress of record buy Nicolas Anelka despite his nine-match goal drought since returning to the Barclays Premiership.<br><br>The 27-year-old France striker has so far only found the target for Wanderers in the Carling Cup against Walsall following his return to England from Turkish side Fenerbahce.<br><br>ANELKA STRIVING TO MAKE HIS MARK<br><br>However Lee said: Â“Nicolas is becoming more attuned to what we do now.<br><br>Â“He was very influential in what we did in our link-up play (in their last match against Sheffield United), beating people and going beyond people.<br><br>Â“It takes time for everybody to get adjusted to the Premiership, and he is slowly but surely getting there and he is having a great influence on the team.<br><br>Â“OK yes, people look at his goalscoring, but itÂ’s not just for Nicolas to score goals, it is for every department to score goals. I believe he is working very hard for the club."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>READING v CHARLTON ATHLETIC: TEAM NEWS<br><br>Reading manager Steve Coppell believes the change at the helm of Saturday's opponents Charlton Athletic can galvanise the Addicks to escape relegation.<br><br>WEEKEND FIXTURES: HEAD-TO-HEAD - PART II<br><br>Iain Dowie lasted just 12 league games before being replaced by Les Reed, the Football AssociationÂ’s former head of youth development who had been assistant head coach at the Valley.<br><br>REED RELISHING MANAGERIAL CHALLENGE<br><br>Coppell admitted it was difficult to predict how the upheaval would affect the Charlton players.<br><br>He said: Â“There are two ways it could go.<br><br>Â“They moved very quickly not to make an interim appointment. Les Reed is the permanent choice so my inclination is that Charlton will be out to impress the new manager.<br><br>Â“I look at it in terms of the pedigree they have got over the years.<br><br>Â“They have been in this division for a number of years and I think it is fair to say the longer you are in this division the more chance you have of staying there.<br><br>Â“The position they are in is obviously a difficult one but given their personnel and the attitude they have developed over a number of years they have certainly got enough time to get out of it.Â”<br><br>Reed knows it will be a long haul to get the Addicks' season back on track, with the south-east London side currently bottom of the Barclays Premiership heading to the Madejski Stadium.<br><br>With his predecessor having spent the best part of Â£11million, he accepts there are unlikely to be significant funds available when the transfer window opens in January.<br><br>Â“We do have some unfinished business and certainly have irons left in the fire,Â” said Reed.<br><br>Â“It is more about needs rather than individual players.Â”<br><br>Reed added: Â“It probably will mean a bit of wheeling and dealing.<br><br>Â“But if it means we need a bit a boost to make something happen, I think there will be some funds available, although nothing like the summer.Â”</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WIGAN ATHLETIC v ASTON VILLA: TEAM NEWS<br><br>Wigan Atletic manager Paul Jewell has held up Martin O'Neill as a shining example of what can be achieved if given time.<br><br>The Aston Villa boss was under pressure during his early days at Leicester City, but the Foxes board kept faith and O'Neill has never looked back, becoming one of football's most respected managers.<br><br>Â“People who have worked with him say he's got something about him which is magic,Â” said Jewell.<br><br>Â“But when Martin first started at Leicester he lost something like his first eight games, and the fans wanted him out.<br><br>Â“If I'm not mistaken, I'm sure he invited some of them to a board meeting to vent their anger.<br><br>Â“But it shows you need time in this job. If you are given a fair amount and it doesn't work out, then you hold your hands up.<br><br>Â“Martin had it and look how well he did.<br><br>Â“He won a trophy with Leicester, and then all those cups and titles with Celtic in Scotland.<br><br>Â“He is a coveted manager for every job in the country. If the Manchester United job came up then he would be in the top three.Â”<br><br>WEEKEND FIXTURES: HEAD-TO-HEAD<br><br>Martin OÂ’Neill has pinpointed Aston Villa forward Gabriel Agbonlahor as a future England player but has urged Steve McClaren not to fast-track the 20-year-old into his current plans.<br><br>The Northern Irishman said: Â“I just think it is too early for Agbonlahor to be considered for England.<br><br>Â“I am delighted with him. I couldnÂ’t be more pleased with him. He has done well but it is far too early.<br><br>Â“You can suddenly start feeling youÂ’ve arrived if you are only a kid when you havenÂ’t even really learned your trade and you think `I should be here and I should be playing for Manchester United or Real MadridÂ’.<br><br>OÂ’Neill will come face to face with Emile Heskey at the JJB Stadium, a player he once sold for Â£11million from Leicester to Liverpool.<br><br>He said: Â“We sold him for Â£11million and there was no-one at Leicester that wanted to see Emile go, least of all myself.<br><br>Â“I would never knock Emile because he was brilliant for us, absolutely brilliant. He looks as if he has rediscovered that spark again and he is a handful. When Emile is confident, he is an absolute top-quality player.Â”<br><br>BLACKBURN ROVERS v TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR: TEAM NEWS<br><br>Robbie Savage is set to return to the Blackburn Rovers side on Sunday two weeks ahead of schedule.<br><br>The Welsh midfielder thought he would be sidelined for a month after suffering a thigh injury in the UEFA Cup victory against Basle.<br><br>Instead he is in line to face Tottenham Hotspur at Ewood Park after a two-match absence.<br><br>Mark Hughes is keen to welcome Savage back as his side aim to address a four-match losing streak in the league.<br><br>The Blackburn manager said: Â“Robbie is driving everyone nuts and it is good to get him back on the training field.<br><br>Â“He has worked really hard with the physios while he has been out. It will be a bonus to have him involved at the weekend.<br><br>Â“He gives us energy, he gives us that trigger to press teams because of his willingness and his determination to affect the game.<br><br>Â“Perhaps we have missed that in recent matches.Â”<br><br>Martin Jol has called on his Tottenham players to battle their way to a first Barclays Premiership away win of the season when they travel to Blackburn on Sunday.<br><br>HUDDLESTONE STAYS HUMBLE<br><br>SpursÂ’ only goals on the road have come from a Juan Pablo Angel own goal and Robbie Keane's penalty last week, and Jol has demanded greater mental and physical toughness.<br><br>Â“We've got football players,Â” Jol said. Â“We don't buy Vinnie Jones-style players, so if they all show they can be a tough, physical player then there is no problem. We showed that in our 10 games.<br><br>Â“We did ever so well in Turkey (against Besiktas), we did everything we could as a team,Â” he added.<br><br>He added: Â“We are not far off but it's still annoying we can do well at home but not away.Â”<br><br>Â“If you are strong enough you will get the points away from home,Â” he said. Â“You have to take responsibility physically.<br><br>Â“If you have five big strong guys, it's not a problem. If you have two or three then other people have to take responsibility as well.Â”</div>
