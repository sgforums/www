              <p><em>Flying the nest? Tevez is frustrated by his lack of first team opportunities.</em></p>
              <p><em><strong></strong></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span><strong> are ready to exploit the deadlock in negotiations with Carlos Tevez and United by making a move to snatch the unhappy striker.</strong> </p>
              <p>Tevez has indicated he is looking to move after a season in which he has grown frustrated over his lack of opportunities.</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old revealed last week that there has been interest from abroad — believed to be Real Madrid and Inter Milan — but Liverpool are prepared to offer him the chance to stay in England and avoid uprooting his family.</p>
              <p>It would also give Tevez a chance to join Argentina team-mate Javier Mascherano. Liverpool would have to pay a transfer fee of about £30million to Tevez’s management company, similar to the £18m it cost them to resolve the third-party ownership issues surrounding Mascherano when he moved in 2007. </p>
              <p>Although United were given permission to bring in Tevez on a two-year loan, costing £10m, that agreement ends in the summer and the Premier League has ruled that any club wishing to sign him must do so on a permanent deal.</p>
              <p>It is United’s reluctance to finalise such a deal that has led to the stand-off, as well<br>as the arrival of Dimitar Berbatov which has limited Tevez’s opportunities.</p>
              <p>The Argentine looked unhappy when he was replaced by Berbatov on Wednesday and when asked if he would be at United next season, he replied: ‘It’s very difficult to say. I don’t know. I know that the fans chant my name and sing the song about the manager signing me. They’ve always been very good to me. It’s emotional for me.’</p>

              <h1 class="heading">Cristiano Ronaldo convinced Carlos Tevez will stay at Manchester United</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00535/ron_and_tevez_360_535785a.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="360"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The irony was not lost on Cristiano Ronaldo. As he pondered the question, a smile spread across his face, quickly followed by a few splutters of laughter. So, Cristiano, will Carlos Tévez stay at Manchester United beyond the summer?</strong></p>
              <p>“Yes, definitely,” Ronaldo said when asked if he hoped the Argentina striker would remain at Old Trafford beyond the end of his complicated two-year “lease” agreement in June.</p>
              <p>The future of Tévez, who has also attracted interest from Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester City and Inter Milan.</p>
              <p>Not for the first time, United supporters left the manager in no doubt about their feelings about Tévez during the 1-0 victory over Arsenal in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final on Wednesday when Old Trafford reverberated to the cries of “Fergie, sign him up.”</p>
              <p>It was Tévez’s first start in the Champions League knockout rounds and he responded with a typically industrious display that might easily have yielded a goal had it not been for the heroics of Manuel Almunia in the Arsenal goal. The Argentina forward has, however, struggled to mask his frustration at his fall from favour since the arrival of Dimitar Berbatov from Tottenham Hotspur last September.</p>
              <p>United must pay £22 million to the companies, headed by Kia Joorabchian, that own Tévez’s economic rights to secure his permanent signature, but even if an agreement is reached it is unclear if the player would want to stay.</p>
              <p>“It was a good thing for me to start the game against Arsenal but it’s very difficult to say [if I will still be at United next season], I don’t know,” Tévez said.</p>
              <p>His affection for the fans, though, was unequivocal. “I know the fans chant my name and sing the song about the manager signing me,” he said. “They have always been very good to me and it’s emotional for me.” Tévez could be back on the substitutes’ bench for the Barclays Premier League game away to Middlesbrough tomorrow lunchtime, when United will be without Rio Ferdinand, the defender, who may also miss the second leg against Arsenal on Tuesday with a rib injury that was being carefully assessed yesterday.</p>
              <p>“I can understand his frustration and you have to respect his decisions, but I still believe he’s going to stay here in Manchester,” Ronaldo said.</p>
              <p>Tévez’s treatment has served only to heighten the resentment towards Berbatov and the Bulgaria striker conceded yesterday that the ill-feeling had affected him. “I have to thank my team-mates and especially Sir Alex for their help after the criticism,” he said.</p>

              <p>The decision is more with Fergie I feel...  He has more than 6 months to seal it but he didn't take any action... Tevez still wants to stay but, its up to Fergie... who has an eye on Benzema at the moment... If Lyon don't make it to the CL, he could be for sale... But if they do, then this deal is closed... Then perhaps Tevez might get his contract afterall...</p>
              <p>Buying Tevez would need $22m at least for United as they have already paid the $10m for the last 2 years... If Pool want him, he may cost them their whole season's budget of $30m...</p>

              <p>Carlos Tevez admits he sees himself leaving Manchester United in the summer.</p>
              <p>He told <em>The Sun</em>: “It’s true I’ve spent a lot of time on
              the bench and I’d like to play more. But every time I’m given a chance
              I do all I can to do well and take full advantage.</p>
              <p>“Yes, it’s like that, it’s true I see myself more leaving United than staying here.</p>
              <p>“I don’t see why I should lie to people or anything because the
              fans support me a lot as you can see. So I don’t have any reason to lie
              to them.”</p>
              <p>He added: “While I wear the United shirt I will leave my life
              on the pitch. You can see that in every game I play. I respect people a
              lot and I’m grateful to them.</p>
              <p>“My future? I don’t know what will happen for my future. I would like to go to Spain, yes, but I don’t know yet.</p>
              <p>“I have no preference for a team . . . we’ll see.”</p>
