              <p><strong>They've been romantically linked since last year but are rarely seen out together.</strong></p>
              <p>But now Shakira and Spanish footballer Gerard Piqué have made their relationship official - as a photograph of the couple sharing a passionate kiss has been used on the cover of Colombian magazine Caras.</p>
              <p>The 34-year-old singer is seen closing her eyes and leaning in for a romantic embrace with her 24-year-old sportsman beau.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Shakira announced at the start of the year that her 11-year relationship with lawyer Antonio de la Rua, 37, the eldest son of the former Argentinian premier, amid rumours that he had been cheating on her.</p>
              </div>
              <p>And last month, Piqué, who plays for FC Barcelona, uploaded a photograph from his birthday on February 2 of himself and the Colombian singer celebrating with friends.</p>
              <p>The singer first met Piqué last spring while shooting the video to her song Waka Waka (This Time for Africa) - the official track of the 2010 World Cup.</p>
              <p>Barcelona-based newspaper El Periodico de Catalunya claimed they had a string of secret encounters following their initial meeting.</p>
              <p>It said they both spent a night in the seven-room Hotel Atzaro in Ibiza last July. The footballer is said to have arrived and left wearing the same clothes.</p>

              <p><strong>However, Shakira has previously dismissed reports of a romance. </strong></p>
              <p>At a  press conference in Barcelona she described the claims as a 'waka-rumour' and added: 'You shouldn't take any notice of waka-rumours.'</p>
              <p>Pique was also quick to deny that they were lovers, telling reporters last month:  'We're just friends. There's nothing more to it.'</p>
              <p>But in February, the pair were spotted holding hands as they left a restaurant in Barcelona, finally confirming rumours of a romance.</p>
              <p>Shakira announced her split from De La Rua, son of former Argentine president Fernando de la Rua, on her official website in January.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><strong>The couple said: 'During our almost 11 years together we have loved each other deeply, taken care of each other and stood by one another.</strong></p>
              <p>'They have been the most wonderful years of our lives, and thanks to that love and the respect we have shared for one another, we have been an exceptional couple and partners.</p>
              <p>'Our friendship and understanding of one another is unwavering and indestructible.'</p>
              <p>The couple added that they viewed their separation as temporary, and that de la Rua - who is also Shakira's agent - would continue to oversee the singer's business and career interests.</p>
              <p>'We move forward together as partners, developing projects together, working hand in hand and in close communication,' the pair said.<br></p>
