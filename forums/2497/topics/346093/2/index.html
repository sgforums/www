              <p>I am thinking Drogba even if he looks not very interested to play for Chelsea these days, may still do his best for tonight's match if he is selected cos he don't like Rafa... lol</p>

              <p>Those  chief executive should seriously be sacked.</p>
              <p>They should not have so much power in say at all...</p>
              <p>They can be incharged with transfers...but should ask or consult the manager whether they wants the player or don't want the player.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just like Peter Kenyon[selling players when the squad is so thin] and Frank Arnesen[scouting some bullshit players they cannot make it to the first team].</p>

              <p>I feel that all these kind of reports are quite unfair to the CEOs cos when things go well, the manager gets the credit but when things don't go so well, the manager try to shy away from any responsibility and blame it solely on the chief executive...</p>
              <p>Point of note here is... here is a players of top quality so the manager should work on how to get the team playing and not look for excuses... If a new manager takes over a team, the players are all not his also but yet he is expected to get them to perform... Just like none of the current Real players were Ramo's but he still got them playing right... And at Real, the manager just manage... Its the President that choose and buy the players for the club...</p>
              <p>So I feel these managers should not blame others when the team performs poorly... It is not just the player at fault here, tactics employed, sub used, planning, training... All these are the managers job to keep the team winning... And I am quite sure when they were first signed, the manager was also happy to have new addition to his team... So why complain now?</p>

              <p>He never voice out his desire to over take torres to be the main striker or else he will be next to be booted out.</p>
              <p>Keane is more or less confirmed to be sell back to Spurs.</p>
              <p>Now, Liverpool is left with no spare hit man.</p>

              <h1>Anfield flop Keane set for dramatic Spurs return after Liverpool accept 15m bid?<br></h1>

              <p><em>Liverpool flop Robbie Keane could be set for a dramatic return to Spurs</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1133658" rel="1133658|3| nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1133658/Anfield-flop-Keane-set-dramatic-Spurs-return-Liverpool-accept-15m-bid.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Tottenham</strong></span></a><strong> had a $15million offer for Robbie Keane accepted by </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong> on Sunday night and he is expected to sign on at White Hart Lane on Monday.</strong></p>
              <p>It will complete one of the most spectacular deals of the transfer window. Just six months after Keane’s $20.3m move north, the striker left out of Liverpool’s squad for the 2-0 victory over Chelsea at Anfield on Sunday will return, giving Spurs a $5.3m profit on the deal.</p>
              <p>Sportsmail understands Keane’s $90,000 a week salary was proving to be problematic but a solution has been found. Tottenham’s highest paid player is Jonathan Woodgate on $70,000 a week, although $20,000 of that is still being subsidised by his former club Middlesbrough as part of the arrangement to sell him last January.</p>
              <p>Spurs have also asked to take highly-rated Inter Milan forward Mario Balotelli, 18, on loan.</p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/02/01/article-0-04BD5B8F0000044D-937_306x423.jpg" alt="Javier Saviola" width="306" height="423"></p>
              <p><em>Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez could move to replace Keane with a loan swoop for Real Madrid forward Javier Saviola.</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool, meanwhile, will attempt to take Real Madrid’s Argentina striker Javier Saviola on loan. Spurs manager Harry Redknapp is still coming to terms with a serious foot injury to Jermain Defoe and fears the club are back in a relegation battle following the 3-2 defeat to Bolton on Saturday.</strong></p>
              <p>Keane has told friends he was reluctant to quit Anfield after just six months, but Spurs chairman Daniel Levy was at his persuasive best in the final hours of the transfer window to complete the deal.</p>
              <p>Liverpool threatened to report Redknapp to the Premier League after he spoke in glowing terms about the forward last week and relations had remained frosty.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/sunderland.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Sunderland </span></a>are still interested in Darren Bent but Tottenham are reluctant to let him go until they confirm at least one striker coming in. Spurs may also make a late $5m bid to sign Reading’s Stephen Hunt to solve their problem left midfield position.</p>
              <p>Hunt has a $5m escape clause in his contract and Spurs will have to pay the fee up front after Reading snubbed an offer from <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/wigan-athletic.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Wigan</span></a> of a $2.5m down payment with the balance to be paid in instalments.</p>
