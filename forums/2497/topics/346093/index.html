              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">FURIOUS Liverpool are reporting Spurs because they feel they have tried to tap up Robbie Keane. </h2>
              <p class="article">Anfield chief executive Rick Parry is writing a letter to the Premier League to complain about Tottenham’s conduct. </p>
              <p class="article">Parry is fuming after Harry Redknapp went public with his admiration for the Republic of Ireland striker. </p>
              <p class="article">Spurs boss Redknapp said earlier this week: “I won’t sit here and say I wouldn’t like to have Robbie Keane at my club because I would be a liar if I did. </p>
              <p class="article">“I have a lot of time for Robbie as a player and as a person, he’s fantastic. But he belongs to Liverpool so unfortunately it’s not an option.” </p>
              <p class="article">There is no suggestion that Spurs have made any contact with Keane but Liverpool feel Redknapp’s comments are tantamount to an illegal approach. </p>
              <p class="article">Parry’s anger is intensified by the fact Spurs chairman Daniel Levy accused Liverpool of tapping-up Keane before his £20.3m move to Anfield last summer. </p>
              <p class="article">Levy insis-ted the move was “not a transfer but an enforced sale” after Reds boss Rafa Benitez had publicly declared an interest in Keane on Liverpool’s official website. </p>
              <p class="article">Liverpool were forced to issue a grovelling apology and make a donation to Spurs’ official charity before the deal went through. </p>
              <p class="article">Now Parry believes Spurs are guilty of the same crime and could even demand a charity payment in return.</p>

              <p>I think Liverpool is making a fool of themselves over the Keane issue.</p>
              <p>In the first place, he was not fielded as he was condemned by Ah Ben for no reason.</p>
              <p>So, if Ah Ben is not planning to use him (Omitted from the chelsea match tonight), he should at least offload him and instead of making a fool out of him.</p>
              <p>Liverpool is having a confidence issue with scoring goal now.</p>
              <p>As a manager, he should put all conflicts with Parry aside and field whatever players that he can to win the game.</p>
              <p>But, the pettiness of the manager is seriously hurting Liverpool more than the american owners.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben have shown his incapability to deal with free-soul players and unable to inspire players to play well beyond their ability.</p>

              <h1>Spurs to end Keane's Anfield misery - I didn't even sanction the G20m transfer in the first place, admits angry Benitez<br></h1>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/01/31/article-1133129-0333753B000005DC-193_468x457.jpg" alt="Robbie Keane" width="468" height="457"></p>
              <p><em>Liverpool's Robbie Keane hasn't settled since his move from Spurs</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1133129" rel="1133129|3| nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1133129/Spurs-end-Keanes-Anfield-misery--I-didnt-sanction-20m-transfer-place-admits-angry-Benitez.html"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Robbie Keane is on the verge of a G15million return to </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Tottenham </strong></span></a><strong>after being ditched by Rafael Benitez for </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong>'s most important game of the season against Chelsea today.</strong></p>
              <p>Benitez, who has also won important contract concessions from the club's American owners, Tom Hicks and George Gillett, effectively ended Keane's six-month Anfield career yesterday when he left the mercurial striker out of his squad to face Luiz Felipe Scolari's side.</p>
              <p>Liverpool must win today if they are to stay in the race for their first League title since 1990. But the omission of Keane, 28, prompted Spurs manager Harry Redknapp, reeling from the loss of Jermain Defoe for several weeks with a foot injury, to move fast to secure the Irishman as a replacement.</p>
              <p>Keane, the Republic of Ireland captain, scored 107 goals for the White Hart Lane club between 2002-2008 and although he upset some fans with the manner of his departure for Anfield last July, most are likely to welcome him back.</p>
              <p>Spurs, lying 14th after a 3-2 defeat at Bolton yesterday, are unwilling to repay the full G20.3m they received from Liverpool, but the clubs are likely to agree a fee before Monday's 5pm transfer deadline.</p>
              <p>The departure of Keane from Anfield is a significant victory for Benitez in the power battle that has threatened to derail Liverpool's title ambitions this season. Benitez was unhappy that Liverpool paid the full blocking his G18m move for Aston Villa's England midfielder Gareth Barry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/01/31/article-1133129-03336D14000005DC-676_468x293.jpg" alt="Keane" width="468" height="293"></p>
              <p>Liverpool signing Keane with manager Rafael Benitez</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Keane has scored only seven goals in 28 games for Liverpool and publicly showed dissent whenever substituted by Benitez, whose preferred attack is Fernando Torres, supported by Steven Gerrard.</p>
              <p>The Keane issue was one of the reasons Benitez demanded authority over chief executive Rick Parry in choosing how Liverpool spend their money in the transfer market. Both owners are in England for the Chelsea game and hope to sort out Benitez's contract concerns so he can agree a new four-year deal before they return to America.</p>
              <p>Hicks met Benitez for lunch yesterday and the Liverpool manager is expected to meet both owners once Gillett arrives on Merseyside this morning.</p>
              <p>The Americans, who have been split on several issues, have joined forces to try to secure Benitez's signature. One of the most significant changes on the new deal offered to Benitez is that he will now report to the owners on transfers.</p>
              <p>A source said: 'There has been a lot of communication between the owners and Benitez in the past 72 hours. Some changes have been made to the original contract offer and there is a hope that Benitez will agree to it. The idea is for him to be in charge of football matters, and leave Rick Parry to do the commercial side.</p>
              <p>'If Manchester United were in the market for two players who cost the same money, the board would let Sir Alex Ferguson choose which one he needed the most - the same applies for Arsene Wenger and David Moyes. The owners understand Rafa should be given the same deal.'</p>
              <p>Keane, a boyhood Liverpool fan, will be distraught at having to leave but has been unhappy at the deeplying role he has been asked to play. Benitez indicated last night that he had not sanctioned paying G20m for Keane, insisting: 'The club spent it.'</p>
              <p>He is apparently indifferent as to whether Keane attends today's game, saying: 'It's a day off for the players not in the squad. We don't insist they come to the game.'</p>

              <p>After this incident and looking what happened to Crouch, any creative and sane strikers will not be keen to join Liverpool as they will NOT be allow to express their style of play.</p>

              <p>Toking about Crouch, Last Two Year (Be4 Torres come) he was Liverpool Favourite Players (1st squad together with Kuyt n Gerrard) In the end, Even since Torres Came, Crouch has been benched like a SUB.......</p>

              <p>Ah Ben cannot handle players that are over their head.</p>
              <p>He have to in 100% control and all players MUST LISTEN to him.</p>
              <p>That is why Kuyt is his favourite even though he cannot even score constantly.</p>
              <p>In this pattern of thought, Liverpool will never have star and arrogant players like ROnaldo.</p>
              <p>So, Liverpool cannot be the league champion.</p>
              <p>It is, at this moment of time like tonight against chelsea, where the STAR players MAKE the difference and score the goal.</p>
              <p>Imagine you just sold your player that will make a difference before a very CRUCIAL match ????</p>

              <p>By right, there was a time when Keane started to score and ah ben should have continued playing him... Give him the chance to settle into the team and gain the confidence and show he could still be the player he was at Spurs... After he scored that goal against Arsenal, he follow that up with another 2 against Bolton then he was bench for some reason for their next few games... And he change it all around and put Kuyt as the lone striker and benched Keane... Weird...</p>
              <p>Another thing is, ah ben was looking to sell Alonso at the start of the season... I think he is still looking for a buyer...</p>
