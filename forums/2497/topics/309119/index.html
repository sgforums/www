              <h2>Milan Vice President Adriano Galliani fears that Kaka could be
              forced to retire from the game early, just like Marco Van Basten,
              unless referees start offering him more protection.</h2>
              <p><span>The 25-year-old was injured again during Sunday's
              match with Palermo when he was on the receiving end of a strong tackle
              from Roberto Guana.<br><br>Kaka has since complained that he is not
              being protected by referees, and that defenders are being allowed to
              kick him without the fear of punishment.<br><br>Galliani agrees, and
              fears that unless something is done about it, then Kaka may be forced
              to retire from the game at an early age, just like former Milan great
              Marco Van Basten.<br><br>"Kaka is absolutely right because
              unfortunately the referees continue to allow fouls to be made from
              behind," said Galliani.<br><br>"I believe they think these fouls can be handled by players,
              because they see them and should expel or warn, however, nothing
              happens.</span></p>
              <p><span>"We have already lost one great, who was called
              Marco Van Basten at 28 years old and would like to avoid losing Kaka at
              the same age."</span></p>
              <p><span>Van
              Basten was robbed of the best years of his career and finally retired
              in 1995, after a series of operations failed to cure a recurring ankle
              injury.</span></p>

              <h1>Mancini: Kaka Should Be An Accountant</h1>
              <p>Kaka has complained in the press recently about the excessive fouls he
              is suffering recently, and that he is not receiving enough protection
              from referees.</p>
              <p>Now Mancini, who himself was subjected to some rough treatment as a player, has had his say on the matter regarding Kaka.<br><br>"There are fouls and there always have been," he said.<br><br>"In
              recent years the situation hasn't changed much. Sadly whoever's job it
              is to be an attacker will always suffer too many fouls.<br><br>"If one doesn't want tackles, they should become an accountant."<br><br>Mancini is currently preparing his Inter team for tonight's big Serie A match with Roma at the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza.</p>
