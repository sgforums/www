              <p><strong>CHICAGO
              - Sports markets already losing business due to the tight credit
              markets and weak economy could get worse if embattled U.S. lender CIT
              Group Inc files for bankruptcy, analysts and sports bankers said on
              Thursday.</strong></p>
              <p>Shares of CIT, which lends to hundreds of thousands of small and
              medium-sized firms including sports teams, plunged more than 74 percent
              due to investor fears of a failure after the company said last-ditch
              bailout talks with U.S. Treasury officials had ended.</p>
              <p>CNBC television, citing a source close to the company, said CIT,
              which has about $75 billion in assets, is now pursuing a plan that is
              likely to include a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing on Friday.</p>
              <p>While CIT's sports advisory and finance group is only a small part
              of the company's portfolio, it has arranged financing for a number of
              hockey, basketball and soccer teams in the United States, Canada and
              England.</p>
              <p>While CIT is not considered a major player in the sports finance
              market, its potential exit would worsen an already tight credit market,
              especially for teams in the National Hockey League, analysts and
              bankers said.</p>
              <p>"It's going to hurt at the edges and it's indicative of how little
              capital will be available for sports owners, especially if they want to
              do any kind of refinancing or take on additional debt," said Robert
              Boland, professor of sports management at New York University.</p>
              <p>"The pool of sports financing has collapsed over the last few years," he added.</p>
              <p>Officials with CIT as well as within its sports advisory group could not be reached to comment.</p>
              <p>Among the teams to which CIT has loaned money or arranged financing
              over the last few years are the Edmonton Oilers, Ottawa Senators, New
              Jersey Devils, Nashville Predators and Dallas Stars of the NHL, as well
              as the National Basketball Association's New Jersey Nets and Manchester
              United of the English Premier League.</p>
              <p>Spokesmen for the Senators and the Predators declined to comment, while officials with the other teams could not be reached.</p>
              <p>NHL officials also declined to comment on CIT, but Commissioner Gary
              Bettman said on Wednesday that the North American sports league is
              weathering the recession fairly well. He cited record attendance and
              revenue, higher TV ratings and continued strong corporate sponsor
              support.</p>
              <p><strong>TROUBLES BETWEEN THE PIPES</strong></p>
              <p>Bankers wonder whether CIT is backing the almost $575 million bid by
              the Molson family to buy the Montreal Canadiens from George Gillett.</p>
              <p>A spokesman for Gillett and the storied NHL team declined to comment
              on the pending deal and its structure, while a spokesman for the Molson
              family said only that the deal is expected to close by the end of the
              summer.</p>
              <p>CIT's troubles are not welcome for the NHL as the bank was one of
              the few still providing cash for the league, several analysts and
              bankers said.</p>
              <p>"Whenever you take a player out, whether they're a lead or a
              syndicate financial source, these days there are very few substitutes,"
              said Marc Ganis, president of Chicago consulting firm Sportscorp Ltd.</p>
              <p>"It's really an odd situation for (the NHL) because in many cases
              the league is as strong as it's ever been, but there are a number of
              very distressed franchises and there isn't a great pot of gold at the
              end of the rainbow," he added.</p>
              <p>In May, the NHL's Phoenix Coyotes filed for bankruptcy, while the
              month before creditors declared Texas billionaire Tom Hicks' sports
              group, which owns the Stars and the Texas Rangers baseball team, in
              default on $525 million in loans.</p>
              <p>Last year, CIT helped finance half of a Canadian businessman's $200
              million purchase of the Edmonton Oilers, while the year before it
              arranged $130 million in loans to allow the Ottawa Senators to
              refinance their debt.</p>
              <p>One sports banker, who asked not to be identified because he works
              closely with sports teams, said a possible CIT exit "will put yet
              another dent in sports financing liquidity if it happens."</p>
