              <p>Liverpool have confirmed they have reached agreement with Roma to
              sign midfielder Alberto Aquilani for a fee believed to be £20m.</p>

              </div>
              <p>The
              signing comes just hours after Xabi Alonso passed his medical at Real
              Madrid and completed a £30m move to the Bernabeu after five years at
              Anfield.</p>
              <p>It has become clear that the two deals were being negotiated in tandem.</p>
              <p>Once
              Liverpool had completed the Alonso transfer, and received the first
              cash instalment, they were been able to complete the deal for a player
              to replace the Spaniard in boss Rafael Benitez's squad.</p>

              <br> <br> This fella Seems way too injury prone to consider!! 
              <br> Last season he started 7 league matches, the year before, 11, then it's
              9, then 20, then 14. He'd get far more injuries in the English Premier
              League too!! </span></p>

A case in point is the way players such as Wayne Rooney and now more recently Jack Wilshere are brought through into the first-team at 16 or 17-years-of-age, while in Serie A, players such as Sebastian Giovinco and Riccardo Montolivo are still considered young.<br><br>The reason for this, Stanco suggests, is to alleviate the risk of "burn-out", so while there is still time for Aquilani to raise his game further, which Stanco hopes as "everybody knows how Italy needs a good midfielder", but the onus has instead turned to the nation's younger crop.<br><br><strong><span style="color: #333332;">Goal.com</span></strong> Italy had further criticisms about an Aquilani switch. "He does not have the personality to conquest the Premier League. I think he will be a new Dossena who wants to come back to Italy after one year because he doesn't enough."</p>

              <p>"Roma have allowed us to talk with him,
              so that's good and positive. He is a player with the quality we are
              looking for," the Liverpool boss told the club's <em>official website</em>.</p>
              <p>"He can play a little bit higher than <span class="lingo_link" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12.1667px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;">Javier Mascherano</span><img id="lingo_icon" class="lingo_icon lingo_icon_black" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 0pt ! important; padding: 0pt; float: none; position: static; left: auto; top: auto; line-height: normal; background-color: transparent; visibility: visible; width: 12px; height: 12px; background-repeat: no-repeat; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: top; display: inline; cursor: pointer;" src="http://static.lingospot.com/spot/image/spacer.gif" alt=""> - maybe between him and <span class="lingo_link" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12.1667px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;">Steven Gerrard.</span><img id="lingo_icon" class="lingo_icon lingo_icon_black" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 0pt ! important; padding: 0pt; float: none; position: static; left: auto; top: auto; line-height: normal; background-color: transparent; visibility: visible; width: 12px; height: 12px; background-repeat: no-repeat; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: top; display: inline; cursor: pointer;" src="http://static.lingospot.com/spot/image/spacer.gif" alt="">  </p>
              <p>"He
              has good passing - the final ball is good - and he also works. If he
              can settle down properly in England he can be a very good addition.  </p>
              <p>"I
              think the signing should excite the fans. He won the U19 European
              Championship with his country, and U21 too. He has some trophies -
              including the Italian Cup.  </p>
              <p>"I always remember one game - England versus Italy U21s at Wembley, and he was man of the match in a 3-0 win."</p>

              <p>Alberto Aquilani's move from <abbr><span>Roma</span></abbr> to <abbr><span>Liverpool</span></abbr> is yet to be signed off.</p>
              <p><em>The Times</em> says life is rarely without its complications at Anfield and any deal for Aquilani will hinge on the player passing a stringent medical in the next 48 hours amid concerns about the Italian’s troublesome injury record.</p>
              <p>The Italy midfield player will move from Roma for €20 million (about £17 million), rising to €23 million.</p>
              <p>Aquilani is recovering from surgery he had on his right ankle in May and his tenure at Roma has been blighted by injury problems. He has played only 73 games in three seasons for Roma and his last appearance came as a substitute on March 11, against Arsenal in the Champions League.</p>

              <p>Giannini, who was similar in style to the new Red, said: "He won't have any problems adapting to the <abbr><span>Premier League</span></abbr>.</p>

              <h1>Rafa's Italian gamble: Aquilani joins Liverpool with a health warning<br></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/08/05/article-0-05F65A3B000005DC-823_468x406.jpg" alt="aquilani" width="468" height="406"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>High flier: But Aquilani also has a history of injuries and could be a big gamble for Rafa Benitez</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Alberto Aquilani flies into England with a series of medical woes but a playing reputation more in keeping with Steven Gerrard than Xabi Alonso.</strong></p>
              <div class="floatRHS">
              <p class="imageCaption">Crowd favourite Alonso’s belated £30million departure to Real Madrid proved the catalyst for Aquilani’s £20m acquisition, but the Roma midfielder hardly counts as a like-for-like replacement at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool</span></a>.</p>
              </div>
              <p>There is also a risk element to Rafa Benitez’s latest transfer, given a worrying list of injuries culminating in surgery on Aquilani’s ankle in May.</p>
              <p>However, Aquilani is renowned for bearing down on goal, beams with pride at his years in the No 8 shirt for his boyhood idols and is coolness itself from the penalty spot.</p>
              <p>Sound familiar? He will have to look for a new squad number, should he be given a clean bill of health after exhaustive tests at Melwood this afternoon, and spot-kicks will no longer boost his goals output, seeing as Gerrard has first say on both.</p>
              <p>But the 25-year-old will otherwise be encouraged to replicate the way he could become a major influence on Roma’s team in a move that should signal an even more attacking approach from Liverpool in the coming season.</p>
              <p>Aquilani only signed a new four-year deal with Roma worth £70,000 a week in May, following interest from Arsenal a few months earlier, but he has been enticed away by a five-year deal that will increase his weekly wage to £85,000.</p>
              <p>His eye for goal suggests he will link up with Gerrard just behind Fernando Torres, in a departure from last season’s favoured system of using Alonso and Javier Mascherano as midfield anchor men.</p>
