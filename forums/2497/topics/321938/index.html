              <p>Tottenham hope to finally end their search for a new No 1 goalkeeper this week by securing a £10m deal with PSV Eindhoven for their highly-rated Brazilian stopper Heurelho Gomes. Spurs head coach Juande Ramos has been looking at candidates to replace Paul Robinson for the past six months - and has decided to go for Gomes, who stands 6ft 4in and has won 17 caps for his country.</p>
              <p>The two clubs are close to agreeing a fee and Tottenham hope to be given permission to talk terms. The 27-year-old has been one of many names on Tottenham's shortlist, but he made a big impression when he helped knock Spurs out of the UEFA Cup in March.</p>
              <p>In the Eredivisie, he is known for his reflex saves and his ability to throw the ball deep into the opposition half. Gomes fell out with PSV earlier in the season and asked for a transfer after they clinched the championship. He said: 'I don't think the club want me to stay here. Something drastic has to change to keep me here.'</p>
              <p>PSV held talks with Gomes and his agent last week in a bid to get him to stay at the club, but it appears they have lost the fight. If Spurs secure the transfer as expected they will still need to find another keeper to act as back-up on the bench as Czech Republic No2 Radek Cerny, who took over when Robinson was axed by Ramos last season, has joined QPR.</p>
              <p>Robinson's future has still to be decided, but he has been resigned to leaving White Hart Lane since January and is believed to have already bought a new home in the north of England having already attracted interest from Aston Villa and Middlesbrough.</p>
