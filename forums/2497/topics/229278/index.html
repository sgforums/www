            <div class='col-md body'>David Beckham is set to stay at Real Madrid through January as talks continue with the club.<br><br>The former England captain's current deal expires in the summer but Real offered him a lucrative new two-year deal last month as they looked to secure his long-term future.<br><br>The Spanish giants had wanted an answer from Beckham before the start of 2007 as he is now eligible to talk to other clubs, with a view to a Bosman transfer at the end of the season.<br><br>Beckham has struggled to establish himself in the Real team this term and is believed to want guarantees that he will play regular football if he remains.<br><br>According to a spokesman for the midfielder, Beckham is keen to stay at the Bernabeu for the rest of the season as he mulls over his options.<br><br>"David has no intention of leaving the club in January," said the spokesman.<br><br>"He still wants to play a big part in the remainder of the season with Real Madrid and talks are ongoing."<br><br>Real may try to cash in on Beckham towards the end of the month if he continues to stall over their offer, to avoid losing him for free in the summer.<br><br>Beckham has been linked with a return to the Premiership, while there is also speculation about a move to America.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Mancini not Inter Beckham</strong><br><br>INTER MILAN boss Roberto Mancini has ruled out a transfer bid for David Beckham, with the club set to hang on to Luis Figo instead.<br><br>Figo had been linked with a move to Saudi Arabian side Al Ittihad, with their manager declaring the deal was imminent.<br><br>But Nerazzuri chief Mancini has insisted the Portuguese forward is staying at the San Siro, and will not be drawn on speculation linking him with a swoop for Beckham.<br><br>He said: "Figo is an Inter player and he will stay at Inter.<br><br>"Furthermore, just as Figo is an Inter player, Beckham is a Real Madrid player. And out of respect I never talk about players who belong to other clubs."<br><br>Mancini has recently said Figo is frustrated with a lack of first team action this season, but is confident that he will see out his contract that expires in June.<br><br>Beckham is also out of contract this summer, with a move between now and then increasingly likely with the former England captain having been frozen out by Real Madrid manager Fabio Capello.<br></div>
