I found out that Arsenal needed the money and that I was the target.<br><br>"I never wanted to leave.<br><br>"I’m happy they get their money and I hope they spend it well."<br><br>The Togolese striker then said he felt his criticism from the fans was unfair, continuing, "I scored 30 goals for Arsenal two seasons ago and it was not my fault that AC Milan, Barcelona or Real Madrid wanted to buy me.<br><br>"The way the fans turned against me was not nice. They didn’t turn on Cesc Fabregas when Barcelona showed interest in him.<br><br>"When a player plays well, clubs come in for him.

              <h1>Adebayor: Arsenal sold me for the money</h1>
              <p><br> <img src="http://fourfourtwo.com/contentimages/news/Adebayor26.jpg" alt="Adebayor26" align="right"> </p>
              <p><strong>Former Arsenal striker Emmanuel Adebayor says the Gunners sold him to Manchester City because they needed the money. </strong></p>
              <p>The 25-year-old Togoese international swapped the Emirates Stadium
              for Eastlands earlier this month for a fee believed to be in the region
              of £25 million.</p>
              <p>And the former Monaco man has insisted that, despite constant
              reports linking him with a move to AC Milan, he never requested a
              transfer from North London.<br> <br> "When I came back from holiday, I landed on July 13 and my agent told me I was going to speak with the club," he said in <em>The Sun.<br> <br> </em>"When I did he told me they had come to an agreement with another club.<br> <br> "It was a difficult decision to make. But I went away and thought now
              is the time for another challenge. It took about a week to sort
              everything out.<br> <br> "[Wenger] didn't really say why they wanted to sell me, but I found out
              that they needed the money and someone had to leave - that was me.</p>
              <p>And the striker, who scored 46 league goals in 104 outings for the
              club, revealed his disappointment at the treatment he received from the
              Gunners' supporters.<br> <br> "The way the fans behaved towards me was not nice at all," he said.<br> <br> "I can't understand why they were after me. I did my best for them and I was very happy there.<br> <br> "I scored 30 goals in a season - it's not my fault that Milan, Barcelona or Real Madrid wanted to sign me.</p>
              <p>"I know a lot of people will say 'He's gone for the money'. But I
              would like to see one Arsenal fan who worked somewhere for £10 and was
              offered work elsewhere for £30 to say they would refuse.<br> <br> "I come from a very poor city and country. I have a lot of ambition. I've had a career, but I only ever think about going up."</p>

              <p>Owen was doomed to playing Championship football.. no one was willing to give him a break.. not even LFC...</p>
              <p>now.. if you were in Owen's shoes and MUFC holds out their hand, would you grasp it?</p>
              <p>now... Adebayor.. a seriously overrated and useless "striker" who is made to look good by his teammates, who moans and groans over everything... leaves because he can make more money, tries to throw Fabregas who has not said a thing even when Barca came back knocking, and all that....</p>
              <p>what do you think?</p>
              <p>Adebayor will probably cause more trouble for his team than those his team is playing against...</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Adebayor confident Man City can displace Arsenal from top four</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p>Recent <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> signing, Emmanuel Adebayor, believes his new employers are capable of taking <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr>'s place in the top four.</p>
              <p>"That's why I'm here. That's why I signed for this club," the player
              told a press conference in South Africa. "They have the players, they
              have the squad, they have the spirit to fight for the top four places.
              That's why I signed for this club.</p>
              <p>"I cannot assure you of that [a top four finish] but I can
              assure you we will do our best. We will fight on the pitch and we will
              see what we can achieve.</p>
              <p>"I think we have a chance to fight against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr>, to fight against anyone to be in the top four," he said.</p>

              <p>I don't even know if he will be in the first team once they see him miss easy chances infront of goal with Tevez, Santa, Robinho all fighting for that 2 spot or 3... lol</p>
              <p>But he will be paid a lot lah that I know... I think he is now the highest paid player in EPL correct having overtaken Robinho? Cos I thought I read he will get something like $170k per week... What a waste of money...</p>

              <p>Emmanuel Adebayor has urged <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> to raid his old club <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> for defender Kolo Toure.</p>
              <p>Adebayor said: "Kolo is a great friend of mine - he's a big player for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> and a top defender.</p>
              <p>"He's been playing in the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> for seven or eight years now so he knows this league really well.</p>
              <p>"If the manager could get him, he can get exactly what this club wants
              and needs from him, I'm sure about that. I know how good Kolo is and I
              think what Man City needs now is a top-quality defender like him or
              John Terry."</p>

              <p>Hmmm... There is something Robinho, Tevez, Barry and now Ade have in common apart from playing for City...</p>
              <p>They all insist after their switch they didn't moved for the money... But yet got double or in some case 5x their last drawn salaries... lol</p>
              <p>Santa Cruz is an exception, though he also got double or triple his Blackburn pay, at least he didn't need to say he joint wasn't because of the money... lol</p>
