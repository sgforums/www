              <p><strong>Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien picked up an ankle injury while on
              international duty, and the Ghana captain is expected to spend a spell
              on the sidelines.</strong></p>
              <p>The Blues star was forced off the pitch after 22 minutes, during the
              World Cup qualifier with Libya which The Black Stars lost 1-0.</p>
              <p>Essien’s injury is due to be assessed by the club’s doctors as soon
              as he comes back to London, and it is feared that the versatile player
              could miss the clash with reigning champions Manchester United on
              September 21.</p>
              <p>“Ghana coach, Milovan Rajevac, going into his first competitive game
              for The Black Stars, was forced to alter his starting team after the
              22nd minute when Michael Essien was taken off for returning team
              captain, Stephen Appiah,” said a quote on the Ghana FA’s official
              website.</p>

              <p><strong>Chelsea have confirmed their own worst fears with the news that
              midfielder Michael Essien will be out of action for “several months”
              after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament.</strong></p>
              <p>The 25-year-old suffered the injury while playing in a World Cup
              qualifier for Ghana on Friday, and was stretchered off in tears after
              being scythed down by a Libyan opponent.</p>
              <p>Chelsea have now revealed that Essien will go under the knife in one
              week’s time as part of his recovery, after which he will go into a
              programme of rehabilitation.</p>
              <p>The length of his recovery period will mean that Essien will be out
              of action for a substantial period of time, with a return before the
              New Year looking unlikely.</p>
              <p>“Michael Essien suffered a knee injury playing for Ghana on Friday,” read a statement on Chelsea’s official website.</p>
              <p>“He has ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament and will undergo an
              operation as soon as the majority of the swelling has subsided. We
              expect this to happen in a week's time.</p>
              <p>“In the meantime Michael has started rehab in the aqua therapy
              centre at Cobham which will improve the condition of the knee prior to
              surgery.</p>
              <p>“A return to full fitness is not expected for several months.”</p>
              <p>Essien had only recently returned to action for Chelsea from a calf
              problem that had ruled him out for the start of the season, and his
              season has been cut short again after just two league games for The
              Blues.</p>

              <p><strong>John Obi Mikel is on course to start in midfield for Chelsea against Manchester City on Saturday following news that team-mate Michael Essien has been ruled out for six months with a knee injury.</strong></p>
              <p>Mikel missed the last two Barclays Premier League games with a leg complaint but is expected to be given a starting role at Eastlands after Essien ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament while on duty with Ghana at the weekend.</p>
              <p>Midfielder Michael Ballack is still struggling with an ankle problem although Didier Drogba could return upfront after recovering from a knee injury.</p>
              <p>Mikel said: 'The leg is a lot better. The past two weeks I have been working very hard and I am very happy that I am back. 'I can't wait to start again. It won't be easy for me to play regularly because we have so many good midfielders.</p>

SunSport exclusively revealed yesterday that Essien looks set to be sidelined for six months. And Chelsea confirmed their star midfielder will need surgery to repair a ruptured cruciate ligament.</h2>
              <p class="article">Essien, 25, was carried off in tears after being crocked in Ghana’s 1-0 World Cup qualifying defeat in Libya last Friday. He said: “I am devastated but these things happen in football.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“There was no challenge. But after I cut out a cross and landed I felt awkward and the pain was sharp. “I am very disappointed to miss the start of a very important season for Chelsea and Ghana’s World Cup qualifiers. “I hope to make a full and quick recovery.”</p>
              <p class="article">Essien, a £24.4million signing from Lyon in 2005, will probably go under the knife in France. A Chelsea statement said: “A return to full fitness is not expected for several months.</p>
              <p class="article">Essien’s best pal, Ghana skipper Stephen Appiah, revealed how the Blues ace was distraught in the dressing room after his injury. Appiah said: “The pain he was in and the tears he was shedding were so upsetting. “He cried like a child and it upset us all. I know exactly what he was going through and have reassured him that we are all there for him.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“I have spoken to him at length and I think he understands the fact there are ups and downs in every aspect of life and you can come through the difficult times if you stay strong.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42212000/gif/_42212522_knee_ligament2_416.gif" border="0" alt="Knee ligaments" width="416" height="208"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Many footballers have suffered recently from cruciate knee injuries. </strong></p>
              <p>It results in a lengthy period on the sidelines, but why is it so serious?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="ch1"><strong>WHAT IS A CRUCIATE LIGAMENT?</strong></div>
              <div class="ch1"><strong></strong></div>
              <p>There are four main ligaments in the knee - one on either side and two across the middle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <li>Medial collateral ligament (MCL) </li>
              <li>Lateral collateral ligament (LCL) </li>
              <li>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) </li>
              <li>Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) </li>
              <p>The ACL is behind the kneecap (patella) and is in front of the PCL.</p>
              <p>It's the second strongest ligament in the knee and stabilises the joint, connecting the thigh bone (femur) and the leg bone (tibia).</p>
              <p>The ACL and PCL limit the over straightening, over bending and rotation of the knee.</p>
              <p>The average length of the ACL is around 35mm, weighing around 20g. The medial ligament is one the inside of the knee, with the lateral on the outside.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="ch1"><strong>OPERATE OR NOT?</strong></p>
              <p>Surgery is not always essential when the ACL is ruptured. But in the case of a young sportsman looking to return to sport as soon as possible, it will be.</p>
              <p>A middle aged or older person could recover without going under the surgeon's knife. However, it is believed that repairing the ligament can reduce the risk of getting arthritis in the joint later in life.</p>
              <p>Surgeon's will usually graft tissue from either the patella or hamstring tendons to repair the ACL.</p>
              <p>Basically the new tendon replaces the ACL and is usually attached to the bones above and below the knee by screws.</p>
              <p>The success rate for such operations is high and while the injured person can soon be up and walking, running and twisting are some months further down the line.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="ch1"><strong>ROAD TO RECOVERY</strong></p>
              <p>Medical expert Bevan Ellis says: "Many top athletes will go through an accelerated rehabilitation programme to get them back in action within six months. "It requires intensive physiotherapy which needs to be monitored very closely at every stage.</p>
              <p>"For a typical person, an ACL injury would normally take between 8-12 months to get back to full fitness."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Phase one (0-2 weeks after surgery) </strong></p>
              <p>The knee will be swollen after the operation, so the first job is to reduce the swelling. After that, the physio will make the patient do a few light exercises like isometric contractions - keeping the leg still but moving the muscles around the knee.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Phase two (2-6 weeks after surgery) </strong></p>
              <p>The swelling should have disappeared, but the graft usually weakens around this time. The physio may have to back off from the rehabilitation programme until the ligament is up to more exercises.</p>
              <p>The patient should be walking normally by then.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Phase three (6-12 weeks after surgery) </strong></p>
              <p>By this stage, the knee should be getting stronger and able to take more strain. The patient should be able to go swimming and use a road bike to get the knee back on track, as well as doing more strength exercises.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Phase three (3-6 months) </strong></p>
              <p>The patient will have their full range of movement and strength back, so they can start running properly once more. They should be able to get back to specific drills and training.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Phase four (6-12 months) </strong></p>
              <p>The patient should be able to return to playing sport with their surgeon's approval.</p>
              <p> </p>
