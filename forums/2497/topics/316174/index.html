              <p><em>Avram Grant sinks to his knees as the whistle goes.</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <h1>'To question Grant's role after reaching Euro final is unbelievable': Chelsea skipper Terry backs coach Avram to keep his job</h1>
              <p>John Terry has insisted Avram Grant has to remain Chelsea manager now he has taken the club to the Champions League Final for the first time in their history. The Blues beat Liverpool 3-2 in the semi-final second leg to secure a 4-3 win on aggregate and ensure Grant has succeeded where predecessor Jose Mourinho failed. The Israeli has been the subject of constant speculation that he will be fired if he does not win the Premier or Champions League this season.</p>
              <p>But when asked if Grant has already done enough to keep his job by booking Chelsea's place in the final against Manchester United in Moscow, Terry said: "I would have thought so. It's for the club to make that decision, but things have been very good and results don't lie. "To get to where we are and to still question the manager's the role at the club is unbelievable. You look at the League table since the manager has taken over and he's been very good. All we can do once we're out there and once the manager is in charge, is our best.</p>
              <p>"That's what we've done to get to the Champions League Final. I think he deserves respect. "The club has never got to a Champions League Final before." But one man who knows that respect is no guarantee of job security at Chelsea is Mourinho's predecessor Claudio Ranieri, who fears Grant will be sacked unless his side actually win in Moscow.</p>
              <p>Ranieri was sacked in 2004 after his side were beaten by Monaco in the Champions League semi-final and while goals from Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard put Chelsea into the final, he is unsure that owner Roman Abramovich will be happy with just that. "I think Grant deserved this victory," the Italian told BBC Radio Five Live. However, asked what will happen if Chelsea fail to win in the final, the Italian said: "This is a difficult answer but I think if Grant doesn't win, I think he's finished in the job.</p>
              <p>"I think if Grant wins something, then okay, maybe he'll continue, but if not... I don't know the mind of Roman Abramovich, it's very difficult to know what he thinks. "It is the first (European Cup) final of Chelsea's history, going to Moscow, it's fantastic for him. He'll be very, very proud."</p>

              <p><em>John Terry celebrates as Chelsea book their place in the Champions League Final.</em>  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Grant is putting Chelsea to one side today as he will fly to Poland to visit Auschwitz out of respect for Holocaust Day, which took place yesterday. He collapsed to his knees on the pitch at the final whistle and revealed: "It was a special day for me. Hard but very special. My father buried my grandfather with his own hands, so this day always has an extra significance. "My father was the most optimistic and strong person I have ever known, so to reach the Champions League Final today of all days was unbelievable."</p>

              <h1>Ranieri tells Grant: You're finished if you don't win the Champions League</h1>
              <p>Former Chelsea boss Claudio Ranieri fears reaching the Champions League final
              will not save Avram Grant's job unless he beats Manchester United in Moscow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Italian coach Ranieri was sacked in 2004 when owner Roman
              Abramovich decided to bring in Jose Mourinho from Porto and while Grant
              was chosen to succeed Mourinho early this season, speculation persists
              that he will be ousted this summer.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/05_01/RanieriAP_468x342.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="342"></p>
              <p>The Blues last night secured their place in the European Cup final on May 21
              with an extra-time victory over Liverpool at Stamford Bridge and Ranieri, now
              coach of Serie A giants Juventus, was pleased for the Israeli coach.</p>
              <p>"I think Grant deserved this victory," said Ranieri.</p>
              <p>However, asked what will happen if Chelsea fail to win in the final, the
              Italian said: "This is a difficult answer but I think if Grant doesn't win, I
              think he's finished in the job.</p>
              <p>"I think if Grant wins something, then okay, maybe he'll continue, but if
              not...I don't know the mind of Roman Abramovich, it's very difficult to know

              <p>"It is the first (European Cup) final of Chelsea's history, going to Moscow,
              it's fantastic for him. He'll be very, very proud.</p>
              <p>"It's a great achievement for English football."</p>
              <p>Ranieri could return to the Premier League one day but insists he is happy at
              Juve for now.</p>
              <p>"Why not?" he said. "Now I have a very good job here at Juve. We are
              rebuilding the story of this great club. I hope to win something here."</p>

              <p><br>Yeah man... and if they do, Grant deserve all the credit... No wonder there was no players from Chelsea in the team of the year... Cos none of them really played well through-out the whole season... Most of them was injured one time of another lah, some went away for the ACN for 1 and a half months lah... Despite all this he still manage to keep them going...</p>
              <p>So the Normal One has done something the Special One couldn't... Bringing Chelsea to their first champions league final... He is better than Jose liao...</p>
