            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Glenn Roeder has resigned as Newcastle boss after reaching the point of no return.<br><br>PA Sport understands the 51-year-old parted company with the club today after 15 months in charge at St James' Park including his spell as caretaker.<br><br>He made his decision in the wake of yesterday's dismal 2-0 home defeat by Blackburn which ended the Magpies' faint hopes of claiming the Intertoto Cup route into Europe for the second successive season.<br><br>The club are yet to confirm Roeder's departure, although are expected to do so within hours.<br><br>Rumours that he had been summoned to an emergency board meeting had been circulating throughout the day, with some suggesting he had been sacked.<br><br>Roeder was in defiant mood after yesterday's game, which extended his side's run with a Barclays Premiership goal at St James' to five games - their worst return since 1951 - and a staggering seven hours and 51 minutes.<br><br>He said: 'I am very much the same person who was here last year who had a fantastic finish to the season.<br><br>'I have not changed as a person. Of course I understand, 100% understand where the fans are coming from.<br><br>'They want a winning Newcastle team and I also want a winning Newcastle team.<br><br>'At the moment, we have not been winning and I understand their frustration.<br><br>'To win matches, you need to score goals and we have not done that for four, five, six weeks now, and that has cost us greatly.<br><br>'I do understand their feelings.'<br><br>His change of heart sparks yet another search for the man to bring success back to Tyneside for the first time since they lifted the Fairs Cup in 1969, with their last domestic success coming in the FA Cup 14 years earlier.<br><br>Roeder's departure comes at the end of a week which has seen frenzied speculation about his position and the availability of Sam Allardyce. However, chairman Freddy Shepherd had earlier insisted he had never spoken to Allardyce, who turned the job down before Graeme Souness was appointed in 2004, about the matter.<br><br>He said: 'I have never spoken to Sam Allardyce. I don't know where all this is coming from.'<br><br>Shepherd, who has also dismissed suggestions that former England boss Sven-Goran Eriksson could be heading for Tyneside, will now start the process of looking for the sixth manager of his reign and the fifth he will have appointed.<br><br>He fought to be allowed to give Roeder the job last summer, a battle which has since resulted in a change to the Premier League's rules, despite the fact he did not have the necessary UEFA Pro Licence.<br><br>Roeder won his chance after inheriting Graeme Souness' dispirited side and dragging it into seventh place at the end of last season with a return of 10 wins and two draws in 15 league games.<br><br>Despite being linked with several bigger names - he insisted he would not consider Allardyce again after his earlier refusal - Shepherd went with the groundswell and handed the former West Ham manager, who had been working as his Academy manager, his chance.<br><br>But Roeder was hamstrung even before he began in earnest by the knee injury Â£17million striker Michael Owen picked up during England's World Cup finals campaign, and injury woe was to become a familiar theme at St James' as 12 bouts of major surgery robbed the manager of key players for extended periods.<br><br>In addition, a relative shortage of cash following Souness' Â£50million spending spree limited the club's recruitment plans both during the summer and in January with Obafemi Martins and Damien Duff accounting for the manager's entire Â£15million kitty as Mark Viduka and Robert Huth among others getting away.<br><br>On the pitch, performances were patchy, although results in Europe were good until the Magpies squandered a 4-2 first leg lead in Alkmaar to miss out on a place in the UEFA Cup quarter-finals.<br><br>By that point, they had been dumped out of the Carling Cup by eventual winners Chelsea and exited the FA Cup at the first hurdle when Coca-Cola Championship Birmingham inflicted a hugely embarrassing 5-1 third round replay defeat on them on Tyneside.<br><br>Newcastle fared reasonably well against the top four, defeating Liverpool and drawing with Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal at St James'.<br><br>However, home defeats by Fulham, Bolton, Sheffield United, Manchester City and Blackburn left the fans in militant mood.</div>
