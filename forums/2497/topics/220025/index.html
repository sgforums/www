            <div class='col-md body'>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) Â— Wayne Rooney scored his first international goal in a year to help England earn a 1-1 draw at the Netherlands on Wednesday in an international friendly.<br><br>Rooney got behind the Dutch defense in the 37th minute and kicked the ball into the net with his right heel. It was the Manchester United striker's first goal for England since scoring against Argentina in a friendly last November in Geneva.<br><br>Steve McClaren said he was pleased to see Rooney back in form for England.<br><br>"His performance was back to Wayne Rooney as we know him," McClaren said.<br><br>Rafael van der Vaart equalized for the Netherlands in the 86th, stabbing the ball in after a long throw from the left.<br><br>The draw will do little to take the pressure off McClaren, who has been under fire since his team lost to Croatia and drew with Macedonia in European Championship qualifying.<br><br>"We were all disappointed we didn't win the game Â— we deserved to," McClaren said. "The chances we created, we should have won."<br><br>Both teams had chances to win in the last minute Â— Steven Gerrard's close-range shot was saved by Netherlands goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg, and England goalkeeper Paul Robinson denied Klaas-Jan Huntelaar at the other end.<br><br>In the 29th, Rooney squandered an easy chance when he headed the ball weakly to starting goalkeeper Henk Timmer instead of shooting after the ball ballooned to him unmarked in front of the Dutch goal.<br><br>Gerrard also could have scored in the first half when he intercepted a back pass by Khalid Boulahrouz but could not squeeze the ball under Timmer.<br><br>The best chance in the first half for the hosts came in the 11th minute when Robinson parried a powerful shot by Arjen Robben and Denny Landzaat headed the rebound wide.<br><br>The Netherlands was solid in midfield, but playing without a specialist on the right wing stymied the attack.<br><br>"I think it was a reasonable performance," Netherlands coach Marco van Basten said. "It was a strong England side and we were missing a few important players who can give a little extra, such as (Robin) van Persie, (Edwin) van der Sar and (Wesley) Sneijder."<br><br>The Netherlands leads its Euro 2008 qualifying group, but Van Basten has been scrutinized for his team's poor play and his disputes with players, most notably the absent Ruud van Nistelrooy.<br><br>The Real Madrid striker, who scored four goals Sunday in the Spanish league, has vowed never to play for the Netherlands while Van Basten is in charge.<br><br>Micah Richards, an 18-year-old Manchester City defender, had a strong debut for England, canceling out the threat of Robben on the left wing.<br><br>I knew Micah is good <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Can try playing him as Dm also verystrong.How iknow?Cause i play FM <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>McClaren disappointed not to beat Holland<br><br>A frustrated Steve McClaren said his England side deserved to beat the Netherlands after they conceded a late equaliser in a 1-1 friendly draw on Wednesday.<br><br>McClarens men were heading for a much-needed victory after taking a 37th-minute lead through striker Wayne Rooney, only for midfielder Rafael van der Vaart to level in the 86th minute.<br><br>"Were all disappointed that we didnt win the game. We deserved to, there were half a dozen good chances apart from the goal," McClaren told a news conference.<br><br>"But I asked for a performance, everyone wanted to see that, and thats what we got... on another day wed have scored more and won the game comfortably."<br><br>A decent showing was considered a minimum requirement for England after a 2-0 defeat in Croatia and a 0-0 draw with Macedonia has left them third in Euro 2008 qualifying Group E.<br><br>Pleased with the way his men handled the novel 4-3-3 formation designed to echo the Dutch line-up, McClaren said: "The system nullified them.<br><br>"It worked, the players did well to have the organisation and discipline to carry it out."<br><br>The one blot on Englands copy book was to concede to a set-piece. Englands defence failed to intercept Arjen Robbens long throw-in and substitute Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink was able to head the ball back for Van der Vaart to rifle home.<br><br>"I wouldnt have thought that we would have conceded from a long throw and thats the one disappointment from the night," McClaren said.<br><br>"But its not something thats cost us points and its something we will look at. Obviously, we dont like conceding goals and we have to find out reasons."<br><br>Dutch coach Marco van Basten, who was missing some key players at the Amsterdam Arena and whose full-strength side are top of qualifying Group G, had no real complaints.<br><br>"Im satisfied with a fair result against an England side at full strength, while we missed players like Robin van Persie, Edwin van der Sar and Wesley Sneijder, who all three bring something extra," he said.<br><br>His team lacked their usual attacking threat without striker Van Persie, with Liverpool forward Dirk Kuyt struggling against his Premier League rivals at the back for England.<br><br>"Kuyt played an unfortunate match against a very experienced pair like (Rio) Ferdinand and (John) Terry," Van Basten said. "You have to realise you will not get past them easily."</div>
