But if Spurs are to sign the PSV Eindhoven centre half, they will have to negotiate with their London rivals to clinch the Â£14 million transfer.</strong><br><br>Real Madrid are also interested in signing Alex, who knocked Arsenal out of the Champions League this season with his goal at the Emirates. But Real have learned that because of the complex nature of his transfer from Brazilian club Santos to PSV, he cannot move without ChelseaÂ’s involvement.<br><br>PSV technical director Stan Valckx yesterday denied the club had received any substantial offers for Alex but said: "There are two parties involved in this. Chelsea and the player himself." When pressed about ChelseaÂ’s involvement, Valckx said: "It is something between Chelsea and PSV."<br><br>Alex has claimed he was poised to go to Stamford Bridge last summer but the deal was blocked by Jose Mourinho. It is understood he would favour a move to Chelsea, who have confirmed they have first option to buy him, if Mourinho leaves. Otherwise he would consider other offers and Tottenham hope they can entice him to London.<br><br>There are conflicting reports regarding the nature of AlexÂ’s ownership. PSV say the player is rented from Chelsea,who paid the initial transfer fee, whereas Chelsea insist he is a PSV player and that they merely have an option to buy him. Alex was signed on the recommendation of Piet de Visser, Chelsea owner Roman AbramovichÂ’s personal scout.<br></div>

The 24-year-old, who was loaned out by the Blues immediately after his purchase in 2004 due to potential work permit problems, believes the time has come for his long-awaited move to London. </strong><br><br>"The chance that I will leave PSV is quite big," Alex told De Telegraaf newspaper. "At this moment Chelsea are very busy with getting a work permit for me. "Earlier they did the same with Salomon Kalou and several other players, which worked out fine."<br><br>Alex has been unable to play for Chelsea due to his lack of caps for Brazil. Rules in England stipulate that a non-EU player must have played in 75% of his country's matches in the last two years to be granted a work permit.<br><br>However, Alex does not comply and is hoping for a concession from the FA. Even if he is allowed to play for Chelsea, he faces stiff competition from club captain John Terry and Ricardo Carvalho in the centre-back positions. He added: "Chelsea are a great club, but it is most important that I will play a lot of games there. "If I only sit on the bench, it will be difficult. But whether that will happen, you only know when you are there."<br><br></div>
