              <p>The Tottenham Hotspur manager, Harry Redknapp, may rest key players
              for this week’s trip to Ukraine and will make a late decision on
              whether Luka Modric will travel.</p>
              <p>The Uefa Cup tie against
              Shakhtar Donetsk tomorrow starts a period of four matches in 11 days,
              with the Carling Cup final against Manchester United on 1 March being
              Redknapp’s priority – and Spurs also have a Premier League match at
              Hull on Monday.</p>
              <p>The Croatia midfielder Modric picked up a knock
              in training and could be held back for the first leg of the last-32 tie
              at RSK Olimpiyskiy, |but other available players are expected to travel
              even if they do not |start. Robbie Keane, Roman Pavlyuchenko and Vedran
              Corluka are cup-tied, with Jermain Defoe ineligible and sidelined,
              while Ledley King and Jamie O’Hara are returning from injury and will
              not travel.</p>
              <p>“I wouldn’t play Ledley in the Uefa Cup even if he was fit,”
              Redknapp said. “The Uefa Cup is not the most important of our
              competitions. The game at Hull is far more important to me.”</p>
              <p>Redknapp,
              who is expected to put youngsters such as Dean Parrett and John Bostock
              on the bench, at least has options in midfield. Wilson Palacios, Tom
              Huddlestone, Jermaine Jenas and Didier Zokora are the central
              midfielders at Redknapp’s disposal, with the manager assessing which
              players to keep fresh for Hull.</p>
              <p>Darren Bent is likely to start
              in attack, less then a week after he admitted he may have to assess his
              options if he cannot get regular football.</p>
              <p>“I’ve got a point to prove in that I want to show the gaffer what I can |do and I want to be starting games,” Bent said.</p>
              <p>“At
              the same time, I don’t think I’ve got anything to prove because I’ve
              scored goals this season. I’m the top goalscorer at this football club
              so I feel like I can just go out there and relax. I don’t feel the
              pressure at all, I just go out there and enjoy it.</p>
              <p>“If you’re any
              player not playing games you’re not going to be happy. But me and Harry
              get on fine. I’ve got no problem with Harry and he’s got no problem
              with me, so I’ll just go out there and get on with it.”</p>
              <p>Portsmouth’s
              win at the weekend means Spurs dropped to 16th in the table and playing
              on Monday means they could be back in the bottom three before kick-off
              at the KC Stadium. The return leg for the Shakhtar game is on the
              Thursday, followed by United at Wembley on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Bent added:
              “If we can go as far |as we can in the Uefa Cup, start climbing the
              league and win the Carling Cup, all of a sudden it will be a great
              season.”</p>
              <p>Redknapp cannot choose Adel Taarabt or Ricardo Rocha for
              the Uefa Cup as the pair were not registered by Tottenham’s former
              coach Juande Ramos at the start of the season.</p>
              <p>Taarabt, who grew up in France, would have been raring to go after his international debut for Morocco last week.</p>
              <p>Taarabt
              said: “I could have waited to play for France, but I felt the time was
              right when I was given this opportunity and it was a very proud moment
              for me with all my family watching.”</p>
