            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Below are just my own thoughts on the match, not saying they're definitive but just my own thoughts.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I feel Liverpool were the better team overall. They were more daring and willing to venture.<br><br>Kuyt was unfortunate to hit the cross bar and be ruled offside, but the ref made the right call on the offside. The offside call really tight and marginal, but ref got it correct.<br><br>Both keepers did well and Cech should hardly be faulted for letting Kuyt find the back of the net from the 1-on-1. Luckily, it was rightfully ruled offside.<br><br>Crouch wasn't as threatening as I thought he would be, maybe I had high expectations. I guess John Terry's stockier physical presence was able to put Crouch off a little bit. Credit to Terry, Essien and Drogba who took turns to at least reduce the influence of Crouch.<br><br>It was quite obvious from the start Liverpool were going for wing play, crossing and long ball. Pennant on right midfield and Risse at left back instead of his usual left midfield this season. Not surprising considering Liverpool used wing play well against Chelsea in the 2-0 EPL match defeat at Anfield.<br><br>Pity Pennant got injured as his crossing would have helped up to late stages of the game. A lot of good chances came from him, and Ashley Cole did what he could to stop Pennat from breaking open on the wing and getting a cross in. Cole did get a yellow card for a block on Pennant but I think it was necessary. Pennant is so under-rated and under utilised.<br><br>Liverpool were constantly threatening but Chelsea did well to defend. Essien continued to impress at centre back making a few crucial blocks. He would make a decent centre-back but I think a club like Chelsea deserves better. Makelele had a good game too, getting the ball back and keeping vital possession for Chelsea on a number of occassions.<br><br>Drogba can't be faulted for lack of effort or lack of trying, but I feel he would have helped the team better if he didn't try to do his little tricks. Like a dive in the first half where he stayed on the ground but would have been of better help getting up and supporting the attack. I was watching the match with a Chelsea fan who agreed it was a dive and was actually saying,"Drogba get up and attack." I think it was poor Kalou who was taking on the Liverpool defence alone.<br><br>At first based on line-up I thought Chelsea was going for 4-4-2 with Kalou starting. However, when the match started, Chelsea were actually playing 4-5-1 with Cole and Kalou on the wings. In my opinion, Chelsea should have started with SWP instead on the right instead of Kalou. At least, that's what I think. Maybe Mourinho wanted the option of swicthing to 4-4-2 without having to make substitutions.<br><br>Robben should have been introduced earlier to try and get the away goal that could have killed off the game. Bellamy too was intoduced to late to have his pace have real effect on the game. Both are good players in their own right but were introduced too late to have real effect on the game.<br><br>Both Lampard and Gerrard didn't have a fantastic game with most of their long shots not even testing the keeper. Gerrard was usual self running all over and being in the thick of action many a times. But I think that was more down to tactics and some of Gerrard's tackles were a little risky at times. In my opinion, the debate of who is the better midfielder is still open.<br><br>It was a pity the game had to be settled on penalties, but like 2 seasons ago, it was always going to be a tight affair. But there had to be a winner.<br><br>-I'll have a seperate post about the penalties alone-</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>About the penalties...<br><br>I think the most credit for the penalties should not go to Reina but to Benitez. The reason why I say this is because I think Benitez prepared his team well before they took the penalties.<br><br>Last night, all of Liverpool's penalties were taken low. In fact, Cech was beaten in normal time by a low shot from Daniel Agger as well. I remember Cech being good at blocking or stopping high shots and he is a fantastic keeper, but I suspect Cech's has a slight weakness on low balls and Benitez knew that. All of Liverpool's penalties were low shots as compared to 2 seasons ago against AC Milan where there were variations.<br><br>It should be noted that low balls for penalties are never going to be easy for any keeper to save. But it could also be that Benitez has had his team practicising penalties just in case, since all the penalties were well-taken. Good preperation still on Benitez's part.<br><br>Sadly enough also for Chelsea is that they missed the services of two great penalty takers in Sheva and Ballack. Who knows what might have happened if they were available and were included for the penalty shootout as well. Moreover it was a penalty shootout away from home. Having experienced penalty takers would be so important.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It would have been pretty interesting headlines to have Man U and Chelsea head to head in two finals and a crucial EPL match within a span of a few weeks. But still, the current situation seems for pretty interesting encounters in the Champ's league final as well.<br><br>Liverpool vs Man U - Two of the English clubs with the most history and also the two most successful in Europe. Definitely a classic encounter.<br><br>Liverpool vs AC Milan - Rematch of final from 2 seasons ago. What's it gonna be? Another fightback from 3-0? AC Milan was stronger 2 seasons ago yet they didn't beat Liverpool. Liverpool now is also stronger than it was when they became champions. Then again, AC Milan having played them once already would know better what to expect, and to reach the semi-final four times in five seasons is a mark of AC Milan's pedigree in Europe.</div>

The entire Chelsea defence was expecting a high ball with Crouch in the middle of the penalty box. But instead, it was a low pass to Agger to made the shot low as well and had Cech well beaten. Totally not what the entire Chelsea defence expected.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jose complaint a lot about one team was trying to win while the other wasn't... I thought we should look at it in a different way... During Extra time, Pool was the home team while chelsea was the away. There was no reason for pool to commit themselves to go forward too much as 1 Chelsea goal would have counted as 2... While pool's if scored would have consider as 1 only.<br><br>Meaning had chelsea scored 1, there was no way pool was coming back cos they will need to score 2... And if Pool had scored 1, chelsea could still comeback with only a goal and they would have won the match on away goal rule.<br><br>So i guess jose was missing this point when he started talking nonsense again...</div>
