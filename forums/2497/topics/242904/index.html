            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p143/zococl/Roman1.jpg"><br><br><strong>JOSE MOURINHO has sarcastically called Roman Abramovich Â‘the almightyÂ’. The self-dubbed Special One clearly does not feel he is the most important man at Chelsea and has revealed the extent of friction at the club. For the first time Mourinho admitted to rows with Academy Director Frank Arnesen and confessed he has become an increasingly lonely figure at the club. The Blues boss also revealed the split Andriy Shevchenko caused in the dressing room. It is his reference to billionaire Chelsea owner Abramovich which could prove the last nail in the coffin of his Stamford Bridge career, however. In his staunchly Catholic native Portugal only God is referred to as Â‘almightyÂ’ and MourinhoÂ’s quip was clearly meant to be derisory.</strong><br><br>When asked about the rows he had over AbramovichÂ’s decision to stop him buying players in the January transfer window, Mourinho replied: Â“I admit that the period between the end of December and the whole month of January may have caused some tensions. Â“There were some problems to solve and if you see the money of the clubÂ’s owner, you would expect those problems to be solved. Â“But that didnÂ’t happen and the reason given for the club not to hire new players were the alleged problems between me and Abramovich, who even stopped going to the games, although nobody cared to know why.<br><br>Â“I said, who am I to question the owner of the club, Abramovich is the almighty in Chelsea.Â” He said: Â“There was a collective frustration with Sheva due to his great capacity. Â“When I say frustration I mean my frustration as well as the playersÂ’ frustration. That situation spilled over to the transfer ban in January, though Arnesen recommended that Mourinho take PSV Eindhoven defender Alex Â— who he has helped sign to the Dutch club with the help of AbramovichÂ’s money.<br><br>The coach would have none of it, though, since accepting the move would have undermined his authority. He claimed his differences with Arnesen Â— who is RomÂ’s advisor Â— are professional, not personal. Arnesen is not a yes man. He has his own opinion Â— you can agree or not.<br><br>Mourinho clearly feels he and his players have been abandoned by Abramovich Â— who has not spoken or seen any of the first team or coaching staff for more than two months. As a result, he is a more solitary figure than ever Â— creating a siege mentality in the club which is very much Â‘them and usÂ’.<br><br>The manager revealed: Â“I feel lonelier in the same proportion that I donÂ’t need so much company. Â“This club is not presidential. I work every day in Cobham, one-and-a-half hours from ChelseaÂ’s heart at Stamford Bridge, and itÂ’s here in Cobham that I focus all my action together with my people.<br><br>Â“These people who are with me daily, of which the players are a critical part, make me feel supported. Â“The empathy, ambition and friendship in this group is exceptional. We are undoubtedly together.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Let them go - Jose won't stop Lampard and Terry leaving</strong></span><br><br><strong>Jose Mourinho on Friday night risked angering Roman Abramovich by saying he would not stand in the way of John Terry and Frank Lampard if they decide to leave Chelsea in the summer. Club skipper Terry threatened to quit last week after contract talks broke down and Lampard is still waiting for the club to offer him an extended deal.</strong><br><br>Mourinho, who has spoken with the pair at length about their futures, said: "If a player has a dream to play in front of another country and at another club, I wonÂ’t stand in their way. I told them what they have in their hearts is more important than any advice I can give.<br><br>"They are both captains and I have talked to them more than any other players at the club. As a father, I will not do that to my kids and I wonÂ’t do it with my players. They are adults and they have wives who are more important than the manager when these decisions are made."<br><br>Midfielder Lampard, who is being courted by Juventus, is threatening to invoke a FIFA rule at the end of the season and buy out the remaining two years of his contract. Terry, like Lampard, wants the security of another long-term deal and he is disillusioned with chief executive Peter Kenyon after Chelsea reneged on an offer that would have ensured the England captain spent the rest of his career at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>Although Mourinho says he wants to stay at Chelsea until his contract expires in 2010, he is not expected to stay beyond the end of the season. He reiterated his desire to remain in London as he prepared to face Sheffield United on Saturday, but his attempts to secure the future of the clubÂ’s two most influential players was no more than a token effort.<br><br>Mourinho added: "I would love to see them both be part of ChelseaÂ’s history until the end of their career, especially if I stay until 2010. But itÂ’s football and there is always an 'if'. "Frank and John belong to Chelsea and the history of the club and its success. When people have such links, there is no reason for change Â— unless they want it. I know the club will do everything possible to keep the players they want to keep at the club."<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Easy for him to say, cos he expect to be given the sack at the end of this season... </span></div>
