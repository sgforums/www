              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: windowtext; "><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong>'s new owner John W Henry will travel to Merseyside to meet manager Roy Hodgson and his players on Saturday and tell them: I’m here to win the Premier League.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Another day of twists and high drama in the battle for </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> ownership ended at </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">4.30pm</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> on Friday when Henry’s American company New England Sports Ventures paid the £300million needed to wrestle control from the discredited Texan duo of Tom Hicks and George Gillett.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">On Friday night Henry immediately convened an emergency board meeting in the </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">London</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> offices of </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">’s solicitors Slaughter &amp; May to discuss the way forward for a club who are third from the bottom of the Barclays Premier League ahead of Sunday's Merseyside derby at Everton. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">It is understood Henry will head to Liverpool’s training ground, where he is expected to address the club’s players this morning and meet manager Hodgson, who earlier in the day pleaded publicly for time to turn his team’s season around.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Henry talked of his new acquisition to the media gathered outside Slaughter &amp; May, adding: ‘We have a history of winning and we will do whatever it takes. I am proud and humbled to be here and we have a lot of work to do.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">‘I can’t tell you how happy I am to have finally done this deal. I have no idea about how much the deal is worth as at the moment I can hardly tell you what day it is.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">After a day that saw a final, desperate bid from Hicks and Gillett to thwart the deal fail, </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">’s creditors, the Royal Bank of </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Scotland</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">, signalled they had received the £237m owed to them late in the afternoon. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Henry spoke only briefly to say that he won’t be present at Sunday's derby game — preferring to attend a home game at Anfield first — and stopped short of making any firm promises about how much he will spend on players or when he will commit the club to a new stadium.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">He added: ‘It is too early to say what we are going to do. We are not here with a lot to say but we will be doing a lot of listening. We have a lot to learn but our actions will speak for themselves.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Henry confirmed he had not borrowed to complete the deal. He was flanked by chairman Martin Broughton and chief executive Christian Purslow, who between them saw off the challenges of Hicks and Gillett in the courts this week. Broughton will remain as chairman in the short term but, having been appointed by RBS merely to arrange a sale, it is thought unlikely the chairman of British Airways will be asked to extend his involvement with the club.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">He was cheered by </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> fans in </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">London</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> on Friday, and said: ‘Every football fan knows that the most nerve-wracking way of winning a match is by penalties. But the important thing is we have won and we have got the right result. I will stay on as chairman in a transitional role as the new owner decides how he wants to run the club.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Earlier in the day, manager Hodgson was asked questions about his future as he looks to beat Everton and bring relief to a side who have won once in the Premier League this season. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">He said: ‘It’s a sad day for everything if, after a bad start of six or seven games, people think the solution is to find someone else with a magic wand. We all know a magic wand solution doesn’t exist. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">‘I would be very disappointed if, after such a short time to do the job, people decided they wanted to get someone else in. I know I can turn the situation around. But I will have to be given support and I will have to be given the patience to do it. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'I have a three-year contract. If someone wants to get rid of me, presumably they would have to pay it up.’ </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">So what would have happened if the Premier League had done as asked, with all that lovely hindsight, and stopped Tom Hicks and George Gillett buying </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">?</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Pandemonium, that is what. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Rancour. Demonstrations in the streets around Anfield, a storm of cyber-protests and phone-in fury. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Maybe a YouTube video in which obstructing such a noble business venture would be compared to seeing family members sexually assaulted, maybe with your eyes fixed open like Alex in A Clockwork Orange. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Do not kid yourselves that Richard Scudamore, the Premier League chief executive, or his pernickety legal team would have been held up as heroes. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">They would have been vilified, accused of standing in the way of progress, of favouring Manchester United and Chelsea, of needlessly obstructing the next stage in the evolution of Liverpool Football Club.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">There are a lot of what Americans call wiseacres around now, talking as if all true Kopites saw through Hicks and Gillett’s bluster from the start, but were betrayed by the inertia of the authorities.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">They, presumably, were not the ones with the star-spangled banners, chanting ‘</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">USA</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">USA</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">’ on the day the damn Yankees rode into town.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">The High Court heard that the former owners made impossible promises. Yet the Premier League were reliant on the same bold pronouncements as the club and its fans.</span></span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>‘A great step forward,’ said former chairman David Moores.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">‘Great for </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">, our supporters and shareholders,’ proclaimed former chief executive Rick Parry.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">‘We have purchased the club with no debt on the club,’ announced Gillett. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">His partner, Hicks, meanwhile, was owner of the Texas Rangers baseball franchise when they won the American League West Division in 1998 and 1999 and made Alex Rodriguez the highest paid player in the game.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">So what were the Premier League to do? They had no more information other than what was placed in front of them by the previous board and the new owners.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">What would their reason be for blocking the takeover? A feeling in their water? Feminine intuition? Bad mojo? A hunch?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">New England Sports Ventures are full of promises now. John Henry, the new owner, spoke poetically of rising at dawn to catch the light on a deserted Anfield and the locals lapped it up. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Again, he seemed genuine enough.</span> </p>

              <p class="artSplitter"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><strong>He also talked more practically of investment and redevelopment and the supporters are foursquare behind both. Yet who knows what the future holds?</strong> </span></p>
              <p class="artSplitter"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The supporters of West Ham United were once very excited about their Icelandic owners; Alexandre Gaydamak was considered a dream come true at </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Portsmouth</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">.</span></p>
              <p class="artSplitter"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Now imagine if the Premier League refused to take John Henry’s statements at face value and intervened in the NESV takeover.  </span></p>
              <p class="artSplitter"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Imagine if they placed a fresh raft of stipulations on the deal to ensure no repeat of the Hicks-Gillett fiasco.</span></p>
              <p class="artSplitter"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Suppose they said that, to protect the interests of clubs and their supporters, all takeovers from here could not be made with borrowed capital, minimising the risk of leverage in the future.</span></p>
              <p class="artSplitter"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">And imagine if Henry studied this red tape with mounting horror, turned tail and fled?</span></p>
              <p class="artSplitter"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Would Scudamore be saluted for his rigorous stance?</span></p>
              <p class="artSplitter"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Would </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> supporters concede that nothing can be guaranteed, that NESV look to be going increasingly cold on building a new stadium and that a feature of their ownership of the Boston Red Sox has been a steep rise in ticket prices?</span></p>
              <p class="artSplitter"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Would they buffalo.</span></p>
              <p class="artSplitter"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> fans would be up in arms. There is the contradiction: everyone wants the Premier League to be football’s policeman, but only once a crime is committed.</span></p>
              <p class="artSplitter"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Now we know Hicks and Gillett are charlatans, the cry is that they should have been stopped.</span></p>
              <p class="artSplitter"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">At the time, however, all </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> supporters coveted was a wad of dollar bills.</span></p>
              <p class="artSplitter"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Only the names have changed. If the NESV takeover goes wrong, the blame will land at the Premier League’s door.</span></p>
              <p class="artSplitter"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Why didn’t they do something? </span></p>
              <p class="artSplitter"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The reality is, unless laws are being broken, what is there to do?</span></p>
              <p class="artSplitter"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Scudamore can only hope that </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">’s current chairman is a better judge of character than the last one was.</span></p>

              <p>No point condemning this early seriously. what happens if he did it even if his mouth is too big? Since you said it need time and careful planning, then give them some time for god sake.
