              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">KENNY DALGLISH ripped into his Liverpool flops — blasting: "You let the club down."</h2>
              <p>They finished with NINE men as Charlie Adam and Martin Skrtel were sent off for two bookings.</p>
              <p>Kop boss Dalglish rapped: "The boys are going to be upset after that and so they should. Liverpool FC expects more than that — a 4-0 defeat.</p>
              <p>"The players take pride in the club but giving away an early goal was the start of our downfall."</p>
              <p>Dalglish held a high-powered meeting with ref boss Mike Riley last week to talk over Liverpool's yellow-card problems but he flatly refused to put the boot in on shamed Adam and Skrtel.</p>
              <p>The two red cards dished out by ref Mike Jones means Liverpool have the worst disciplinary record in the top flight.</p>
              <p>Yet Dalglish is adamant his side do not have any problems with officials.</p>
              <p>He said: "We cannot dictate interpretation in any way, shape or form. It's better to just leave it.</p>
              <p>"You can talk about anyone being undisciplined. We have a good record for discipline.</p>
              <p>"We'll look at the video and, if there is something wrong, we'll correct it. You never saw Liverpool players running to the ref to dispute a decision so it's no discipline problem.</p>
              <p>"We'll try to get over this before we worry about anything else like the injury to Steve Gerrard."</p>
              <p>Luka Modric opened the scoring with a blockbuster and Liverpool were finished off with a double from Emmanuel Adebayor on his home debut plus a first of the season for Jermain Defoe.</p>

              <p><strong>Spurs boss Harry Redknapp refused to condemn Adam for his red card, which came after a fierce tackle on Scott Parker, but insists Skrtel got what he deserved for decking Gareth Bale. </strong></p>
              <p>He said: "Skrtel had problems coping with Gareth. I've no sympathy. He already had a yellow, so you don't lift someone up on the halfway line to get another."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>By Graham Poll </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>I'm glad that Liverpool had two players sent off on Sunday; not because I don't like them or Kenny Dalglish and certainly not because I enjoy seeing players sent off; far from it.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">I was pleased because the referee at White Hart Lane, Mike Jones, could easily have been affected by the furore that followed Dalglish' criticism of referees so far this season following the Reds defeat at Stoke last weekend. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">I felt at the time that the Scot's attack was a well considered tirade to both deflect criticism away from Liverpool's defeat and apply pressure to referees in future games.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">Dalglish even had a meeting with PGMOL referee manager, Mike Riley, following his complaints and Riley will have assured him that there is no substance to Liverpool's belief that there is a vendetta against his side. </span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">Such an assurance should not be needed but the mere fact it had been made could have affected the referee for Liverpool's next Premier League game.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">It was always going to be a tough away assignment for Liverpool and they chose to play an over aggressive way which Jones handled perfectly. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">Charlie Adam had to be cautioned for pulling Luka Modric back after being beaten in midfield. To then lunge into a challenge just 15 minutes later was crazy and Adam can consider himself fortunate not to be shown a straight red card as he caught Scott Parker very high up and with some force. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">Jones also could not be faulted for his consistency. Martin Skrtel was cautioned for pulling back Gareth Bale and was dismissed for another ill-judged and unnecessary tackle on the same player.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">Last weekend I suggested that rather than focus on referees Dalglish should work on his players finishing after they missed a hatful of chances at The Britannia Stadium; this week it must be work with players on when to make challenges. There can be no further attempt to cover up his teams failings by blaming referees. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">My last word on the excellent and well deserved 4-0 win for Spurs would be to congratulate Jones, a referee I have often criticised for his tolerant approach. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">Yesterday he was strong and consistent and should be heartened by the praise he got from all quarters. Proof that the way to excel at officiating is to be positive and decisive when necessary – well done Mike.</span></span></p>

              <p>The stage is set for captain Steven Gerrard's return from a long-term groin injury.</p>
              <p>Gerrard, 31, has been out since March with the problem, but is ready to answer the manager's call.</p>
              <p>The Reds have placed greater importance on the Carling Cup this season with no European football at Anfield.</p>
              <p>And King Kenny reckons a win over Championship high-fliers Brighton would go some way to erasing the memory of the 4-0 thumping at White Hart Lane.</p>
              <p>Dalglish said: "The fans supported us fantastically and I think the boys will bear that in mind and look forward to repaying them in some way.</p>
              <p>"Sunday didn't please anybody and the players were really disappointed.</p>
              <p>"We have got to get ourselves right and concentrate on ourselves.</p>
              <p>"We are pleased to be in the Carling Cup and our intention is to stay in it for as long as we possibly can."</p>
              <p>Dalglish plans to play a strong team at the Amex Stadium and faces a key decision over whether to bring back Gerrard.</p>
              <p>If he does, it is sure to pile the pressure on Scottish midfielder Charlie Adam, who misses the game through suspension after his sending-off at White Hart Lane.</p>
              <p>Striker Craig Bellamy is likely to make his first start of his second spell while fellow new boy Sebastian Coates is also set for a full debut.</p>
              <p>The Uruguayan gets his chance with Martin Skrtel suspended and Daniel Agger ruled out for around a month.</p>
              <p>Agger fell heavily in the first half of Sunday's defeat and had to be replaced.</p>
              <p>Dalglish added: "Daniel has got a fractured rib, so he's struggling a bit.</p>
              <p>"We'll have a strong team out at Brighton and expect a difficult game. We need to show the same attitude we did at Exeter.</p>
              <p>"Brighton are doing well after getting promotion and were sitting on top of the table until they lost to Leicester.</p>
              <p>"Our players were totally professional when we played at Exeter and we'll have to do the same again if we want to get a result."</p>
