              <p> </p>
              <p>Joey Barton started the process of repaying Newcastle for their faith
              in him by helping to fire them to a first Barclays Premier League
              victory in eight games by beating West Brom 2-1.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 26-year-old midfielder, making his first start for the club since
              being released from jail, converted a ninth-minute penalty to set the
              Magpies on their way to only their second league win of the season and
              manager Joe Kinnear's first.</p>
              <p>Barton,
              who was pelted with coins and bottles as he warmed up during the derby
              defeat at Sunderland on Saturday, started the healing process, but it
              was ultimately Obafemi Martins' 42nd-minute header that won the day and
              lifted his side out of the relegation zone.</p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=242597&amp;league=ENG.1&amp;cc=4716#quotes"></a></p>
              <p>But
              a crowd of 45,801 endured a tense finish after the Magpies failed to
              make the most of the chances they created and saw substitute Ishmael
              Miller pull one back for the Baggies with 25 minutes remaining.</p>
              <p>Indeed,
              had keeper Shay Given, who had kept out James Morrison before the
              break, not made a vital block from Miller eight minutes later, the
              visitors might have gone home with a point.</p>
              <p>Barton has found
              himself the subject of more column inches than he might care to
              remember over the last 18 months or so, but had he chosen to write the
              script for this evening, he may have done it in this way.</p>
              <p>The
              game was only nine minutes old, with the Magpies having already forced
              Baggies keeper Scott Carson into a smart reaction save, when the former
              Manchester City midfielder slid the ball into the box for Shola Ameobi,
              who tapped it past defender Ryan Donk and was then promptly upended by
              the defender.</p>
              <p>Had Michael Owen been on the pitch instead of nursing a groin injury, he would have stepped up and placed the ball on the spot.</p>
              <p>But
              he was not, and as soon as referee Mike Dean raised his arm, Barton had
              only one thought in his mind, just as he had done at Fulham last season
              when he scored his only previous goal for the club.</p>
              <p>His strike
              was firm, Carson went the wrong way, and the ball nestled in the net,
              sparking mass celebrations both on and off the pitch, some for a small
              step in the rehabilitation of a player whose reputation precedes him,
              but most in relief after a traumatic few months on Tyneside.</p>
              <p>But
              if the home fans expected a procession from that point on - and if they
              have followed the club for any time, they would have known how unwise
              that was - they were soon to be corrected.</p>
              <p>If anything, West Brom
              enjoyed the better of the possession as they passed the ball swiftly
              and accurately to leave their opponents chasing shadows at times.</p>
              <p>But
              crucially, they lacked the cutting edge to really trouble the Magpies
              at the back, at least until their big moment arrived 10 minutes before
              the break.</p>
              <p>Robert Koren expertly turned Jonathan Greening's pass
              into the path of Morrison to leave a flat-footed home defence in
              no-man's land, but as he has done so often in the past, Given came to
              the rescue with a fine save to preserve his clean sheet.</p>
              <p>By
              contrast, Newcastle looked more than capable of adding to their tally
              as the returning Jonas Gutierrez, Damien Duff, Ameobi and Martins
              repeatedly stretched West Brom.</p>
              <p>Habib Beye skied a shot high over
              the bar after Ameobi had carved Mowbray's men open down the left with
              37 minutes gone, but the Senegal international made amends within five
              minutes.</p>
              <p>The full-back, supporting Duff down the right wing,
              skipped past Paul Robinson to drill a cross into the middle where
              Martins, with the help of a deflection off defender Jonas Olsson,
              powered a header home.</p>
              <p>An open game continued in similar vein
              after the restart with Martins' pace a constant threat to the Baggies,
              but Iglesias Borja Valero and Greening pulling the strings at the other
              end.</p>
              <p>Tony Mowbray made a significant change with 54 minutes gone
              when he replaced midfielder Chris Brunt with striker Miller, although
              the newcomer unwittingly blocked a goal-bound effort from team-mate
              Morrison two minutes later.</p>
              <p>Morrison was proving a key figure as
              the Magpies laboured, but it was Koren who opened the door for Miller
              to drag his side back into the game, wrong-footing Fabricio Coloccini
              to allow the striker to round Given and slide the ball into the empty
              net.</p>
              <p>He might have levelled within eight minutes had Given not
              reacted smartly when Morrison's free-kick rebounded to the striker off
              the defensive wall.</p>
              <p>Substitute Xisco and Duff both passed up late chances to ease the anxiety, but their side managed to hang on.</p>

              <li id="quotes"><strong>Kinnear building momentum</strong></li>
              <li>Joe Kinnear hopes his first win as Newcastle interim manager can build a sense
              of momentum at the club.
              ''I know its an old cliche but nobody wants to be in the bottom three,''
              Kinnear told <em>Sky Sports 2.</em> </li>
              <li id="quotes">
              <p>''Nobody likes being in that position but if we can carry on now and get a
              second win then that would be great.</p>
              <p>''If we can get a second victory back to back then it would be a completely
              different picture.''</p>
              <p>''We started the second half too cautiously.</p>
              <p>''We kept defending deeper and deeper because we were trying to protect what we
              had but we sat back instead of going for it and we caused ourselves some
              problems.''</p>
