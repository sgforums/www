Third-placed Liverpool, have not conceded a goal at Anfield in nine league outings and are unbeaten at home this season.<br><br>United, though, can draw encouragement from an outstanding record on the road, having won 10 and drawn two of their 14 away games in the league this season. It is likely to be a classic example of an immoveable object meeting an irresistible force.<br><br>Liverpool suffered two heavy home defeats by Arsenal, conceding a total of nine goals, in early January but both came in cup fixtures where manager Rafa Benitez selected weakened teams.<br><br>Benitez, who will try to defend a 2-1 lead at home to Barcelona in their Champions League first knockout round second leg on Tuesday, faces a delicate selection dilemma. By resting players against United he risks a repeat of the Arsenal defeats and the end of his team's proud home league record.<br><br><strong>European Champions League</strong><br><br>But Benitez also knows he will need a full-strength side to eliminate European champions Barcelona three days later. United, fresh from securing their place in the FA Cup quarter-finals with Tuesday's replay win at Reading, also have a Champions League clash to prepare for.<br><br>Alex Ferguson's men hold a 1-0 lead going into their home game with French club Lille. Liverpool kick off against United at 8.45, four and a half hours before Chelsea visit Portsmouth.<br><br>If Liverpool win at lunch time, a victory for Chelsea would cut United's advantage to six points, with the Londoners having a game in hand. Chelsea also entertain United at Stamford Bridge on April 15.<br><br>Elsewhere, fourth-placed Arsenal host Reading while third-bottom Charlton Athletic travel to bottom club Watford and Aston Villa visit Fulham. Wigan Athletic also meet Manchester City, Newcastle United face Middlesbrough and Everton play Sheffield United.<br><br>On Sunday, West Ham United entertain in-form Tottenham Hotspur and Blackburn Rovers travel to Bolton Wanderers.<br></div>

DonÂ’t believe them. This is the most anticipated, the most ferocious, the most exciting match of the Premiership season for these two powerhouses. The culture and history of this fixture, the hatred between the two sets of supporters and the tension means that defeat is a frightening prospect.<br><br>Liverpool are unbeaten at home for 30 Premiership games, stretching back to October 2005, but they have beaten Manchester United only once in the last nine Premiership games. They are due a win. But they will host a United team in imperious form, with Paul Scholes and Cristiano Ronaldo leading the drive to reclaim the title. Scholes will look to run the midfield, possibly up against Steven Gerrard Â— not a contest for the faint-hearted.<br><br>There is pace in this United team. They are almost a clone of the side which had Roy Keane and Paul Ince in midfield, Ryan Giggs on the left and the speed of Andrei Kanchelskis. They would pull you in and then hit you on the break.<br><br>Kanchelskis scored 15 Premiership goals from midfield in one season Â— a record he shares with Frank Lampard Â— and now they have Ronaldo. The winning goal against Fulham last weekend was a perfect example of their breakaway threat.<br><br>I have had some good Â— and some bad Â— experiences against United. Liverpool beat them 2-0 in 1994-95 and I scored.The previous season, I gave away a goal and we trailed 3-0.<br><br>We came back to 3-3 and then, in the last minute, I was one on one with Incey, I cut inside and bent a shot towards the top corner. It was the winner Â— until Peter Schmeichel produced a brilliant save.<br><br><strong>My five key personalities<br><br>RYAN GIGGS</strong><br><br>This will be RyanÂ’s 700th appearance for United and, after 16 trophies, we are talking about a remarkable footballer, a Premiership superstar. He does not behave like that, there is no flashiness about him, no modelling deals and the like. Which is probably why he has survived under Sir Alex Ferguson for so long. That and being a terrific player. He has altered his game, but he has not changed much. He still has spindly legs and a slight frame, but when he is running at you you are thinking: "Oh no, please pass it, donÂ’t embarrass me."<br><br>I once got in a one-on-one dash with him. I wasnÂ’t the quickest or the slowest. It felt like a 100metre sprint when it was really just a 30-yard burst into the Liverpool box. We reached the ball together, I appealed for a corner, he appealed for a penalty. And Eric Cantona scored from the spot. He has lost a touch of pace but he looks so comfortable. The role of dressing-room veteran seems to sit easily with him and he can still skin a full back, especially as he is playing with such freedom.<br><br>When he scored the opening goal against Fulham, he came through the centre and ended up the furthest forward, on the right of the attack, scoring with his left foot. He plays clever little passes up to the front men and then joins in. His running and his movement seem effortless. He is a finely-tuned athlete, which is why he has suffered a few hamstring injuries. But he can still take defenders to the cleaners with one shake of those snake hips.<br><br><strong>JAMIE CARRAGHER</strong><br><br>Liverpool have conceded only three goals at home in the league this season. Here is the main reason why. What I love most about Jamie is the desire and the hunger he shows to make it to this level. There was a time when I wasnÂ’t sure about my mate. He was playing right midfield or central midfield and didnÂ’t really look the part. Then one pre-season he came back and he had changed. He had worked on his strength and his stamina; at 18, he had left as a boy and come back as a man.<br><br>Now he deserves comparison with outstanding defenders such as Kolo Toure and John Terry. He shows no respect for any striker, he does not fear any challenge. Good job too, because after Wayne Rooney he will be up against Samuel EtoÂ’o!<br><br><strong>RAFAEL BENITEZ</strong><br><br>Despite having never beaten Manchester United in the League, Rafa has a team who can trouble them this time, if anyone can guess what team he will pick. I have a feeling he might rest some key men for this game, with Barcelona in mind. It would be a daring plan but you would not put it past Benitez.<br><br>The lads I speak to at Anfield have so much respect for him, for his attention to detail, his knowledge of the game, his training regime. Liverpool are very fit these days. He has three trophies, but not the Premiership scalp of Manchester United. Would he rather win on Saturday or see off Barcelona? I think we know the answer.<br><br><strong>NEMANJA VIDIC </strong><br><br>THE new Steve Bruce: Vidic has scored four goals and, like Bruce, he is a real threat from set plays. Watch him get his head to the ball in defence or attack. He is brave and strong. He will put his head in where it hurts. Jaap Stam took his time to settle at United but Vidic has slotted in comfortably alongside Rio Ferdinand Â— and he is only 25.<br><br>United have the joint-best defensive record in the country, conceding just 19 goals. You can see what an impact he has had by how much they missed him at Reading in the FA Cup on Tuesday. He takes responsibility, he will mix it with the centre forward and he can deal with quick ones too. Solid operator.<br><br><strong>HENRIK LARSSON </strong><br><br>This is due to be LarssonÂ’s final Premiership game for United. He is a big-match player, as he so often proved for Celtic, and he will look to go with a goal. He has scored two in 10 games since arriving on loan, but he allowed Sir Alex Ferguson to rest Louis Saha in that time, ready for the run-in. I still cannot see how he can walk away from this, however Â— the chance of a title, an FA Cup Final and back-to-back European Cups.<br><br>Wayne Rooney will have learned so much from him, watching his runs and movement. A masterstroke by Sir Alex to bring him in and IÂ’m not convinced this is the last we will see of him in the Premiership.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://images.skysports.com/images/playerpics06_07/Experts/le%20tissier%20main.jpg"><br>Kop in for a shock - Le Tissier<br><br>This is always one of the biggest games of the season, but this is probably as big as it it gets. If United go to Anfield and get beat then it really does throw the title race open and it gives Chelsea the belief they can catch them. The belief that they can close the gap if they win the meeting between the two at Stamford Bridge. If United go to Anfield and win, then it a massive step towards regaining that Premiership crown.<br><br>A lot of people have been saying the Fulham game last week, when they somehow scraped a 2-1 win, will be the moment we look back on and say 'that's where they won the title' - but I disagree. Most people, myself included, expected them to go to Craven Cottage and win, as I am sure Jose Mourinho did. But Liverpool at Anfield is a different matter. People will be expecting them to drop points here, so if they can go there and win, no-one will remember Fulham.<br><br>They are in such good form right now I just can't see them slipping up, although if you offered him the draw right now I am sure Sir Alex Ferguson would snap your hand off! That is not only down to the situation at the top of the table, but the terrific form Liverpool are in at home. They haven't lost there for something like 18 months and you've got to say there haven't been many draws in there either. It's been a phenomenal run.<br><br>That sort of form should be enough to be pushing United and Chelsea, but for my mind, Rafa Benitez is now counting the cost of all that early-season tinkering. Steven Gerrard has said they dropped too many 'silly points' and I said it at the time. Early on is when you need those points in the bag, because one thing you can't do in the Premier League is give the others a head start.<br><br>Their home form was never really an issue and never really where Rafa made those strange selection decisions - although I just wonder if he will go for Peter Crouch here, if he's recovered from that kick in the face. I  know Dirk Kuyt and Craig Bellamy seem to be the pair he favours but with the Barcelona game coming up in midweek, I wouldn't be surprised to see him rest one of those. Maybe Crouch can unsettle Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic.<br><br>Because of those lost points, the Barca game is bigger than this for Liverpool - even though the fans might disagree. I can't see Rafa, particularly after what happened against Arsenal in the FA Cup, resting too many because if this one goes badly wrong the fans will not let him forget it. But he can't afford to lose anyone for Tuesday night.<br><br>I know United have a slender lead against Lille, but I can't see that causing them any problems and I can't really see Fergie resting anyone here. Even if they pick a couple of injuries I can see them winning their second leg quite comfortable. That means Gary  Neville, Michael Carrick, Paul Scholes, Cristiano Ronaldo, Ryan Giggs, Henrik Larsson and Wayne Rooney back at Anfield - and it means United taking another massive step towards the title.<br><br><strong>LE TISS PREDICTS</strong><br>AWAY WIN - This, along with the game at Chelsea, will be the ones United have been really looking at in their run-in and because of that I can't see them being beaten. Anfield will be heaving and Liverpool at home are pretty formidable right now, but United have so many experienced players - and fresh ones at that - that if any side in the Premiership can handle that, it is them. I also think they are decent enough to keep Liverpool at bay as well, so I fancy a 2-0 win.<br><br><strong>MATT'S MAIN MAN</strong><br>WAYNE ROONEY - He is due a big performance and I wouldn't be surprised if he produces it on his return to Merseyside. He might have been a little quiet of late, but he is still only a young lad and has every right to dip in form - and he will keep doing so until well into his mid-20's. But even when he's quiet he has still been showing those flashes that make him so special and I can see him hitting top form over the next few weeks.<br><br></div>
