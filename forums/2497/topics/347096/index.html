              <p><strong>LONDON - David Beckham looks likely to make his 108th England
              appearance next week after coach Fabio Capello recalled him to the
              squad on Saturday having been impressed by the midfielder's fitness
              since he joined AC Milan.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Beckham, who turns 34 in May,
              will equal Bobby Moore's record number of caps for an outfield player
              if he plays in the friendly against Spain in Seville on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>"He is better than he was six
              months ago," Capello told reporters. "He is fit now. This is important
              for David and for us. And every player in the squad has to play, not
              just train.</p>
              <p>"He is a very important player
              and I've watched him in one game in Milan and (deputies) Italo Galbiati
              and Franco Baldini saw his other games. He is getting better and better
              with each game."</p>
              <p>Capello has been delighted with
              the form of the former Manchester United and Real Madrid player since
              he was loaned from Los Angeles Galaxy to the Serie A club.</p>
              <p>The former England captain,
              initially discarded by Capello's predecessor Steve McClaren, scored
              twice in his first five appearances.</p>
              <p>Capello, who managed Beckham at Real Madrid in 2006-07, said he had no interest in players' personal milestones.</p>
              <p>"I never think about this when I choose a player or make a substitution," he said.</p>
              <p>Beckham, on loan at Milan until
              March 9, wants to stay in Italy permanently although the Serie A club
              said on Saturday the Galaxy had rejected their first offer for the
              midfielder.</p>
              <p>Capello said he could
              understand Beckham's desire to remain at Milan, a club he managed for
              six years and led to nine major trophies including the Champions League
              in 1994.</p>
              <p>"The game is different in Serie
              A," Capello added. "There is more pressure. It is stronger. That is the
              difference. I think he wants to stay for those reasons -- it's
              exciting, Milan are a good team.</p>
              <p>"But he has to choose. I've
              never spoken to him about it, that is not my job. It's AC Milan or Los
              Angeles' problems. David is very fit now and this is important."</p>
