              <h3>SPURS are trying to re-sign Liverpool’s Robbie Keane. And a bid anywhere near the £20m the league leaders paid in July could see the Irishman make a January return to White Hart Lane.</h3>
              <p>Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp wants to test how much patience Rafa Benitez has lost with the striker, who was an unused sub during yesterday’s 3-1 win at Blackburn. But even if Rafa looked to cash in, the Anfield board would need convincing of the merits, as the Merseysiders’ would inevitably have to accept a loss. </p>
              <p>They agreed to pay Spurs £20m in instalments, which means Redknapp could offer part of the summer fee and waive the estimated £10m still owed. </p>
              <p>Keane’s dream move to Merseyside has gone sour just five months into his Anfield career as he’s struggled with confidence and form. He effectively has until the end of the month to convince his manager Spurs’ interest should be rebuffed as Rafa plots a radical shake-up of his squad in January.</p>
              <h4>Opportunity</h4>
              <p>Benitez wants funds to remedy summer transfer mistakes, none of whom started at Ewood Park. Liverpool’s recent signings have failed to have an impact, with only Albert Riera acquitting himself reasonably well.</p>
              <p>Left back Andrea Dossena, who cost £7m from Udinese, will be offloaded back to Italy at the first opportunity. Right-back Phillip Degen, who was given a £2m signing on fee and £38,000-a-week salary when he joined from Borussia Dortmund, hasn’t featured in the Premier League due to a succession of injuries.</p>
              <p>Rafa wants to bring Emile Heskey back to Anfield for £3m, as well as two full-backs to compete with Fabio Aurelio and Alvaro Arbeloa.</p>
              <h4>Lure</h4>
              <p>There are those at Anfield who still hope Rafa can be convinced into a rethink on Michael Owen at the right price, especially if Keane is sold, but the manager opposes the idea.</p>
              <p>Keane grew up as a Liverpool fan and always wanted to become a idol on the Kop. After starting at Wolves, he had spells at Coventry, Inter Milan and Leeds before finally settling at Spurs, where he became club captain.</p>
              <p>Last season he formed one of best partnerships in the Premier League with Dimitar Berbatov but could not resist the lure of Anfield. But he has only scored four goals for the Reds, has played 90 minutes just three times and been substituted 15 times.</p>

              <p>Keane is just going through a period of low confidence.</p>
              <p>The same thing happened to Crouch when he arrived at Anfield.</p>
              <p>The only thing is that he cannot change his style to suit the lone striker role desired by Ah Ben.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben is similarly to Scholari as he sometimes obessessed with his 4-4-1-1 formation.</p>
              <p>It would take a talented striker like torres to hold his ball and his front against the defenders.</p>
              <p>If liverpool have the fund, they should buy a playmaker to support keane or babbel.</p>
              <p>As for Ah Ben,  he have to learn from the rovers game that riera should stick to the right as he is the few players who can hold the possession up front without losing it.</p>
              <p>The rest of the players are plain hopeless.</p>
              <p>As the press have suggested, give Babbel a chance to be the striker.</p>

              <p>Ah Ben have lousy past record of buying spanish and dutch players that cannot adopt the pace of the BPL.</p>
              <p>Except for a few players, the failure for the buy by Ah Ben is pretty high.</p>
              <p>That is why he have to buy Keane since he is a proven scorer in the BPL.</p>
              <p>What Ah Ben failed to realise that Keane is not a team player, and would rather play on his own style instead of playing on what is instructed by Ah Ben.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben love obedient and normal players like Kuyt that played without complaining.</p>
              <p>Keane got the taste of the ben-dicine as he was completely benched although he was warming up at 63 mins.</p>
              <p>From his reaction on the substitution during the west ham match, I dun think Keane will stay around to prove his point to Ah Ben.</p>
