            <div class='col-md body'>Arsene Wenger today revealed he never had any intention of walking out on Arsenal after confirming a new three-year deal with the Premier League club.<br><br>This morning's announcement brings to an end speculation that the highly-respected coach would follow former vice-chairman David Dein and star man Thierry Henry out of the Emirates Stadium at the end of the season.<br><br>Since his arrival at Arsenal just over a decade ago, 57-year-old Wenger has enjoyed unprecedented success, securing three Premier League titles and four FA Cup triumphs as well as reaching the final of the Champions League in 2006.<br><br>Today Wenger maintained he wanted to stay at the helm and continue his plans to build a new all-conquering squad.<br><br>'My heart is tied to this football club so signing a new deal was always my intention. Arsenal is the club of my life,' said Wenger, in a statement on the club's official website.<br><br>'I have been entrusted with complete freedom to implement and execute my plans on what will make the team successful and that means I have a responsibility to the fans to deliver silverware and also a responsibility to the players to help turn our potential into prizes.<br><br>'This club has deep-seated roots and a tremendous heritage and it is my aim to uphold these important values and help create new history for future generations to recount.'<br><br>The terms of the new deal - which will keep Wenger at the Emirates Stadium until 2011 - have not been made public.<br><br>But it is understood to be worth around Â£4million a season to the Frenchman, making him one of the highest paid bosses in the Premier League.<br><br>However, the prospect of Wenger now being handed a massive transfer kitty when the window re-opens remains unlikely.<br><br>The Frenchman clearly has funds available following a summer surplus from players sold. However, Wenger has long championed the alternative way of earning success through developing a side rather than simply going out and buying the best talent around.<br><br>Arsenal's chairman Peter Hill-Wood said: 'Arsene has a special ability to develop talented players and turn them into world-class stars, a quality that is admired here at the club and indeed around the world.<br><br>'With Arsene continuing to manage the team, I am sure we can look forward to more exciting football and success on the pitch.<br><br>'We have been at Emirates Stadium for a year now and go from strength to strength off the pitch.'<br><br>Despite all the uncertainty and predictions of another unimpressive campaign ahead following the loss of Henry, Arsenal have opened the new season in some style.<br><br>The Gunners comfortably beat Sparta Prague to qualify for the lucrative group stages of the Champions League and are currently second in the Barclays Premier League table, unbeaten in four matches.<br></div>
