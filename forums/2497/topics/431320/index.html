              </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 12pt; " lang="EN-AU"> </span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'> </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Guus Hiddink dropped the biggest hint yet that he is ready to turn his back on Turkey and return to club football as </span></strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><strong><span style="color: #003580; text-decoration: none; ">Chelsea</span></strong></a><strong> manager. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Hiddink repeatedly refused to commit his long-term future to the Turkish FA and even confessed he was feeling the urge to return to club football after five years on the international circuit. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>He also confirmed he had been in regular contact with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich since ending a three-month spell as temporary boss two years ago.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Speaking from the Turkish training camp in Holland, ahead of Friday's Euro 2012 qualifier against Belgium, Hiddink said: 'At the moment there's nothing concrete to talk about, but if there was a concrete offer I would think about it. We'll play this game and then see. The moment things are concrete, I'll go to where I have to be.' </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>It did not go down well with the Turkish media. One asked: 'We cannot get clear answers from you about your future, there are English reporters here, so what is going on?' </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But Hiddink insisted he was simply focused on winning. 'We'll play this game and then we'll see,' he said. Defeat in Brussels on Friday will leave Turkey unlikely to qualify for Euro 2012, which could make them accept a compensation bid from Chelsea and release Hiddink from a deal which expires next year. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Hiddink signed a two-year contract worth £3.5million-a-year net last year but came under pressure after losing qualifiers against Germany and Azerbaijan. He spends most of his time in Holland and will lose chief ally Mahmut Ozgener if the Turkish FA president is not re-elected next month. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Hiddink said: 'I can imagine that if we lost to Belgium they would say it is better to quit, as they did after we lost to Germany and Azerbaijan.' </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>One theory cited against the 64-year-old's return to Stamford Bridge is his reluctance to return to the rigours of club football just before receiving his pension papers from the Dutch government. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But Hiddink said: 'I have the energy, I'm not feeling that I should sit back. As long as I feel fresh and as long as the young people, the players, are not getting annoyed with me, then I will continue. So far, I feel energetic enough to go on. </span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>'Sir Alex Ferguson is a lesson for us. I read that his wife told him to get lost, to go, not to sit in the garden and do the gardening. Get back to work. My wife thinks I'm a lousy gardener. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'When you're working at a club with a lot of joy, you say it might be good to be a national team manager because you'll be more flexible and you'll have fewer games but, when you've been working a long time with a national team and still have that energy then you like to work every day.' </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Asked about his remaining ambitions, Hiddink said: 'When I was working in Spain in the mid-1990s, I thought I'd do one more year and then go into another sportsrelated business. That was my plan, but now we're 15 years on.' </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>In his three months at Chelsea, from February to May 2009, the club dropped only four points from 13 Barclays Premier League games, finishing second. They won the FA Cup and were beaten by Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final when Andres Iniesta struck in the last minute. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Thanks to Abramovich' s influence, he was able to combine the Chelsea job with managing Russia. 'That was another situation,' he said. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'Roman Abramovich was a strong supporter of the Russia team. We spoke to the president of the Russian FA and agreed it all matched but that was an exceptional situation. You must only do one job.' </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Hiddink was hugely popular at Chelsea, and the players gave him a limited edition Rolex watch worth £200,000. John Terry is among many who stayed in touch. 'I still have the watch,' said Hiddink. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'But I never wear a watch. Last year, I got one from the Turkish players when we had a tour in the US. I'd just started with the team and the first training session went on for two hours and 10 minutes. The next day they gave me a watch to remind me I should check the time.' </span></p>
