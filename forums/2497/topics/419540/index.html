              <h1>Edin Dzeko Juventus Ultimatum - Make Me An Offer In 48 Hours Or I’ll Join Manchester City</h1>
              <h2>- Dzeko wants Serie A and Juventus<br>- Juve have 48 hours to make an official bid<br>- If no offer is forthcoming, Dzeko will join Man City<br>- Wolfsburg &amp; City have already agreed transfer fee</h2>

              <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Pointing the way ¦ </strong>But where will Dzeko go?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Wolfsburg star </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Edin Dzeko</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> has given </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Juventus </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">48 hours to make him an official offer, or else he will complete his move to </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester City</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">, Goal International can reveal.<br></span></strong><br>The Bosnian has been the centre of intense media speculation over the past few weeks, with the English press adamant that only personal terms separate the hitman from finalising his transfer to Eastlands.<br><br>The Italian media has long since claimed that Dzeko would prefer a move to Serie A in order to join long-term admirers Juventus, who were very close to signing him last summer before they instead used up their one non-EU berth on CSKA Moscow’s Milos Krasic. The Old Lady did obtain an option on Dzeko, though, as part of the deal that saw Brazilian playmaker Diego move to Wolfsburg for a cut-price fee of €15.5 million.<br><br>Goal has now learned that Dzeko – who due to Serie A EU rules cannot join Juventus until the summer – is desperate to move to the Bianconeri at the end of the current campaign and has handed them a 48-hour ultimatum to present an official offer.<br><br><span style="color: #333332;">If this is not forthcoming, then Dzeko will instead complete his transfer to Manchester City, most likely on Thursday, for a fee in the region of €32m. City and Wolfsburg have already agreed upon a transfer fee, but the Bosnian has yet to give the green light as he clings onto hope of Juve.<br><br>A source close to the player told Goal: "Dzeko has made it clear many times that Serie A is his favourite league and that he wants Juventus.<br><br>"However, he cannot wait around forever. We are talking about one of the best forwards in the world and Edin must think as a professional too.<br><br>"He cannot wait any longer than 48 hours. It is in Juve's hands, but they are running out of time."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333332;">Dzeko’s heart is almost certainly not with Wolfsburg anymore. Goal Germany reports that at the club’s mid-season training camp in Marbella yesterday, the 24-year-old’s body language was very poor and he did not speak to any of his team-mates. Dzeko also refused any interviews after the session ended.<br><br>Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini confirmed in his pre-Arsenal match press conference that a fee with Wolfsburg has been settled.<br><br>"For Dzeko, I can say only one piece, that we have agreed with Wolfsburg, but we'll speak after Arsenal," he stated.<br><br>"I think Dzeko is a good player, all teams in Europe want him."<br><br><em>Tuttosport </em>claims that Juventus sporting director Giuseppe Marotta is considering tabling a bid today of €30m plus Malian midfielder Mohamed Sissoko for Dzeko. Bayern Munich are also attempting a late hijack, but are considered rank outsiders.</span></p>
