              <h2>Having overcome their demons of Craven Cottage, Arsenal have now targeted the Premier League, with the determination to win their first silverware for four years in style.</h2>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Last night's 4-0 win over Steve McClaren’s FC Twente banished to the history books Saturday’s dreadful performance in the 1-0 defeat at Fulham and, according to defender Gael Clichy, the style that returned to the Emirates Stadium could return them to former days of glory.</p>
              <p>“We had to do it for the fans because I think everyone is agreed that the Fulham game was not the way we play,” said Clichy. “Sometimes you can’t play your game but it’s the way you behave on the pitch and the fans have always been there for us since the first day I came to Arsenal.</p>
              <p>"The defeat at Fulham was a really big blow and we felt sorry about it but now it has passed and we have to do the right things for the fans. “The main objective now is to win something this year,” added Clichy. “But if we can do it the way we play, it is even better because football is to entertain people and to take pleasure and that’s what we are doing at Arsenal. We have to win things, I hope this year will be a good one but once again I am sure we can do it.</p>
              <p>“Saturday was a big disappointment and we have to remember what happened but we have to keep that behind and look forward. “For a club like Arsenal, we have to be at the top and to be at the top you have to play with the right spirit so that’s what we tried to do and we showed with the players we have got, if everyone is playing the same way, we can have a great result.”</p>
              <p>Clichy insisted the spirit at the Emirates was as strong as ever, adamant that the players are all behind captain William Gallas. Gallas has been the target for those attempting to identify Arsenal’s previously poor start and Clichy added: “I think last night he showed against Twente that he is a great player.</p>
              <p>“Everyone has a bad time – last year against Birmingham, I had a big mistake – that was my thing. Of course, William is a big player, a more experienced player and he is the captain so you have to look for someone to blame.</p>
              <p>“Unfortunately it is him but I don’t think the players think that is right. We don’t blame him for everything, everyone makes mistakes. I made a mistake like I told you and I think William is a great player and he scored again against Twente. Everyone is behind him and it will remain like this.”</p>
              <p>Clichy also urged the Arsenal fans to stop criticising Emmanuel Adebayor. The Togo striker started on the bench last night but when he was introduced he was the subject of booing from a small section, following his talk of leaving the club in the summer.</p>
              <p>Clichy said: “I think the big thing is to feel that you are wanted from your club, your manager, your team-mates and the fans. Ade is a big, big player and last year he showed he has the quality to be one of the best in Europe. So we just have to be behind him.</p>
              <p>“It is difficult, of course for the fans, but I am sure if he starts scoring goals and in December is on 15 or 20 goals, everything will be fine.”</p>
