              <p><span><strong>Liverpool midfielder Joe Cole hopes hard work will help change his luck and turn around a disappointing first season for him at his new club. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The 29-year-old moved from Chelsea on a free transfer in the summer but his Reds career got off to the worst possible start when he was sent off in the first match of the season against Arsenal. </span></p>
              <p><span>Since then he has suffered a number of injuries which have resulted in a stop-start campaign, where his infrequent appearances have mainly come in the Europa League.</span></p>
              <p><span>He does not look comfortable on the left-hand side of midfield but has to be thankful for the pitch time and got another 90 minutes under his belt in the 1-0 defeat away to Braga in the Europa League last 16 first leg tie last night. </span></p>
              <p><span>But Cole knows that is not enough and is determined to work out a solution to his difficulties. </span></p>
              <p><span>The England international said: 'I am just going day by day. I am enjoying my football and I love to go into training with a smile on my face. </span></p>
              <p><span>'I'm trying to get a run in the side and trying to get back to where I need to be. 'If you work hard you get a bit of luck here and there and I am sure my luck is around the corner. </span></p>
              <p><span>'This is a cracking club and I really think we are going in the right direction with Kenny Dalglish, Steve Clarke (first-team coach who also worked with Cole at Chelsea) and Damien Comolli (the director of football strategy).'</span></p>
              <p><span>Cole is one of a number of new arrivals at the club who have so far failed to produce their best form. </span></p>
              <p><span>The likes of Christian Poulsen and Milan Jovanovic have also been restricted to occasional appearances while the much-derided left-back Paul Konchesky lasted five months before he went out on loan to npower Championship club Nottingham Forest. <br></span></p>
