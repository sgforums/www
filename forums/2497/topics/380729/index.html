              <p><a href="http://www.goal.com/en-gb/teams/england/97/manchester-united">Manchester United</a> striker <a href="http://www.goal.com/en-gb/people/england/1909/michael-owen">Michael Owen</a> has questioned the 'injury-prone' label he's carried for much of his
                                      career, whilst once again stating that it is wrong to brand a forward
                                      as a poor performer if he does not score goals.<br><br>The Red Devils'
                                      hitman is of the opinion that strikers can sometimes have off days and
                                      still hit the back of the net, while they can go a few games without
                                      scoring despite putting on stellar performances.<br><br>"I don't think it takes a goal for me to play well," Owen said, according to the <em>Press Association</em>.<br><br>"I
                                      was average [during the League Cup game] against Barnsley but scored. I
                                      played really well against Bolton [Wanderers] and didn't. <br><br>"It just didn't get reflected.<br><br>"But that is how my career has gone. It is strange, but I am not particularly bothered about it."<br><br>During
                                      his time with Newcastle United, Owen had become a by-word for injury,
                                      but the 29-year-old remains defiant that he is not a player who is
                                      prone to injury.<br><br>"I get a bee in my bonnet about injuries," he said.<br><br>"When you talk about my career, I have two long-term injuries, that were linked probably.<br><br>"But they were not 'injury-prone' injuries. It is the little niggly ones
                                      that you can probably manage and eradicate from your game."<br><br>Owen
                                      had another hiccup with regards to injury in the club's victory over
                                      Wolfsburg in the Champions League. The striker had to be taken off
                                      within 20 minutes, but he maintained that it was only a preventive
                                      measure.<br><br>"The older you get, the more you learn about your body," he said.<br><br>"I came off before it was too late. If I had stayed on and done another
                                      sprint, maybe I would have done my groin and been out for a month.<br><br>"Fortunately I could feel what was happening, so I put my hand up and
                                      said I had to come off. I was back training four days later."</p>
