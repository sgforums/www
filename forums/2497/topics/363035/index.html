              <h1>Capello undecided on Kazakhstan keeper</h1>
              <p><br> <img src="http://fourfourtwo.com/contentimages/news/Capello23.jpg" alt="Capello23" align="right"> </p>
              <p><strong> ALMATY - England manager Fabio Capello
              will wait until the morning of the match to make a final
              decision on who will replace injured goalkeeper David James for
              Saturday's World Cup qualifier against Kazakhstan.</strong></p>
              <p>West Ham's Robert Green, former first choice Paul Robinson
              of Blackburn Rovers and West Bromwich Albion's Scott Carson are
              the keepers in the squad for the Group Six match.</p>
              <p>"I have more or less decided but tomorrow morning will be
              the last decision," Capello told a news conference on Friday.
              "All the goalkeepers that we have here are fit."</p>
              <p>Group leaders England have won all five of their matches and
              a victory in Almaty and then against Andorra at Wembley on
              Wednesday would leave them needing just three points from their
              last three qualifiers to secure a place at the 2010 World Cup in
              South Africa.</p>
              <p>"For me these two games will be very important," said
              Italian Capello. "I think they are the biggest steps to South
              Africa."</p>
              <p>The Kazakhs have won only one of their five games and were
              beaten 5-1 by Belarus last time out but England captain John
              Terry said his team would have to guard against what they expect
              to be a rejuvenated home side.</p>
              <p>"I think they will start very quickly," Terry said. "Their
              season is just beginning so they are going to be very fit and
              very sharp.</p>
              <p>"The game is going to be difficult," added Terry, who missed
              the 5-1 win over Kazakhstan at Wembley last October with a back
              injury.</p>
              <p>He said a number of players had found it difficult to sleep
              following the nine-hour flight from London to one of European
              soccer's furthest flung outposts, but all of them were fit and
              ready for the game.</p>
              <p>"We are prepared for the unexpected because it's going to be
              difficult tomorrow," he said.</p>
              <p>"We are really looking forward to these two games. We have
              got ourselves into a good position in the group -- but this game
              is going to be a tough one and all the players are feeling the
              same."</p>
