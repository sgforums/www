The Chelsea chief, who is fine-tuning his squad ahead of tomorrow's Premier League opener with Birmingham, expects the Brazilian to arrive before the August 31 transfer deadline.</strong><br><br>Mourinho said: "The situation with Alves is not much different from the situation with Arjen Robben, but the only thing I know is that we want to make our squad better. "Right back is a position where we feel we can improve, but that is not easy. We want a good player and Alves is a good player. I don't know what the offer is or what Sevilla are demanding because I don't ask. Chelsea will do a bit of business in the last bit of August, but we are making a balanced offer and not a stupid offer."<br><br>Sevilla president Jose Maria del Nido yesterday claimed to have turned down two bids for Alves, but refused to say whether either was from Chelsea, who are also in negotiations with Real Madrid over the possible departure of Robben. The Holland winger is struggling with a knee injury and is unlikely to figure against Birmingham. Chelsea, who are unbeaten in 63 league games at Stamford Bridge, will eclipse the record Liverpool set in the late Seventies and early Eighties if they avoid defeat against the newly promoted side.<br><br>"Arsenal were the last team to beat Chelsea at home in the League back in February 2004 and although Claudio Ranieri was in charge when they began their unbeaten run, Mourinho has been at the helm for the past 57 home games. The Chelsea chief said: "If we draw against Birmingham we can't celebrate, because we don't play for records - we play for titles. If we can beat the record, then respect to every Chelsea player who participated in this number of games. I don't believe anybody thought four years ago that we would come close to the record. To equal it is great, but to beat it is a moment to enjoy and remember."<br><br>Chelsea will be without John Terry but Frank Lampard, who claimed he is no longer in negotiations with the club over a new contract, will lead the team in his absence.<br></div>

And the Brazilian defender Alex is confident he can adapt quickly to the Premier League and make an immediate impact. With John Terry, Ricardo Carvalho and Tal Ben Haim all competing at the back, Alex will have a fight on his hands to get into the team but he is confident he can force his way in quickly. </strong><br><br>Alex, who represented Brazil at this summer's Copa America, told Chelsea TV: "I hope to start very soon and to do a good job at this wonderful club. "I am happy for the opportunity Chelsea have given me. It's a wonderful club, I sometimes watch the games and I hear about the club and I hope everything goes well. "I hope to adapt myself very quickly because Carvalho and (manager Jose) Mourinho will help me with the language barrier, and I hope I can start straight away and won't have any problem to be on the team."<br><br>Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon feels the club now have genuine strength in depth at the back, having had to resort to playing Michael Essien and Paulo Ferreira in central defence because of injuries last season. "It seems like a long time coming. We had it agreed a long time ago," he said.<br><br>"As you can see he has kept fit over the summer and he is a good addition to the squad. He has got to be our biggest player (in terms of height) and he could be quite intimidating. "Last season we lost out I think, there was that crucial period where we had those injuries around there. I think we've definitely strengthened in that position. We're very well covered and with very good quality as well."<br></div>
