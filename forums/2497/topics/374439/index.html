              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">IT'S payback time for England.</h2>
              <p class="article">I am not talking about the friendly against Slovenia at Wembley today. I am referring, of course, to our World Cup qualifier against Croatia under the Arch on Wednesday.</p>
              <p class="article">It will provide us with the chance to settle an old score, exorcise a demon or two and finally lay to rest one of the biggest ghosts of England's recent football past.</p>
              <p class="article">It will be the first time we have hosted Croatia since <strong>THAT</strong> fateful, wet and rainy night in November 2007. A night when the football gods conspired to rain on England's parade, both literally and metaphorically. A night when the nation that gave the world the beautiful game was denied a place at Euro 2008 in the cruellest and most bitter of fashions. And a night made even worse by our opponents' unsporting behaviour after the final whistle.</p>
              <p class="article">I should point out that this is not a case of sour grapes. As assistant to then-boss Steve McClaren, I acknowledge we should have done better on the pitch to book our place at the finals in Austria and Switzerland the following summer. Especially after coming back to make it 2-2 in a match we would eventually lose 3-2.</p>
              <p class="article">And I would never deny a team the right to celebrate a goal or win. Such moments are the reason we all love the game so much.</p>
              <p class="article">However, we should never <strong>EVER</strong> forget that, first and foremost, football is a <strong>SPORT</strong>. And by definition that means it commands a degree of sportsmanship, whether in victory or defeat.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00882/England_280x390_882118a.jpg" alt="England" width="280" height="390"></p>
              <p class="small bold"><em>NO NEED TO CRO ... Venables is still seething at Croatia's post-match antics</em></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"><strong>That is something the Croats seemed to forget on that night at Wembley as they basically danced in our dejected boys' faces.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">I can understand any nation's delight at beating England. Especially at the new Wembley. But it seemed to me Croatia were more intent on celebrating our failure to qualify for Euro 2008, instead of their own prestigious victory.</p>
              <p class="article">Why did they act like that? I do not know. They had already qualified for the finals, so the outcome was academic to them. I am sure the likes of Steven Gerrard, Gareth Barry, Frank Lampard, Jermain Defoe and David Beckham have not forgotten the Croatians' behaviour. But I am sure they will not be looking to avenge the celebrations - they will be looking to avenge the result.</p>
              <p class="article">That is the all-important thing at this stage of qualification. We have done tremendously well to get ourselves into this position, having won seven out of seven.</p>
              <p class="article">Now we just have to make certain we get across that line with as little fuss as possible - and I'm sure we'll do just that. The senior stalwarts of England's team have taken a while to get it right in a Three Lions shirt.</p>
              <p class="article">For too long they have performed better for club than country. With South Africa on the horizon, there has never been a better time to put that right. Some of the current squad may never get a chance to write their names into international footballing folklore.</p>
              <p class="article">They should not be thinking: I am going to play as well for England as I do for my club. They should be vowing: I am going to play <strong>BETTER</strong> for England than I do for my club. Starting today against Slovenia and continuing it against Croatia on Wednesday and, hopefully, beyond.</p>
              <p class="article">We have nothing to fear, certainly not from Croatia. Their ridiculous inference that Lee Bowyer deliberately put Luka Modric out of the Wembley showdown gave me a wry smile.</p>
              <p class="article">Not at the Tottenham midfielder's misfortune, you understand. But the fact that Croatia, of all teams, have the nerve to complain about injuries. They have only lost one of their star men.</p>
              <p class="article">How many do you think England were without on 'that' night in November 2007? It may surprise you to know that the answer is <strong>EIGHT</strong> - including arguably our first-choice back four.</p>
              <p class="article">Yes, Gary Neville, John Terry, Rio Ferdinand, Ashley Cole, Owen Hargreaves, Michael Owen, Emile Heskey and Wayne Rooney were all missing from the starting line-up.</p>
              <p class="article">With a cleaner bill of health, I expect us to beat Croatia comfortably on Wednesday - before showing our guests the utmost respect by celebrating in the right manner.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">SLAVEN BILIC last night hit back at England skipper John Terry and insisted: Eduardo is no diver.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Croatia boss reckons Chelsea centre-half Terry should get his own house in order before branding opposition players as cheats. In an exclusive SunSport interview before his country's Wembley World Cup showdown, Bilic said: "John Terry is not talking like that when Didier Drogba goes down for Chelsea.</p>
              <p class="article">"I am not saying Drogba is a diver. I adore him as a player but I'm saying when they get a penalty they're not accusing their own team-mates. "You can't say English players don't dive.</p>
              <p class="article">"I've known Eduardo for years. If anyone knows him I know him. He is <strong>NO</strong> diver. He is a good guy, a sportsman, a professional and a role model of fair play. Sometimes he waits for a contact. Maybe it wasn't a penalty against Celtic but you can't say there was no contact.</p>
              <p class="article">"Don't forget he was very badly injured for a long time. And he's just come back. "I don't care why John Terry did this but it's all part of the game. "Look, if we're talking about 100 per cent fair play it's also not fair play from Terry to say something like that before the game if he wants to put pressure on the referee.</p>
              <p class="article">"That would not be fair play in the same sense as what he was saying about Eduardo, accusing a fellow professional of these things."</p>
              <p class="article">Croatian hitman Eduardo was banned for two matches by UEFA after winning a controversial penalty in Arsenal's 3-1 win over Celtic in a Champions League qualifier.</p>
              <p class="article">The Brazilian-born hitman will still face England on Wednesday as his ban applies only to the Gunners' games. Bilic insisted Eduardo has not been affected by the controversy surrounding him.</p>
              <p class="article">The Croatian chief said: "You know why he's not affected? Because he's straight, he's clean, he's not guilty. If he was guilty of course he would be affected. But he's honest and knows he's clean."</p>
              <p class="article">Bilic believes Croatia can ruin England's World Cup knees-up on Wednesday and avenge their 4-1 defeat in Zagreb last year.</p>
              <p class="article">Fabio Capello's men need three points to seal their ticket for South Africa but Bilic is convinced his Balkan underdogs can shock the Three Lions again at Wembley.</p>
              <p class="article">Two years ago, Croatia ended England's Euro 2008 bid and dumped brolly-wally boss Steve McClaren out of a job with a 3-2 win in the Wembley rain. Now the Croatia chief is looking for a repeat despite missing injured Tottenham star Luka Modric.</p>
              <p class="article">Bilic said: "That 4-1 England win was deserved, end of story. "It was a big shock. England are probably thinking, as is their right, that it was a realistic difference between the two teams. But that doesn't change our confidence and mine that we can beat England again.</p>
              <p class="article">"I fully believe in the ability of my players. Losing Modric was the biggest blow but we can compensate with our team game." Bilic has been linked with several Premier League jobs since masterminding England's Euro 2008 exit. But he refused to say whether he would take a job in England if Croatia qualified for the World Cup.</p>
              <p class="article">He insisted: "I have a project. I have a job. I have a contract and all that I'm concentrating on until the end of the qualification campaign is this."</p>

              <p><strong>Steven Gerrard is looking to avenge the 3-2 defeat suffered at the hands of Croatia nearly two years ago when the teams meet again on Wednesday.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Liverpool midfielder captained England on that fateful night in November 2007 when defeat at Wembley cost the Three Lions a place at Euro 2008.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 29-year-old admits the loss was his worst moment in an England shirt and declares that he is yet to get over result.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, Gerrard is looking to put things right in midweek when England know a positive result against Slaven Bilic's side will see them book their place at next summer's World Cup.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"There is unfinished business for all of us," explained Gerrard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It hurt. We still remember the feeling afterwards in the dressing room. We remember the result and will use it to motivate ourselves on Wednesday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"If you can't get motivated to beat a team to get to the World Cup then you've got a problem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Losing to Croatia was definitely my worst moment in an England shirt. It has taken a long time to get over it - I am still not over it now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I don't think I will be until we get that qualification under out belts on Wednesday."</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Croatia to target England’s Rooney</h1>
              <p>Croatia are setting their sights on targeting England striker Wayne Rooney in their World Cup qualifier on Wednesday night.</p>
              <p>Slaven Bilic, Croatia’s coach, believes his players can get under the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> man’s skin and potentially force his mind off the game.</p>
              <p>Rooney has been labelled as a player to stop by the Croatians and
              Bilic, along with chief scout Goran Vucevic, believe they must put a
              plan in place to do so.</p>
              <p>“Rooney is England’s real danger,” said Vucevic.</p>
              <p>“He is literally wild for the entire 90 minutes, constantly
              seeking contact and physical challenges. He is technically phenomenal,
              agile and awkward to play against.</p>
              <p>“Lampard and Gerrard are the key for Rooney to get the ball,
              the right-hand side is not so crucial - whether it is Wright-Phillips
              or someone else.”</p>
              <p>Bilic added that a victory over England would be enormous for Croatia.</p>
              <p>“Goran Vucevic was at England’s game against Slovenia and he has
              helped with my preparations. He also tells me the English are calling
              Wednesday’s game ’the clash of the titans’, so we know England respect
              us,” he said.</p>
              <p>“Winning on Wednesday night would be like reaching Mount
              Everest in my career. It would be the pinnacle so far. Not just because
              of the injury problems we have, but also because it would help us to
              qualify for the World Cup.”</p>

              <div>.</div>
              <div>.</div>
              <p><br></p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Croatia boss Slaven Bilic insists Eduardo is big enough to face the jeers from England fans at Wembley following the diving row that erupted two weeks ago.</strong></p>
              <p>Arsenal striker Eduardo received a two-match ban from UEFA "for deceiving the referee" during the Champions League match against Celtic - and the 26-year-old has already felt the backlash when he came off the bench for his club against Manchester United just before the international break.</p>
              <p>With Luka Modric out because of a broken leg, the onus will be on Eduardo to provide the creative spark against England in a match where Fabio Capello's men can seal their place at the World Cup with victory.</p>
              <p>"Eduardo is a complete man and a complete person," said Bilic.</p>
              <p>"He's great as a player, great as a person, great as a father.</p>
              <p>"I can say that because I've known him since he was 17 - so I know. It can only motivate you more. He knows that he is 100%, horizontally, vertically, diagonally, 100% honest."</p>
              <p>Modric is not the only player missing for Bilic, with Vedran Corluka suspended and Stipe Pletikosa also injured. The latest player to pull out is Genoa midfielder Ivan Juric.</p>
              <p>That has complicated the chances of a repeat of two years ago when Bilic famously masterminded the victory at Wembley that denied England a place at Euro 2008, leading to Capello replacing Steve McClaren as manager.</p>
              <p>England are now a different proposition under their Italian coach, according to Bilic - so when he says they have lost their "Englishness" he means it as a compliment.</p>
              <p>"With those words, I praised Capello and the English team," said the former West Ham defender.</p>
              <p>"I didn't say anything negative. I didn't say that they'd lost Englishness.</p>
              <p>"I said, in a positive way, that Mr Capello is one of the best managers in the world; they are more organised, more solid; they control games almost completely, and they don't leave opponents five yards of space. They are playing differently now.</p>
              <p>"They should be better at a World Cup - if they qualify, of course. They will still have six months to train together and will be together for three or four weeks, so they will be better and better."</p>
              <p>Bilic has been through DVDs of the Wembley game two years ago and England's 4-1 win last season in Zagreb when Theo Walcott's hat-trick proved the difference.</p>
              <p>"Of course, the best way to show my players what we did well and what we did wrong was to show them some actions from the game at Wembley and some from the game of Zagreb," he said.</p>
              <p>Bilic's men took full advantage of Scott Carson's blunder during their last trip to Wembley - but the Croatia boss feels Robert Green being Capello's second choice will not be a factor.</p>
              <p>"Green is a very consistent goalkeeper at West Ham," he said.</p>
              <p>"He is not a weak link in the side. He was good against Slovenia as well, and against Holland. He's a great goalkeeper, very calm and very good."</p>

              <p>final result england 5 - 1 croatia.. 2 goals from lampard and 2 goals from gerrard and 1 goal from rooney.. lampard + gerrard 4 goals all from header assist by lennon, johnson(2 times) and rooney.  for rooney is free goal cause that goalkeeper pass wrong angle.. tat wan i should say is funny. for croatia side is eduardo 1 goal. rob green save 2 time but 3rd time did not manage to save it and the england manager is not happy about it. 1st half england got 7 times offside and 2 golden opportunity from hesky to score but fail to perform goals. croatia players all being tear apart by the england players where they do not have any possession to attack england's defence. 2nd half i should say that is laughable cos alot of silly mistake... and 1 thing to note also the pitch ned to change i think cos the england player keep falling down without anyone touching or getting the ball.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>The finger of blame: an angry John Terry gives Croatia's Ivan Klasnic a piece of his mind</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>England's celebrations were marred at the final whistle when captain John Terry was spat at by Croatia substitute Ivan Klasnic.</strong></p>
              <p>Klasnic, who signed for Bolton on transfer-deadline day on a season long loan from Nantes, came on in the 73rd minute to replace Arsenal striker Eduardo, who was booed throughout after his recent dive for a penalty in the Champions League play-off against Celtic.</p>
              <p>The clash with Terry came after the 5-1 win that clinched England's place in the World Cup finals next summer. The England skipper looked furious in conversation with Spanish referee Alberto Undiano Mallenco in the aftermath but did not want to take the gloss off a wonderful night for his country by dwelling on the controversial incident.</p>
              <p>However, the ugly moment should add spice to Chelsea's game at Bolton next month.</p>
              <p>'Their No 17 spat at me,' said Terry. 'It's not a nice reaction. He came on frustrated but it's not nice at all.</p>
              <p>'He's the first person who has ever spat at me in my career. It is disappointing to see but let's not let it ruin a massive night.'</p>
              <p>Croatia manager Slaven Bilic also tried to play down the incident. He said: 'I think the game was pretty much fair. I don't know. But I spoke to Terry and he was all right.'</p>

              <p>I think Eduardo's new reputation as a diver has work against him cos I thought he deserved a penalty when the score was still 2- 0 to England... He was in the box ready to head in when an England player hold him down from behind and prevented him from jumping up... Eduardo can't believed it and his face show a wth look when the referee wave play on...</p>
              <p>I guess his reputation worked against his on that occasion... England went on to score their 3rd and the game was over...</p>

              <p>what a 2 years it has been. think about mclaren england side lost to croatia 3-2 at wembley and now under capello, england vanquished croatia 5-1 at wembley.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope the morons at FA dun appoint people like mclaren ever again.</p>
              <p>under the same players, capello can transformed them into world beaters. mclaren is hopelessly out of his depth, like argentina and portugal are facing now. their coaches simply cannot make it.</p>

              <p><strong>Croatia striker <span style="color: #000000;">Ivan Klasnic</span> has firmly denied spitting at <span style="color: #000000;">John Terry</span> and Bolton's new signing has further accused the England captain of punching him in the kidneys.</strong></p>

              <p>Klasnic and Terry were involved in a heated exchange during England's 5-1 win over Croatia at Wembley on Wednesday night and, after his country secured their place at the World Cup finals, the England defender claimed that his opponent had spat at him.</p>
              <p>But Klasnic, who joined Bolton on loan from Nantes on transfer deadline day, refutes the accusation. The 29-year-old had a double kidney transplant in 2007 and has now accused Terry of hitting him in a sensitive area.</p>
              <p>"He hit me with a fist exactly in the place where I've been operated," Klasnic told the <em>Sun</em>. "I was lucky to be wearing a protective belt. He is the first player who has tried to hit me with a purpose in the kidney. He insulted me first then he hit me.</p>
              <p>"And now he has accused me of spitting at him? I didn't do it. We spoke after the final whistle and I thought we sorted everything out - but obviously not so."</p>
              <p>Klasnic is yet to make his debut for Bolton and Trotters manager <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=11"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Gary Megson</span></span></a> hopes that the early controversy to surround his new arrival will be quickly forgotten.</p>
              <p>"Ivan told me he has spoken with Terry and they have had a private word and the matter is between them," Megson said. "It was private so I don't know what was said but, as I understand, it has been sorted."</p>
