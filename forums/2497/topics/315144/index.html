              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Arsenal's Alexander Hleb faces being banned for
              the rest of the season if the FA call for video evidence of his clash
              with Graham Murty.</span></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Television replays appeared to show the
              Belarus star slapping Reading skipper Murty in the face in the second
              half of Arsenal's 2-0 win on Saturday and although it was missed by
              referee Peter Walton and his assistants, it was spotlighted on BBC TV's
              'Match of the Day'.</p>
              <p>If found guilty of violent conduct Hleb would face a
              three-match ban - with Arsenal now only left with games against Derby,
              Everton and Sunderland to complete their season.</p>
              <p>An FA spokesman said: "The first thing is to wait and see the
              referee's report but that is not necessarily the end of the matter."</p>
              <p>The FA can call for video evidence from any match if they deem
              it necessary to apply justice to a clear offence which a referee has
              failed to punish.</p>
              <p>The circumstances are certainly not without precedent as far as Arsenal are concerned.</p>
              <p>Nearly 20 years ago their midfielder Paul Davis was banned for
              nine matches after TV footage showed him retaliating to verbal abuse
              with an off-the-ball punch which broke a Southampton player's jaw
              during a match.</p>
              <p>Although Hleb's slap appeared to be only a comparatively minor
              contact, Arsenal's former striker Jeremie Aliadiere was recently banned
              for four matches after appealing against a red card while playing for
              Middlesbrough having been sent off following a spat with Liverpool's
              Javier Mascherano.</p>
              <p>Alan Shearer, former England striker and BBC TV soccer pundit
              recalled the Aliadiere case in referring to Hleb and said: "I think the
              FA have to do something about this one, too."</p>
              <p>Reading manager Steve Coppell, who saw his side dragged deeper
              into the relegation fight with a 2-0 defeat at The Emirates, admits he
              does not understand the system by which players can be suspended for
              offences the referee has missed.</p>
              <p>He said: "It is clear for all to see on the tape. I don't
              think, in these circumstances, that anyone can say 'please, FA, look at
              it.' I don't know what the procedure is.</p>
              <p>"It seems some mystery man phones in and says 'have a look at
              this piece of tape.'and then three other mystery men men make a
              decision on whether further action is required.</p>
              <p>"The whole situation is unexplainable but maybe someone sitting in a front room will do something about it."</p>

              <p><strong>Hleb charged with violent conduct</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="first"><strong>Arsenal forward Alexander Hleb has been charged with violent conduct by the Football Association.</strong></p>
              <p>The FA has taken action after reviewing video evidence of an incident involving Hleb and Reading's Graeme Murty in a game Arsenal won 2-0 last Saturday.</p>
              <p>"The incident was not seen by referee Peter Walton," said an FA statement.</p>
              <p>"Having now watched video footage, Walton has informed the FA that, had he seen it, he would have shown Hleb a red card for violent conduct." </p>
              <p>Hleb has until 1800 BST on 23 April to respond to the charge, which will be heard by a regulatory commission on 24 April.</p>
              <p>The Belarus international now faces the prospect of a three-game ban, which would bring a premature end to his season as Arsenal have just three games of the season remaining.</p>

              <p><strong>Alexander Hleb will miss the rest of Arsenal's season through suspension after he accepted a charge of violent conduct from the Football Association. The Belarus winger was involved in an off-the-ball clash with Reading captain Graeme Murty during the Barclays Premier League match at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday.</strong></p>
              <p>Hleb appeared to strike the Royals defender with his open hand, but the incident - which left both Murty and the Reading bench incensed - was missed by referee Peter Walton.</p>
              <p>However, officials at Soho Square, as well as Walton himself, reviewed television footage and subsequently charged the Arsenal winger.</p>
              <p>An FA statement read: "Arsenal midfielder Alexander Hleb has admitted a charge of violent conduct and will serve a three-match suspension with immediate effect.</p>
