The Reading winger earned notoriety when he left Chelsea's goalkeeper with a fractured skull during the match there last October.</strong><br><br>Now the Republic of Ireland international believes he has built a more positive reputation after a series of fine displays last season. "I haven't spoken to Cech and I won't either. That's not meant to be rude but it's just all forgotten now and we move on," Hunt said yesterday. "I approach every game as normal. We will line up and shake hands but that will be it. I will just look forward to the game as usual."<br><br>Hunt was accused by Jose Mourinho of causing the injury deliberately and was criticised by Frank Lampard for not visiting Cech in hospital, a stance backed up by several Chelsea players. "Unfortunately the incident made so many headlines and I guess a lot of people were asking, 'Who is he?'" he said. "By the end of the season I think I made a name for myself as a footballer."<br><br>Hunt relishes the chance to prove his ability against the high-profile sides. "There is more incentive to do well against teams like Chelsea. They have so-called superstars who earn so much money but the two times we have played them we have deserved results out of the game. We drew 2-2 at their place and played very well and even in the first game were unlucky to lose."<br><br>The incidents at Reading prompted the Football Association and the Premier League to improve the level of care to players. A number of new measures have been introduced this season including the use of an ambulance specifically for players and officials. The Blackburn striker Benni McCarthy was afforded the new service when he collapsed in the fixture against Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium on Saturday with a head injury.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Reading Vs Chelsea match will be shown on Wednesday, 15 August channel 27 at - 3:00am - <span style="color: red;">(Live)</span></span></div>
