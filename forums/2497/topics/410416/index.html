              <p><strong>October 6. Put this date in your diary. It is the day when the very destiny of Liverpool Football Club will be decided.</strong></p>
              <p>If that sounds dramatic, then it is meant to be so, because on that day there is a real danger that one of the most famous and historic clubs in world football could be brought to its knees.</p>
              <p>Let me say now, that Liverpool are actually a well-run, well managed club, which, even with its current commercial performance and before stadium development, could be among the most profitable in the English game.</p>
              <p>They are broke though, for one very good reason: The burden of acquisition interest that is place directly on the club. Or in simple terms for those who prefer their information in English, Liverpool are paying millions every month for the dubious pleasure of Tom Hicks and George Gillett owning them.</p>
              </div>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>If that is allowed to continue, if Tom Hicks and George Gillett are allowed to continue with their ownership under its current format, then it spells disaster for Liverpool. It could even see them go bust.</p>
              <p>It really could happen. Hicks and Gillett want to sell their ‘soccer franchise’, but they also want to make a profit out of it. Indeed, they want – and need – to make a big profit.</p>
              <p>At the moment it is clear there are no takers at their asking price. Rather than sell, they are now desperately trying to refinance to ensure they can hold on to the business until they CAN sell it at their valuation.</p>
              <p>But to do that, they will probably have to borrow even more money at even higher rates, and use the club’s assets to underwrite those loans. And we all know what that means. If you don’t, just ask Portsmouth or Leeds fans.</p>
              <p>So October 6 becomes vitally important. That is the date that the Americans’ current lenders, the Royal Bank of Scotland, have set for repayment of loans totalling around £285million at the last count.</p>
              <p>By then, the Yanks must have either sold Liverpool, or raised the funds to replace that existing debt with new debt. Or – and here is an intriguing third possibility – have persuaded the RBS to extend those loans once more.</p>
              <p>Every single Liverpool fan the world over now recognises the danger of that happening, because it will merely extend an essentially unsustainable financial structure at Anfield. It will merely extend the threat of the club collapsing.</p>
              <p>Even the much-maligned board at Anfield recognises it. Apparently, Chairman Martin Broughton and MD Christian Purslow, along with commercial director Ian Ayre, have already resisted one attempt by the Americans to use the club’s assets against new loans.</p>
              <p>They know Liverpool could well be doomed if the Yanks hold on to power, and they seem to understand that the best interests of the club certainly aren’t served by that nightmare scenario.</p>
              <p>I say seem to understand, because Broughton seems to have decided that the fans don’t deserve any information about what the hell is going on through the Merseyside media. He seems only to be prepared to talk to obscure business sources.</p>
              <p>Purslow too, seems to have gone into hiding, bizarrely breaking off all contact with the fans, through the media, for the past six months. Attempts to ask him questions – as fans on a popular Liverpool website have tried to do recently – are met with silence, as are all interview requests.</p>
              <p>But credit to them both and to Ayre, there is no question they are trying to resist the Americans’ attempts to retain control. For all the criticism aimed their way, much of it justified, they are trying to do what the fans so desperately want. They are trying to do the right thing, and fans shouldn’t forget that.</p>
              <p>Without wishing to be too pessimistic though, there are no guarantees they will succeed. Already there are rumours of a legal challenge to the three directors blocking the two Americans on the board.</p>
              <p>And who amongst us doesn’t believe that after decades of the most cunning business dealings that have made them both billionaires, that Gillett and Hicks aren’t stealthy enough to somehow pull off their latest despicable plan.</p>
              <p>They are ruthless enough, after a combined ten decades in the leveraged buy-out business, that is for sure. Don’t think for one second they are going to roll over and simply accept that Liverpool will be taken from them and sold at a loss.</p>
              <p>Which is why October 6 is so important. Let’s get real again here for a second. The RBS are making millions of pounds of profit from Liverpool, who so far have had no trouble at all meeting the repayments. In that sense, it is a gilt-edged investment for them.</p>
              <p>So they will be reluctant to let it go easily, and still – possibly – open to persuasion from the Americans to extend, if yet more guarantees are proferred.</p>
              <p>Other banks may well feel the same, that there is easy, unrisky profit to be made from extending credit to Hicks and Gillett, because the club will meet the liability. And that is the true danger to Liverpool as a storied club.</p>
              <p>It is where the fans must come in, because it is down to them to stop either the RBS or any other bank perpetuating the current nightmare that has engulfed Anfield and threatened its very future.</p>
              <p>Supporters are already responding in their thousands. I have highlighted here before the work of Kopfaithful, who are actively campaigning to ensure the RBS realise the risks of a massive backlash if they are to extend the Americans’ loans.</p>
              <p>They have an intelligent, well-organised campaign which has spoken to MPs in the House of Commons, to major financial institutions in the UK and to major media outlets in the U.S., explaining the feelings of millions of worried Liverpool supporters.</p>
              <p>They discovered that the Americans have approached at least 10 different institutions for refinance funding, and are now fervently trying to block that possibility, by orchestrating an email campaign to the likes of the Wall St Journal and NYTimes.</p>
              <p>They are also making it clear to the RBS that there will be massive opposition if they don’t act in the best interests of Liverpool fans. The bank’s HQ in Edinburgh will allow access to vistors as part of an open house scheme on September 25, and guess who plans to be there?!</p>
              <p>Kopfaithful want to talk to RBS Chief Executive Stephen Hester, to make clear the opposition to the Americans.</p>
              <p>They are backed by several fans’ groups too, who are all aware of the dangers facing Liverpool right now. Influential websites such as Red and White Kop and You’ll Never Walk Alone are meeting along with several others this very evening, to discuss tactics. They are planning protests that will highlight the depth of feeling, and the potential power of such a massive body of committed support.</p>
              <p>And that’s where you can help if you are a true Liverpool fan. October 6 is D-Day, and the more supporters make clear their opposition to any institution offering finance to the Americans, the less chance of it happening.</p>
              <p>Back Kopfaithful, back Red and White Kop, back all the other fans’ groups who love Liverpool and are desperate to save the club. Do it calmly, nicely, but back them.</p>
              <p>There is a chance that the Americans’ plans to refinance can be blocked, and if that happens, then there is a real chance the RBS can assume temporary control as they seek to sell the club to a responsible buyer.</p>
              <p>If that can happen, then Liverpool can be great again. They already make an operating profit because they are operating efficiently without the Americans’ debt.</p>
              <p>Without ownership debt on the club they can build a new stadium and turn profits – which can be invested in playing assets – that will make most Premiership MDs’ eyes water. So it is D-Day at Anfield on October 6, and you, the fan, can have a massive say in what happens.</p>

              <p>Because the owners aren't looking for a long term solution, and bonds generally needs at least 5 years to mature. The owners are looking for a short term solution which involves them selling the club at a profit.</p>
              <p>Anyway im quite sure Liverpool won't go bust, borrowing money doesn't make you go bankrupt if you can still make profits yearly..And really, the bank should be smart enough to continue collecting the interest from Liverpool, rather then forcing them to sell their assets and returning the money.. Its a safe investment with good returns..</p>

              <p>Not too sure about the bond stuff, need to check with a friend but I think maybe they can end it premature as long as they pay the full interest to that point in time... Like the Red Knights, had they successfully taken over from the Glazers, and if they can afford, they might want to pay everything up and not be paying interest to the bond holders for 7 yrs...</p>
              <p>Anyway in Pool's situation, The worry for the bank could be, the club already owe them something like $240m and also owe Barclays Bank another $110m. And with the penalty to RBS should it happen, the total debt could reach almost $400m. And on last count, there was no takers for the club even at that price...</p>
              <p>So the bank might get worried and call in the loan to be safe and not be caught with any liabilities. So this problem could be a very brave one for the bank management to make.</p>
              <p>Also there is still no new stadium in sigh to boost gate collection for the next 3 yrs minimum. And what about the cash that needs to build the new stadium going to come from? More borrowing from banks? This would incur more interest i think...</p>
              <p>A bond isn't a bad thing if you think about it... Cos 7yrs or 10 yrs, the interest is fixed. It may be a lot today but in 3, 4 yrs it may not be anymore and in 7 to 10 yrs... The interest may seem a lot smaller an amount than today as inflation kicks in...</p>
              <p>Pool's current owners way of keep re-newing yr on yr is troublesome and the interest keep increasing on each new deal... And it's also quite unstable news to have for the club every year...</p>

              <h2>Royal Bank of Scotland shifted the loans of Liverpool co-owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett into its "bad debts" division in March as part of negotiations over the future of the club.</h2>

              <div class="firstPar">
              <p><strong>Sources with knowledge of the deal told <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> on Thursday night that the decision was taken to shift the American’s £237 million loan to RBS’s Global Restructuring Group when Hicks and Gillett were in negotiations over extending their financing deal with the bank.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>The outstanding debt secured against <span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool's</span> holding companies was largely incurred in the purchase of Liverpool in 2007. When debts secured against the club are included the complete debt package totals £351m.</p>
              <p>By shifting management of the loans from the bank’s corporate arm in the spring, RBS may have effectively emphasised to Hicks and Gillett their growing impatience with the financial position at Liverpool.</p>
              <p>In the years following their purchase of the club RBS has demanded increasing levels of security from the Americans, including rising personal guarantees.</p>
              <p>The banks’ patience had worn thin by the spring, and the shift to the restructuring group was part of the negotiation process that culminated in Hicks and Gillett agreeeing to put the club up for sale and appoint Martin Broughton as chairman to oversee the process.</p>
              <p>In return RBS agreed to extend its financing deal to the American’s for a further six months, albeit on apparently more onerous terms.</p>
              <p>That deadline expires on Oct 6 at which point the bank will face a crucial decision.</p>
              <p>Attempts to sell the club have failed so far, with a flurry of activity at the start of August culminating in two apparently interested parties, Sahara and Chinese businessman Kenneth Huang ruling themselves out.</p>
              <p>RBS could extend the financing for a further term to allow Broughton to try and complete a sale, or sell the debt to a third party who could then call in the loan from the Americans.</p>
              <p>It could also call in the debt itself, effectively forcing the American’s out of the club and then run it for a period while it searched for a buyer.</p>
              <p>That would simplify the process and probably reduce the price, but it would still be a huge step for the bank given the public relations implications and the volatility involved in running a Premier League football club.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Bloated Anfield</strong></p>
              <p>When Liverpool’s playing staff crept up to 62 last year, it prompted a withering attack from Uefa on the size of squads retained by the Premier League’s Big Four.</p>
              <p>“Ridiculous,” said general secretary David Taylor. “You can only field 11 at one time.”</p>
              <p>For the current campaign, Liverpool have 21 designated squad players, but another 53 who fall under the category of Under 21 and scholars, making a total of 74. Arsenal lead the way with 76, while Blackpool have the smallest squad at 46.</p>

              <p><em>Liverpool's co-owners Tom Hicks, left, and George Gillett have succeeded in alienating the Anfield fans.</em></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Tom Hicks and George Gillett's ill-starred reign as owners of </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Liverpool" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong> looks like having less than a month to run after the club's loans with </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Royal Bank of Scotland" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/royalbankofscotlandgroup"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong></span></a><strong> were placed into its toxic-assets division.</strong></p>
              <p>The deadline for the refinancing of the owners' personal loans from RBS is 6 October, and that now looks set to be the date that Hicks and Gillett's association with England's most successful club will end. The bank's decision to switch the debts to its Global Restructuring Group is the strongest possible signal that these loans will not be extended.</p>
              <p>The co-owners' previous attempt to refinance the debts in June, when they are believed to have offered to secure the loans against their US assets, was overruled by the club's board, led by the chairman, Martin Broughton. Now, with the loans having been shifted into RBS's so-called "bad bank", where all toxic assets have been housed since last year, it is clear the club's lender has also adopted a more steely stance towards the Americans.</p>
              <p>One source with a knowledge of Liverpool's dealings with RBS said: "If it has been taken out of the hands of the corporate banking department they'll have a much more ruthless approach on 6 October." An informed view from another source close to the situation is that the bank would hope to sell the club, possibly at a knockdown price, in the coming weeks or as soon possible after 6 October.</p>
              <p>According to the club's accounts to July 2009 Liverpool's owners owe £237.4m to RBS. Through companies in the UK and overseas, Hicks and Gillett are also personally exposed to tens of millions of pounds in other commitments to the club and its lender. These have been a mixture of cash, which the pair have injected through equity, and guarantees to the RBS loans. Last year's accounts stated these amounted to £145.3m, but it is believed to have risen dramatically after the last refinancing agreed five months ago.</p>
              <p>RBS would hope to achieve an orderly sale without having to take control of Liverpool. However, depending on the terms of the April refinancing agreement – which have never been made public – that may prove difficult if the co-owners, who value the club at £800m, refuse to go quietly.</p>
              <p>One tool at RBS's disposal is to force the insolvency of Liverpool's UK parent and associated companies. It is clear from mortgage documents lodged with Companies House that in the event of default RBS has the power to place Kop Football and Kop Football (Holdings), as well as Gillett's loan-security vehicle, Football UK Ltd, into administration. However that would be unpalatable for the bank, Liverpool's board and the Premier League since it would require the imposition of a nine-point penalty on the club.</p>
              <p>By exercising those clauses the bank would also effectively take control of Liverpool. Although RBS's restructuring group describes itself as being responsible for "the management of any problem lending portfolios", the bank has no long-term plans to hold the club as its subsidiary. Instead it is expected RBS would prefer to fulfil another of its stated aims – the "maximising [of] debt recoveries" – by selling the club in short order.</p>
              <p>That means there are also strong signs RBS will now be prepared to accept a knockdown price in order to cut its ties. During negotiations with prospective buyers Broughton, and the investment bank advising him, Barclays Capital, have maintained that Liverpool's debts with RBS must be paid in full as a minimum sale price.</p>
              <p>Provided buyers still retain an interest in taking over Liverpool beyond 6 October, it will mean a more orderly sale process. There would be only one party for purchasers to negotiate with and the club's debts would be manageable.</p>
              <p>The departure of Hicks and Gillett is an outcome that would delight Liverpool fans. The Kop Faithful group wrote in an open letter to the RBS group's chief executive, Stephen Hester, this week: "Hicks and Gillett were proved to be no more than a pair of liars. The promised 'no Glazer style buy out' was all of a sudden [a leveraged buy out] – a club £350m in debt to effectively buy itself, when it had been sold for less than £180m in what seemed no time before."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson has insisted any prospective owner should have funds to build a stadium if the club are to compete for trophies.</strong></p>
              <p>Hodgson’s view, shared by the club’s board, comes amid fears the Royal Bank of Scotland might take over Liverpool in October and sell to a bargain hunter who has no interest in moving the club to a new ground.</p>
              <p>Owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett are due to pay back debts of £280million to the RBS on October 6. If no buyer is found by then, the board can either let the Americans refinance the loan or hand the club over to the bank.</p>
              <p>If RBS take control, they will be interested only in getting their money back, meaning investors can buy Liverpool for less than £300m and without building a stadium.</p>
              <p>While Hodgson, whose team travel to Birmingham today after an indifferent start to the season, admits his knowledge of high finance ‘could be written on a postage stamp’, he knows that would be a disaster, with Liverpool needing a bigger stadium to compete with Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea as well as Manchester City.</p>
              <p>Hodgson said: ‘I hope (chairman) Martin Broughton finds an owner who first and foremost backs the club’s desire to build a new stadium, which would be tremendous for our long-term future.</p>
              <p>‘If we want to be up there with other big clubs, we need to have a capacity to rival theirs.’ Liverpool (capacity 45,000) generate £42m from matchday revenue, £30m less than Chelsea, who pull similar crowds but have more corporate boxes.</p>
              <p>Manchester United (76,000) and Arsenal (60,000) earn double Liverpool’s income from home games.</p>
