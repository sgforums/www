His snub left the players fuming. And it makes manager Jose MourinhoÂ’s exit this summer even more likely.</strong><br><br>The Russian billionaire first failed to visit the BluesÂ’ dressing room to congratulate the team, manager and coaches after the win over Arsenal. He then avoided the victory party held at LondonÂ’s Aura nightclub on Sunday night.<br><br>It is the first time Abramovich has not gone to the dressing room when Chelsea have won a trophy. And his behaviour is in stark contrast to the last time they won the tournament in 2005.<br><br>Abramovich then paid for a lavish party at La Famiglia restaurant in Chelsea following the win over Liverpool. The reclusive owner also delighted boss Mourinho and his squad by drinking champagne from the Carling Cup and leading a chorus of Â‘We are ChelseaÂ’.<br><br>SunSport revealed last month that Abramovich had broken with his tradition of visiting the dressing room after every game. He went missing for the first time in the wake of the January defeat of Wigan at Stamford Bridge. That was at the height of his feud with Mourinho over transfer dealings and the fact Andriy Shevchenko had been dropped.<br><br>Abramovich has since made his displeasure known by missing some games altogether but this latest snub is the most significant yet. His actions confirm the total breakdown in relations between manager and owner Â— the consequence of which is likely to be Mourinho leaving the club.<br><br>Mourinho departed from his habit of not celebrating on the pitch with his players after a trophy win by leading from the front. His behaviour was undoubtedly a reminder to Abramovich of who is responsible for the teamÂ’s success.<br><br>With one of four possible trophies in the bag, Frank Lampard insisted the Grand Slam is still possible. The FA Cup, Premiership and Champions League have still to be bagged. Lamps said: Â“It will be very tough to win all four. But everything weÂ’re in, weÂ’re capable of winning. And weÂ’ve won the first.Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Red Rom KO's Mourinho again</strong></span><br><br>ROMAN ABRAMOVICH delivered a stunning third Carling Cup snub to Jose Mourinho and his Chelsea players. The Blues had booked out posh Knightsbridge restaurant San Lorenzo on Monday night for a slap-up meal to salute their final win over Arsenal. But there was no sign of Red Rom as the Russian billionaire again blanked Mourinho and the team.<br><br>SunSport revealed yesterday he missed the dressing room celebrations in Cardiff and then the victory party on Sunday at a London nightclub. San Lorenzo reservations were made for 90 people. Everyone from Abramovich to Mourinho, the players, their wives, the backroom staff and those in charge of washing the team kit was invited.<br><br>Yet Abramovich, who flew back to London from Cardiff on Sunday evening, opted to head for Moscow on Monday afternoon Â— a decision that left Mourinho and his squad increasingly bemused by his decision to abandon them.<br><br>Club sources believe owner Abramovich wants to avoid a confrontation with Mourinho over the managerÂ’s future. Captain John Terry attended, despite still suffering the after-effects of concussion. And the England skipper could even return to action as early as Saturday against Portsmouth if he gets medical clearance.<br><br></div>

And one heartbroken season ticket holder revealed: "Everyone wanted to know if Mourinho is staying, but every time the question was asked there was no answer.<br><br>"That convinced us all that Mourinho will definitely be leaving in the summer."<br><br>Our revelations come just 24 hours after Mourinho insisted he would never walk away from the club. It will put Abramovich on a collision course with his players after skipper John Terry, Didier Drogba, Michael Essien and Claude Makelele have publicly given Mourinho their full backing.<br><br>Terry is also prepared to lead a players' deputation to Abramovich, insisting: "We all agree we don't want Jose to go and if it takes five or six of the senior players to tell them so, then that's what we're prepared to do."<br><br>Mourinho revealed he had twice thought about quitting Stamford Bridge but then declared: "I will not walk away to another club. I would never do that to Chelsea."<br><br>"Normally, there are three ways for a manager to leave a club. he can walk away, be sacked or his contract can finish. "So there are only two ways I can leave."Either I'll go in 2010 when my contract finishes, or the club is not happy with my work and they decide to sack me."<br><br>"The power is always in the club's hands."<br></div>
