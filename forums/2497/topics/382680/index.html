              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Super-sub: Tevez swung the match in favour of the visitors after coming off the bench</em></p>
              <p class="article-icon-links-container"><br></p>
              <p><strong>The day’s main talking point ended inconclusively after </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span><strong> and </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester City</strong></span><strong> both passed up the chance of putting down a marker about their Champions League prospects.</strong></p>
              <p>But there was no mistaking the message Carlos Tevez had to digest.</p>
              <p>The former Manchester United striker’s demotion to the bench had been predicted, but the same could hardly be said of the explanation from manager Mark Hughes.</p>
              <p>City’s stellar signing of last summer owed everything to Tevez tiring of his limited involvement under Sir Alex Ferguson and believing he would be valued more highly at Eastlands.</p>
              <p>He may think again after a development that illustrated how managing City these days comes with demands that never used to apply.</p>
              <p>Hughes has his hands full trying to keep everyone happy, from owners who want a return on their investment to players who struggle with the concept of squad utilisation.</p>
              <p>Six straight draws suggest the first part could be going better, while saluting Tevez’s qualities as a substitute will do little for the second.</p>
              <p>It wasn’t what the 25-year-old had in mind when he moved, but he may have to get used to it after going on in the second half and sparking a revival that almost left Rafa Benitez having to explain a sixth Barclays Premier League defeat of the season.</p>
              <p>Carlos has had a bit of a problem with his knee, but not starting him was a tactical thing,’ declared Hughes. ‘You are not going to go gung-ho at Anfield because the likelihood is you will concede goals.</p>
              <p>‘Once we went behind it was time to introduce him. It was always my intention to bring him on at some point, because of the impact he can have from the bench. He got us into a winning position which we didn’t see through.</p>
              <p>'He won’t play every game, as a lot of others won’t, because we have a good squad. It has been frustrating for him.’</p>
              <p>What was supposed to be one of the most revealing fixtures of the season, in terms of top four places, demonstrated little other than both sides’ shortcomings at the back.</p>

              <p>This is what that really happens when you go all out and buy lotsa high-rated strikers at one go. You sure as heck can't use all of them at one go, but if you bench any of them, they start making noise.</p>
              <p>How many strikers does Man City have, anyway? Nine, right? ( <a href="http://www.soccerblog.com/2009/07/manchester-city-have-nine-stri.htm">Linkie) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></a></p>

              <p>Pool might have to think twice about even getting him on loan if City ever approve it in the first place... Cos he is like being paid $140,000 a week at City and Pool's highest paid player Johnson is on like $139,000 a week...</p>
              <p>Anyway, he is really better as an impact player rather than starting...</p>
