            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://clientimages.teamtalk.com/07/05/240/NaniAnderson_227458.jpg"><br><br><strong>Manchester United have scored a major summer transfer coup by swooping for highly-rated Portugal-based duo Anderson and Nani. Most of the best clubs in Europe, including Chelsea and Real Madrid, have been linked with at least one of the pair at some stage over the past few months. But a flying visit to Portugal by Red Devils chief executive David Gill and Sir Alex Ferguson's assistant Carlos Queiroz has proved exceptionally fruitful. Fees have been agreed with the players' respective clubs - FC Porto and Sporting Lisbon - and personal terms have also been sorted out. All that remains are the medicals and, in Anderson's case, a work permit, before the formal conclusion of the transfers are announced. </strong><br><br>With a deal to sign Owen Hargreaves from Bayern Munich virtually done and dusted as well, Ferguson has not allowed the grass to grow under his feet since United were crowned champions earlier this month. Ferguson suggested he was after at least three new players to bolster his squad. But no-one expected him to act so quickly, with the overall fees for all three men likely to exceed the Â£40million mark, the first major cash splurge since Malcolm Glazer's controversial buyout almost two years ago.<br><br>"Manchester United is delighted to announce it has agreed terms in principle with FC Porto and Sporting Lisbon for the purchase of the registrations of Anderson and Nani," said a club statement. "Personal terms have been agreed and a formal announcement will take place once the necessary administrative procedures, including medicals, have been completed."<br><br>Anderson has been one of the most sought-after young talents in the game since he was crowed player of the tournament in the 2005 World Under-17 Championships. The Brazilian teenager, who has established himself as one of the best attacking midfielders in the Portuguese League, has been named by national coach Dunga in a preliminary squad for this summer's prestigious Copa America.<br><br>United have been tailing Nani for some time but appeared to have been thwarted in their attempts to sign him when it was suggested the 20-year-old was ready to extend his stay with Sporting. However, the proposed contract remained unsigned, allowing Ferguson to step in and snap up the Portugal international.<br><br>Ferguson will cross his fingers and hope his new arrivals enjoy the same kind of success as the last player he signed from Portugal, footballer of the year Cristiano Ronaldo. Their arrivals should certainly help Ronaldo feel at ease, particularly if the winger's friend Gabriel Heinze is sold this summer as expected.<br><br>It is certainly an astute piece of business by Ferguson, who realises two of his main attacking stars, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes - while outstanding this season - are reaching the end of their careers. With Hargreaves on board as well and the likelihood of a big-name striker being signed, United have signalled a statement of intent for the new campaign. All the new arrivals will make their bows on the club's pre-season Far East tour.<br></div>

The Premiership champions signed Brazilian Anderson, 19, for Â£17m from Porto and Sporting LisbonÂ’s Nani, 20, for Â£14m. </strong><br><br>A United statement read: Â“Terms are agreed with both players and an announcement will take place once a medical and other procedures are done.Â” A day of drama started when United No 2 Carlos Queiroz and chief executive David Gill met with Sporting directors yesterday morning and offered Â£10m for Portuguese winger Nani, 20.<br><br>The Old Trafford contingent then left for Porto believing they had all but agreed the transfer. They went on to complete the move for striker Anderson, 19. United then learned Sporting met with Spurs sporting director Damien Comolli three hours after they had left.<br><br>Spurs believed they had nicked Nani with a bid which equalled his buy-out clause of Â£14m. But, crucially, NaniÂ’s agent, Jorge Mendes, did not meet with Comolli. Mendes is also Cristiano RonaldoÂ’s agent and, coincidentally, also represents Anderson. Mendes is believed to have travelled to Porto to complete the Anderson deal. Porto announced the Â£17m fee to the Stock Exchange. But United would not be beaten on Nani, either.<br><br>After learning of SpursÂ’ bid, they matched the offer and a deal was struck. Nani had made it clear he would only sign for the Old Trafford club. Hitman Anderson has been one of the most sought-after young talents since he was crowned player of the tournament in the 2005 World Under-17 Championships.<br><br>He was recently named in BrazilÂ’s preliminary squad for this summerÂ’s Copa America Â— but not tomorrowÂ’s friendly with England at Wembley. United manager Alex Ferguson also expects to wrap up the signing of Bayern MunichÂ’s England midfielder Owen Hargreaves, 26, this weekend for Â£17m. This would take FergieÂ’s summer spree to Â£48m Â— and he still wants to sign another striker.<br><br>Sources close to Fergie say he will play a 4-2-3-1 formation next season Â— using Ronaldo, Anderson and Nani as his three attacking midfielders behind Wayne Rooney.<br></div>
