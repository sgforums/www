              <p><strong>Jens Lehmann was nearly caught out after taking a toilet break DURING his side's Champions League match last night.</strong></p>
              <p>The former Arsenal goalkeeper nipped over the advertising hoardings behind his goal to relieve himself in a quiet moment during Stuggart's 3-1 victory over Unirea Urziceni.</p>
              <p>But - as this video proves - 40-year-old German Lehmann had to rush back to cover his net as the Romanians went on the attack.</p>
              <p>Lehmann claimed afterwards that he went because he was 'as nervous as ever before' - even though that didn't stop him performing in front of 40,000 fans.</p>
              <p>It was one highlight of an enjoyable night for former Tottenham boss Christian Gross, who took over from axed Markus Babbel earlier this week.</p>

              <p><strong>Eccentric Stuttgart goalkeeper Jens Lehmann must have been a relieved man during his side's Champions League triumph over Unirea Urziceni on Wednesday night, after it emerged he urinated behind the goal during the match.</strong></p>
              <p>An otherwise tight-lipped Lehmann has admitted since that he was as "nervous as ever before", presumably before the incident that occured on one knee, behind the goal and in front of 40,000 fans.</p>
              <p>Lehmann was interrupted by an attack from the Romanian side, meaning he had to jump back over the advertising signage before suffering the embarassment of a conceded goal or a yellow card for leaving the pitch without permission.</p>
              <p>Stuttgart's director of sport Horst Heldt was quoted in the <em>Guardian</em> praising Lehmann for his handling of the sticky situation.</p>
              <p>"I thought he handled it very expertly," he said. "It was a tricky situation. He could hardly run into the dressing room while play was going on and it reminded me of the Tour de France - sometimes there are simply no options."</p>
              <p>Stuttgart's passionate fans - who are more accustomed to going behind the goal than their goalkeeper - would have been delighted the team could hold on to their 3-1 lead, even if Lehmann couldn't. Given the club's dismal performance in the Bundesliga this season, Mercedes-Benz would have been full of relieved people after the team progressed to the Champions League knock-out stages. None more so than Lehmann.</p>

              <p><strong>Stuttgart goalkeeper Jens Lehmann has landed himself in hot water again after his latest escapade ruined his side's chances of picking up their first win in nine Bundesliga games.</strong></p>
              <p>The 40-year-old gave away an unnecessary late penalty and received a red card in the 1-1 draw with Mainz before exiting the stadium and making his own way home, after a confrontation with a fan.</p>
              <p>The drama unfolded in the 86th minute of the game at the Bruchweg Stadion, with the Bundesliga strugglers winning 1-0 thanks to Pavel Pogrebnyak's 11th-minute opener.</p>

              <p><strong>Lehmann had possession of the ball within his penalty area when he decided to take revenge for an earlier foul on him by Mainz striker Aristide Bance by stamping on his foot.</strong></p>
              <p>Bance fell to the floor and referee Wolfgang Stark showed Lehmann the red card and awarded the hosts a penalty, which Eugen Polanski dispatched past Sven Ulreich to earn Mainz a point.</p>
              <p>Lehmann fled from the stadium in a rage, confronting one fan outside the ground.</p>
              <p>Television pictures showed a clearly incensed Lehmann pull the fan's glasses from his face and only give them back after the fan pleaded for their return.</p>
              <p>The former <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal </span></a>and Germany goalkeeper then called for a taxi before opting instead to get on the team bus.</p>
              <p>He did not remain on the bus for long, however, as he had a change of heart once again and took a taxi to Frankfurt airport, from where he flew back to his family in Munich.</p>
              <p>Lehmann was fined 40,000 euros last week for criticising his club and further disciplinary measures can now be expected.</p>
              <p>'That was unnecessary,' said coach Christian Gross. 'I will talk to him about it. It is a delicate situation. I know Jens Lehmann as a footballer, but not yet as a person.'</p>

              <p><strong>Despite a turbulent week, Lehmann's place in the Stuttgart goal does not appear to be under threat amid rumours he may decide to hang up his gloves this winter - six months ahead of plan.</strong></p>
              <p>'I cannot imagine that,' said director of sport Horst Heldt. 'He will be suspended, but he still has a contract until June 30, 2010. 'It is a shame that it came to this because he had made some fantastic saves. I am going to have to have a word with him.'</p>
              <p>Lehmann was caught on camera urinating behind the goal during Stuttgart's 3-1  Champions League defeat of Unirea Urziceni, appearing to stop midway through as the Romanians mounted an attack and vaulted to advertising boards to regain his place between the sticks.</p>

              <h1>Kahn urges Lehmann to call it a day</h1>

              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Oliver Kahn has told Stuttgart goalkeeper Jens
              Lehmann that he should bring the curtain down on his career in the wake
              of his recent escapades.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Kahn and Lehmann sustained a bitter feud for
              several years when they were both fighting for the Germany number one
              jersey, but they appeared to make peace at the 2006 World Cup when Kahn
              retired from international football.</p>
              <p>Two years later, Kahn brought his glittering football career to
              an end just short of his 40th birthday, but Lehmann has carried on
              playing after turning 40.</p>
              <p>But, after being in the headlines for all the wrong reasons,
              first for criticising his club and then for storming off at the end of
              their 1-1 draw with Mainz after receiving a red card and giving away a
              penalty, Kahn has advised him to retire from the game.</p>
              <p>"Maybe it would be better for him to retire now," Kahn told the Az newspaper. "Who knows where things might yet lead.</p>
              <p>"Jens is a good goalkeeper, but what should the management (at Stuttgart) think?</p>
              "There is no point to it anymore. Stuttgart's management have got to work out whether Lehmann is helping or damaging the team."<p></p>
