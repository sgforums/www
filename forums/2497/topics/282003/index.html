            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Martin Jol has reportedly agreed a Â£4million compensation package with Tottenham despite denying reports he is on his way out of the club.</strong><br><br>Over the weekend there were claims that chairman Daniel Levy made five separate attempts to lure Jose Mourinho to White Hart Lane last week, with one newspaper even claiming Jol was ready to quit his post.<br><br>But the Dutchman said: "Everybody is committed to the cause of getting higher up the league and making a success of the season.<br><br>"This is dominating my thoughts at the moment and so you can imagine how surprised I was to hear that one newspaper was suggesting that I was on the verge of quitting my job. What a load of rubbish."<br><br>However, Tuesday's Daily Mirror claims Jol has struck a deal with the club and will go as soon as they can find a suitable replacement.</div>

Our focus is on winning games.<br><br>"For the record Damien (Comolli) was not in Barcelona this weekend, he was watching Southampton v Barnsley."<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disregarded</span></strong><br>And a statement on the club's official website read: "Normally we only have to remind fans to ignore speculation during transfer windows, and we do that in the best interests of our playing staff and our supporters.<br><br>"Given the level of speculation about Martin and his position at the club we feel it is necessary to do the same thing now.<br><br>"Much of the reporting that has been carried since mid-August has been speculative and unfounded and accurately provided information has been disregarded."</div>
