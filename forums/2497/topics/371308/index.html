              <h1>English Angle: Attention, Liverpool Fans - Everything You Want To Know About Alberto Aquilani</h1>
              <h2>You've
              heard the name, now let Goal.com Italy expert Fabrizio Ponciroli fill
              in all the blanks on Anfield's latest midfield maestro...</h2>
              </div>
              <p></p>
              <div id="article_detail_block">
              <div id="small_article_image_container"><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/29218_news.jpg" alt="Alberto Aquilani, Roma (Foto Grazia Neri)"></div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Is He Worthy?</strong><br><br>Potentially,
              Aquilani is the ideal player to replace Xabi Alonso. He has refined
              feet, an excellent positional sense and he also has a good shot on
              goal. The only doubt: his physical condition. Too often he has been out
              injured. In any case, he has the personality to play for a club like
              Liverpool, even though he will have to learn to be more consistent.<br><br><strong>On The Pitch</strong><br><br>Alberto
              Aquilani is a central midfielder with offensive tendencies, with good
              feet (he can use both, even though the right foot is his favourite). He
              has also been employed as a classical, between-the-lines playmaker, but
              he has shown his best form when given full control of the midfield.<br><br>He's
              a very dynamic player, he has a good long-range shot (many of his
              greatest goals have been efforts from outside the area) but he’s also
              good at getting into the area untracked. He makes his presence felt on
              the pitch, he has a good temperament, despite his injuries, he doesn’t
              exactly fear the physical battle and he has, like all Italians, a
              strong positional sense.<br><br>He almost never loses his head (even
              under pressure); this is demonstrated by relatively low yellow-card
              count (nine in the league since playing for Roma) and he has never been
              sent off.<br></p>
              <div><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/53146.jpg" alt=""><br>Aquilani, like Xabi, will pull all Rafa's strings<br></div>
              <p><br><strong>Off The Pitch</strong><br><br>Aquilani
              has always been described as a calm and reserved lad. Hailing from the
              Roman quarter of Montesacro (where he’s considered an idol), he doesn’t
              like to be in the spotlight, he’s a pretty simple person, very tied to
              his family (he has a tattoo with the initials of his closest family
              members). Then there is his girlfriend, actress Michela Quattrociocche,
              who has recently tattooed the player’s initials on her neck to show her
              love for Alberto.<br><br>He won’t have problems adjusting to England,
              even though certainly Rome was his home. He’s not the type who talks a
              lot in the dressing room or on the pitch. In the Eternal City he was
              very well liked. Being an intelligent person, he’ll manage to find his
              space also in Liverpool…<br><br><strong>The Man &amp; The Fans</strong><br><br>Despite
              being just one year younger than Daniele De Rossi, Aquilani is still
              considered the boy in the group at Roma. The fans have always liked
              him, especially for being a Roman 100 per cent.<br><br>Obviously,
              compared to the likes Totti and De Rossi, the Roman people’s love for
              him is different. Aquilani was not considered to be on their level, but
              he was still very well seen by the Roma fans. The phrase most often
              said to describe him was: “He’s good, but too often injured…”<br></p>

              <p><strong>Potential</strong><br><br>Roma
              needed to get some money. Few people thought it would be up to him to
              pack his bags, especially because he was considered a 'son of Rome'.<br><br>Nevertheless,
              Liverpool could certainly represent the ideal place for Aquilani to
              make a jump in quality. A new environment, a new coach, and a team that
              seems to suit his qualities. In Rome, each time he came on the pitch,
              he was called on to make the difference; in Liverpool, he’ll have more
              time.<br><br><strong>Value For Money<br><br></strong>The price paid by Liverpool
              for Aquilani (about £18 million) is good value, because the boy has
              much room for improvement and, above all else, was born in 1984. <br><br>Roma
              certainly have done a great deal economically, but if the player will
              do well on the pitch, Liverpool will also say that they have not spent
              too much. <br><br>The boy, on paper, is worth the money spent to bring him to Anfield.<strong><br></strong><br><strong>Expert Opinions</strong><br><br><em>Ubaldo Righetti (former AS Roma player, 1980-1987 and voice of Roma Channel)</em>:
              “Aquilani has not betrayed Roma, absolutely not. It was a painful
              choice, both for the club and the lad. He is from Rome, he loves Rome
              and he never would have left, but in life you have to make choices.
              Roma need money and the lad needs to have new experiences. The club has
              always taken care of him but they had reached a point where they had to
              make some decisions. <br><br>"I think Aquilani will do great things at
              Liverpool. English football is different to Italian football but
              Aquilani has characteristics that will allow him to adapt himself well.
              He just needs to find the consistency he lacked in Rome. Certainly he
              will need to adapt but, knowing him, I know he will do his best. If he
              finds continuity, he will do exceptional things at Liverpool. <br><br>"He’s
              going to a team of a very high level, one of the best clubs in the
              world, for him it’s a great new opportunity which he has to take with
              both hands.”<br><br><em>Attilio Tesser (Aquilani’s coach at Triestina, 2003-04)</em>:
              “He immediately showed he was not only able to play as a central
              midfielder but also in one of the vertices of a diamond formation, and
              he immediately showed great temperament. I’d also like to underline his
              very positive family environment. His parents are exceptional people.”<br></p>

              <p><br><strong>ONE MORE THING...</strong><br><br>It’s said that, in the past, Aquilani almost became a Lazio player.<br><br>Here’s what he said in an exclusive interview to <em>Calcio2000</em> – November 2007:<br><br>“I
              want to clear up this story about Lazio because it’s been talked about
              a lot. As a child I played with Spas Montesacro, my local team. One day
              I accompanied a friend of mine to the training, without even knowing
              that that team was a satellite club of Lazio.<br><br>"A Lazio observer
              asked me to train, I did it and, at the end of the training, they said
              they wanted to get me. But I did not sign anything with Lazio, I simply
              went to training with a friend.<br><br>"After refusing to join the
              Biancocelesti, I waited for a month, and then Roma proposed me to join
              their youth ranks. It should be clear to everyone: I don’t and never
              will support Lazio in any way.”</p>
