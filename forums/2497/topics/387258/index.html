              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> legend Jan Molby has launched a scathing attack on the club's underperforming stars, stating that big-name players, such as </strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Steven Gerrard</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> and new signing </strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Alberto Aquilani</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>, need to step up their game if the Reds are to achieve the top-four </strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Premier League</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> finish promised by their manager </strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Rafael Benitez</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Speaking<strong> </strong>through the Liverpool Supporters Club New York and their MP Red podcast, the Dane - who made nearly 500 appearances for the club between 1984 and 1996 - asked questions over skipper Gerrard's form, accusing the 29-year-old of "sulking" during the Reds' tumultuous start to the season.</p>
              <p>"Gerrard has not been 100 per cent this season with his injury," said Molby. "And it begs the question: 'what are we looking to achieve with him?'</p>
              <p>"Yes he has been restricted by his injury, but to me it seems he has also had a bit of a sulk on this season. He looks heavy legged, there isn't really that spring in his step this season so far and the team has suffered."</p>
              <p>Yet despite Gerrard's lack-of-form this term, and mischievous reports linking him away from Liverpool, Molby believes that the 29-year-old will remain a Red for the rest of his career.</p>
              <p>"Steven Gerrard is a Liverpool player, there is nowhere else for him to play," he added. "I'm not sure what it would mean for him to lift the [Premier League] title with another club. He wants to win the title with Liverpool but, if not, I have a feeling he could live without it."</p>

              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/54518_hp.jpg" alt=""><br><em><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hands up</span> | Molby Blames 'Sulking' Steven Gerrard For Liverpool Woes</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>As one of Liverpool's first foreign imports, signed from Ajax in 1984, Molby knows a thing or two about settling into a new football culture, and says that if the Reds' latest midfield maestro - injury-hit midfielder Aquilani - is to have an impact at the club, then next season may be his best bet.</strong></p>
              <p>"Being brutally honest, we are halfway through the season and his [Aquilani's] contribution has been zero," Molby continued.</p>
              <p>"That is not all his fault, with the injury etc, but it is still a fact. "I actually spoke to Rafa Benitez about him a few weeks back and said that, from my experience, if Aquilani is to make a big impact at the club, then it will probably be next season at the earliest."</p>
              <p>Yet despite admitting to some misgivings about the Italian's ability to adapt to English football, Molby says Aquilani has the attributes to establish himself as a good signing for the Reds.</p>
              <p>"It is a totally different style of play [to Serie A] and you have to learn to look after yourself quickly," he added.</p>
              <p>"You have to face the Blackburns and the Sunderlands - with players like Lee Cattermole biting in - and you have to compete. If you don't fancy it, you can get snowed under very quickly.</p>
              <p>"But if it comes down to talent, then Aquilani certainly has what it takes to be a success. He has ability, no question."</p>
              <p>Molby is the latest ex-Red to stick the boot into Benitez’s embattled side, who welcome Tottenham Hotspur to Anfield on Sunday knowing that a defeat would leave them seven points adrift of the top-four.</p>
              <p>In December, former manager Graeme Souness declared that the club was on the verge of “meltdown” after their exit from the Champions League, whilst Ronnie Whelan and Jamie Redknapp have been highly critical of Benitez’s methods throughout Liverpool’s below-par start to the season.</p>
              <p>Saturday’s FA Cup draw at Championship strugglers Reading represented another below par display in a season dominated by false dawns and disappointment for Reds fans.</p>
              <p>One player who Molby reserves special praise for, however, is goalkeeper Pepe Reina, who the Dane believes can go on to become Liverpool's best-ever stopper.</p>
              <p>"I said a few years ago that Reina has all the tools to become the greatest keeper in Liverpool's history, and I stick by that, he has been fantastic this season," said Molby.</p>
              <p>"People say he doesn't come and catch enough balls, but I think he is a truly exceptional keeper, and deserves to be mentioned up there with the best."</p>
              <p>And in a season of minimal promise for Liverpool supporters, Molby reveals his excitement at the prospect of young Spaniard Daniel Pacheco, who has shone in two first-team cameo appearances this season.</p>
              <p>Molby concedes that the 18-year-old's lack of physical presence may prove a hindrance, but says Reds fans have reason to get excited about Pacheco's progress.</p>
              <p>"I like the kid because he has great ability," added Molby. "He has a great first touch - schooled in Barcelona of course - can spot a pass, and has fantastic set-piece delivery. If we talk about Steven Gerrard's ability from set-pieces, well this kid is something special.</p>
              <p>"My only worry about him is his lack of strength, he is very slight. That probably means he is unlikely to dominate games, but he certainly has the ability to be a match-winner for Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"He is confident, he always wants the ball, wants to play - that's down to his upbringing - and I think he is a very exciting kid for Liverpool fans to get excited about."<em><br></em></p>
