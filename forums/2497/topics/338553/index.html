              <p><strong>Bayern Munich president Franz Beckenbauer has slammed Michael Ballack for reviving a recent row with Germany coach Joachim Low. The Chelsea midfielder told Germany's Premiere television that he had "intentionally" gone public with his criticism of Low last month.</strong></p>
              <p>Although he claims his comments were not meant as a criticism, and were "blown out of proportion" by the German media, he said he had considered his words in a bid to "shake a few people up."</p>
              <p>Ballack was summoned for clear-the-air talks by a furious Low and his future as Germany captain was in doubt until the pair met in Frankfurt and resolved their differences.</p>
              <p>Beckenbauer believes Ballack is still skating on thin ice and cannot understand why he has decided to go public once again.</p>
              <p>"I am speechless," he said. "I thought the whole issue had been dealt with. "It would be terrible if this whole issue turned into a never-ending story."</p>
              <p>That should not be the case, though, since Low has already warned Ballack that his international career will be over if he steps out of line once again.</p>
              <p>His latest comments have not been treated as criticism. "Michael has the right to express his opinion," Low told Bild newspaper.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Beckenbauer believes Ballack is on the brink of boiling over once again. He told Premiere television: "I believe that Ballack is still very frustrated and that has carried over from Euro 2008 where he noticed a few shortcomings and complained.</p>
              <p>"It is starting to weigh him down that he will probably always be the man who finished second. "Therefore, he is perhaps still a bit angry."</p>
              <p>Ballack has won one Bundesliga title with Kaiserslautern, but lost in Champions League and DFB-Pokal finals with Bayer Leverkusen as well as in the Euro 2008 final with Germany and the Champions League again with Chelsea last season.</p>
              <p>The Blues also finished as runners-up to Manchester United in the Premier League last season.</p>
