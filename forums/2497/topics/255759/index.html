            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.teamtalk.com//Images/114300.jpg"><br><br><strong>Arsene Wenger is interested in taking Michael Owen to Arsenal, according to reports in the north east. The Newcastle Evening Chronicle claims that Wenger asked St James' Park officials whether they were intending to partner Owen with Obafemi Martins next season. He apparently indicated that he would be interested in taking whichever striker may be available. </strong><br><br>Wenger is expected to watch Owen when he plays for England B against Albania this Friday night and again when he faces Brazil and Estonia if he proves his fitness at Turf Moor. The report suggests that Manchester United's interest in Owen has cooled because of the combination of his Â£5million-a-year wages and his questionable fitness, while Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez has no interest in taking him back to Anfield.<br><br>Wenger has made his admiration for Martins very clear in the past, but the Nigerian will disappear on African Nations duty at the same time as Emmanuel Adebayor, leaving the Gunners with limited options. Owen is still to sit down and talk with Newcastle boss Sam Allardyce about his future.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think AW is just casting his nets as a contingency plan in case Henry leaves. The rumours of him leaving hasn't subsided yet. And although he might stay, there's always a possibility of a Vieira happening  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>AW knowing that funds are limited, is now grooming the current crop to be stars of the future.  I am pretty sure given one or two more seasons, they will be very strong, all of them played together for several seasons, grew together, and since each of them start young, from scratch, you don't have the ego &amp; management problem of managing super stars or Shevchenko syndrome.<br><br>You can see that the squad is going to be built around Febregas &amp; Walcott - I am assuming Henry is gonnna to stick around as the leader to lead the pack - but in event he goes, AW will stick someone senior as captain.<br><br>But the managment and fans need patience because you cannot expect a relatively young squad to suddenly become a championship winning team.</div>
