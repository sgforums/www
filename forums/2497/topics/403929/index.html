              <h1>Manchester City stunned by Wolfburg's £50m demands to sign Bosnia 
              striker Edin Dzeko<br></h1>

              <p>Wolfsburg have stunned Manchester City by insisting it will cost them
               at least £50million to prise away Edin Dzeko.</p>
              <p>The Bosnian is 
              keen to join City but Roberto Mancini rightly considers the deal too 
              expensive. City made an offer last month which was rejected and are now 
              waiting on the player to push for the move.</p>

              <p>Mancini, meanwhile, is close to agreeing a deal for Colombia 
              goalkeeper Cristian Bonilla and has invited former teammate Attilio 
              Lombardo to join the Manchester City coaching staff.</p>
              <p>Lombardo,
               44, said: 'I'm proud to work alongside Mancini. I played for a 
              year-and-a-half at Crystal Palace so I know some of the football.</p>

              next season.</p>

              <p><strong>David Silva has completed his £30million move from Valencia to Manchester City.</strong></p>
              <p>The Spain winger is moving to Eastlands on a five-year deal and becomes Roberto Mancini’s second World Cup signing of the summer following Germany defender Jerome Boateng’s £10m transfer from Hamburg.</p>
              <p>The Silva deal was completed - subject to a medical - after Spain reached the quarter-finals with victory over Portugal in Cape Town on Tuesday night. </p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span> revealed last week that City had seen off late interest from Chelsea to snare Silva, but Spanish officials wanted to be sure of progressing in the tournament before the deal was confirmed and were wary that he could have been accused of putting personal ambition before his country if they had lost to their neighbours.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>However, once Silva’s former Valencia team-mate David Villa scored to clinch their place in the last eight, they were keen for the move to go through as quickly as possible.</strong></p>
              <p>Silva, 24, who has been at Valencia since 2004, will officially sign after the World Cup. 'I have enjoyed six years at Valencia, they discovered me as a footballer and they will always be a special club for me,' he said.</p>
              <p>‘The time is right for me to seek a new challenge, and I am thrilled about playing in England with Manchester City.</p>
              <p>'I believe the Premier League is one of the best competitions in the world and I want to bring success to City and win trophies for them.</p>

              <p><strong>City boss Mancini, who hopes to add Ivory Coast international Yaya Toure before the end of the week after agreeing a £28m deal with Barcelona, is delighted to have signed Silva.</strong></p>
              <p>‘I think that David Silva is one of the best midfielders in Europe, and I hope he will be a very important player for Manchester City,' said the Italian.</p>
              <p>‘I am so pleased he is coming to us, I think he can make a big, big impact for Manchester City.</p>
              <p>'In signing David, we are showing the world that we are bringing the best players here and that we hope to compete to win the Premier League.</p>
              <p>‘When players see what is happening at City and the ambition they are attracted to what we are building and want to be a part of it.</p>
              <p>‘I hope he does very well for Spain in the World Cup and then joins us for our pre-season, ready to compete in the Premier League. I am very excited about seeing him playing for City.’</p>
              <p>Real Madrid had been lining up a deal for Silva earlier this year only for new boss Jose Mourinho to prefer other targets.</p>
              <p>Barcelona and Chelsea have also courted him, while Liverpool tried unsuccessfully to sign him last summer. </p>
              <p>City's deal for holding midfielder Toure is all but done, but must be rubber-stamped by new Barcelona president Sandro Rosell, who officially starts his job on Thursday.</p>

              City spending to £260M</h1>
              <p>David Silva is joining <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> on a whopping £140,000 a week.</p>
              <p>The former <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Valencia</span></abbr> winger signed with City yesterday in a 
              £24m move. <em>The Sun</em> says his four-year deal is worth £140,000 a 
              week - a total of £29m in wages.</p>
              <p>Manager <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Roberto Mancini</span></abbr> said: "I think David Silva can make
               a big, big impact.</p>
              <p>"We are showing the world we are bringing the best players here and that
               we hope to win the League."</p>
              <p>Silva, 24, will complete his medical after the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">World
               Cup</span></abbr>. He said: "The time is right for me to seek a new 
              challenge and I'm thrilled about playing in England with City."</p>
              <p>The Eastlands club have spent £260m since Sheikh Mansour bought City in 
              2008.</p>
