              <p class="SubHeading"><span style="font-size: small;">The 32-year-old defender scored from the spot in the first half for the Reds before converting a penalty own-goal for the club he supported as a boy after the break.</span></p>

              <div id="ext-gen1136" class="moduleHalf"><span style="font-size: small;">The teams looked one-sided as Carragher was able to call on favours from current team-mates Steven Gerrard and Joe Cole as well as former players Michael Owen, Luis Garcia, Emile Heskey, Danny Murphy and Jerzy Dudek.   <br></span></div>
              <p class="SubHeading"><span style="font-size: small;">But if you were being charitable to Everton, managed by David Moyes, you could say they did not want to spoil the occasion.   </span></p>
              <p class="SubHeading"><span style="font-size: small;">Gerrard, given dispensation by Fabio Capello after featuring in England's 4-0 victory over Bulgaria last night, played the opening 10 minutes before being replaced by Murphy.  </span></p>
              <p class="SubHeading"><span style="font-size: small;">On the bench former Reds manager Gerard Houllier warmed up for a possible Premier League return with Aston Villa by sitting alongside current boss Roy Hodgson.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Manchester United striker Owen assumed the role of pantomime villain with a mixed chorus of boos and cheers from the crowd of 35,631 greeting his every touch.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">He played up to his new status when his shot struck Jose Baxter's arm for the 44th-minute penalty, pretending to lay claim to the spot-kick before allowing Carragher to take two steps and roll the ball past Iain Turner.   </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Prior to that referee Mark Halsey had provided the comedy moment when he delivered a slap around the head to Lee Carsley after booking the Toffees midfielder for theatrically kicking the ball away.   </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Luis Garcia's goal after being set up by Cole and Heskey on the right of the penalty area was a sign of things to come.   </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Owen had a shot tipped around the post, Luis Garcia sidefooted wide Cole's cross, Heskey - as he often did in a Liverpool shirt - squandered a great chance when he skewed well off target after being put though and Murphy also rolled a shot wide. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">In the second half Cole volleyed in his first goal at Anfield - having missed a penalty at the ground in the Europa League qualifier against Rabotnicki - from Ryan Babel's cross and reserve team striker Nathan Eccleston fired home. </span></p>

              <p>I think that's very rude, i dont agree to crack jokes on such a situation. To say that Jamie took all the funds from the testimonial is an insult to the charity act.</p>
              <p>Obviously, the funds are going here.</p>

              <p>This is something that's not right at all IMO.</p>
              <p>I understand the rivalry between utd and liverpool, but to proclaim that Jamie pocketed all the money for his own use is clearly something that's not nice to hear of.</p>
              <p>When a man do a good deed for fellow mankind but got insulted because of that rivalry is seriously a case of lacking respect.</p>

              <p>No one made any jokes about the misfortune ones here... Do read carefully... I only found his reply to mine creative and hilarious. But to be fair to him, calling it his 'own foundation' shouldn't in any way be seen as insulting to Carragher or even more so the 'misfortune ones' as he did donate it to his own selected foundations as you have shown...</p>

              <p>And again, your interpretation is way off here... Cos I read from the first post to this last one, but nowhere do I see anyone saying Jamie took all the funds from the testimonial? Only yourself is the only one saying it do you realise that ?</p>
              <p>You seemed over eager to jump the gun and come to very bad conclusion... Cos like, who is cracking jokes at the expensed of the misfortune ones? Again I don't see it from top to bottom...</p>

              <p>2) Who is the one who implied Carragher took all the funds from the testimonial?</p>
              <p>3) Who is cracking jokes at the expensed of the misfortune ones?</p>

              <p>As i have said earlier, I only found his reply to me creative and hilarious. I was simply responding to his reply that's all... You want to assume otherwise, or my 'tune' it's up to you. But I should have a right to reply to him, right?</p>
              <p>Ok on your "charity act"... Wah like your super star question ah? I didn't want to make it any more bad for you but since you persist... Actually if you read deeper, you would know i have already given you the answer. I will give you a more straight forward answer now.</p>
              <p>But first please define the meaning "charity act" from your first full sentence ok, don't cut half half ah. That earlier one you highlighted in red, that one can be killer blow you know... If people didn't see the front of my sentence... "<span style="color: #ff0000;">shouldn't in any way be seen as insulting" <span style="color: #000000;">and only see what you quote as me saying...</span> "be seen as <span style="color: #ff0000;">insulting"<span style="color: #000000;">...

              <p> </p>
              <p>First of all, as i have pointed out earlier, you are still the only one to clearly suggest or assume Jamie took all the funds from the testimonial, and no one else to date...</p>
              <p>From your sentence, can we say that the word charity act is used as someone's goodwill to donate the funds generated to a charity? Or someone's act of kindness to another be it a person or an organization? And in this case, from your full sentence, clearly Carragher's act of charity correct?</p>
              <p>So if I already pointed out "calling it his 'own foundation' <span style="color: #ff0000;">shouldn't in any way be seen as insulting</span> to Carragher or even more so the misfortune ones". How so can it be an insult to anyone or thing?</p>
              <p>I will say it again that your interpretation of words is way off... And really, there is no need to overreact... And it's how you construct that can easily come across as rude... No need for words like got moustache = your father? fart = rude? The word fart in itself isn't rude. Even f*** too isn't. It's how you used it that can be easily tell...</p>

              <p>Ok, I think i need to clarify some stuff which brought about a huge barrage of comments.</p>
              <p>I mentioned "I think he donated all the proceeds leh, to his own foundation. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">"</p>
              <p>It's definitely not insulting but because I am a United fund, it was deemed as an insult.</p>
              <p>Yes, he did donate all the proceeds and yes, it was to his own foundation isn't it? So whats wrong with this sentence? My smiley face?</p>
