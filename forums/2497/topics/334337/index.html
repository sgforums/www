              <h1>Calcio Debate: Juve Fans Should Support Real Madrid</h1>
              <h2>Claudio Ranieri will almost certainly be sacked as coach of Juventus if his team lose to Real Madrid in the Champions League. Carlo Garganese believes that every Bianconero should become a Blanco on Tuesday night.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/33640_news.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>If it wasn’t already patently obvious beforehand, Juventus really are in crisis now following their 2-1 defeat at Napoli last night, a result which means they could drop to as low as 14th in Serie A by the end of today, and also find themselves seven points behind the league leaders.<br></strong><br>Juve have not won in five games, with the last two of these being defeats. If the Old Lady were to make it a hat-trick of losses against Real Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday night, then surely the Juventus management team would have no other option but to dismiss Claudio Ranieri.<br><br>If Juve are somehow able to sneak a win, or a draw, then the Tinkerman may yet live to tinker for another day. In view of this, there is no doubt in my mind that every Juventino should transform into a Real Madrid fan in Turin, in order to ensure that Ranieri is sacked.<br><br>The simple truth of the matter, as I have said on many occasions, is that Ranieri just is not up to the job at Juventus. Against Napoli, he made some simply horrific substitutions, once again, which ultimately cost his side the match. With the game open at 1-1, Ranieri took off one of his two attackers, Alex Del Piero and, bizarrely, brought on a defender, Paolo De Ceglie. Napoli were immediately handed the initiative, and it was then inevitable that they would grab the winner, which they did through Ezequiel Lavezzi.<br><br>Juve will win no major trophies under Ranieri, so it really is in the best interest of everyone associated with the club that he is out of the door as soon a possible. A defeat against Real Madrid would not be the end of the world. The other realistic challenger for the second spot in Group H, Zenit St Petersburg, are four points behind Juve, so a loss at the Stadio Olimpico won’t change all that much, although it would complicate the away trips to both Madrid and Saint Petersburg.<br><br>The worst thing that could happen to Juventus on Tuesday is if they beat Real Madrid because that would mean Ranieri keeping his job for a little while longer.</p>

              <h1>Juventus hit form as record 36 goals are scored in Champions League</h1>
              <h2>Juventus finally found form on Tuesday night as they beat Real Madrid 2-1 in their Group H encounter and 36 goals were scored in the eight matches across the Champions League – a record for the competition.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01013/claudio-ranieri_1013139c.jpg" alt="Claudio Ranieri and Carvalho Amauri: Juventus hit form as record 36 goals are scored in Champions League" width="460" height="288"></p>
              <p><span class="caption"><em>That's my boy: Claudio Ranieri congratulates Juventus' goalscorer Carvalho Amauri as he is substituted in Turin</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Juventus  2 - 1 Real Madrid</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Strikers Alessandro del Piero and Amauri found the target for the hosts while Ruud van Nistelrooy collected Madrid’s solitary goal. The evergreen Del Piero opened the scoring after just five minutes, latching on to Amauri’s pass and curling the ball into the top corner from 20 metres.</strong></p>
              <p>Juve, who had not won in five matches coming into the game, punished a lethargic Real again after 49 minutes when Amauri’s header from Pavel Nedved’s cross was deflected in off Gabriel Heinze. Van Nistelrooy nodded home for Real in the 66th minute but Juve held on. The Serie A club go top of the group with seven points from three games, with Real Madrid on six. BATE Borisov drew 1-1 at Zenit St Petersburg in the other group match.</p>
