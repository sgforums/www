              <p><strong>Today we ask</strong>: <em>Jose Mourinho and Carlo Ancelotti will 
              meet again in the last 16 of the Champions League, but what is the history 
              between the pair?</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><br><br>Gabriele Marcotti responds:</strong> ”The 
              rivalry between the pair goes back to the time when Mourinho had left Chelsea 
              and was being constantly linked with AC Milan. That was also a time, during the 
              summer of 2008, when Ancelotti was on pretty shaky ground at Milan and even 
              admitted to speaking with Chelsea. <br><br>Ancelotti was being asked over and 
              over again “what do you think about Mourinho? Is he going to take your job?” He 
              responded with an off the cuff comment that was made as he was literally walking 
              out of the press conference, he joked “I don’t need Mourinho at AC Milan, he 
              isn’t much of a footballer, have you ever seen him kick a ball”?</p>
              </div>
              <a id="more"></a>
              <div class="entry-more">
              <p>It was a joke, but Mourinho didn’t see it that way and responded by saying 
              that Arrigo Sacchi [who won two European Cups at Milan] wasn't a footballer 
              either, but was a far greater Milan manager than Ancelotti had ever been. From 
              there it went on as Mourinho became Inter manager although it has always been 
              fairly one sided.</p>
              <p>It takes a lot to wind Ancelotti up. He is a very low key guy and has been 
              especially low key this season. I would imagine he will do everything he can to 
              avoid a war of words in the build-up to these matches. Mourinho won't hesitate 
              to start the verbal sparring if he feels it will benefit his team.</p>
              <p>I will predict that we will hear something along the lines of “Whose team is 
              this anyway? I signed Petr Cech, I signed Ashley Cole, I signed Ricardo 
              Carvalho, I signed Michael Essien, I signed Didier Drogba and I made John Terry 
              captain.” In some ways he has a point. Many of the Chelsea players remain very 
              attached to Jose and that may well be something he uses to get to Ancelotti.”</p>

              </p><p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Carlo Ancelotti" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/carlo-ancelotti"><strong>Carlo Ancelotti</strong></a><strong> has vowed not to be provoked by José Mourinho's trademark "mind games" after the 
              draw for the knockout phase of the </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Champions League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championsleague"><strong>Champions League</strong></a><strong> gave the Special One a mouth-watering return to </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Chelsea" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chelsea"><strong>Chelsea</strong></a><strong> with </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Internazionale" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/internazionale"><strong>Internazionale</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
              <p>Mourinho's return to Stamford Bridge, where he won the club's first league 
              titles in half a century during a glittering three-and-a-half-year spell, that 
              catches the imagination, particularly given the strained relationship he endured 
              with Ancelotti, then at Milan, in Serie A last season.</p>
              <p>The pair clashed verbally as Mourinho claimed the Serie A title for Inter but 
              failed to secure the club's principal objective, the European Cup. "There were 
              some problems, some questions and discussions in the papers, but I like him as a 
              coach," said Ancelotti. "He's a fantastic coach who won in Portugal, in England, 
              in Italy. Everywhere. But I'm not able to discuss his character. I will speak of 
              him as a coach and nothing else. It isn't a problem that we don't have a good 
              relationship. This can be a good opportunity to improve that.</p>
              <p>"It will be an emotional game for him. He did a fantastic job here, so to 
              play against Chelsea won't be easy for him. But this match is Chelsea versus 
              Inter, a football match between two of the most important teams in Europe. 
              Nothing else. I have experience [of what he'll try to do] but I'm not ready to 
              play mind games. I never will be ready to play these games. I prefer to play 
              football matches and I've never thought that a football game is a match between 
              coaches. I will try and find a weakness in their team but not in a fellow 
              coach."</p>
              <p>Ancelotti was more critical of Mourinho in his autobiography, Preferisco la 
              Coppa, in which he referred to the Inter coach as "His Mourinhoness, comparing 
              himself to Jesus" and "His Specialness". The pair went head-to-head in 
              pre-season, when Chelsea won 2-0 in a friendly in Pasadena yet both avoided talk 
              of their frosty past. The Chelsea chief executive, Ron Gourlay, said the former 
              manager's return would be "spectacular" yet, for all that Mourinho will be 
              afforded a tumultuous reception by fans, it could prove an awkward obstacle for 
              the London side.</p>
              <p>"Going back to Stamford Bridge will be an added motivation for Mourinho," 
              said the Inter president, Massimo Moratti, who had seen the Portuguese's 
              relationship with the Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, steadily deteriorate. 
              "It's better to have those strong motivations and, against Chelsea, we'll 
              certainly have those."</p>

              <p>Although Ancelotti was adamant he will not get mixed up in mind games,
              he did hint that the build-up to the matches will affect Mourinho more.</p>
              <p>The Portuguese left Stamford Bridge in 2007 after winning two Premier Leagues, an FA Cup and two League Cups.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti added: "I think that for him it will be an emotional game. He did a very good job here in <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>, so to play against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> won't be easy for him. He will do his best to win against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>"Mourinho did a very good job and maintained a very good
              relationship with these players. That's normal. They won and this will
              be a reminder of those seasons. This is normal in football.</p>
              <p>"The games will be difficult because I think that at the moment Inter are the strongest team in Italy.</p>
              <p>"They are top of the table. It is difficult for them, though, to play against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>"I think we have confidence this season to do the best in the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> and in Europe.</p>
              <p>"But for us, at this moment, it's better to speak about the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">West Ham</span></abbr> game in the league this weekend."</p>
