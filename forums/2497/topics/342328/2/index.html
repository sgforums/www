            <div class='col-md body'><p>i was saying once cech reaches 32 years old. i know david seaman lasted till 41 years old, but even so 8 million for say 6 years of mediocrity is a waste of money. we have to become pragmatic and realistic not like arsene wenger. look at the number of goals given conceded, not the fantastic saves he made. what's the point of stopping point blank shots when you concede 5 in a game. i rather a keeper save 2 ordinary shots and keep a clean sheet. it's ridiculous these days. only keepers who have clean sheets and pull off good saves deserve recognition. or at least maybe conceding 1 or 2 goals the maximum.</p></div>

              <h1>Given needs to go: Toon turmoil is driving Shay out, claims lawyer's bombshell statement<br></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/01/01/article-0-02E78956000005DC-639_306x423.jpg" alt="Given" width="306" height="423"></p>
              <p><em>Shay Given has rocked Newcastle by revealing he wants to leave the club</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Newcastle</strong></span><strong> were rocked on Thursday night as Shay Given’s future was thrown into doubt after 459 appearances for the club.</strong></p>
              <p>Given’s lawyer, Michael Kennedy, took the unusual step of releasing a statement that will surely bring to an end the goalkeeper’s loyal 11-year stay at St James’ Park under nine managers.</p>
              <p>Kennedy said: ‘Shay is very despondent following the very poor performance of the team against <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool </span></a>last weekend. ‘It was the lowest point of his football career and a performance that he would not wish to be repeated.</p>
              <p>‘When he signed a new five-year contract in 2006 it was on the basis that the club would challenge for major honours, but on the present evidence all that he can see ahead with the turmoil on and off the pitch is a battle for survival.</p>
              <p>'Having served the club loyally for over 11 years, Shay feels compelled to consider his position in the light of the interest being expressed in him by <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester City</span></a>, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal</span></a> and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Tottenham</span></a>.’</p>
              <p>Kennedy, who also represents Roy Keane, is notoriously reluctant to speak publicly, so this is a sign of Given’s unhappiness with Newcastle’s season and of their prospects.                           </p>
              <p>No bid for Given has been officially confirmed but Newcastle and the player face a decision as to whether Given appears in the FA Cup third round at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/hull-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Hull City</span></a> on Saturday.</p>
              <p>Newcastle owner Mike Ashley, having just taken the club off the market, has a major issue to deal with as Kennedy’s statement will resonate on Tyneside due to Given’s enormous popularity at Newcastle and because of his length of service — the 32-year-old Irishman has been at St James’ since Kenny Dalglish signed him in August 1997 from <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/blackburn-rovers.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Blackburn</span></a>.</p>
              <p>This comes on top of Michael Owen’s decision last week to postpone signing a new contract at Newcastle, raising the belief that Owen will leave in June.</p>
              <p>Cracks at the club are beginning to show. The thought of Newcastle also losing their talisman in Given will alarm supporters already more than sceptical about how Ashley is running their club.</p>
              <p>After Alan Shearer’s retirement in 2006, Given became the one Newcastle player to whom the Toon Army felt a special loyalty.</p>
              <p>Given feels the same loyalty to Newcastle fans but he is understood to have become increasingly annoyed by the club’s unreliability, particularly in the autumn when Kevin Keegan left St James’ in controversial circumstances. <br></p>

              <p>lehmann our dependable keeper was gotten at 32 for only 1 million. even cech cost 7 million only. i just hope arsenal look for someone else cheap and reliable, they should have bought gomes before he went tottenham. there were rumours of him going to arsenal anyway and i believe arsenal's goalkeeping coach would have taught Gomes how not to make those mistakes.</p>
              <p>craig gordon was also linked to arsenal and he is a fine young keeper</p>

              <p><br>23 goals conceded in 21 matches ain't good. lehmann accomplished 15 goals in 21 matches. don't blame too much on the defenders as well. almunia is a good keeper, but just like tim howard, he is more suited for clubs in the uefa rather than champions league.</p>
