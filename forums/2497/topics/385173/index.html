              <div>Tottenham have convincingly beaten Manchester City 3-0 at White Hart Lane to improve their Premier League campaign and continue their good form at Manchester City.<br><br>Tottenham were the stronger side in the first half and deservedly took the lead with a Niko Kranjcar strike in the 36th minute.<br><br>A
              high tempo start saw Manchester City create two early chances both
              involving the in-form Carlos Tevez. Within minutes Tevez managed to
              skip through the Tottenham defense striking the ball with incredible
              power but unfortunately his chance flew over the cross bar.<br><br>Tottenham
              got into the game shortly afterwards with Niko Kranjcar curling in a
              great cross, which was headed swiftly towards goal by Peter Crouch.
              However, the striker failed to utilize the early opportunity.<br><br>Crouch
              continued to play well with some intelligent runs through the Tottenham
              defense controlling all crosses and aerial battles. Niko Kranjcar also
              started well, supplying strikers Crouch and Jermaine Defoe with some
              excellent through balls and crosses.<br><br>The low winter temperatures
              didn't seem to affect either team who were both working hard for
              possession for the first 20 minutes. Robinho got into the match early
              looking to prove he was still the £32m player Mark Hughes bought last
              year, as he started to show glimpses of magic striking the ball sweetly
              past the post after 22 minutes.<br><br>Jermaine Defoe missed an opportunity inside the area after a quick run down the left from Aaron Lennon.<br><br>Aaron
              Lennon made another darting run down the right crossing the ball
              perfectly into the box, where Crouch headed towards goal. The ball was
              deflected out and met by <strong>Kranjcar</strong> who smashed the ball into the back of the net: 1-0 to Tottenham.<br><br>Minutes
              later Shay Given was put under more pressure with a fantastic move
              involving the two Tottenham strikers. Crouch finished the move by
              firing the ball into the top right but Given saw it early and
              comfortably managed the strikers effort.<br><br>Tottenham controlled
              the game after the goal and Manchester City were feeling the pressure
              with Defoe, Crouch and Lennon working the ball smoothly around the
              Manchester City defense as Silvio Sylvinho and Kolo Toure try
              desperately to gain possession.<br><br>Tottenham started the second
              half as they finished the first, and Defoe took full advantage of
              Manchester City's lack of confidence by breezing passed Sylvinho
              towards goal but the ball was hustled out for a throw in.<br> <br>Eight
              minutes into the second half and Tottenham increased the lead. Crouch
              headed the ball towards goal from a long ball down the middle, which
              was excellently half volleyed passed Shay Given by Jermaine<strong> Defoe</strong>: 2-0 Tottenham.<br><br>The
              second goal forces Mark Hughes to make some changes and Robinho is
              replaced by Roque Santa Cruz immediately after a strong move down the
              right from Tottenham.<br><br>Aaron Lennon picked the ball up seconds
              after Santa Cruz jogged on and tried to skip passed Sylvinho who
              unfairly takes Lennon down. Sylvinho is booked for his challenge.<br><br>Lennon
              took full advantage of Sylvinho's yellow card and put pressure on the
              defender with a number of darting runs down the wing. Crouch almost
              found himself in on goal after another run from Lennon but was unfairly
              flagged offside.  <br><br>The pressure continued and Manchester City
              were struggling to gain possession. Crouch dominated in the air and had
              a superb chance in the 82nd minute with a great cross from Lennon and a
              clever flick from Defoe, however, Crouch was unable to make it 3-0.<br><br>Two minutes into injury time Aaron Lennon provide another fantastic ball to <strong>Kranjcar</strong> who fired the ball into the goal from inside the six-yard box for an emphatic finish to the match.  </div>
