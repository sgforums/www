              <p class="first"><strong>An Italian prosecutor plans to bring a criminal case against England
              coach Fabio Capello for allegedly withholding information in a
              corruption trial.</strong></p>
              <p>He was a witness in the trial of six men accused of conspiring to
              control transfers by intimidating players into signing for a sports
              management firm.</p>
              <p>The state prosecutor believes he was evasive in the evidence he gave.</p>
              <p>Mr Capello's lawyers said he was certain "he had given all the information required of him".
              </p>
              <p>They said they were confident "everything will soon be completely cleared".</p>
              <p>In a statement, they said: "Mr Capello made it clear that he has never
              been involved in the conclusion of professional football players'
              contracts, and has only limited and indirect knowledge of this
              subject."</p>
              <p><strong>Newspaper interview</strong></p>
              <p>The court case, which is ongoing, relates to the GEA World sports agency.</p>
              <p>The former Juventus general manager Luciano Moggi, who was at the
              centre of Italy's match-fixing scandal in 2006, and Davide Lippi, son
              of the former Italy coach Marcello, are among the defendants.</p>
              <p>The England coach worked under Mr Moggi at Juventus until 2006, but it
              was his time in charge of Roma between 1999 and 2004 which most
              interested the court.</p>
              <p>In court, he denied having been put under pressure over the management of players during his time at Juventus and Roma.</p>
              <p>Mr Capello, 61, was also asked about an interview he gave to the
              Corriere dello Sport newspaper about GEA and their alleged monopoly of
              players.</p>
              <p>In that interview the coach said he knew many players were "gravitating towards that company".</p>
              <p><strong>Poor recollection</strong></p>
              <p>But when asked further in court about the interview, and details he had
              given in the initial inquiry, the England coach was less forthcoming.</p>
              <p>Mr Capello is not thought to have lied, but the prosecutor believes he
              was evasive and at times obstructive in the evidence he gave.</p>
              <p>At times he said he could not remember or recall specific details.</p>
              <p>The prosecutor said he would now seek to bring a new case of
              withholding information against both Mr Capello and Antonio Giraudo, a
              former Juventus director, who also gave evidence.</p>
