              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Tottenham</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> have put a £50 million price tag on </strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Gareth Bale</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> – and would bank the entire transfer fee if he leaves after removing the 25 per cent sell-on clause that was part of the original agreement with </strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Southampton</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>, Goal.com UK can reveal.<br></strong></span><br>Bale moved to Spurs in the summer of 2007 for £5m, rising to £10m with add-ons, but the deal was renegotiated the following year when Southampton suffered financial trouble.</p>
              <p>Tottenham paid the south coast club an early settlement payment of £3m to reduce the final fee to £8m and allow Southampton the immediate cash that they desperately needed.</p>
              <p><strong>Goal.com UK</strong> understands that, at the same time, Southampton agreed to forfeit the 25 per cent sell-on clause that they were originally entitled to if Bale left White Hart Lane.</p>
              <p>This shrewd piece of negotiating would save Spurs around £10m at his current market value if they cashed in on their prized asset.</p>
              <p>However, after Bale tore Inter Milan to pieces for the second time in a fortnight during Tottenham’s 3-1 victory over the European champions on Tuesday, manager Harry Redknapp declared that Bale would not be sold.</p>
              <p>“You couldn’t buy him for 25 or 30 million pounds, that’s for sure,” said Redknapp. “If he had a value, if we wanted to sell him, it would be way in excess of that.</p>
              <p>"Gareth is an amazing young player. The chairman said he’s not for sale and that’s good enough. We are building a team at Tottenham and we are a club going places.”</p>
              <p>Redknapp’s defiance extends to the Spurs boardroom. Tottenham sources insist that it would take £50m to tempt them to sell a player whose value has rocketed since he nailed down a regular starting spot at the turn of the year.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, Spurs, who rewarded the Wales winger with a four-year contract in May, have plans to extend his agreement with the club beyond 2014.</p>
              <p><strong>Goal.com UK</strong> can reveal that the north London club wanted to tie Bale down to a six-year deal during his contract talks at the end of the season but the player’s camp insisted on a shorter agreement.</p>
              <p>The continued upward curve of his development and the interest from Europe’s elite clubs, headed by Real Madrid, Manchester United and Inter Milan, has convinced the Spurs hierarchy that they will need greater protection for the left-sided flyer when they come calling again next summer.</p>
              <p>United had a £20m bid rejected last summer while Real also made their interest clear and are expected to prepare a huge offer at the end of the season.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Tottenham </strong></span></a><strong>are ready to offer Gareth Bale a new contract on the back of his stunning display against European champions Inter Milan. </strong></p>
              <p>Bale’s brilliant form this season, including two spectacular performances against Inter, has alerted the world’s biggest and richest clubs.</p>
              <p>But Spurs chairman Daniel Levy will make the first move in an effort to quash any attempt to lure the 21-year-old away from White Hart Lane by offering to increase his pay and extend a deal which runs until 2014.</p>
              <p>Bale is earning a basic wage of £30,000 a week under a contract signed in May after helping Tottenham finish in the top four of the Barclays Premier League for the first time. This is less than half what the club’s top-paid players - Robbie Keane and Rafael van der Vaart - receive and Levy is prepared to reward Bale for his rapid progress.</p>
              <p>Spurs have a modest wage structure compared to Europe’s top sides, although they do have a reputation for improving terms for young players who impress. They cannot compete on a pay scale with Real Madrid, Inter, Barcelona and Manchester City but will invite Bale’s advisers to open talks. It could see the Wales international catapulted to more than £50,000 a week.</p>

              <p><strong>Bale joined Tottenham from Southampton in May 2007 for a fee of £5million, plus another £5m based on success. After his starring role in Tuesday’s 3-1 win, he claimed he was in no rush to move on.</strong></p>
              <p>‘Tottenham have shown against Inter they can compete on the biggest stage with the best teams so why would anyone want to leave?’ he said. ‘There is a terrific group of players at White Hart Lane. The feeling within the squad is amazing.’</p>
              <p>Spurs boss Harry Redknapp insisted: ‘We wouldn’t entertain a bid. The chairman said he’s not for sale and that’s good enough.'</p>

              <p>Spurs are over-bloated with their recent success, and that's not good for them. Consistency is the key to success, especially in the league. Beating Arsenal in one game and losing to Wigan at home in the next is not an indication of a good team.</p>
              <p>As for their debut champions league adventure, credits should be given when it's due. And they have done excellent thus far, but let's wait for them to meet the real big boys (Barcelona, Real madrid, Bayern munich, etc) before making a judgment.</p>
