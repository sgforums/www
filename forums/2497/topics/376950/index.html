              <p class="article"><strong>A stunned Ancelotti admitted lambasting his players in Italian - the language he uses when he is angry - as they lost their 100 per cent record and let Manchester United, who won 2-0 at Stoke, take over at the top of the league for the first time this season.</strong></p>
              <p>Cech, too, was furious for getting a red card after 51 minutes for bringing down Hugo Rodallega when the score was 1-1, but a hard-line Ancelotti refused to blame referee Phil Dowd's decision for the end of Chelsea's 22-match unbeaten run which dated back to March.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti said: 'It was the right result, Wigan played better than us. It was not the normal Chelsea. We are disappointed we did not play well - but I don't know the reasons. We started well but then we slept for the first goal.'</p>
              <p>Chelsea's players were ordered to go out for the second half five minutes before Wigan reappeared, with Ancelotti suggesting he had some sharp words to say to his players. 'Today, I spoke in Italian after the first half,' he said.</p>
              <p>Wigan had never beaten a member of the Big Four and Chelsea looked set to go and record a 13th straight win when Didier Drogba cancelled out Titus Bramble's opener with his 100th goal for the club.</p>
              <p>But the match turned when Rodallega fell dramatically after being caught by Cech's trailing leg as the Chelsea goalkeeper rushed out to challenge.</p>
              <p>Dowd awarded Wigan a penalty - from which Rodallega scored - and sent Cech off even though it was questionable that it was a scoring opportunity.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti admitted it was a turning point in the game but refused to condemn the referee. 'I hoped we could win the game when we equalised but the match became very difficult after the penalty was given. I don't want to comment on the referee's decision. I don't like to do that.'</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Early bath: Petr Cech argues with referee Phil Dowd after he is shown a red card at DW Stadium</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Chelsea are left counting the cost of their defeat. Cech is ruled out of next Sunday's clash against Liverpool, Ancelotti's first Premier League game against a Big Four rival, while there will be tests made on Ashley Cole and John Obi Mikel in the next 48 hours after they went off injured at Wigan.</strong></p>
              <p>Rookie manager Roberto Martinez savoured the biggest win of his career, declaring: 'It was a complete performance and we have made history. We had a challenge of beating a top four side after 34 attempts.</p>
              <p>It is something to celebrate. 'We are in a transitional period, there has been a huge turnaround in playing staff, but slowly you can see the players gelling together.</p>
              <p>'You can only unsettle Chelsea by keeping the ball from them, which is what we did. In my opinion, the penalty and the red card decisions were right.'</p>

              <p>ancelotti claims he doesnt like to comment about referees. he keeps repeating that these days.</p>

              <p>well, the red card (if I am not wrong) was becos he was the last man. I have not seen replays, but I believe there were some blues that may have been just behind him, so the red card may not be justify. but penalty is near confirmed cause he did trip the wigan player with his trailing leg.</p>
              <p>this bramble is playing quite out of his skin, I recall when wigan played United, he also performed quite well.</p>
              <p>anyway, with this loss, the EPL seems quite balanced now. if City were to win, then the top 4-6 is quite close and the race is heating up.</p>
              <p>Do hope Cech can play for the Pool match, then it will be such a fanastic game to watch..</p>
