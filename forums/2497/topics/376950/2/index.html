              <h2 style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">JOHN
              TERRY savaged his Chelsea team-mates for their lack of fight and
              desire in Saturday's defeat at Wigan. </h2>
              <p>Blues skipper JT rapped: "The least we expect from
              every player is that we work hard and fight - and we did not do
              that. </p>
              <p>"We didn't win our headers and we didn't win our
              tackles - and that's simply not good enough.</p>
              <p>"You can go anywhere and not play well. But when you
              come to places like this, you've got to match their
              work-rate. </p>
              <p>"We didn't do that, the whole team. That's the most
              disappointing thing." </p>
              <p>Blues were knocked off top spot by title rivals
              Manchester United after surrendering their 100 per cent start.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div style="width: 380px;"><img title="HAVE A WORD ... JT gives flops what for" src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00897/Flops__380x223_897629a.jpg" alt="HAVE A WORD ... JT gives flops what for">

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>And Terry added: "All the other big sides had
              emphatic wins, so it's even more disappointing we've thrown away
              three points."</strong> </p>
              <p>Saturday's 3-1 defeat piles on the pressure for
              Sunday's Premier League showdown at home to Liverpool. </p>
              <p>Keeper Petr Cech misses that game as he is banned for
              his red card at Wigan. </p>
              <p>And Ashley Cole and John Obi Mikel both suffered
              injuries that make them doubts. Mikel left Wigan with an ankle
              injury while Cole will have a knee scan.</p>

              <p>the game will be at chelsea's advantage being at home, with the current liverpool midfield strength, i'm seeing chelsea gaining another advantage with the likes of essien, lampard, or mikel, or even joe cole whom i think will play some part in the fixture.</p>

              <p>I think Pool will meet a match like they have never before this season... I feel Pool's last few wins have been disguise by meeting weaker opponents like the Hull, WH, Burnley, Bolton types of teams... Even then, they seemed to have a few problems with defending set pieces like free-kicks and corners... Chelsea have a few very big guys in their squad who are good in the air... Drogba, Ballack, Lampard, Carvalho and not to forget Terry as well... These guys feed on set-pieces...</p>
              <p>Also, this is an away match for them and the last 2 times they went away to Bolton and WH, they only manage to win but not convincingly... I thought they got lucky against Bolton when the Bolton player got sent off... or they might not even come away with a point from there...</p>
              <p>The only good points Pool have right now is Torres better form but this can be neutralize with better defenders that Chelsea has... And also Chelsea do have an equal in Drogba... But the biggest plus for them now must be Cech's ban and their CL matches... While Pool play on Tue, Chelsea plays on Wed and they have to travel all the way to Cyprus as well...</p>
              <p>Cech's absence could make a difference if Pool gets a good opportunity on goal... With Cech, the chance of saving is much better than with Hilario... But who knows, after his Wigan performance, Lotti may start with Turnbull who I think is a better keeper to Hilario but the occasion may be a bit too big for a new young keeper...</p>
              <p>I still think Chelsea will win or at least a draw... and they also have Anelka, who seems to like to score against his former clubs... But the question is will Pool go to the Bridge and play their rush and chase style or go attacking?</p>

              <p>I think Liverpool will get punished at the back against the bigger teams because of Glen Johnson.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He adds an attacking option to the team but I feel he goes upfront way too often and sometimes doesn't even trek back as a defender, leaving a gap at the back.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any counter attack and it's just Carragher and Skrtel to cover.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You just hope Liverpool scores more goals than the opposition if that happens. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>actually i think Hilario is the 2nd choice. Turnbull looks promising at the start...but his blunder at reserves(he conceded 4 goals which is his dumb mistake) probably made Ancelotti considering</p></div>
