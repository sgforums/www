              <div class="content">
              <p>Alan Shearer says Newcastle United's relegation is squarely the fault of the players.</p>
              <p>Shearer said: "When you get in that rut, it's very difficult to get out
              of. I've just told the players that they can make all the excuses they
              like. Shearer wasn't good enough, Ashley wasn't good enough, Chris
              Hughton, Kevin Keegan, Joe Kinnear - forget that. It's what's in the
              dressing room that's not been good enough.</p>
              <p>"Whoever comes in, there needs to be an overhaul. The sooner
              the better. Other clubs will have a head start. We are going to be a
              big scalp in the Championship. What's important now is that we get back
              on track."</p>
              <p>Shearer, almost in tears, added: "I will sit down with the
              owner and the chairman this week and give my opinions. You talk about
              me making a decision, but they might not even ask me. They will ask my
              opinion.</p>
              <p>"I haven't had time to sit down and think. Decisions need to be
              made sooner rather than later. There are huge problems. It's not just
              about today. It's gone on this season, last season, the season before,
              it's a culmination of everything. We are now paying the price for that."</p>

              <p>Unlike perennial teams that go up and down the premiership on a regular basis like the likes of West Brom and Birmingham, Newcastle will not be able to keep the bulk of the team intact.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For Newcastle, most of the "premier" players will likely leave, so you can't depend on them to stay with the club to bring the club back up to the premiership.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They will just have to start rebuilding with players from their youth squads and add other championship level players from Div 1 and hope for the best.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I suspect they might take a few seasons at least before they make it back up. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Newcastle United have confirmed talks are planned with manager Alan Shearer this week.</p>
              <p>Managing director Derek Llambias told the club's official website:
              "Being relegated from the Premier League is a huge disappointment for
              everyone involved with Newcastle United.</p>
              <p>"We are all hurting and I feel desperately sorry for everyone
              associated with Newcastle United; for Mike (Ashley), who has invested
              heavily in the club, and for all the supporters who have given the team
              magnificent backing up and down the country all season long.</p>
              <p>"Mike and I will sit down with Alan this week to discuss how
              the club moves forward again, and I hope to be able to say more to our
              supporters later this week."</p>
              <p>One of the first issues to be resolved will be Shearer's
              continued presence or otherwise at St James' Park after his eight-game
              reign drew to a close.</p>

              <p>Newcastle United boss Alan Shearer admits they will start next season's Championship on the back foot.</p>
              <p>Shearer told the <em>Evening Chronicle</em>: “The problem this
              club has got is, whether it’s in this league or not, the other
              Championship teams have already started preparing.</p>

              <p>“It needs to be filled with people who love this club. Newcastle will be a huge scalp for the whole of the Championship.</p>
              <p>“We’re up against it all ready. We have to get over what happened at Aston Villa.</p>
              <p>“We need to look at it with a clear head. I will give them my opinion on what is wrong and what needs to be done.”</p>

              <p><strong>If Alan Shearer needed evidence of the mess he had walked into when he took over as</strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/newcastle-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong> Newcastle United</strong></span></a><strong> manager, he had only to study the club's annual £71 million wage list.</strong></p>
              <p>One contract must have stood out among the names of highly paid millionaires without a care in the world, and certainly not a care about Newcastle United: Xisco, a six-year contract, £50,000 a week (no relegation clause), a deal which will cripple any prospective Championship club.</p>
              <p>The Spain Under 21 international striker was one of Dennis Wise's many dubious summer signings, added to the Newcastle squad without Kevin Keegan's knowledge while the then manager was preparing what he had thought was his squad during pre-season.</p>

              <p><strong>He had never heard of the Xisco Kid, but he wasn't alone. Then again, it was clear he had never heard of Fabricio Coloccini, Jonas Gutierrez or Ignacio Gonzalez either.</strong></p>
              <p>After the £8 million flop that was Albert Luque, you would have thought even a new Newcastle United board would have learned the lessons of signing Spanish strikers from Deportivo La Coruna. But apparently not. And now Mike Ashley must pay a very heavy price.  </p>
              <p>Xisco made his Newcastle debut against Hull City, one of only three league starts he made all season. And he even scored in that shock 2-1 defeat to the rampant Tigers that September afternoon. Well, the ball hit him from a rebound off the post and crept over the line.</p>
              <p>That was the day the fans turned on Ashley and his Cockney Mafia and they were warned to stay away from St James's Park. </p>
              <p>The players, Xisco included, were called in for a brief meeting with Shearer and Iain Dowie at nine thirty yesterday morning. They departed with strict new fitness regimes for their summer break and were told to report back for pre-season training on July 1, even though it was also made quite clear that they will not all be Newcastle United players by then.</p>
              <p>With the possible exception of Kevin Nolan and Ryan Taylor, none of the players have relegation clauses, so no one, not even Joey Barton, can be expected to quit the club without a pay-off, and there are certainly no plans among the players to take a pay-cut, no matter what soundbites they produce about loyalty and devastation.</p>
              <p>Damien Duff and Steven Taylor, two of the few assets, say they want to stay.</p>
              <p>They want Shearer to do the same if Newcastle is to have any chance of returning next season.Duff said: `I am as loyal as they come - whether the gaffer stays or not - but if there is one man to get us back up it is the gaffer.</p>
              <p>And Taylor added: 'It is starting to sink in now we are a Championship team and we have to deal with it.'I know there are going to be changes but we want to be back. We are a Premier League team so we need to be back up there.'The only person I think can take us back up is Alan Shearer. He has been fantastic to work with and let's hope I get the chance to work with him again.'</p>

              <p>“It has to be an honour to play for Newcastle. I don’t care who
              you are, or what club you have played for, you have to be seen to give

              <h1>Shearer warned: Managing harder than you think</h1>
              <p><br> <img src="http://fourfourtwo.com/contentimages/news/Shearer14.jpg" alt="Shearer14" align="right"> </p>
              <p><strong>There is no substitute for experience when it comes to managing a big football club, according to Lawrie McMenemy.</strong><br>  <br> The former Southampton boss watched two teams from his native North
              East fall out of the Premier League last weekend – and both had young
              managers at the helm.<br>  <br> Alan Shearer won just one of his eight games in charge for Newcastle as
              they were relegated, while Gareth Southgate’s third season as
              Middlesbrough manager also ended in the drop.<br>  <br> And McMenemy – currently visiting Hong Kong for the HKFC IP Global
              International Soccer Sevens – believes letting former players go
              straight into management at a top-flight club is a risky business.<br>  <br> “Young managers should really cut their teeth in the lower divisions,
              but these days they want big names at Premier League clubs,” he said.<br>  <br> “Alan’s only been in charge of Newcastle for a few weeks and if he
              stays to try and get them out of the Championship he’s going to find
              out just how hard management is.<br>  <br> “Gareth Southgate was another who went straight into management from playing and it’s a difficult thing to do.<br>  <br> “But Middlesbrough have got probably the best chairman in England in
              Steve Gibson, he’s stuck by Gareth and will continue to do so.<br>  <br> “Even so, they are the least well supported of the three North East
              clubs – they are behind Newcastle and Sunderland in that respect – and
              I think they may continue to struggle.<br>  <br> “I managed in all four divisions in England in my career and I can tell
              you the Championship is the most difficult to get out of.”<br>  <br> However, McMenemy was quick to point out that Shearer could hardly be blamed for Newcastle’s demise.<br>  <br> “As Alan himself said, it’s mainly down to mismanagement on and off the field going back several years," he said.</p>
              <p>"Their massive support has kept them going in the past couple of
              seasons but all their problems have finally caught up with them.”</p>
