              <p><strong>Marseille have confirmed agreement has been reached for the signing of exciting Lyon winger Hatem Ben Arfa.</strong></p>
              <p>The France international grew unhappy with the Ligue 1 champions and had looked set for a move to Arsenal at one point.</p>
              <p>However, the 21-year-old has decided to remain in Le Championnat and should prove to be an excellent acquisition for l'OM.</p>
              <p>"We have reached a definitive agreement with Lyon for the transfer of Hatem Ben Arfa," confirmed chairman Pape Diouf.</p>
              <p>Ben Arfa was overlooked for Raymond Domenech's Euro 2008 squad but displayed great potential on Lyon's left flank.</p>
              <p>Manchester United were also allegedly admirers of his skills but the
              player will not be joining the exodus across the Channel for some time
              yet.</p>
              <p>All that remains is for the youngster to pass a routine medical to seal his switch to Stade Velodrome.</p>

              <h1>Ben Arfa Deal Not Completed - Lyon</h1>
              <h2>Olympique Lyonnais have moved to swiftly deny that a deal has been
              brokered between themselves and Olympique Marseille over young winger
              Hatem Ben Arfa.</h2>
              <p>Hatem Ben Arfa's elongated transfer saga took another twist this
              evening as his current club, Olympique Lyon, denied that a deal has yet
              been completed with Marseille. <br><br>Communications director of les
              Gones, Olivier Blanc, told France Football, “Marseille claim that an
              agreement has been made between Olympique Lyon and their club. This is
              both true and false at the same time.” <br><br>“There will be a deal
              but it is not yet completed. There are still some fine details that we
              have to conclude with Ben Arfa with reference to his own standing at
              Lyon. Once this is done then a deal can be completed with Marseille,”
              Blanc explained further.</p>

              <h1>Lyon Issue Ben Arfa Threat</h1>
              <h2>Olympique Lyonnais have threatened to call off negotiations with
              Olympique Marseille over youngster Hatem Ben Arfa if the deal is not
              completed by tomorrow night.</h2>
              <p>L'OM had confirmed on their official website that they had agreed a
              deal with Lyon to secure the services of the 21-year-old winger.<br><br>However,
              the French champions later stated that the transfer had not been
              finalized and that some details had to be concluded before the player
              could leave Stade Gerland.<br><br>Lyon have now issued a press release
              in which they urge Marseille to complete negotiations before Friday
              night; otherwise, the deal will be cancelled.<br><br>"Olympique
              Lyonnais inform that the eventual transfer of Hatem Ben Arfa to
              Olympique de Marseille must be completed before tomorrow night, Friday
              27th June, so that he is registered in the league before June 30th,"
              Lyon said on their official website.<br><br>"If an agreement between
              the player and Lyon is not made and he is not registered before 30th
              June, Lyon will be forced to cancel the transfer.<br><br>Lyon stated, meanwhile, that they have not allowed Ben Arfa to undergo a medical for Marseille.</p>

              <h1>Marseille: Ben Arfa Is Ours</h1>
              <h2>Manchester United and Real Madrid's intercontinental sparring match
              is being replicated on a more localised level in France as Olympique
              Marseille and Olympique Lyon go to-toe-to over Hatem Ben Arfa.</h2>
              <p>Last week Marseille had claimed that the young winger had signed on at
              the Stade Vélodrome only for Lyon to promptly issue a statement
              claiming that no transfer had been finalised.<br><br>Jean-Michel Aulas,
              the Lyon president, then issued a Friday midnight deadline for the deal
              to be completed while his club were reportedly obstructive about
              allowing Ben Arfa to travel south for a medical. <br><br>Speaking to
              France Football, Marseille's president, Papa Diouf, last night
              maintained l'OM's original position. “The boy is ours, final point,”
              declared Diouf, “The case will now go to the League, which has been
              given all the relevant documents attesting to our claim.” <br><br>“We
              respected all our contracted engagements and we have in our possession
              the document which the two clubs agreed would be the terms of sale,”
              Diouf responded in light of Lyon's claims that Marseille had not
              respected certain conditions. Such accusations led Diouf to bemoan the
              Rhône club's “catalogue of omissions and lies.” <br><br>“Arguments used to reconsider their commitment undertaken with Marseille are futile,” Marseille's president warns.  <br><br>“This
              illustrates the way in which morals are interpreted by the president of
              Lyon. I also note that they have the same problems with Atletico Madrid
              in regard to the transfer of Grégory Coupet.” <br><br>“Jean-Michel
              Aulas is victim of internal incompetence having accepted the transfer
              of Ben Arfa and is feeling swindled. Known as a poor negotiator by many
              people, he does not know how to leave this trap.”</p>

              <p><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/32084_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="226"></p>
              <h2>Contrary to comments made by Olympique Lyon head coach Claude Puel
              earlier today, Hatem Ben Arfa has declared himself an Olympique
              Marseille player on OMTV.</h2>
              <p>Young winger Hatem Ben Arfa appears to have completely undermined the hierarchy of Lyon by allowing himself to be broadcast on <em>OMTV</em>, Marseille’s news channel, declaring himself a member of the Mediterranean club.<br><br>“I
              signed with Marseilles and I am very content to have done so,” Ben Arfa
              declared, “My position is clear: I know that I have arrived and that I
              will remain here with l’OM and I will not return to Lyon. What more can
              be said? I am here.”<br><br>Positively gushing with praise for his new
              home city, the 21-year-old continued: “It is a club that any player
              would dream to play with because of the public, all of the atmosphere
              around the club.<br><br>“It really is a choice of the heart. Which
              player would not like to play here? It will be a really beautiful
              experience… I am very content to have chosen l' OM.<br><br>“I had
              already visited the city a little. The weather is very hot and that is
              a good thing for me. It is a beautiful city, the training centre is
              beautiful and I hope to start working out with the squad very soon. I
              am in a hurry to meet them.”<br><br>The saga of Ben Arfa’s transfer
              began last week when Marseille announced that they had signed the
              talented youngster, a move swiftly and officially denied by Lyon. Over
              the weekend personal insults were made by Marseille president Papa
              Diouf towards his Lyon contemporary as war broke out between the two
              clubs.<br><br>It now seems impossible for Ben Arfa, who Marseille claim
              will start training with his new club on Tuesday, to remain in Lyon
              next season even if Puel wishes him to.</p>
