              <p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Stephen Ireland is hoping to become a Manchester City stalwart, and have a stand named after him. </strong></p>
              <p>The Irish midfielder broke into the first-team set-up
              with the Blues in 2005 and has been a regular fixture in the side ever
              since.</p>
              <p>The 2008/09 campaign has arguably been his most successful
              yet, as he only narrowly missed out to Ashley Young in the voting for
              PFA Young Player of the Year.</p>
              <p>He admits that he is enjoying his time at Eastlands and has ambitions of becoming a City legend in the future.</p>
              <p>With
              Mark Hughes' men set to face arch rivals Manchester United on Sunday,
              Ireland has revealed that he is hoping to emulate the achievements of
              Red Devils heroes Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs.</p>
              <p>"I would like to
              achieve at City what Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs have done at United.
              They have been fantastic servants to the club and won cupboards full of
              medals," he said in the <em>Manchester Evening News</em>.</p>
              <p>"I would
              love to think that at 33 or 34 years of age I would still be playing
              for City in midfield, still loving the game, enjoying a bond with the
              fans and winning things.</p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p>"Those two United players are legends at
              Old Trafford and that is a path I want to follow and what I want to be
              at Eastlands, in fact one of my aims is to play so well for so long
              here I have a stand named after me!</p>
              <p>"I want to stay at City as
              long as possible and knock United off their pedestal, achieving things
              with these players, these fans and Mark Hughes, who gets a bad time in
              the press sometimes which is undeserved. I want to win games for him,
              too, and do his methods justice."</p>
              <p>Ireland believes City are
              closing the gap on United, with the Abu Dhabi United Group helping to
              bankroll the club's pursuit of success.</p>
              <p>"The gap between the
              clubs is narrowing, we are signing world class players and the future
              here is going to be very interesting," he said.</p>
              <p>"United are still the target to aim at, they have things right there, and we are on the way to matching them in all aspects.</p>
              <p>"We
              go to Old Trafford (on Sunday) full of confidence and we will be better
              than we were in the first derby at our place earlier in the season
              (during a 1-0 defeat).</p>
              <p>"I think we go there with a better squad
              than we had before Christmas and with plenty of players in form.
              Everyone is hungry to get into the side and the manager has some
              decisions to make and that is good for the club."</p>
