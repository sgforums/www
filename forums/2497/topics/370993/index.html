              </div>
              <p><strong>Here are six future Arsenal stars who could make an impact this season.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Jack Wilshere:</strong> Age 17; Perhaps the most exciting talent in English football. A powerful attacking midfielder, whose vision and ability to run directly at defences have evoked comparison with a young Paul Gascoigne.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Fran Merida: </strong>Age 19; Like Cesc Fabregas, Merida moved from Barcelona to Arsenal and is an extremely promising central midfielder. He impressed in the Emirates Cup against Rangers on Sunday and featured in the Premier League last season in the wins against West Brom and Portsmouth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sanchez Watt:</strong> Age 18; An emerging forward who was a key part of the team that won the FA Youth Cup earlier this year. He has already featured in pre-season for the first team against both Barnet and Rangers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Kieran Gibbs: </strong>Age 19; Came to prominence at the end of last season when he replaced Gael Clichy at left-back in the final matches of the season. Gifted Manchester United a goal in the Champions League semi-final with an unfortunate slip, but Wenger believes that he is a future England left-back.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Rhys Murphy:</strong> Age 18; Another member of the FA Youth Cup-winning team and another emerging young English talent. A prolific goalscorer for the Arsenal Under-18s, who has already had to overcome a major injury after breaking his ankle against Wolves in 2008.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Emmanuel Frimpong: </strong>Age 17; Has already trained with the first team and was on the bench for the Premier League game against Portsmouth last year. Grew up in Ghana, but was taken on by Arsenal at the age of nine and has featured in the England youth teams. Also played in the pre-season friendly against Barnet.</p>

              <p>Sanchez watt wasnt very convinving for arsenal against rangers.. Though he did chase the lost ball that lead to the 3rd goal. He make too many stray passes, and did not dare to take on defenders. He simply passed sideways...</p>
              <p>Off all the youngsters that arsenal currently have (not including walcott, bendtner, fabregas, denilson), I think those whom are able to make it next season are Wilshere, Gibbs, Ramsey, Merida and Lansbury.</p>
              <p>Gibbs is already there as shown last season that he is an abled deputy for clichy. He would probably be used in the Carling cup and FA cup and whenever clichy needs a rest.</p>
              <p>Wilshere is definitely potential given his 2 man of the match performances against rangers and atletico madrid. Simply outstanding with his left foot. Arsenal fans should be happy because he can be the next messi. He can dribble, he can pass, he can cross and he can definitely shoot. But I think his performances would be reduced to just carling cup and FA cup appearances. Several EPL appearances maybe.</p>
              <p>Aaron ramsey, is just another cesc fabregas in the making. He can dribble and shoot. He can pick out his colleagues just like how cesc does. Anyway, if fabregas does leave arsenal, we already have ramsey that can take over his mantle. This coming season, I think ramsey would be playing in the FA cup and Carling cup as well, and making some EPL starts and some CL appearances.</p>
              <p>Merida, if he is not going out on loan, would be used in the carling cup. He has the ability to dribble and pass. He is a talent, and i would be gutted if he leaves arsenal. I would love to see him sign at arsenal, and take over the left flank left behind by arshavin and rosicky.</p>
              <p>Lastly, lansbury, because he shone in the U19 last season, and also the U19 england team. He is a gerrard in the making. He is definitely a gem, and provided that he is not another david bentley, he would do great to arsenal.</p>
              <p>Team of the next season:</p>
              <p>Almunia</p>
              <p>Sagna Gallas Vermaelen Clichy</p>

              <h2>WENGER SEES SHADES OF ROO IN JACK</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/09/08/240/Jack-Wilshere-celeb-v-Rangers_2343039.jpg" border="0" alt="Jack Wilshere - positive attitude."></div>
              <p><br><br>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger believes Jack Wilshere can be Arsenal's Wayne Rooney.</strong></p>
              <p>The Hertfordshire-born 17-year-old may have missed out on a call-up to the England Under-21 squad for the friendly against Holland next week, but much is expected of the tenacious young midfielder.</p>
              <p>Wilshere netted twice in the recent 3-0 victory over Rangers to complete an impressive weekend at the Emirates Cup, in front of watching England manager Fabio Capello.</p>
              <p>There have already been calls for the player to be considered by Capello for the 2010 World Cup.</p>
              <p>Wenger has called for patience with the teenager, who was fast-tracked into the first-team squad last season.</p>
              <p>However the Gunners boss feels Wilshere has all of the potential to make a big impact at Emirates Stadium - just as Manchester United and England star Rooney did with Everton when he was a similar age.</p>
              <p>"What is good in his case is he reminds me a bit of Rooney when he started, in his belief and his positive attitude to go forwards," said Wenger.</p>
              <p>"For the rest, he has still a lot to learn, relations with other players team-wise, but there are some great basics there."</p>
              <p>But Wenger stressed: "As a manager you do not want a guy to be a star before he has delivered, and maybe here that is more difficult than anywhere else."</p>
