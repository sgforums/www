              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> striker Wayne Rooney admits England struggled to break down Brazil after their 1-0 defeat in Qatar.</p>
              <p>Capello's side fell victim to a goal early in the second period from
              Nilmar to leave England still without a win in eight matches on neutral
              territory against the Brazilians.</p>
              <p>Luis Fabiano also missed a penalty for Brazil, who unsurprisingly dominated possession.</p>
              <p>Capello will now have four months to reflect on how many of his
              fringe players pushed their claims to be part of his World Cup plans
              before the next international in early March.</p>
              <p>Only <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Aston Villa</span></abbr> winger James Milner, who was making his full debut, could feel he
              furthered his cause on the left wing to any significant effect.</p>
              <p>Rooney told <em>ITV1</em>: "It was a difficult game for us. Brazil were the better team and deserved to win.</p>
              <p>"Brazil move the ball really well and make you chase it, which is really hard to do for 90 minutes.</p>
              <p>"We should have put more pressure on the first ball (for the goal). I'm not sure how he (Nilmar) has got in between the defence.</p>
              <p>"We are looking to improve. Thankfully it is only a friendly but it is always difficult to take a defeat."</p>
              <p>Capello added: "I think we played against a Brazil team who have the best XI in the world.</p>
              <p>"My first XI will be better than this one. But I found a lot of things positive.</p>
              <p>"I understand the value of some of the players I checked on in this game when you play against these teams."</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> goalkeeper Ben Foster admits he could've been sent-off in England's friendly defeat to Brazil.</p>
              <p>Foster made some good saves either side of the goal scored by Nilmar.</p>
              <p>The United keeper admitted, though, that he was lucky to only receive a
              yellow card when he felled Nilmar after the Brazilian had latched on to
              Wes Brown's poor back-pass.</p>
              <p>"I was lucky to stay on the pitch, I have to be honest," he
              said. "I thought I was a goner, but then there were a few strange
              decisions from the officials.</p>
              <p>"I think we gave a good account of ourselves with what was a
              depleted squad and I just hope I've advanced my case to be part of the
              World Cup squad.</p>
              <p>"Every time I've come in, Fabio has given me a chance and he's doing wonders for me. I just want to play."</p>

              <p><strong>BEN FOSTER</strong></p>
              <p>THE FIGHT for England's No 1 jersey is similar to the FA's bid for the World 
              Cup. Despite so much potential, the nagging doubt is: Is it all going to end 
              in tears? Foster's trademark nervous moment arrived when he lunged at Nilmar 
              on 56 minutes. He was relieved the shocking penalty by Luis Fabiano almost 
              hit the overhead camera. Distribution, usually one of Foster's strongest 
              assets, was also a problem. Most of his goal kicks gave Brazil possession. 
              Capello may lament this had more to do with the lack of height and physical 
              presence in attack without Emile Heskey. In his defence, Foster did 90 per 
              cent of his work with little fuss, but, as with David James, his 
              concentration level still needs attention.</p>
              <div class="inline-image-left-100"><img title="WES BROWN: 5/10." src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00066/brown_100x150_66065a.jpg" alt="WES BROWN: 5/10.">

              </div>
              <p><strong>WES BROWN </strong></p>
              <p>FABIO has asked every England full-back other than '66 hero George Cohen to 
              come out of retirement to sort out this problem position. As one of the few 
              English right-backs still available, Brown finds himself in this team by 
              default. There were few signs of an kind of understanding on the right flank 
              with Shaun Wright-Phillips. The early debilitating conditions made rampaging 
              overlaps impossible, while Nilmar's persistent threat kept the United man 
              pinned in his own half. Glen Johnson will not be sweating on his England 
              place just yet after the dreadful chested backpass led to the penalty.</p>
              <div class="inline-image-right-100"><img title="WAYNE BRIDGE: 5/10" src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00061/bridge_engerland_100_61368a.jpg" alt="WAYNE BRIDGE: 5/10">

              <p><strong>WAYNE BRIDGE</strong></p>
              <p>THE SPECTACULAR light show before kick-off made it look as if the circus had 
              come to town. Some of Bridge's early contributions had the same impact. 
              There was precious little combination with James Milner. The lack of 
              dynamism on both flanks meant Capello was doing windmall impressions with 
              his arms all evening. No sooner was he sitting down, his wide men and 
              full-backs were losing the ball and the Italian was marching back to the 
              edge of his technical area. He will have learned a lot from some of this 
              performance, none of it pleasurable.</p>
              <div class="inline-image-left-100"><img title="JOLEON LESCOTT: 4/10." src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00066/lescott_100x150_66064a.jpg" alt="JOLEON LESCOTT: 4/10.">
              <div class="caption">JOLEON LESCOTT: 4/10.</div>
              </div>
              <p><strong>JOLEON LESCOTT</strong></p>
              <p>ACCORDING to the 'find your Brazilian nickname' website, Wayne Rooney would be 
              called Wayniano, Gareth Barry should be dubbed Biano and Lescott somewhat 
              cruelly finds himself renamed 'Costoomucho'. The £22million move to 
              Manchester City seems to have damaged rather than enhanced Lescott's 
              reputation. One of the most expensive defenders in football to mark Kaka, 
              the Brazilian will be salivating if they meet again next summer. The heart 
              of England's defence disappeared in the 47th minute. Many England fans will 
              be hoping that is also the case when John Terry and Rio Ferdinand are fit.</p>
              <div class="inline-image-right-100"><img title="MATTHEW UPSON: 5/10." src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00066/upson_100x150_66063a.jpg" alt="MATTHEW UPSON: 5/10.">
              <div class="caption">MATTHEW UPSON: 5/10.</div>
              </div>
              <p><strong>MATTHEW UPSON</strong></p>
              <p>SUCH have been the injuries to Rio Ferdinand, Upson is reaching a stage where 
              he may no longer be considered a deputy at centre-back. He has been less 
              susceptible to knocks for the past 12 months - but question marks remain. 
              Upson made an early error when he was robbed on the touchline by the 
              lightning-fast Nilmar - and he never looked comfortable after that Whenever 
              the Brazilians stepped up a gear, especially in the second half, England's 
              defence looked primed for embarrassment. The exhibition nature of the game 
              was a God send if the shambles of Nilmar's easy opener was anything to go 
              by.</p>
              <div class="inline-image-left-100"><img title="SHAUN WRIGHT-PHILLIPS: 5/10." src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00066/wrightphillips_100x1_66007a.jpg" alt="SHAUN WRIGHT-PHILLIPS: 5/10.">

              </div>
              <p><strong>SHAUN WRIGHT-PHILLIPS </strong></p>
              <p>A WORD of warning: Wright-Phillips was the fourth member of the starting 
              line-up representing Manchester City. A harrowing thought for those 
              assessing Capello's strength in depth. Joe Cole's injury handed former 
              Chelsea clubmate Wright-Phillips a year's head start in establishing himself 
              as the first-choice on the right of England's midfield. With one game to go 
              before the squad for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa is named, he will 
              have to reflect on a missed opportunity. Cole will be welcomed back to the 
              fold once he has proved his fitness after a serious injury.</p>
              <div class="inline-image-right-100"><img title="GARETH BARRY: 7/10." src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00061/barry_engerland_100x_61234a.jpg" alt="GARETH BARRY: 7/10.">

              <p><strong>GARETH BARRY</strong></p>
              <p>THE Manchester City midfielder was teased into thinking he would be captain. 
              But despite the disappointment of losing the armband, he still had the look 
              of an authoritative presence. Alongside Rooney, he stood out as the class 
              act in a white shirt, providing a lesson to some of those around him about 
              keeping possession. That is why he is a certain starter in South 
              Africa.Tactically, teams such as Brazil pounce on the carelessness of 
              opponents and look to monopolise the ball. At times, Barry looked like the 
              only England players who understood the importance of not passing to a 
              yellow shirt.</p>
              <div class="inline-image-left-100"><img title="JERMAINE JENAS: 6/10." src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00066/jenas_100x150_66006a.jpg" alt="JERMAINE JENAS: 6/10.">

              <p><strong>JERMAINE JENAS </strong></p>
              <p>JERMAINE JENAS scored the first goal of the Fabio Capello era - but you get 
              the feeling the only way he is going to South Africa this summer is on 
              Safari. He was the brightest of the fringe players, but the quality of the 
              absentees means Jenas had to shine far more to make an impression. Being 
              okay is not enough to claim a World Cup place. The meticulous Capello is 
              looking for class acts to influence his decisions now. Jenas fell well short 
              of that against illustrious opponents.</p>
              <div class="inline-image-right-100"><img title="JAMES MILNER: 5/10." src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00066/milner_100x150_66003a.jpg" alt="JAMES MILNER: 5/10.">

              <p>THE 'dry' hotels in Qatar offer non-alcoholic strawberry flavoured beer 
              instead of real ale. It is a bit like replacing a player of Steven Gerrard's 
              class with James Milner. No matter how much you want it to work, it never 
              will be adequate. You cannot question his workrate but you wonder if there 
              is enough X-Factor about his game. He is more a Louis Walsh act than one of 
              Simon Cowell's. His versatility should ensure he is part of the final squad 
              but, like much of this team, you cannot see him making more than cameo 
              appearances in the summer.</p>

              <p>FIRST a father, now an England captain, Rooney is emerging as England's top 
              ambassador. The Manchester United striker shared the A-list billing with 
              Kaka. Every touch and drop of the shoulder was greeted with shrieks of 
              approval from a largely subdued crowd. But such was the lack of support on 
              the pitch that he had to drop ever deeper to hunt for possession. When he 
              did get a pass, typically he was always trying to make things happen. 
              Inevitably, he cut a frustrated figure as the lack of quality showed - and 
              he will welcome back the cavalry like the rest of us in the next friendly.</p>

              <p><strong>DARREN BENT </strong></p>
              <p>ONLY the Royal Mail has carried a greater strike threat since Bent signed for 
              Sunderland. He was one of those with something to prove, but precisely what 
              he confirmed is not certain. If anything, he underlined the strangeness of 
              leaving Peter Crouch on the bench. Bent's first touch was header over the 
              bar from 25 yards and he looked lost for the rest of the match. His game 
              relies on the kind of regular service you can get in the Premier League, but 
              not at this level. He left the international stage on 55 minutes and his 
              World Cup hopes probably exited with him.</p>
              <p><strong>SUBSTITUTES: </strong></p>
              <p><strong>JERMAIN DEFOE </strong>5 (for Bent), 55m</p>
              <p>May see his omission from the starting line-up more positively than it first 
              seemed. Capello wanted to take a closer look at Bent, but he will have seen 
              nothing to suggest he should displace Defoe as the prime goal-sniffer in the 
              box<strong>.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>PETER CROUCH</strong> 5 (for Barry), 81m</p>
              <p>His enthusiasm saw him chase everything - but he looked rather one-paced 
              against the masters from Brazil.</p>
              <p><strong>TOM HUDDLESTONE </strong>4 (for Wright-Phillips), 81m</p>
              <p>Given a half chance to stake a World Cup claim but did not improve his hopes, 
              not least because he was on for such a short time.</p>
              <p><strong>ASHLEY YOUNG </strong>3 (for Milner), 87m</p>
              <p>Just did not have enough time to shine.</p>
              <p>SUBS NOT USED: Robert Green, Gary Cahill, Stephen Warnock, Joe Hart.</p>
