What he needs is to convince the player itÂ’s the right move for him. This is not a financial issue, itÂ’s about a chance in life.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t think he wants to leave Italy but things can change quickly in football.Â”<br><br>Buffon would be able to play in the Champions League knockout stages with Juve banned from Europe for match-fixing.<br><br>Buffon, 28, is contracted to the Turin club until 2010 and opted to stay despite demotion to Serie B.<br><br>The key to a January move will be persuading Buffon to leave Italy for the first time in his career.<br><br>Mourinho is determined not to place any pressure on Cech rushing back to action so wants to sign another world-class keeper.<br><br></div>

There are a lot of names in the air. What I know is that Carlo (Cudicini) and Hilario are very good goalkeepers and it is not easy for somebody to come and play in this team.<br><br>"Probably, what we have to try to get is a third goalkeeper and, of course, Fabien is not a preferred third goalkeeper. He is a high-profile goalkeeper.<br><br>"I prefer to think that now we have Hilario and Carlo, they are first options and we need somebody to give us security and replace Petr Cech in the group of keepers. That is the profile of the goalkeeper we are looking for." </span><br><br><span style="color: green;">Just other transfer rumour for buffon case as chelsea is looking for a good but non-high profile keeper</span></div>

He said he would gladly loan him Ian Walker or Oman Ali Al-Habsi if mourinho wants. If he was looking for 3rd choice, these would be good enough. But my guess is mourinho has no faith in cudicini all along so may get someone else he consider better.<br><br>Goalkeepers are abundance in the market cos one team only need 1 and 1 for backup.<br><br>So Buffon profile is not high enough? You don't compare a pass his best retired Barthez to what many people consider one of the best keeper at the moment...<br><br></div>

He had lots of offers in Italy and elsewhere this summer and turned them down.<br><br>"But he made a decision to stay in Turin because he wanted to repay the club for helping him become famous and being one of the best in the world."<br><br></div>
