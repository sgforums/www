              <h1 class="titlestory">Man Utd coach Solskjaer expects Welbeck, Macheda to make bigger impact</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> reserves coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says young strikers Kiko Macheda and Danny Welbeck are ready for more <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premiership</span></abbr> action next season.</p>
              <p>"They are ready for it," Solskjaer told the <em>Manchester Evening News</em>. "But it is a very fine line between thinking you are too good to work hard and being ready for it.</p>
              <p>"When you reach the top that might be the easy part. For instance, it was hard for the team to win back the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> title in 2007 but having won it three times in a row it becomes even
              harder. The likes of Welbeck and Macheda will realise that. Everybody
              knows about them now. Expectations of them are higher and they have to
              have higher expectations of themselves as well.</p>
              <p>"It is a major step up for them. It is not just about going
              into the league, you are going to the best team in the country and the
              best team in Europe almost. The next step for many reserve players is
              maybe playing for a mid-table <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> team but these boys are at the best club. The expectations are that
              they perform every time they play. But they know they can do it. How
              much they want it is also key to progress and succeeding. I know them
              and I know they want it badly. So I am not worried about them.</p>
              <p>"Kiko when he scored against Villa he turned, he scored and
              that one kick of the ball changes his whole life. Everybody knows about
              him know. Welbeck scores against Stoke with that fantastic strike and
              everyone knows about him.</p>
              <p>"It is about raised expectation. It is not about opponents
              knowing about you now and working you out. I don't think that matters
              or comes into it. Everybody knows everything about opposition players
              when they play against them these days no matter whether they are young
              or old. It is not as if John Terry is going to sit and watch videos of
              Macheda. The Villa defenders wouldn't have been saying he's just a
              young lad we don't have to be on our guard. It doesn't work that way.</p>
              <p>"He's a good footballer and they'd be prepared for him. They
              train with great footballers every day. Defenders are playing every
              week against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Cristiano Ronaldo</span></abbr>, Michael Owen or <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fernando Torres</span></abbr>. They have to be ready.</p>
              <p>"Opponents can study you all they like if they want but if you make the
              right decision they cannot stop you most of the time. When Kiko chose
              to turn onto his right foot against Villa instead of making the pass or
              switching to his left he made the right decision. By watching him
              opponents wouldn't have know exactly what he was going to do.</p>
              <p>"We coach them into making the right decisions. Also, where you
              gain an advantage is unpredictability. Footballers nowadays are not
              predictable. If you become predictable, you are struggling.
              Unpredictably is a big thing. Danny and Kiko are not predictable.</p>
              <p>"They are also in great physical shape. They can both be target
              men. They are both finishers. Technically, they are very gifted. Both
              could work on their heading side of their game. The size of them they
              can bully defenders almost. But all that will come with experience.</p>
              <p>"They have both got great talent. When they have played
              together for the reserves, it has been a great pleasure being their
              coach. They can handle it all. They are tough mentally. You have to be
              as a striker at this club. You have to believe that if you get a chance
              you will score."</p>
