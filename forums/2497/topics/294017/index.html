            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Middlesbrough boss Gareth Southgate has re-iterated his belief in the long-term value of young players to the club.</strong><br><br>It could be convincingly argued that the pressure on Premier League managers to achieve instant results is hampering the progress of young players at certain clubs.<br><br>But this is definitely not the case at Boro - partly down to the fact that the Teessiders can not compete in the transfer market with the Premier League's big spenders.<br><br>But it also stems from Southgate's belief that this is the most sustainable way forward for the club.<br><br>In sticking to this belief, Southgate is fortunate to enjoy both the patience of his chairman Steve Gibson, and the benefits of a renowned academy.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Long-term</span></strong><br><br>Speaking of the situation, Southgate, 37, said: "You have got to try to make decisions for the long-term benefit of the club and the players.<br><br>"Whether you survive as a manager by doing that is up to individual boards or chairmen.<br><br>"That is the route we have decided to go here. I understand I am in a fortunate position in terms of the chairman thinking that way but, also, I am prepared to take that chance.<br><br>"It's the way I believe is right and you should stick to your beliefs.<br><br>"We have done that because we have had talented players in the academy, but also because of necessity.<br><br>"Financially, we cannot always compete with some of the other Premier League clubs, so we either take a second tier of players transfer-wise, or you try to grow your own.<br><br>"We feel we have, in certain positions, players who are good enough to go into our first team."<br><br><strong>Fantastic</strong><br><br>He added: "(Academy manager) Dave Parnaby has done a fantastic job here and we have had more players come through than we could have possibly dreamt of.<br><br>"But that flow will not always be there, there might be years when we do not get anybody through.<br><br>"You have to plan long-term and hope you can buy from elsewhere to fit in around the players you are bringing through."<br><br>Southgate is convinced his belief in young players is the correct one for his club - as was shown when he was a young player at Crystal Palace.<br><br>He said: "I made loads of mistakes when I was a young player and I was fortunate that Steve Coppell stuck with me.<br><br>"We actually got relegated at Crystal Palace, but he obviously felt it was the right thing at the time to go with the younger players, and five or six of us went on to play international football<br><br>"He did not reap the benefit of that at the time, but the club ultimately did and the players did."</div>
