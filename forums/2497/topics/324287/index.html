              <p><em>Drogba, 30, will go from £70,000 to £130,000 a week.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>DIDIER DROGBA will be offered a huge new deal to keep him at Chelsea for life. Boss Phil Scolari is desperate to hold on to the Ivory Coast star. He has told Drogba’s representatives the club will meet the hitman’s demands to get him to sign a four-year contract.</strong> </p>
              <p class="article">Drogba, 30, is on around £70,000 a week and the new agreement could give him parity with Blues skipper John Terry — the club’s highest earner with an estimated weekly salary of £130,000. </p>
              <p class="article">Scolari said: “I want him to stay 100 per cent. No, 200 per cent.” True to his word the Brazilian has sent a clear message to the Stamford Bridge crowd favourite that Chelsea are willing to do whatever it takes to hang on to him. Drogba has been pining for a move to Italy, with AC Milan or Jose Mourinho’s Inter the most likely destinations. Barcelona are also keen on him.</p>
              <p class="article">Midway through last season Drog launched a vicious verbal attack on club owner Roman Abramovich over the way he sacked Mourinho and said he wanted to leave. But Chelsea’s offer might prove difficult to turn down as no club in Europe could match the terms.</p>
              <p class="article">Drogba’s fellow striker Claudio Pizarro is set to lead Scolari’s Blues clear-out by quitting for Paris Saint-Germain. The Peruvian is one of seven players the new Blues chief wants to axe. Pizarro, 29, has flopped at the Bridge since joining on a free transfer from Bayern Munich last summer. He made only four Premier League starts and did not feature at all following Chelsea’s FA Cup humiliation by Barnsley in March.</p>
              <p class="article">Pizarro had been expected to move back to Germany, with Werder Bremen and Hamburg keen. But PSG hope to tie up a £3million deal before Chelsea leave for their tour of Russia and China on Sunday. The only stumbling block could be his £50,000-a-week wages and he will have to take a pay cut to move to France.</p>

              <p><br>1. They can ask to leave if they don't want to stay... Like Lampard. But they all seem to choose to stay because they know Chelsea is more stable and Scolari is a able coach to play under...</p>
              <p>2. Drogba is on only £70,000 a week, Inter Milan has a rich owner too who is willing to spend to get the CL title next season... There is already a 4 yr deal waiting for Lampard with an option for him to make it 5yrs...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bottom line is, maybe when Jose left, they were feeling emotional about it but time have pass and they all seem to have forgotten about those days now... Time pass, things change...</p>
