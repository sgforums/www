              <p>Tottenham goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini has been injured in a motorbike crash in London.</p>
              <p>The Italian was rushed to hospital after suffering injuries described by the police as "possibly life-changing".</p>
              <p>Cudicini's BMW superbike was in collision with a Ford Fiesta on Forest Road, Walthamstow at 10.30am on Thursday morning.</p>
              <p>Early indications suggest the former Chelsea man is being treated for a suspected broken pelvis.</p>
              <p>A police spokesperson confirmed: "A 36-year-old male suffered
              injuries described as possibly life-changing and was taken to an East
              London hospital for further assessment and treatment."</p>
              <p>A Tottenham spokesperson confirmed Cudicini had been involved in an accident, but were unsure of his injuries.</p>
              <p>"We can confirm Carlo Cudicini was involved in a road accident
              this morning. The club doctor is with him at hospital where we await
              the result of scans and tests," said the Spurs spokesperson.</p>
              <p>"When more is known and things are made clear, a statement will be made through the club's website."</p>

              <p><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Spurs</strong></span><strong> keeper Carlo Cudicini is fighting to save his career after a motorbike smash left him with broken wrists and a damaged pelvis.</strong></p>
              <p>Cudicini suffered the injuries, which the London Ambulance Service described as 'possibly life-changing', after crashing his BMW superbike into a Ford Fiesta on Forest Road, Walthamstow, East London at 10.30am yesterday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="scrollText">By riding a motorbike Cudicini is in breach of his contract, meaning technically Spurs would be within their rights to sack him. Clauses agreed with the Premier League, the Football Association and the Professional Footballers' Association forbid players from engaging in activities which could endanger their careers such as skiing or riding a motorbike.</p>
              <p>While Tottenham insist they are only concerned with Cudicini's welfare, there could be problems further down the line regarding the insurance for a player who is understood to earn in the region of £50,000-a-week.</p>
              <p>Cudicini was understood to be on his way to Tottenham's training ground near Chigwell, Essex, when the accident occurred, although manager Harry Redknapp was said to be unaware his keeper rode a motorbike.</p>
              <p>The fact that he chose to ride a motorbike to training is even more perplexing given he had been undergoing treatment for a back injury and had not even been on Tottenham's bench since the home defeat by Stoke almost three weeks ago.</p>
              <p>Redknapp, who is on a break in Dubai, said: 'We are all sorry to hear about what happened to Carlo.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">'We are just relieved that the injuries he sustained were not more serious. Everyone at the club sends their best wishes and we hope that he recovers soon.' The female driver of the Fiesta and a child passenger walked away from the car, which was described as a write-off, and did not need hospital treatment.</p>
              </div>
              <p>The Italian was taken to Whipps Cross hospital where he was visited by club medical staff and has since been transferred to a private clinic where his condition was described as 'stable'.</p>
              <p>The seriousness of the accident raises questions as to whether the 36-year-old goalkeeper will play again. Even if he can resume his career after months of rehabilitation, it his unlikely he will return to action this season.</p>
              <p>Cudicini signed for Tottenham from Chelsea on a free transfer in January, having spent the latter part of his career on the bench at Stamford Bridge. But he has made just 11 league appearances for Spurs after failing to dislodge Heurelho Gomes.<a class="lightboxPopupLink" href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/11/12/article-1227214-07316E42000005DC-888_468x281_popup.jpg"> </a></p>
              <p>His chances of extending his contract which runs out at the end of the current campaign had already looked slim, Redknapp having attempted a swap deal for Portsmouth's David James in the summer.</p>
              <p>Tottenham have not yet considered whether to appeal for special dispensation to sign a keeper outside the transfer window.</p>
              <p>But given that as well as Cudicini and Gomes, they have Jimmy Walker, Ben Alnwick, David Button and Oscar Jansson on their books, it is debatable whether a request would be granted.</p>
              <p>Spurs goalkeeping coach Tony Parks has backed Cudicini to battle his way back to fitness. He said: 'Your first thought is, "Thank Christ he is still alive".</p>
              <p>'I'm not a medical person, so I'm not qualified to speak about the injuries Carlo has suffered but I'm thankful it is not as serious as it could have been. Hopefully he can get through this and make a comeback. There's no doubt he will be up for the fight.'</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p>Carlo Cudicini's motorbike accident yesterday took <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> officials by surprise - in more ways than one.</p>
              <p><em>The Times</em> says senior officials at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> Hotspur were unaware that Cudicini owned a high-performance motorcycle
              until the goalkeeper came off it yesterday morning, receiving “possible
              life-changing” injuries.</p>
              <p>Cudicini, 36, fractured both wrists and received pelvic damage
              when his BMW superbike collided with a Ford Fiesta in Walthamstow, east
              London. Once <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> have established the full extent of the injuries, they will have to
              decide whether he was in breach of his contract when he received them.</p>
              <p>Naturally, the club’s immediate concern was for their player’s
              welfare. Yesterday evening he had been transferred to a private
              hospital for further assessment and was described as “stable” by a club
              spokesman.</p>
              <p>“We’re all sorry to hear what happened,” <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Harry Redknapp</span></abbr>, the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> manager, said. “We’re relieved that the injuries weren’t more serious.
              Everyone at the club sends their best wishes for his recovery.”</p>
              <p>A breach of contract could affect any insurance claim should Cudicini’s injuries prove career-ending.</p>
