We needed patience and got it."<br><br><strong>Charlton manager Alan Pardew on Sankofa's sending off:</strong><br>"My view was that Robin van Persie was offside anyway. But then he's ahead of my full-back who tried to get back and it's not really a foul. "I'm aggrieved he got sent off. To play Arsenal's best XI with five missing is hard enough, let alone with 10 men.<br><br>"But I was pleased with how we played and Scott Carson was just fantastic."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>looks like Chelsea solved one problem &amp; left the other unsolved.  They din concede goals this match but neither did they score.<br><br>Credit to Aston villa, they did not have their regular goalkeeper on hand.  The defenders are the stars / "stars" for this round of EPL matches - kudos to Aston Villa for resolute defense.  Kudos to Newcastle to holding Man U to a draw. And a debut defender to score - and catch Man U's defense napping.  Earlier, Scholes's second goal was also the fault of Newcastle's defense.<br><br>West Ham's defense was not interested to play and hence the 6-0 drubbing by Reading.<br><br>Ok back to Chelsea, in my opinion, playing away to Aston Villa is always not easy.  They matched Man U for the entire first half before conceding.  for Chelsea, its not just only Terry &amp; Cech coming back, its what happen when Drogba is injured or suffering from goal-drought.<br><br>From the match report, they lacked the final touch to put the ball away, thats something that's not easy to find.</div>

Tactics and formation also might have played a little.

He is a box to box player, tackle like a tiger, score quite a fair bit of important goals, but not as much as scholes scoring record. Quite like the Steven Gerrard type of player.<br>Sometimes keane also plays the role of playmaker when he need to.<br><br>As for Essien, he is a defensive midfielder in the mould of Makelele, not quite the box to box midfielder and playmaker type.<br><br></div>
