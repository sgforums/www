              <p class="photoDesc">Robert Enke: Germany keeper has died</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Germany and Hanover 96 goalkeeper Robert Enke has died after being hit
              by a train and German police have confirmed that first indications
              point to suicide.</p>
              <p>The 32-year-old died close to his home in Neustadt-Eilvese,
              Hannover, near a railway level crossing. "First indications point to
              suicide," a media officer for the Niedersachsen police said.</p>
              <p>"At
              1825 (1725GMT) he was run over by a regional express train running
              between Hamburg and Bremen," said police spokesman Stefan Wittke. "The
              train was travelling at the speed of 160-kph."</p>
              <p>The player's
              friend and consultant Joerg Neblung told reporters: "I can confirm this
              is a case of suicide. He took his own life just before six (pm). There
              will be a press conference
              tomorrow with more details".</p>
              <p>Enke won eight international caps
              and was in the running to play at the World Cup in South Africa next
              year. However, he missed Germany's last three qualifiers with a stomach
              virus and having just returned to action after almost two months out
              was omitted from the latest squad.</p>
              <p>His national team colleagues
              learned of the tragic news of his death after training in Bonn on
              Tuesday and Germany's general manager Oliver Bierhoff said: "We are all
              shocked. We are lost for words."</p>
              <p>The president of the German
              Football Association (DFB) Dr Theo Zwanziger added that he and the rest
              of the football community in Germany "are deeply distressed and in
              mourning".</p>
              <p>"All our sympathy goes to the wife of Robert Enke and his family," he added.</p>
              <p>It is not yet clear whether Germany's friendly against Chile on Saturday will still go ahead. <em>Die Mannschaft</em> are due face the Ivory Coast the following Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Hanover president Martin Kind said: "This is a tragedy."</p>
              <p>Enke,
              born in Jena in the former East Germany, also played club football for
              Borussia Moenchengladbach and Benfica and had a brief spell at
              Barcelona before stints with Fenerbahce and Tenerife.</p>
              <p>Enke's
              daughter Lara died in 2006 of a rare heart condition when she was just
              two. He leaves behind his wife, Teresa, and an eight-month-old daughter
              the coupled had adopted.</p>

              <p><strong>German football is in shock after it was confirmed that national team goalkeeper Robert Enke was killed in an incident at a railway level crossing on Tuesday evening.</strong></p>
              <p>The 32-year-old was struck by a regional train travelling between Norddeich and Hanover at a railway crossing in Neustadt am Rubenberge and died at the scene, police have confirmed.</p>
              <div>

              <p><em>Sad story: Enke pictured in May 2006 with his daughter Lara, who tragically died a few months later at the age of two</em></p>

              <p> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Enke leaves behind his wife, Teresa, and an eight-month-old daughter who the couple had adopted in May. The Enkes lost their own daughter Lara in 2006 when she died of a rare heart condition at the age of just two.</strong></p>
              <p>On the field, Enke's career had taken him from his local side Jena into the Bundesliga with Borussia Monchengladbach before spells abroad with Benfica, Barcelona, Fenerbahce and Tenerife.</p>
              <p>He returned to the Bundesliga, joining Hannover in 2004 and earning his first cap for Germany on March 28, 2007 after impressing year after year for his club.</p>
              <p>He went on to make eight appearances for Germany and was regarded as the favourite to be their number one at the World Cup in South Africa next summer, but a mysterious bacterial infection forced him out of their World Cup qualifier against Azerbaijan in September.</p>
              <p>He only recently recovered from the illness and made his return for Hannover in their Bundesliga win over Cologne on October 31.</p>
              <p>However, he was omitted from the Germany squad for their upcoming friendly matches against Chile on Saturday and the Ivory Coast next Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Germany coach Joachim Low nevertheless insisted that Enke was one of the favourites to be his number one in South Africa, saying that the decision to leave him out of his squad was "not a decision against, but rather a decision for Robert".</p>
              <p>His national team colleagues learned the tragic news after training in Bonn<br>today.</p>
              <p>'We are all shocked,' said Germany's general manager Oliver Bierhoff. 'We are lost for words.'</p>

              <p><strong>The president of the German Football Association (DFB) Dr Theo Zwanziger added that he and the rest of the football community in Germany 'are stunned and in mourning.</strong></p>
              <p>'All our sympathy goes to the wife of Robert Enke and his family,' he added<br>on the DFB's website.</p>
              <p>Enke's death may force a postponement of Saturday's game against Chile. Fans were flocking to Hannover's Niedersachsen Stadion on Tuesday night where they were laying flowers and lighting candles at the gates in memory of their captain who had dedicated himself to the club since joining in 2004.</p>
              <p>A press conference has been scheduled for Wednesday afternoon, when more light will be shed on the death of one of Germany's most respected and talented footballers.</p>

              <h3>REPORTS in Germany claim a suicide note from Robert Enke has been found as the 
              country remains stunned by the international goalkeeper's death.</h3>
              <p>The Hannover No1 was killed by a train on Tuesday and his agent has indicated 
              that it was a deliberate act from the 32-year-old, rather than a shocking 
              accident.</p>
              <p>Germany have cancelled Wednesday's training session and all planned interviews 
              ahead of Saturday's friendly with Chile, which has now been postponed, as 
              the players struggle to come to terms with the sad news.</p>
              <p>Enke played eight times for his country and was tipped to keep goal in next 
              year's World Cup finals in South Africa.</p>
              <p>German legend Franz Beckenbauer led the tributes, saying: "I am infinitely 
              sad. When you receive news like this all other problems pale into 
              insignificance."</p>
              <p>The former Barcelona keeper is survived by his wife Teresa and adopted 
              eight-month-old daughter. The couple suffered a terrible tragedy three years 
              ago when their daughter Laura died of a heart condition aged only two.</p>
              <p>Enke had been ill and missed the World Cup clash with Azerbaijan due to a 
              bacterial infection in September but he returned to play for Hannover 
              against Cologne on October 31.</p>
              <p>Chelsea midfielder Michael Ballack, an international colleague of Enke's, 
              summed up the mood of the squad.</p>
              <p>"I am stunned," he admitted. "Words fail me."</p>
              <p>A press conference on Wednesday afternoon involving Teresa and the player's 
              psychologist Dr Valentin Markser confirmed Enke had been battling depression 
              after first being treated for the illness in 2003.</p>
              <p>"He could hide the extent [of the problem] well," said Markser. "He shied away 
              from making it public until the very end and kept it as an additional 
              problem."</p>
