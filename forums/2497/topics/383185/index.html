              <p>Cesc Fabregas insists he wants to stay with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Despite <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Real Madrid</span></abbr> and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Barcelona</span></abbr> publicly declaring they want to bring him back to Spain in the summer, Cesc declares he wants to lead the Gunners long-term.</p>
              <p>"I am so happy here," he told the <em>Daily Mail</em>. "And I
              want to continue to be part of what is happening here. Definitely. If
              not I would have left when I had the opportunity, three years ago, two
              years ago or last year. I believe in this team and I feel we can
              achieve things. The boss believes in us more than anyone, and I feel I
              am part of it. He makes me see that as well. And I don’t want to fail
              here."</p>
              <p>He likens his situation to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Steven Gerrard</span></abbr> and the decision Liverpool’s captain made when he was offered the opportunity to move to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>"I think you have to be grateful to those who have helped you,"
              he says after another arduous training session at London Colney on
              Friday afternoon. "When <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Steven Gerrard</span></abbr> had the opportunity to go somewhere else he chose to stay with the club
              of his life, and I don’t think he will ever regret that. He made a
              decision to stay and he has to believe that it was the right one.</p>
              <p>"And he’s still young, young enough to achieve so much more.
              For me he is one of the best midfielders in the world. He looks like
              such a nice guy but he has this side to his game that comes through in
              important moments, when he makes an impact. <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Frank Lampard</span></abbr> is a great player too, but for me I see something very special in <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Steven Gerrard</span></abbr>."</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> captain Cesc Fabregas rates the likes of Aaron Ramsey and Jack Wilshere as better than he was at the same age.</p>
              <p>Indeed, Cesc fears Wales international Ramsey taking his place in the near future!</p>
              <p>"Ramsey, Wilshere, Fran Merida. They are at the level of everyone.
              Perhaps even better than me. They are top class. In training, phew,
              they are so good," Cesc told the <em>Daily Mail</em>.</p>
              <p>"Aaron has really developed. Physically he is bigger and more powerful, as you could see when we played <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> in the Carling Cup. If I go to sleep I will wake up and find him in my
              place. No, it is true. Wilshere will be a top player, too, and when he
              gets a bit older they will move him into the middle. They just need a
              run of games to gain confidence and they will be a big part of
              Arsenal’s future. A future I hope to be part of."</p>
