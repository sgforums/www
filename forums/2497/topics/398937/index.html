              <p><strong>1. Goals, goals and more goals</strong></p>
              <p>The 8 goals against Wigan propelled Chelsea into the record books
              with the most number of goals scored in a Premier League season (103).
              With their <a href="http://sg.yahoo.com/_ylt=Ak25X_D8b921ZLSnWLiH4YaCG7J_;_ylu=X3oDMTNrczNkdHQwBGEDU0dTcG9ydHNfY2hlbHNlYXdpbnRpdGxlXzIwMTAwNTEwBGNwb3MDNARnA2lkLTM1MTgEaW50bANzZwRwa2d2AzkEcG9zAzQEc2VjA3RkLWZlYXQEc2xrA3JlbC10aXRsZQRzbHBvcwNGBHRlc3QDNzEy/SIG=134jd26g3/**http%3A//sg.news.search.yahoo.com/search%3Fei=UTF-8%26p=Chelsea%26type=all%26age=all%26type=photo">8 – 0 drubbing of a hapless Wigan</a>,
              Chelsea ended the season scoring 7 goals or more in 4 games this
              season. The 7 – 1 demolition of Aston Villa was particularly
              impressive, considering Martin O’Neill’s side boasts one of the better
              defensive records in the league. Fans tend to remember their blowout
              games but all season long, Chelsea only failed to score in one game (0
              – 0 vs. Birmingham). In comparison, title rivals Manchester United and
              Arsenal both failed to score in 6 and 5 matches respectively this
              season.</p>
              <p><strong>2. Carlo Ancelotti</strong></p>
              <p>Owner Roman Abramovich wanted his Blues to win in style. And under
              Carlo Ancelotti from AC Milan, they finally delivered. Gone was the
              Mourinho-style dour approach to win at all costs.  Credit must also go
              to the Italian master tactician for sticking with his midfield diamond
              formation, where he abandoned his use of wingers, bringing a greater
              emphasis on playmakers. His achievements are all the more impressive
              considering he had to work largely with a squad he inherited.
              Furthermore, his man-motivation skills also brought out the best in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&amp;q=didier+drogba&amp;m=text">Didier Drogba</a> and in particular, Florent Malouda.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Perfect record against the ‘Big Four’ </strong></p>
              <p>Chelsea’s perfect record against the other teams who make up the ”Big Four” of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&amp;q=manchester+united&amp;m=text">Man United</a>, <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=arsenal+football+club&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Arsenal</a> and <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=liverpool+football+club&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Liverpool</a> shows they can rise to the occasion and deliver under pressure. This
              included doing the Double over closest rivals Man United, albeit via an
              offside goal by Drogba. Ancelotti has just come out to say that
              it was this Double win over the Red Devils that was key to their first
              title in four seasons.</p>
              <p><strong>4. Fortress Stamford Bridge</strong></p>
              <p>In the Abramovich era, home form has always played a huge role in
              Chelsea’s run to be champions. In the 2004/2005 and 2005/2006 seasons,
              they won the league unbeaten at Stamford Bridge. This season they won
              the league again with the best home record, secured a staggering 52 out
              of a possible 57 points at the Bridge.</p>
              <p><strong>5. Key players</strong></p>
              <p>For the past 2 seasons, Didier Drogba wasn’t nearly as good as he
              was during Jose Mourinho’s time. But this year, he was back to his
              best, his explosive form resulting in 29 goals, 13 assists and the
              Golden Boot in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>After scoring only 1 goal in the first 9 games of the season,
              Lampard stepped up to the plate after injuries depleted Chelsea’
              midfield. The ever-consistent playmaker bagged 22 goals and 17 assists
              in his most prolific season in the Premier League yet with Chelsea.</p>
              <p><strong>6. Resurgent Malouda</strong></p>
              <p>This season, the French winger’s performances finally justified the
              £13 million Chelsea paid for his services from Lyon 3 years ago. Voted
              the club’s Player of the Season by his fellow team-mates, his goals and
              assists record this season alone surpass that of his first 2 seasons
              combined. With 12 goals, he’s Chelsea’s 3rd highest scorer in the
              league.</p>
              <p><strong>7. Mental toughness</strong></p>
              <p>Under Mourinho’s guidance, Chelsea developed a siege mentality
              against other opponents. This season, that quality again came to the
              fore as the Blues had to deal with off-field scandals involving captain
              <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=john+terry+scandal&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">John Terry</a> and left-back <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=ashley+cole+scandal&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Ashley Cole</a>.
              Drogba has admitted that Terry’s scandal in particular could have
              derailed their season but to their credit, Chelsea’s mental tenacity as
              a team saw them overcome off-pitch distractions.7.</p>
              <p><strong>8. Great squad depth<br> </strong></p>
              <p>It’s often been said this season that Man United depended too
              heavily on Wayne Rooney. In contrast,  Chelsea showed they have a
              handful of match-winners besides Drogba, Lampard or Malouda ready to
              step in and deliver.  Alex and Ricardo Carvalho bolstered the defence
              when required, while Michael Ballack and Deco filled in at midfield
              especially with Michael Essien out injured. Upfront, Nicolas Anelka and
              Salomon Kalou flourished in the run-up to the end of the season,
              combining to score 13 goals in the league.</p>
              <p>So that, in a nutshell, explains why Chelsea are champs. Can they do
              the Double this Saturday when they play Portsmouth in the FA Cup final?</p>
              <p>Don’t bet against it.</p>

              <p>i seriously think man u will back pedal next season. no disrespect to fergie but i think he's met his waterloo and should make way. 3 on a trot is no mean feat and narrowly missing out is a subtle way of telling him that his time is up.</p>
              <p>bloody chelsea is too darn good this season. so, congrats (albeit grudgingly), they are deserving champions with the kind of records they break/set.</p>
              <p>so, the utterly disappointing season for me ends on a high this weekend. the reds is still the greatest club in british soccer in all competitions. man u, eat your heart out! </p>

              <p>firstly, kudos to chelsea for winning. They were more consistent in the season.</p>
              <p>Mind u,  MU was trying to achieve something near impossible. Breaking the 18th title, and winning 4 EPL in a row. Losing their top scorer and one of their better players were hard to fill. But credit to Rooney, in his new role, he did well, narrowingly missing the golden boot.</p>
              <p>And surprisingly,with only him on form, and MU's next top scorers being Berba @ 12, and own goals @ 12, and to lose 7 games, and yet, still be only 1 pt behind the magnificent Chelsea, smashing all sorts of records is quite commendable.</p>
              <p>As per SAF's comments, MU did suffer some bad calls, but also benefits from some good calls, so it is give n take.</p>
              <p>Sadly for some, I don't think MU will 'back pedal" and will still serve to be a potential treat to snatch back the EPL title next season.</p>
              <p>As for blues fans, enjoy it while it lasts. :)</p>

              <p>No offense, backpedal should not be used for MU, maybe, Liverpool? 
              from 2nd, UCL, now scrapping for Europa League, next season? No offense,
               just fans' talk.</p>
              <p>Records are meant to be broken. Realistically, I think MU still 
              has the greatest potential to break it. It would be quite fun, if 
              Gunners/ Blues finally manage to catch up and contest MU for a chance to
               smash this vodoo (be it English titles/UCL), and put the old ghosts to 
              rest..</p>
              <p>Then sadly, one great club would be forever remember as an 
              "once" great club..</p>

              season.</p>
