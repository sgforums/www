              <blockquote>
              <p class="ss-text-bold">Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez says it will take a 'massive offer' to persuade him to sell Xabi Alonso.</p>
              <p>Spanish midfielder Alonso had been tipped to leave Anfield to enable Benitez to raise the funds to sign Gareth Barry from Aston Villa.</p>
              <p>Benitez says money is no longer an issue in his pursuit of Barry and feels Alonso understands his reasons behind him originally being prepared to sell the former Real Sociedad man.</p>
              <p>"I explained to him why I needed money for signing other players," said Benitez.</p>
              <h4>Great player</h4>
              <p>"He can understand if you have (Javier) Mascherano, Lucas, Steven Gerrard and then Plessis, you have four other midfielders and maybe you can sell one player.</p>
              <p>"When I was first talking with Xabi (about a transfer) we needed money. After these months it is not a question of money. We would have to have a massive offer because Alonso is a great player.</p>
              <p>"But if we sell one or two players we have enough money to bring in one more good player.</p>
              <p>"Don't forget we will need eight British players - and the left-footer we were talking about can play in three positions too."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h5>Protected</h5>
              <p>Alonso was only a half-time substitute in Saturday's 1-0 win at Sunderland, but Benitez explained why the midfielder started on the bench.</p>
              <p>He added: "Xabi has had a dead leg so we had to protect him.</p>
              <p>"At the end of the game Plessis was injured too so we had to change. We knew Xabi was only maybe 80% of his ability so it was to protect him.</p>
              <p>"Xabi is our player and he is playing well. If he continues to play well I will be really pleased. But it doesn't matter if you have one good player and you need another one, you have to keep the balance of the team."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>its up to xabi. unlike berba, ade, helbs, barry, who cried big about wanting to move. he just too quiet. you dont let rafa know your idea, he assume you are satisfy playing bit part football at liverpool.</p>

              <p>u r right. he has Mascherano who play defensive midfielder position as barry. but u never know what u gona get from rafa. maybe he see potential of barry as a central defender cover for carragher not Mascherano</p>

              <p>Ah Ben is behaving like a spoiled brat.</p>
              <p>Alonso is one player that defied him last season for not going to Inter Milan due to the girl friend going to give birth.</p>
              <p>I disagree with Ah Ben on this issue and I believe his team mate would understand his decision to stay behind.</p>
              <p>Even though Alonso is very needed at this moment for the missing players, Ah Ben refused to acknowledge this truth for the sat match.</p>
              <p>This is the weakness of Ah Ben that he have displayed for the 4 seasons that he have been around.</p>
              <p>His stubbornness in his wrong decision will cost Liverpool the title.</p>
