              <p><strong>There was some confusion over the fee that the Portuguese club would accept, however, with officials claiming they still want £60 million – which <span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span> will not pay.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>Personal terms are understood to have been agreed already, however, and although Porto are denying that they are close to an agreement, it appears that the transfer is moving closer.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>Porto have accepted that they cannot demand the €100 million (£80 million) release clause in Hulk’s contract is met and are open to negotiations especially as the 25-year-old Brazilian international has made it clear that he is desperate to leave.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>Hulk — full name Givanildo Vieira de Souze – scored 21 goals in 38 appearances last season as he helped guide Porto to their second successive league title.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>Hulk can play on the right of an attacking trio, or through the middle, with Chelsea having already signed Eden Hazard for £34 million, along with £6.5 million Marko Marin as Abramovich overhauls his squad.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>The billionaire is determined to add much-needed creativity to the squad.</p>
              <p>They have made an inquiry for several ‘big names’, including Real Madrid’s Gonzalo Higuaín and Atletico Madrid’s Radomel Falcao, although neither would want to be second-choice.</p>
              <p>It would appear more likely that Chelsea could bid for a younger striker such as Bayer Leverkusen’s Andre Schurrle. An inquiry has been made for the German international.</p>

              <p><strong>Chelsea have agreed a staggering £38million deal for Porto striker Hulk.</strong></p>
              <p>Porto have been driving a hard bargain for the Brazilian international but believe they have finally reached an agreement.</p>
              <p>Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is expected to sign it off within hours after lengthy negotiations on Thursday brought a breakthrough.</p>
              <p>It takes Chelsea’s summer spending towards the £80m mark already, as they have snapped up Belgian star Eden Hazard for £32m and German international Marko Marin for £8m.</p>
              <p>Abramovich has suddenly decided to spend big to help refresh an ageing squad and it is also part of a bigger plan to lure a top manager - with Pep Guardiola still top of his list.</p>
              <p>The former Barcelona boss has knocked back at least three approaches as he claims he wants a year-long sabbatical.</p>
              <p>But Chelsea believe they can change his mind with a £12m-a-year package and big-money signings.</p>
              <p>Hulk - real name Givanildo Vieira de Souza - is keen to move to Chelsea, so personal terms will not be a problem.</p>
              <p>Chelsea will now have serious firepower with Fernando Torres and Hulk to finish off chances created by Juan Mata, Hazard and Marin.</p>

              Summary of current FFP Regulations
               
              Football clubs wishing to take part in the UEFA Champions League or UEFA Europa League must balance their football-related expenditure over a three-year period up to the 2014â€“15 season.[68]
               
              The 2011â€“12 season is the first season which counts towards the 2014â€“15 assessment. Clubs, however, will be allowed to make a loss of â‚¬45 million (Â£39.4 million) over the three years, falling to â‚¬30 million from 2015â€“16 IF the loss was covered by equity contribution only. The first season that UEFA will begin actively monitoring the financial situation of individual clubs is 2013â€“14, but this will take into account losses made in the two preceding years (2011â€“12 and 2012â€“13).
               
              From 2013-14 UEFA will be able to ban clubs from playing in European competitions the following season if the rules have not been met but it is not until 2018 that clubs will be expected to bring their annual losses below Â£8.8 million (based on 2010 exchange rates)
               
              Only actual "football-related expenditure" â€” a clubâ€™s outgoings in transfers and wages â€” will be counted over income from gate receipts, TV revenue, advertising, merchandising, sales of players and prize money is included in the assessment. Any money spent on infrastructure, training facilities or youth development will not be included.[69]
               
              The full regulations are available to download as a PDF from the UEFA official portal UEFA.com on this link. "UEFA Club Licensing and Financial Fair Play Regulations Edition 2010". UEFA.com. 27 May 2010. Retrieved 24 March 2012.
