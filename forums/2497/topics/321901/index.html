              <h2>Real Madrid are preparing to sell up to six players in order to finance their continuing quest to prise Cristiano Ronaldo away from Manchester United this summer.</h2>
              <p>With the highest amount reported that los Merengues are willing to pay being €90m, the club's moneymen have warned president Ramón Calderón that sales will have to be made, Sport state.<br><br>The Spanish champions are in debt, with some critics putting the figure as high as €400m, and the transfer of Ronaldo could not be justified unless other money was brought in.<br><br>One plan is that Madrid will sell four high profile youth team products and two star names from their squad in a bid to raise more than half the projected transfer fee for Ronaldo.<br><br>Robinho looks set to be sold and it is now just a question of whether is included in a swap deal with Manchester United or offered to the open market for the right price.<br><br>Two other names in the hat, only one of which will go, are Wesley Sneijder and Ruud van Nistelrooy, but Schuster would prefer the former to be the one to leave.<br><br>Despite only being at the club one season, Sneijder's stock has risen higher because of Euro 2008 and the arrival of Ronaldo would mean he would not be sorely missed.<br><br>Esteban Granero, Rubén De la Red, Álvaro Negredo and Javi García could all be sold on despite enjoying successful spells on loan last term that looked to be enough to earn them a recall to Bernd Schuster's squad.<br><br>Negredo is the only one not to have seen his buy-back clause activated with Almería hopeful they can keep him, but the other three all believe they could play for Madrid next term.<br><br>The sale of those six players would be expected to raise over €50m and could mark a huge shift in the way the squad is balanced next term at Madrid.</p>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>REAL MADRID last night ruled out a mega-bid for Cristiano Ronaldo. President Ramon Calderon denied Real will smash the transfer world record by saying: “We’ll NEVER pay £80million for one player.” And in another amazing twist, SunSport can reveal United would NOT be allowed to let Ronaldo rot in the stands rather than let him go.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">FIFA rules state a player can walk away if he features in fewer than 10 per cent of his club’s matches in a season. Calderon, who has infuriated United boss Alex Ferguson with his public chasing of Ronaldo, now claims to be delighted the player has made public his desire to move to the Bernabeu.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “We are very happy with the declaration of the player. But it does not depend on him, it depends on United. “There is no issue with Ronaldo but they don’t want to sell. The English club have to make the first step. United have the last word.” Real boss Bernd Schuster sparked a frenzy of speculation when he said Real would pay “whatever it takes” to land the 42-goal ace. But Calderon has put paid to rumours a world-record £80m bid — dwarfing the previous record of £46m Real paid for Zinedine Zidane — was in the offing.</p>
              <p class="article">United have maintained all along the Portuguese superstar would not be allowed to leave. They even threatened to force Ronaldo to watch the season from the stands. But under section four of FIFA’s articles for the status and transfer of players, it says: “An established professional who has, in the course of a season, appeared in less than 10 per cent of the official matches in which his club has been involved may terminate his contract prematurely on the grounds of sporting just cause.”</p>
              <p class="article">This rule gives Ronaldo, 23, a strong hand in his battle to get out of United.</p>

              <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo could tip balance if he moves from Manchester United to Real Madrid</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/graphics/2008/06/24/sfnmad124.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="small"></p>
              <p class="story"><strong>Real Madrid are famed for their pristine white kit but, given the club's indebted recent financial history, red might be a more appropriate colour.</strong></p>
              <p class="story">A fiscal crisis at the turn of the century was overcome following a deal to sell the club's training ground to regional government in Spain, and according to recent estimates the debt figure is again in excess of £160 million.</p>
              <p class="story">Club president Ramon Calderon, having seemingly steered away from the controversial 'galactico' policy of predecessor Florentino Perez, insisted last night that Real Madrid would "never pay €100million for any player," yet it looks increasingly likely that they will do just that to secure the signature of Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo. On top of that, Calderon is ready <span style="color: #000000;">to give the Portuguese a £182,000-a-week contract</span> that would dwarf the wages commanded by players such as Kaka, Michael Ballack and John Terry.</p>
              <p class="story">At a time of such Premier League strength, Real's apparent financial muscle may appear surprising. Indeed, if the Ronaldo transfer happens, it would force a re-evaluation of the supposed European financial dominance of England's leading clubs.</p>
              <p class="story">Recent research showed that the Premier League was generating some £600 million more income on an annual basis than Spain's La Liga, yet revenues are widely split in Spain.</p>
              <p class="story">Real were accused of being effectively state-subsidised following the training ground deal, but remain the only club to generate more annual income than United. In 2006-07, <span style="color: #000000;">according to Deloitte's Money League</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span> their turnover was £236 million compared to United's £212 million. The difference could largely be explained by the commercial legacy of the galactico policy, as well broadcast rights. United and the rest of the Premier League clubs sell their television rights collectively, while Real are free to thrash out individual deals in Spain, and have recently signed a contract with Mediapro worth £740 million over seven years. They also generated more than £30 million more in commercial turnover than United, an area of their finances that improved significantly during the period that Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham and Brazil's Ronaldo were at the club.</p>
              <p class="story">As well as the benefit on the football pitch, the acquisition of United's Ronaldo would also provide a boost to Real's merchandising. It is, however, widely predicted that United's turnover will surpass Real's when the figures for the 2007-08 season are published.</p>
              <p class="story">Ronaldo yesterday went on holiday, and no swift resolution is expected. Ultimately, the stand-off highlights the differing styles of the world's two richest clubs. United's emphasis on developing emerging young talent has helped ease any temptation to spend excessively on individual players, while Real coach Bernd Schuster has expressed the desire to "pay whatever it takes" to sign Ronaldo.</p>

              <p>Ronaldo, who helped fire United to a Premier League and Champions League double last season, is a target for the Spanish giants, although several weeks of claim and counter-claim have failed to result in a deal.</p>
              <p>United insist the Portugal international is not for sale while Madrid are waiting for the player to announce his future plans. "If he leaves, Manchester United would lose the best player in the world," said Liverpool right-back Arbeloa on Tuesday. "I would be delighted if Ronaldo leaves and more so if it is to my former team."</p>
              <p>Arbeloa joined Liverpool last summer from Deportivo La Coruna and has faced the challenging task of marking the 23-year-old. Ronaldo's departure would be a blessing for many Premiership defenders, according to the Spain international.</p>
              <p>"Let's hope Real Madrid make an effort," joked Arbeloa. "For me it would be fantastic, I would thank them."</p>

              <p><strong>Real Madrid are all set to pay €85 million for Cristiano Ronaldo, according to reports in Spain.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Madrid based daily AS claims that club president Ramon Calderon will lodge a straight cash bid, worth around £68million, rather than the player-plus-cash offer previously mooted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The paper quotes a 'source' close to Calderon as saying: "Cristiano is most likely going to come to Madrid because he's made a decision that he's unlikely to go back on. The transfer will close in at €85m."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Calderon ruled out 'breaking the bank' for Ronaldo on Tuesday, saying: "In any case, Real Madrid will never pay €100 million for anybody."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, AS claims that Real would be prepared to go up to €90million to get their man, but no higher. Real would therefore need to offload at least one of their other valuable stars, with Brazilian Robinho the favourite. AS claims his sale (possibly to Chelsea) would raise around €45million.</p>

              <h2>Real Madrid are including Cristiano Ronaldo in their pre-season plans and are convinced that he will be with them for their trip to Austria on July 21, according to Marca.</h2>

              <p><strong>Bernd Schuster knows that given the price and the emphasis placed on prising the Portuguese star away from Old Trafford, that he is likely to be the only signing of the summer. That pressure has meant that Madrid cannot now afford to miss out on him because it would require a rapid redrawing of the plans and would sees calls for president Ramón Calderón to go.<br></strong><br>A date of July 7 was stated by Marca, who have been accused of being the public voice box of the club by pundits, as the date when a deal could be announced, but that has now changed. Ronaldo is in the middle of a month's holiday, that he began after Portugal's exit from Euro 2008, but he is predicted to return to Manchester next week and finalise a move to Madrid.<br><br>Schuster is confident that he will have the player in his ranks in time for the trip to Irdning for the start of pre-season training and has made accommodation plans for him. The limited transfer movement at the Bernabéu has so far only seen Javier Balboa go to Benfica, although, Roberto Soldado and Julio Baptista are expected to be sold soon.<br><br>Robinho could also go even if Ronaldo does not arrive because he is reportedly becoming upset at being tipped to made a makeweight in a deal for the United star.<br><br>While Ronaldo remains away from the media spotlight, the saga will continue to drag on with the latest predictions turning full circle as many people believe that he could not stay at Old Trafford.</p>

              <h1>Real Madrid: Cristiano Ronaldo must declare he wants to leave Manchester United</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="small"> </p>
              <p class="story">Real Madrid have once again told Cristiano Ronaldo that he must tell Manchester United he wants to leave if a move to the Bernebeu is to happen this summer.</p>
              <p class="story">Real president Ramon Calderon, who has been exceedingly vocal in his desire to sign the 23-year-old winger, has reportedly already got a deal in place.</p>
              <p class="story">The <span style="color: #000000;">News </span>suggests Real have set the £75 million-rated Portuguese international a £140,000-a-week pay limit - on a par with Raul - but have promised him £25m from commercial activities and image rights over the next two years.</p>
              <p class="story">All the Spanish champions need is Ronaldo to officially declare that he wants to leave Old Trafford, and Calderon said: "In the end, the player's desire will decide it.</p>
              <p class="story">"Something can be gleaned from his declarations. But we need him to openly say that he wants to leave Manchester United to play for Real Madrid.</p>
              <p class="story">"We're a respectful club and will continue to be so. What I can say is that I'd feel proud if the big clubs in the world were after our players, as that would mean they were the best in the world."</p>
              <p class="story">Ronaldo's agent, Jorge Mendes, has been in regular contact with Real's sporting director Predrag Mijatovic, while Ronaldo, currently on holiday with his girlfriend in Sardinia, is not due back in Manchester until July 10.</p>
              <p class="story">Upon his return, he will have showdown talks with United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and chief executive David Gill, but Spanish sources claim Ronaldo has already chosen a property in Morajela, close to where Calderon and head coach Bernd Schuster live.</p>
