              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Manchester City have been splashing the cash this summer like no tomorrow, but James Marshment thinks it is too soon to tip them for the title.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span>  </p>
              <p>Gareth Barry, Roque Santa Cruz and more recently Carlos Tevez have all been added to the Manchester City pay-roll this summer at a cost of around £60million in transfer fees.</p>
              <p>It might be peanuts compared to the credit-crunch-defying cash being spent by Real Madrid, but these are all players of proven Premier League ability, who will undoubtedly make City much stronger this coming campaign.</p>
              <p>Some observers even believe the title will move across the city to the blue half of Manchester come next May.</p>
              <p>But whilst I believe City's investments will give the Premier League's top-four a much-needed shake-up, I think we're a season away - and possibly two - from considering Mark Hughes' side as genuine title contenders.</p>
              <p>Let me explain why.</p>
              <p>Firstly, when was the last time you saw a side go from finishing 10th in the table (not to mention a whopping 40 points adrift) go on to finish top of the pile the very season after? Add into the mix that the top eight, let alone the top four, has altered only minimally over the past five seasons and you get some idea of the task City are facing. In fact, since their return to the Premier League at the end of the 2001/02 season, the Blues have only secured a top-eight finish once.</p>
              <p>With that in mind, just finishing in the top six would represent progress given their previous 'struggles'.</p>
              <p>Now obviously, given the cash that has been spent, all associated with the club will be expecting a whole lot more than a top-eight finish this term - and bringing Champions League football to Eastlands in the 20010/11 season has to be a realistic goal.</p>
              <p>But to even get to that level, Hughes must iron out a couple of deficiencies that have held City back in recent times - starting with their defence. It is mainly away from home where these problems lay - and their shipping of 32 goals in 19 games on their travels last term was the fifth worst in the entire division. Even relegated Newcastle conceded less on the road!</p>
              <p>To be fair to the City chief, he has apparantly set the wheels in motion to strengthen his rearguard and links to Sol Campbell, Kolo Toure, Lucio (and particularly) Joleon Lescott and John Terry, should at least give supporters heart. I think Hughes recognises he probably now needs to priortise on strengthening his central defence and the capture of two established names would aid their progress far more significantly than anywhere else on the field. It's the age-old adage, but if you're keeping things clean at the back then you've always got a chance of winning more matches.</p>
              <p>Shay Given was recruited in the winter transfer window and he'd surely become a safer pair of hands if he was playing behind say Terry and Lescott, as opposed to Richard Dunne and Micah Richards - the latter of whom seems to have lost the panache of previous seasons.</p>
              <p>And if City do bring in the star additions at the back to accompany the marquee signings in attack, that will surely take care of their other frailty - their appalling away record. Two wins in 19 on the road last season tells its own story and Hughes will know this needs significant improvement if they're to push for the top four next season.</p>
              <p>If they are to upset the establishment and bag a top-four place, the most obviously under threat are Arsenal, who after a few seasons of under-investment player-wise, look set to face their stiffest test yet to hang onto their place amongst England's elite. Aston Villa threatened it for a spell last season until they ran out of steam - but City will hope to go one better this time around.</p>
              <p>The Gunners have been in a slow decline over the past three or four seasons and if they don't make some key additions this summer, I think they will lose their top four mantle come next season.</p>
              <p>Don't get me wrong, I'm delighted to see City spending big if it makes for a more exciting race for the European places.</p>
              <p>They say Rome wasn't built in a day - and it will certainly take that bit longer to bring the Premier League title to Eastlands.</p>
              <p>But City are on the right track and hopefully come this time next year we will be talking about City as serious title contenders</p>

              <p>their striker dept is very strong now, but its their defence that sucks lol. no point scoring lot of goals and also leaking lots of goals. they only add gareth barry to their midfield.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>going for the title, thats wishful thinking on their part. buying players is one thing, getting them to gel and play as a team is another. think they can finish within top 6, maybe top 4 or 5. their shopping of players have not ended, with toure and lescott rumoured to be coming. if they come, they will certainly strengthen their defensive weaknesses. dun think JT will leave chelsea. if he does, that will be a shocker.</p>

              <p>well, Man City ain't RM. Players go RM 'coz of their histories. 1st UCL winner, most UCL winner, one of the best stadium around the world. What does Man City have? I dunno their history.</p>
              <p>Most important, RM are always playing for the top of their division and in UCL while Man City? Struggling in mid table or in relegation zone. Not even a Uefa cup place. Why would players wanna go Man City? Go is 'coz of money.</p>
              <p><br>If Mark hughes dun go, man city won't reach the top 4 this or next season.</p>

              <p>players want to go because of money and because they forsee the money there will allow them to get good players to make it big. You won't get the top players straight away but you'll sure as hell get the near top players.</p>
              <p>enough of them + a good coach and you're set to be better than a team with just 2 or 3 top players. look at chelsea for example.</p>

              <p>Yeah... man city would NOT be first next season. I dont even think they will be the top 6. I still think that no matter who they buy, Man utd, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal, Aston Villa, Everton and Tottenham Hotspurs would still be above them.</p>
              <p>The best I see them would be 6th, qualifying for the UEFA (or what you call them now) Cup.</p>
              <p>Hughes is no ferguson, wenger, mourinho, ancelotti or guardiola. Having good players but a lousy manager would get you no where at all.</p>
              <p>Having money alone is not enough, people joining city is all because they want money. If you dont win trophies at least you have the money. Who the hell is truthful when they say that they are interested in joining the revolution of man city football club. Fuck Them.. there is no truth in all these statements. They go because of the money. Look at the adebayor, getting 170000 per week. He is a fucking lazy player and he is worth 170000 per week???? Rooney is how many times better than him and is not even earning that amount. City is nothing but money, and money cannot always buy you success.</p>
              <p>Everyone goes because of money. Gareth Barry is the prime example. I wanna play for liverpool or arsenal because of champions league, then the next moment, Barry has signed for City in a 18million deal. I am very happy to be joining city's revolution blah blah blah... fuck you barry, you are more interested in the money than anything else.</p>
              <p>Money has killed soccer. Paying over the odds for a player that is not fucking worth it at all. 25 million for adebayor?? That guy is worth only at most 15million. 80 miilion for ronaldo?? that guy is worth only at most 35million. Even players like glen johnson can cost 18miilion and liverpool is just dumb enough to pay that amount. Johnson is maybe only 7-8million worth. Crazy football dealings, all because of Perez, Abramovich and City bosses!!</p>
