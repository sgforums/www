            <div class='col-md body'>Plastic pitch will be no excuse, insists Robinson<br><br>Paul Robinson has insisted England will have to adapt to the plastic pitch when they face Russia in Wednesday's crucial Euro 2008 qualifier in Moscow.<br><br>The Tottenham 'keeper is adamant there will be no room for excuses because of the artificial surface if Steve McClaren's side slip up against a Russia side looking to avenge last month's 3-0 defeat at Wembley.<br><br>England have been training in similar conditions as part of their preparations for a game from which a win will ensure their qualification for next summer's finals - but a defeat will take their hopes out of their own hands.<br><br>Robinson said: 'It will be different. We trained on a plastic pitch a couple of times during the past week, we've got a couple more sessions before we fly out on Monday to Russia and we will train on the actual pitch on Tuesday.<br><br>'It's just another element you have to cope with. It will be a tough away trip to Russia and not many of us have played on that type of pitch before.<br><br>'But it must be of good quality and we can't be putting excuses in the way about plastic pitches. We've got to go out there, deal with the circumstances and hopefully get a win.<br><br>'It is a learning experience for us all. We have done as much research as we can.'<br><br>Robinson admits he may have to adjust his own game to deal with the conditions in Moscow where snow has been falling during the past few days.<br><br>He said: 'Maybe as a 'keeper you have to meet the ball before it bounces some of the time. You can't rely on the ball skidding through as it does on grass.<br><br>'Maybe the bounce will take a lot of pace off the ball. I think I will have to wear leggings or tracksuit bottoms to prevent the burns and the grazes and to help me to slide.<br><br>'It is a new challenge and it is a massive game for all of us. We have put ourselves in a great position now, have won a lot of games 3-0, and we want to finish the job.'<br><br>Robinson is expecting a busier night than in the 3-0 win over Estonia and he knows the Russians will wants to redress the balance after the reversal at Wembley.<br><br>He said: 'No disrespect to Estonia, but Russia is the big game because we have to go there and get something. It is going to be a difficult game and they won't be happy having got beat the way they did here.<br><br>'They will be looking for revenge but they will be coming up against a confident England team.<br><br>'I definitely expect a busier night on Wednesday. Away to Russia is going to be a difficult game. They won't be pleased with the way we beat them at Wembley.'<br><br>Robinson is in a confident frame of mind despite coming under the microscope for recent errors with club and country.<br><br>He said: 'I was pleased with my form against Estonia. First of all I was pleased to play. But, if you look at my record, that is our 10th qualifying game and I've kept nine clean sheets.<br><br>'I do look at my own performances and I've made a few mistakes which is unlike me but I have worked hard.<br><br>'The manager gave me a vote of confidence and I took a lot of strength from that and from the clean sheet on Saturday.<br><br>'All goalkeepers are harsh on themselves but I am pleased and we all know how close we are to qualifying now. We've got the bit between our teeth and don't want to let the chance go now.'<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00372/Joleon_Lescott_372965a.jpg"><br><br><strong>JOLEON LESCOTT has won a shock call-up to EnglandÂ’s starting 11 for tomorrowÂ’s Euro 2008 showdown with Russia. He replaces Ashley Cole, who could be out for THREE MONTHS after injuring an ankle in SaturdayÂ’s 3-0 defeat of Estonia. </strong><br><br>Frank LampardÂ’s role in Moscow is less clear. The Chelsea midfielder featured in a 4-3-3 formation during training yesterday. But boss Steve McClaren then reverted to the 4-4-2 line-up that saw off Estonia at Wembley. Everton defender Lescott impressed in training on a plastic pitch in Altrincham and gets the nod at left-back ahead of Nicky Shorey.<br><br>Lescott, 25, replaced Chelsea full-back Cole for most of the second half at the weekend. McClaren is a fan of his pace and presence at set-pieces. Cole had a further scan yesterday which revealed no broken bones. But doctors have seen enough ligament and muscle damage to know he will need up to 12 weeks to recover.<br><br>The player will have another scan today, when medics hope to diagnose the full extent of his injury. If McClaren does retain the 4-4-2 formation, Lescott would most likely be the only change. McClaren had indicated Lampard would play a big part in Russia but now seems to be having second thoughts about shuffling his pack.<br><br>A final decision will not be taken until after training in Moscow tonight. Mac is keen to see all his men on the Luzhniki StadiumÂ’s artificial pitch and assess who copes best with the conditions. John Terry travelled and has declared himself fit to play, despite a knee injury. Even so, Terry must wait until later tonight before finding out if he will take part.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Terry doubtful for Russia game<br><br>MOSCOW, Oct 16 (Reuters) - England captain John Terry will almost certainly miss Wednesday's Group E Euro 2008 qualifier against Russia, manager Steve McClaren said on Tuesday.<br><br>Terry, who sat out the 3-0 win over Estonia at Wembley last Saturday with a knee problem, had earlier declared himself fit but locked his knee towards the end of an hour-long training session on the artificial turf at the Luzhniki Stadium.<br><br>McClaren, whose team will reach the finals in Austria and Switzerland if they beat Russia, said the Chelsea defender could not complete the session and is 'almost certainly ruled out'.<br><br>Portsmouth central defender Sol Campbell is again likely to deputise as he did on Saturday.<br><br>Terry had earlier told a news conference: 'I am fully fit but I will have to have an operation in the near future to remove a bit of floating bone.'<br><br>The England captain took part in a warm-up and practice match on Wednesday but broke down after the players split into groups for the final 25 minutes of the session.<br><br>'He locked his knee towards the end of training and could not complete the session,' added McClaren.<br><br>Looking ahead to Wednesday's match the England manager earlier said: 'I am delighted to be in this position where it is all on Russia to have to win the game.<br><br>'We expect them to come storming at us for the first 20 minutes or so and we are determined to defend it right and to keep a clean sheet.<br><br>'You do not qualify for major tournaments in March or April, you qualify over the last few games in October or November and I always thought it would come down to this.<br><br>'It will be a very big test for everybody but I am confident we have the players to go out and complete the job.'<br></div>
