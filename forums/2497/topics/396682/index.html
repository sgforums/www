              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=84997">Aruna Dindane</a> has been allowed to play in the FA Cup final by his parent-club Lens
              who have offered to waive their £4 million fee for his 22nd game if he
              does not play in any other match this season. However, Portsmouth have
              refused the offer, claiming that he must also be allowed to participate
              in games leading up to the Wembley final.</p>

              <p>Dindane,
              currently on loan at Pompey, has a clause in his loan agreement stating
              that the club must pay £4 million if he plays another game, but Lens
              have agreed to miss out on this payment as they believe that playing in
              the showpiece event would boost their chances of selling him in the
              summer.</p>
              <p>The striker has been one of the most important players at
              Fratton Park this season and impressed in the 2-0 semi-final defeat of
              Tottenham, but Pompey want him to be match-fit if he is to play in the
              final and are willing to let him miss out on the game in a bid to
              strengthen their position over the player.</p>
              <p>''The club [Lens] have
              now agreed to let him play in the final, because they think it would be
              a good showpiece platform for him to get a move,'' Pompey administrator
              Andrew Andronikou told <em>Soccernet</em>. ''But Portsmouth's feeling is
              that he needs to play in the other games leading up to the final and he
              needs to be totally match-fit to play against Chelsea. I have made a
              last ditch attempt to find some rational ground between us.</p>
              <p>''We
              told Lens that this is our stance today, and basically it is a
              'take-it-or-leave-it' offer from us. We will see what happens over the
              weekend, but I have so much to do and many more issues to look after
              that I can't afford much more time on this one.</p>
              <p>''We will see
              what happens and we really hope that Dindane can play in the final. He
              deserves to, and he was one our best players in the semi-final, but
              I've got to say that his chances are decreasing.''</p>
              <p>Dindane, himself, has talked of his desire to play in the final, telling the <em>Daily Star</em>:
              "I grew up in France watching the FA Cup final and to have the chance
              to play in one is a dream come true. I only hope that dream will not be
              taken away."</p>
