              <p><strong>Harry Redknapp believes Manchester City have a better squad than Barcelona.</strong></p>
              <p>The Tottenham manager claims the club he will be trying to beat at White Hart Lane on Sunday has greater depth than the one that's shaping up to become the best in football history after winning last season's European Cup.</p>
              <p>“I would say their squad is stronger than Barcelona’s, yes," he said. "It's an amazing squad they’ve gone for there.</p>
              <p>The White Hart Lane chief also predicted Carlos Tevez would regret it if he gets his wish to leave the Etihad Stadium and claimed Samir Nasri joined City for the cash on offer, despite the player's denials.</p>
              </div>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>But it is Redknapp's belief that Mancini’s squad is nearly-invincible that summed up the task facing Spurs this weekend.</p>
              <p>“To bring in players like they have - Aguero, Tevez, Dzeko - is incredible," he said.</p>
              <p>"Look at that strike force. It’s an unbelieveable goal-scoring forward line - one that could absolutely whip anybody on their day.</p>
              <p>“David Silva is world class and could play in any team in the world right now.</p>
              <p>"Their squad is full of quality now. Look at De Jong, Yaya Toure. They have people like James Milner struggling to get in the team and Adam Johnson, you just don’t see [him] playing any more.</p>
              <p>“Its an amazing squad. I think they will eventually be challenging for everything, because they have the resources to keep bringing in the best players in the world.</p>
              <p>“Eventually, if the owner stays with the club - which I am sure he will do - they will win the Premier League.</p>
              <p>“[Tevez] will find it hard leaving there. Unless you go to Barcelona or Real Madrid, I couldn’t see where you would want to go other than Manchester City.</p>
              <p>“He has been at Manchester United [so] isn’t going to go back there. I can’t see anywhere he can go where he is going to better his football."</p>
              <p>Redknapp believes he succeeded with a loan bid for City striker Emmanuel Adebayor - who cannot play in Sunday's game against his parent club - because the Blues are sure they are nailed-on for a top-four finish.</p>
              <p>He said: “They probably don’t see us a threat any more! The days of them worrying about being in the top four are gone. They are now looking at winning the Championship. That’s how strong they are.</p>
              <p>“They are not worried about battling away for the top four spot. If they <em>don’t</em> make the top four, it will be a miracle.”</p>
              <p>Redknapp believes the Citizens’ moves for Nasri and, earlier in the summer, his Arsenal team-mate Gael Clichy, illustrate a spending power few can compete with.</p>
              <p>He went on: “They’re a more powerful club, yeah. Because, at the end of the day, they can pay wages that Arsenal can’t pay. That’s your problem.</p>
              <p>“If they [City] are interested, it’s a dream move for a player to suddenly go and get £200,000 a week for five years. They haven’t got to worry too much after that, have they?”</p>
              <p>“I don’t believe [Nasri, <span style="color: #000000;">who refuted the suggestion he moved for financial than than footballing reasons</span> ], no. He could have gone to Manchester United. They wanted him and he wanted to go to United, really - that’s what I heard.</p>
              <p>“But then City came in and offered him more money again, so he went to City.</p>
              <p>“I wouldn’t see Chelsea being powerless. They’re mega-rich, with Mr Abramovich there. But then they nearly lost John Terry the other year, didn’t they, to City?</p>
              <p>“Whatever anyone says, I’m sure John was thinking about it, because it was such an offer.</p>
              <p>“So yeah, if they come in and make a crazy offer and offer your player crazy-money, it’s very difficult for the player not to have his head turned.”</p>

              <p>how on earth can city be stronger than barcelona? barcelona can tap on its reserve squad, which is the best in the world.can city do that? city only rely on buying star players.</p>
              <p>city midfield cannot even come close to barcelona of messi, iniesta and xavi, not to mention fabregas and sanchez who just joined barcelona. what has city got in midfield? 3 midfield destroyers, plus nasir who just joined and silva. their midfield will be overrun by barcelona. rednapp is english, so he is speaking on behalf of english teams. is he kidding himself to say city squad is stronger than barcelona?</p>

              If like that say, then many teams can be better than Barcelona... I mean man city just lost 3-2 to man utd? And 1 of the goal was a soft goal due to man utd keeper's mistake?

And <span style="color: #000000;">Edin Dzeko</span><span style="color: #000000;"> finally coming good, he looks like the old RVN...</span></p>
              <p>And Spurs should just let Mordic go lah... Get 2 able bodies from Cheslea also a good deal as they need players...</p>
              <p>Dzeko now like the old top form Drogba... Tevez can play more Carling cup match liao... Dzeko equal Berbatov's record of scoring 4 goals in a match... wow.</p>

              <p>Spurs problem remind me of their year Berbetov left them... That year Levy pushed it all the way to the very last day to deal with the Berbatov transfer and it ended up the problem it created to the Spurs team that they couldn't win and only got 2 points from their first 8 matches... And Ramos was sacked...</p>
              <p>Now the same situation happening with Modric... This guy never learn... But at least he gets good value for money lor... But must pay to sack the manager... lol.</p>
