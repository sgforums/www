              <div><span><strong>Chelsea are still in talks with AC Milan over a stunning summer swoop for Kaka, according to the player's personal assistant. The Brazil international has been linked with the Premier League outfit following the appointment of compatriot Luiz Felipe Scolari as manager.</strong> </span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div id="articlebody">
              <p>Milan insists their gifted playmaker is not for sale, but reports suggest a 100million Euros (£78million) deal could yet be brokered before the closure of the transfer window at the end of the month. </p>
              <p>Kaka, who is under contract at the San Siro until 2012, is said to be unhappy over Milan's refusal to allow him to represent his country at the Olympic Games in Beijing. And the brilliant Brazilian's personal assistant, Diogo Kotscho, has claimed talks between the two clubs are ongoing. </p>
              <p>Kotscho told <em>The Observer</em>: "I spoke with Kaka yesterday (Saturday). We know that the clubs are talking about the transfer, although they have not reached a conclusion yet. "I think an August transfer is still a possibility, though Kaka will only talk about that when they do a deal. </p>
              <p>"He is waiting for a deal and then he will start to negotiate with Chelsea. "Normally, Milan do not sell their best players. We think they like the proposal, but it is not so easy for them to accept it. "For now we must just wait and see."</p>

              <div><span><strong>Chelsea will make another bid for Robinho this week, but according to reports from Spain it will again be rejected by Real Madrid. The Blues confirmed last week that they had lodged an official bid for the Brazilian winger, believed to be in the region of £20million. </strong></span><span><strong>And now Spanish daily <em>AS</em> believes they'll up that offer to 30million Euros in the coming days (around £25million).</strong> </span></div>

              <div id="articlebody">
              <p>Ramon Calderon said after the first bid that Robinho wasn't for sale, and the paper claims he'll repeat that stance when Chelsea come back with their improved offer.</p>
              <p>Robinho's future has been the subject of much speculation all summer, particularly with Real trying to land Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United. And in recent days his camp have made no secret of the fact he feels undervalued by Madrid.</p>

              <h1>Madrid Nip Robinho Saga In The Bud</h1>
              <h2>Real Madrid have decided that Robinho is untransferible and will remain at the club despite Chelsea preparing to increase their offer for the player.</h2>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Los Merengues believe that they can calm the Brazilian star down and make him stay with them and are set to refuse any bids that come in for him in the current transfer window.</strong><br><br>Bernd Schuster sees Robinho as a key part of his plans for next term and has always asked the club's hierarchy to try their best to keep him. During the lengthy saga to prise Cristiano Ronaldo away from Manchester United, Robinho's name was mentioned as a possible makeweight in the deal and that opened up the current rift.<br><br>Allied with the 24-year-old's desire to be paid a similar wage to the club's top earners, Madrid looked set to lose one of their main assets. By denying Chelsea's improved offer however, the Spanish champions hope that will be the end of the matter and that they can placate Robinho with a new deal.<br><br>The Premier League team made it clear that they were willing to pay him around €6m-per-season and that has made Madrid's €4m pale and left them having to draw up a fresh plan.</p>
