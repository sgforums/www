              <p><em>Gareth Barry &amp; Steve Finnan trading places...</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="addStoriesLink" rel="1039828_3" href="/sport/football/article-1039828/INSIDER-EXCLUSIVE-Liverpool-Villa-finally-agree-19m-deal-Gareth-Barry-England-star-secures-Anfield-move.html"></a></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool </strong></span><strong>have drawn a line under the summer's longest-running transfer saga after finalising a £19m deal for </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Aston Villa</strong></span><strong> midfielder Gareth Barry. Fresh from concluding a £20million deal for Spurs striker Robbie Keane, the Anfield club have held further talks with Villa and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Insider </span>understands that they have reached agreement on a £17.5m cash offer plus defender Steve Finnan.</strong></p>
              <p>The move is no surprise but the timing is, as Liverpool have still to sell to raise the relevant funds but know they have offers on the table for Jermaine Pennant and Yossi Benayoun.</p>
              <p>Further interest has also been expressed in Andriy Voronin, Alvaro Arbeloa and Xabi Alonso. Benitez made public his first bid for Aston Villa midfielder Barry in May and incurred the wrath of Villa boss Martin O'Neill. Barry then confirmed he wanted to leave and criticised O'Neill for a lack of communication. That outburst saw the England playmaker fined and banned by the club.</p>
              <p>Four bids from the Reds were rejected by the midlands club, who were holding out for £18m, before Arsenal reportedly became involved in the race for the England man.</p>
              <p>The 27-year-old, who scored 36 goals in 327 appearances for Villa, was booed when he turned out for Villa in a pre-season game but the crowd appeared fully behind him when he came on as substitute in the Intertoto Cup match against Odense last Saturday.</p>

              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold">Aston Villa have confirmed Gareth Barry is staying at the club and will not be joining Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Barry has been a target for Liverpool throughout the summer, but the Premier League rivals have been unable to agree on a fee.</p>
              <p>Liverpool
              have seen multiple bids for the England international rejected, with
              Villa reportedly wanting a sum in the region of ï¿½18million.</p>
              <p>The midfielder had stated that he wanted to take up the opportunity to move to Anfield to play UEFA Champions League football.</p>
              <p>He
              was critical of Villa boss Martin O'Neill and was also fined by the
              club before returning to pre-season training a fortnight ago, and then
              being booed by fans in a friendly against Walsall last week.</p>
              <h4>Deadline passed</h4>
              <p>Barry will now spend the new season in the Midlands after Villa revealed Liverpool did not meet the deadline to agree on a deal.</p>
              <p>A statement on Villa's <em>official website</em> read: "This evening, Aston Villa can announce that Gareth Barry will be
              staying with the club following the interest from Liverpool over recent
              months.</p>
              <p>"During discussions in the past few days, a final
              deadline to conclude this episode was set that all parties were aware
              of and agreed to.</p>
              <p>"This deadline has now passed and so Gareth will remain with Villa."</p>
              <p>Reds
              boss Rafa Benitez had admitted on Tuesday, following the signing of
              Robbie Keane from Tottenham Hotspur, that he would have to sell before
              being in a position to buy Barry.</p>
              <p>However, Benitez will now have
              to look elsewhere for midfield reinforcements after Villa ended
              negotiations regarding a possible deal.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">THE amazing Gareth Barry transfer saga took a bizarre turn last night when Liverpool caved in to Aston Villa’s demands — 15 minutes too late.</h2>
              <p class="article">Two days of intense talks took place with Villa holding out for £18m cash. A 5pm deadline was set by Villa but when Liverpool failed to meet it, Villa immediately released a statement saying that the England star was staying.</p>
              <p class="article">It read: “Aston Villa can announce that Gareth Barry will be staying with the club. “A final deadline to conclude this episode was set that all parties agreed to. This deadline has passed so Gareth will remain with Villa.”</p>
              <p class="article">The speed in which Villa closed the debate stunned Liverpool and Barry, 27, but the Kop remain determined to get the midfielder. They had agreed to pay £18m but there was haggling over the methods of payment and Liverpool asked for a small deadline extension.</p>
              <p class="article">Villa chief Randy Lerner refused and, even though Liverpool had everything in place by 5.15pm, Villa would not negotiate further. Barry is determined to play Champions League football and Arsenal could now renew their interest with a player-exchange deal.</p>
              <p class="article">Liverpool’s £20m new-boy Robbie Keane made his debut in last night’s friendly in Spain against Villarreal.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">MARTIN O'NEILL has revealed his delight after holding on to Gareth Barry. Aston Villa last night pulled the plug on their skipper's £18million move to Liverpool.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Reds failed to meet the 5pm deadline set by Villa as talks over the midfielder's future rumbled on. And boss O'Neill has expressed his relief at keeping Barry, 27, at Villa Park.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “Naturally we’re all absolutely delighted that Gareth will be staying at Villa Park and relieved to find a resolution and closure to the saga. “We had a very positive meeting on Monday when it was agreed between Gareth, his agent, Mr Randy Lerner and myself that a deadline should be communicated to Liverpool to finally resolve the situation.</p>
              <p class="article">“Liverpool were informed and that deadline came and passed. Now we can all look forward to the coming season with relief, anticipation and ambition.”</p>

              <p>i wonder why...</p>
              <p>Barry will catch a lot of stick from the fans.. he'll not have the heart to play.. and worse, he's already burnt a bridge before he crossed it <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <h2>BARRY TO PUT IN TRANSFER REQUEST?</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/08/07/240/Gareth-Barry_1065710.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div>
              <div><em>Barry: encouraged to hand in a transfer request</em></div>
              <p> </p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Gareth Barry could hand in a transfer request in an effort to force through a move to Liverpool despite Aston Villa saying the deal is dead.</strong> <strong>The midfielder has yet to formally request a move - despite telling the media that he wants to play for Liverpool - because it would see him lose a loyalty bonus. </strong> </p>
              <p>But now reports suggest that the Reds will encourage Barry to hand in a transfer request to try and force Villa to accept an offer despite the passing of a deadline. </p>
              <p>Although Villa have declared the deal dead after Liverpool failed to come up with the funds by 5pm on Wednesday - with suggestions that the Reds missed the deadline by 15-20 minutes - there is cynicism that the story is over. </p>
              <p>The Daily Mail is still sticking by their Wednesday afternoon exclusive that Liverpool have come up with a £19m deal that involves Steve Finnan moving the other way and claim that the deal will go through on Thursday. </p>
              <p>This despite Martin O'Neill declaring: "Naturally we're all absolutely delighted that Gareth will be staying at Villa Park and relieved to find a resolution and closure to the saga," said O'Neill. </p>
              <p>"We had a very positive meeting on Monday when it was agreed between Gareth, his agent [Alex Black], Mr [Randy] Lerner [the chairman] and myself that a deadline should be communicated to Liverpool to finally resolve the situation. Liverpool were informed and that deadline came and passed. Now we can all look forward to the coming season with relief, anticipation and ambition."</p>
