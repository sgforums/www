              <h2>Zinedine Zidane will be awarded the Legion of Honour, the French equivalent of a knighthood, it has been announced today.</h2>
              <p>Just as the British honours system rewards people deemed to have made a
              valuable contribution in society over their lifetimes, the French have
              a similar set-up. The Legion of Honour is the highest accolade that the
              French state can award and is only given to those whose influence is
              unquestionable. <br><br>French footballing great Zinedine Zidane will
              have his ranking in the Legion lifted from a knight to an officer it
              was announced this afternoon.<br><br>At 36 years of age, 'Zizou' will
              be remembered as one of the truly great footballers of his generation,
              performing with Cannes, Girondins de Bordeaux, Juventus, Real Madrid
              and France with distinction during a career that spanned 18 seasons.<br><br>Few
              players can claim to have won the titles that the Marseille-born
              superstar has won. Domestically, Zidane has won titles both in Italy
              and in Spain in addition to achieving great continental success,
              victorious in the European Cup – few will forget his sumptuous winning
              goal for Real Madrid against Bayern Leverkusen - and twice the European
              Super Cup <br><br>It is his exploits with the French international
              side that are really being recognised today. Zidane was a spearhead of
              the French international side that dominated international football at
              the turn of the millennium, playing pivotal roles as France claimed
              their first ever World Cup title in 1998, famously scoring two goals,
              and then followed this with a dramatic European Championship success a
              year later.<br><br>The Légion d'honneur, as the French recognise it,
              has five levels, of which Zidane has been promoted to the fourth-most
              rank, officer – one step ahead of a knight. There is a maximum quota of
              10,000 officers at any one time so the award is truly unique and
              special.<br><br>Jacques Lambert, president of the FFF, was also
              upgraded to an officer while Fernand Duchaussoy, chairman of the French
              amateur leagues (the LFFA), has been made a knight.</p>
