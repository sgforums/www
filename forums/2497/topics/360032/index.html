              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger insists his battered </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Arsenal</strong></span><strong> side are ready to bounce back to wreck </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United’s</strong></span><strong> title party.</strong></p>
              <p>And despite recent setbacks, the Gunners boss feels his team are just as good as the Barclays Premier League champions.</p>
              <p>United need just a point at Old Trafford on Saturday to retain the crown but Wenger is determined to get his side back on track after disastrous defeats to United and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span></a>.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">'It looks like it will be Manchester United but we can still delay it. We definitely have a point to prove,' said Wenger. 'We want to play for our pride and be respected for who we are, that is people who love the game they play.</p>
              </div>
              <p>'We promised ourselves on the first of January we would give everything in every game until the end of the season. That is where we can show we are capable to do that.'</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Arsenal crashed to a 4-1 aggregate defeat against United in the Champions League last week, while Sunday's 4-1 home loss to Chelsea has left them trailing the league leaders by an incredible 18 points.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Former Arsenal players Ian Wright and Emmanual Petit have urged Wenger to spend big in the summer, but the Arsenal manager is convinced his side can still become one of the strongest teams in England and are determined to get revenge over United.</p>
              <p>Wenger is adamant there is no gulf between the two clubs and his team have the quality to challenge for major silverware.</p>
              <p>He said: 'We have a very promising team who can deliver very soon. If you look at the statistics of the two teams for example, we have scored a similar amount of goals.</p>
              <p>'In the passing quality in the final third and in the opposition half, we are as good as Manchester United. We have conceded more goals and that's where the difference lies.</p>
              <p>'We have conceded 36, they have conceded 24, we have scored 64 they have scored 67. Offensively, I do not believe there is a difference.'</p>

              <p><strong>Rafael Benitez has refused to concede the Premier League title to Manchester United and called on Arsenal to prove they are better than their recent results.</strong></p>
              <p>The Liverpool boss is defiantly clinging onto the faint hope that leaders United will not take one point from their last two games to retain their crown.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson's men are preparing for a championship-winning party at Old Trafford on Saturday against the Gunners, with a trip to Hull City on the last day if they need to wrap up the league title against the relegation-haunted Humbersiders.</p>
              <p>And Benitez was certainly not prepared to heap praise on United just yet as they close in on equalling Liverpool's 18 league titles. Benitez's team must sit and wait for the outcome of the Old Trafford match before facing West Brom at The Hawthorns on Sunday, by which point they could be concerning themselves with getting the four points from two games that will secure runners-up spot.</p>
              <p>But Benitez said: ''We have confidence that Arsenal will play a good game. They have lost their last two and this time you will see a totally different team intent on proving something about themselves.</p>
              <p>''If they do that, hopefully it will give us our chance the following day.</p>
              <p>''Arsenal will put up a fight, they are a good team with players of quality. And because of the results they have had in the last few games, they have to prove something.</p>
              <p>''Arsene Wenger is winner, and his players are too. You cannot lose in the way they have done in their last few games and not want to try to do their best.</p>
              <p>Benitez also called for the league's last two weekend schedules of the season to be played at the same time, rather than just the last day as it is now. Benitez said: ''This is a strange situation, having games so close to the end of the season on different days. It is something that should be improved in the future.</p>
              <p>''For the last two weeks of the season, teams fighting for the title or to avoid relegation should have their matches all at the same time. ''The last two games should be the same for everyone, in Spain it is like this.''</p>
              <p>Benitez went on to suggest that United's position on top of the pile is mainly because of the money they spend. He said: ''When you talk about Manchester United you are talking about a top side spending big, big money on every single player. Every season.</p>
              <p>''For me that is the main difference between the teams. You have seen that with regard to Chelsea before, spending big money. ''The advantage United have is that they have a big squad, in the last years they have spent money to improve that squad even more.</p>
              <p>''They have spent big on top-class players, so they can make mistakes and they can change players. When we won there, they had <span style="color: #000000;">Ryan Giggs</span>, <span style="color: #000000;">Paul Scholes</span> and <span style="color: #000000;">Dimitar Berbatov</span> on the bench. ''We cannot do something like that. We spend too much time worrying about whether <span style="color: #000000;">Steven Gerrard</span> and <span style="color: #000000;">Fernando Torres</span> can play while they can play Ronaldo, <span style="color: #000000;">Carlos Tevez</span>, Berbatov or <span style="color: #000000;">Wayne Rooney</span>, it doesn't matter to them.''</p>
              <p>He continued: ''We have done well. Clearly we are more consistent. Once we were a team for the cups and the Champions League and now we can talk about being a team for the Premier League. That is positive for the future.</p>
              <p>''We will now continue to do our job this season, and next season it will be different.''</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Manchester United were crowned champions of England for a record-equalling 18th time at Old Trafford after a goalless draw with Arsenal ensured Liverpool cannot now catch their north-west rivals.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson's side might not have given Usain Bolt a goal to celebrate on his first visit to the Theatre of Dreams but the Premier League trophy will do as consolation.</p>
              <p>After over three decades as the unquestioned kings of English football, the Merseysiders now have someone else to share the title with. And, if Ferguson is to be believed it will not be long before the Anfield outfit lose it altogether.</p>
              <p>While the first half ended with United still on course for the 11th league title of Ferguson's illustrious reign, Arsenal had every reason to be pleased with themselves.</p>
              <p>After two dire displays that surrendered their Champions League semi-final with the Red Devils, plus a hammering on home soil by Chelsea, it was feared the Gunners would suffer yet another embarrassing mauling.</p>
              <p>Yet, as time wore on, it seemed Ferguson's side were adopting a pragmatic approach to the situation, ensuring their goal was tight and secure, pushing forward in numbers only when really necessary.</p>
              <div>
              <div>Fabregas and Van Persie had one last shot at spoiling the party. But with the trophy ready and the tickets sorted, it seemed a shame to stop it.</div>

              <div><strong>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger:</strong><br>"United are worthy champions. They did well in every single competition and that is very difficult. "It was a very interesting championship. I think United won it because they got more points at home than any of the other teams in the top four.</div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Our ambition was to win the game. United were very cautious, and we did not find an opening. "We lacked sharpness and quality in the final third but overall we dominated the game. "United's strength is to defend well and that is what they did today."</p>

              <p>Well, it's a good thing that the prize presentation is this week at Old Trafford. It won't be nice for Hull if they're relegated next week and this is happening in front of them. On the other hand, their celebrations if they manage to stay up would also be overshadowed.</p>
              <p>Whatever it is, let Hull have their moment good or bad at KC Stadium.</p>
