              <p>Some bg on Ryan’s love life? Ryan was engaged to Davinia Taylor, but they fell out after some random situation in a nightclub that left her with facial injuries.  (WTF, right?) She then got engaged/married to Jason Gardner, a sports agent.  Giggsy was close with Gardner and was the two fell out after he began seriously dating his sister, Emma and cheating on her with Stacey (his current wife).</p>

              <p><br>I guess Giggs was right afterall with choosing the right girl for himself... Cos his ex-gf Davinia Taylor an actress probably had some issue... She married his friend (Beck's good friend) but was reported to have a drug fueled lesbian sex sessions with Kate Moss and Sadie Frost.</p>
              <p>She gave birth to a son, Grey, in June 2007. Beck's good friend wasn't the father, Not sure who the father is but the kid’s Godparents are Beckham and Kate Moss... lol.</p>

              <p>   </p>
              <p><strong>John Terry’s lover Vanessa Perroncel had a fling with a second Premiership star – during her on-off affair with the England skipper. Her mystery man is a household name and is now terrified he will be the next to be exposed.</strong></p>
              <p>Vanessa, 33, is mulling over whether to accept an offer of £250,000 to tell the story of her affair with married Terry. Her spokesman said: “If she decides to, she’ll come out and say exactly what happened.”</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, shamed Terry has been repeatedly phoning heartbroken wife Toni in a desperate effort to save his marriage.</p>
              <p>Toni, 28, fled to their holiday home in Dubai at the weekend as news broke of her husband’s affair with Vanessa Perroncel, ex-girlfriend of his England team-mate and former best friend Wayne Bridge.</p>
              <p>The source added: “Toni will take as much time as she likes to think things through. It is understandably a very difficult time but her main priority at the moment is their twins. They are her life and she wants to protect them foremost.</p>
              <p>“She is still taking John’s calls. She thinks it’s important for them to still communicate with each other for the sake of the kids, however upsetting the whole situation is.”</p>
              <p>Chelsea defender Terry is said to be ready to pay Vanessa £500,000 to buy her silence over their affair.</p>
              <p>He fears any chance of a reconciliation with Toni will be wrecked if Vanessa, 33, decides to reveal all with a kiss-and-tell story.</p>
              <p>She was yesterday said to be mulling over offers of up to £250,000 from various media outlets .</p>
              <p>The insider said: “JT wants to fix things with Toni but he can’t afford a load of intimate stuff to come out in the wash. If Vanessa is all about the money, he’ll find the money.”</p>
              <p>Vanessa’s spokesman Max Clifford said: “She has known John for a long time and obviously I think during that time they had become very close friends.</p>
              <p>“Vanessa will decide what she wants to do, and she will then, if she decides to, come out and say exactly what has happened.</p>
              <p>“You’ve only got to look at Tiger Woods.<span>  </span>There was one, there was two, and then suddenly there were 12 or 13 who allegedly had relationships with him.” Terry, 29, who earns £170,000 a week, is said to be confident he can smooth things over with Toni, even though the fling with her former friend Vanessa is the latest in a string of infidelities.</p>

              <p>In a statement read on her behalf by publicist Max Clifford, Ms Perroncel said: 'In recent days I have been the centre of a great deal of press speculation and comment. </p>

              <p>If the paper only can offer $250k which is already a lot in normal circumstances, and the whole world will gets to know your deep dark secrets and someone else willing to pay you twice the amount to keep quiet... It's obvious which one is the better deal right. And now that Terry isn't the captain anymore, its value probably drop a little as well...</p>
