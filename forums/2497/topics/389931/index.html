              <p>England boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fabio Capello</span></abbr> is expected to make an announcement on <abbr><span class="glossary-term">John Terry</span></abbr>'s captaincy on Friday.</p>
              <p>Capello is considering the options available to him following newspaper allegations that the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> skipper had an affair with the former partner of international team-mate Wayne Bridge.</p>
              <p>Capello is understood to be keen to have the issue settled before he
              travels to Warsaw for the Euro 2012 qualifying draw this weekend.</p>
              <p>He has asked his assistant Franco Baldini, who is more fluent
              in English than Capello, to handle the situation and to keep in touch
              with 29-year-old Terry.</p>
              <p>When Capello returns to England on Thursday - he was due to
              have an appointment today with a consultant in Switzerland about his
              recent knee surgery - he will then assess the situation and a decision
              is likely to be announced on Friday.</p>

              <p><strong>The conflict follows Terry’s decision to sever his ties with Lincoln, the former </strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/chelsea/"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span></a><strong> kit-man who negotiated the deal on his behalf.</strong></p>
              <p><em>Sport</em> understands that Lincoln claims to be entitled to a percentage of the Umbro money as part of the deal, but that arrangement has been questioned since the acrimonious split with Terry. Lincoln is pressing his claims and negotiations are ongoing.</p>
              <p>The dispute comes as Terry waits to hear the verdict of Fabio Capello, who is considering whether to retain him as England captain following disclosures about the centre-half’s affair with Wayne Bridge’s former girlfriend.</p>
              <p>Sources close to England manager Fabio Capello say he remains unsure of what to do about Terry. While he has the highest regard for the centre half as a player and a skipper, he recognises how difficult the situation has become. But as much as Capello remains troubled, it is what might come next that also concerns him and the FA.</p>
              <p>Capello is under pressure to make a public statement on his return on Friday following knee surgery.</p>
              <p><br>The dispute is also an unwelcome complication for Umbro. Last night a spokeswoman for Umbro said: “We do not comment on our players. Any dispute between a player and an agent is a matter for them.”</p>
              <p>The disagreement with Lincoln is one of the consequences of Terry’s decision to change his team of advisers last August. In splitting with Lincoln, who also represents Wayne Bridge, Terry also lost the guidance of long-term personal solicitor Angus McBride, who also represents the England players’ committee, and PR consultant Mark Bolland, a former personal secretary to the Prince of Wales.</p>
              <p>Terry has since placed his affairs in the hands of an Essex-based company, Elite Management, run by the Rushden and Diamonds chairman, Keith Cousins, and Paul Nicholls, a former team-mate from the Chelsea youth squad. In recent days PR adviser Phil Hall, a former News of the World editor, has begun working for Terry in an attempt to counter the tide of negative publicity, and the potential for further revelations from Vanessa Perroncel, who is represented by Max Clifford.</p>
              <p>While Terry must take responsibility for his own behaviour, questions have been asked about the advice he has been receiving. The affair with Perroncel is just the latest in a recent string of personal indiscretions by Terry that have attracted media attention.</p>
              <p>Terry is no stranger to unwelcome press coverage but it appears his associates have struggled to navigate the squalls created by his personal conduct.</p>
              <p>The decision to seek a “super-injunction” preventing publication of allegations about his relationship with Perroncel looks particularly unfortunate. Media opposition to the use of super-injunctions is universal, and by seeking to close down the story Terry and his advisers simply alerted the rest of the print and broadcast media to its existence. The net effect was to amplify interest in the story, reaping a whirlwind of adverse publicity when Mr Justice Tugendhat revoked the injunction last Friday.</p>
              <p>The judge observed that the motivation in trying to prevent publication included the impact of adverse publicity on Terry’s earning power. The judgment also revealed that two unnamed business associates of Terry approached Perroncel and asked her to sign documents preventing her discussing the affair.</p>
              <p>Sources close to Chelsea have rejected suggestions the club advised Terry to take legal action.</p>
              <p>Lincoln was Terry’s long-term agent until disagreements ended their relationship in August. The catalyst for the split was Terry’s negotiations with Manchester City, which Lincoln conducted on his behalf. Terry sealed an improved deal at Chelsea with the blessing of owner Roman Abramovich worth at least £150,000 a week.</p>
              <p>Terry is also understood to have been unhappy at the failure to secure him more sponsorship deals. It is striking given his profile how few endorsements Terry has, evidence perhaps that his previous off-field troubles may have been a factor. Umbro is his only personal sponsor and a deal with King of Shaves expired in 2008.</p>
              <p>Elite’s attempts to fill the sponsorship gap began poorly when Terry was forced to disown an email, sent by Riviera Management, a company who had been engaged by Elite Management, circulated in the football industry touting his availability for commercial projects off the back of his anticipated leadership of England at the World Cup in South Africa.</p>
              <p>Neither Cousins nor Nicholls have commented since the recent controversy broke and neither they nor Lincoln returned calls yesterday.</p>

              <p>Some bg on Ryan’s love life? Ryan was engaged to Davinia Taylor, but
              they fell out after some random situation in a nightclub that left her
              with facial injuries.  (WTF, right?) She then got engaged/married to
              Jason Gardner, a sports agent.  Giggsy was close with Gardner and was
              the two fell out after he began seriously dating his sister, Emma and
              cheating on her with Stacey (his current wife).</p>

              <p>What you talking about? Giggs never had an affair with a teammate's wife or girlfriend at anytime.</p>
              <p>Giggs dated his friend's sister... But he ended up marrying her brother's ex-girlfriend... All this happened when he was a young single man and all parties wasn't married at that time... His friend ended up marrying one of his ex-gf as well... So, there is really nothing to it compare to this, they just found their preferred soul mate thats all. And they are now all married with kids.</p>
              <p>There is nothing really like a scandal it is now with Terry's. He is married, he is England's captain and most importantly, he isn't young either. This isn't just any woman or an ordinary girlfriend they can just joke about... It is the woman of his club team-mate, said good friend and international team-mate's only child mother... How he secretly went behind the back of his said good friend and bang her till she became pregnant is totally out of this world when their relationship wasn't totally over or still fresh...</p>
              <p>As a guy, there are somethings you just don't do... And this probably rank right up there... It's like you have designs on your sister-in-law or even worst your sister... lol.</p>
