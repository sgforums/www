              <p>The Liverpool midfielder has made it clear he wants to leave Anfield this summer.</p>
              <p>Ex-Reds boss Rafa Benitez, who is now at Inter Milan, is believed to be interested while Barca have been long-term admirers.</p>
              <p>Mascherano's agent Horacio Zandonadi has revealed he will be allowed to move on.</p>
              <p>Barca had targeted Arsenal's Cesc Fabregas but were put off by the Gunners' £50m asking price.</p>
              <p>Fabregas last week revealed he would stay in North London, leaving Barca to weigh up their options.</p>
              <p>Werder Bremen's Mesut Ozil is in line for a move to the Nou Camp but Mascherano, who came close to joining Barca last summer, is also on the radar.</p>
              <p>Zandonadi said: "The player and all of us would love him to be at the club.</p>
              <p>"The numbers are close to half what Barca were being asking to pay for Fabregas.</p>
              <p>"He has not renewed his contract and they promised that this year they would help him leave.</p>
              <p>"We're talking about a much easier situation than last year."</p>

              <p>The Juventus midfielder, 30, is set to complete a £6million switch to Anfield this week.</p>
              <p>He is seen as the replacement for Javier Mascherano, who is expected to leave the Reds this summer.</p>
              <p>And Agger thinks his Denmark team-mate will fit in well on Merseyside.</p>
              <p>He said: "Christian would be a perfect addition to most of the big clubs in Europe, so he will certainly fit in here.</p>
              <p>"He is a top player and will make us stronger. We need to have big signings so we can compete and he is one of those players.</p>
              <p>"Christian will improve the team. But we need more improvements if we want to be at the top of the league this season.</p>
              <p>"Maybe he will find the pace of here a bit of a culture shock. He will have to get used to the extra high tempo.</p>
              <p>"He has played in Italy, Spain and Germany and done very well, so I don't see any reason why he shouldn't be a success with Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"We have Mascherano but it looks like he is leaving so there is a gap there."</p>

              <h2 style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">WEST HAM have won the war to keep their captain Scott Parker.</h2>
              <p>The Hammers' midfield star, 29, is set to sign a new four-year deal a week today to finally see off interest from Tottenham and Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Boss Avram Grant has already cemented deals for Manchester City striker Felipe Caicedo and Ajax winger Miralem Sulejmani.</p>
              <p>And the Hammers will further test French side Nice's resolve with a firm £12million bid for striker Loic Remy.</p>
              <p>But Parker's decision to stay put is an enormous boost for Hammers fans, who have twice voted him their player of the year.</p>
              <p>He still had three years left on his current deal but agreed a one-year extension with a rise to around £70,000 a week.</p>
              <p>Ecuadorian Caicedo is arriving on a season-long loan with an option to buy for £2.5m, while Serb attacker Sulejmani is also expected to agree a loan deal for the season with an option to buy at £7m.</p>
              <p>Hammers have added over £10m to their £60m a year wage bill - despite being £90m in the red.</p>
              <p>But midfielder Radoslav Kovac could join Stoke to bring in £1m and save £1.5m a year on wages - while Alessandro Diamanti and Jonathan Spector are also expected to be let go.</p>

              <p>West Ham are willing to sell but they want a top price as they would have little time before the new season kicks off to sign a replacement striker.</p>
              <p>Kop boss Roy Hodgson was instructed earlier this week to pay £15m up front with a further £5m fixed to appearances.</p>
              <p>A Hammers insider said: "It has to be a big price for Carlton. With just days to go before the season starts, the club don't want to be left in the lurch.</p>
              <p>"If things happened earlier, maybe the price could have been lower."</p>
              <p>Hammers have already turned down a Stoke bid of £9m plus £3m on appearances for Cole, 26.</p>
              <p>The frontman has been in fine pre-season form, scoring four goals in six games as he bids to add to his seven England caps.</p>

              <p>Defender Carragher, 32, has spent his whole career with home-town club Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Yet towards the end of last season there was talk that the former England international would not rule out leaving.</p>
              <p>But he said: "I'm sure I'll be signing a contract - and I'm looking forward to finishing my career at Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"I laugh when people say I've been in 'talks'.</p>
              <p>"There'll be no talks, it will probably be sorted in 20 minutes.</p>
              <p>"The club mentioned that the most important thing was to sort the ins and outs before the end of the transfer window.</p>
              <p>"Then, if they want to speak to me, that's great. That's probably when we'll sit down and sort it out.</p>
              <p>"I'm desperate to finish my career here and I'm sure that'll be the case."</p>

              <p>"The sale process is continuing but its timing and outcome remain uncertain. In the meantime, we will not comment on rumour and speculation."</p>
              <p>Kirdi is the preferred bidder for the Americans as he is willing to pay closer to their £600million asking price.</p>
              <p>Yet he has been viewed with sceptism by some as his figure is so far above the £350m price Huang is hoping to do business at.</p>

              <p>The Reds owe £237million to Royal Bank of Scotland and the bank is reluctantly drawing up plans to assume control of the club as hopes of a new investor falter.</p>
              <p>Talks between RBS and Liverpool officials are reported to have already taken place.</p>
              <p>The owners want £600m for the club but if they do not find a buyer by October 6, they will incur a further £60m penalty fee.</p>
              <p>RBS has set a deadline of the end of August for a takeover and could sell it for the amount of their £237m loan - leaving Hicks and Gillett with nothing.</p>

              <p>He said: "We have had a number of bids. We will examine those extremely carefully. We will make sure we take our time."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">DAVID NGOG has no intention of leaving Liverpool after his blistering start to the season.</h2>
              <p>The French striker, 21, scored in Sunday's 1-1 draw with Arsenal to make it three goals in three games.</p>
              <p>He has been linked with a loan switch to West Brom, despite playing a key role at Anfield over the last month.</p>
              <p>With Spain striker Fernando Torres still recovering from his World Cup efforts, Ngog has been on top form.</p>
              <p>He netted twice at Rabotnicki in Champions League qualifying and opened the scoring with a fine finish against the Gunners.</p>
              <p>He said: "I am happy at Liverpool. I am focused on the club and I'm trying to do my best for Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"I am a striker and I want to score a lot of goals for Liverpool. I work hard for this and so it's good when it comes off.</p>
              <p>"When Javier Mascherano passed the ball to me in the box I couldn't see so many solutions so I took a shot and that's that."</p>
              <p>Ngog was delighted to get a draw against Arsenal after Joe Cole was sent off just before half time.</p>
              <p>It could have been so much better though with Pepe Reina spilling into his own net in the final minute of normal time.</p>
              <p>Ngog added: "Yes, it's a good point because when we went down to 10 men. We realised it was going to be difficult to get a point.</p>
              <p>"I don't know if he deserved the red card. He just wanted to do well. But after that we fought together and did well."</p>
              <p>Torres made his first appearance off the bench as a late sub - his first since committing his future to the club.</p>
              <p>And Ngog said: "He really helps us. He's a key player and it's good for our future. It was a boost.</p>
              <p>"When big players like him and Stevie say they are staying it's a good thing for Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"We are a big club and we need big players."</p>
              <p>Former Paris St Germain starlet Ngog is also enjoying life under new boss Roy Hodgson.</p>
              <p>He added: "So far it's been really good. He talks really closely with the players.</p>
              <p>"He has a lot of experience and this will help us to be at a top level.</p>
              <p>"He has managed for a long time and he's good for the club."</p>

              <p>The England midfielder, who signed for the Reds this summer, was sent off in his first league match.</p>
              <p>He lunged at Gunners defender Laurent Koscielny during Sunday's 1-1 draw at Anfield.</p>
              <p>And Liverpool have confirmed they will not appeal the decision.</p>
              <p>A club statement said: "Liverpool will not contest the automatic three-game ban imposed upon Joe Cole.</p>
              <p>"Roy Hodgson said after the game that the club would analyse the incident before deciding whether to lodge an appeal.</p>
              <p>"Liverpool have now chosen not to take the matter further, meaning Cole will miss clashes against Manchester City, West Bromwich Albion and Birmingham City."</p>

              <p>The Argentine superstar wants his £25million-rated national captain to join the Catalan giants as soon as possible.</p>
              <p>Messi said: "The 'little captain' would be a great boost for Barca.</p>
              <p>"He has the quality to play for Barcelona and his character would fit in perfectly at the club."</p>
              <p>World Player of the Year Messi is a close pal of midfielder Mascherano and is understood to be desperate for him to sign.</p>
              <p>Mascherano, 26, has made clear he wants to quit Anfield for family reasons and his agent has said he would love to move to the Nou Camp.</p>
              <p>But Barca have offered only £12m plus ex-Arsenal star Alexander Hleb.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">JOE COLE is an Anfield god despite being a sinner on his league debut for Liverpool.</h2>
              <p>He has already done enough to suggest the good times can return to the historic club.</p>
              <p>Even Jamie Carragher's son James has Cole's name on his shirt, rather than the old man's.</p>
              <p>The Kop centre-back said: "Joe has lifted the city. It's not just on the pitch or in the dressing room, it's the whole place.</p>
              <p>"He's staying in the centre of town getting well-wishers all the time, so he's starting to realise just how big a club this is.</p>
              <p>"Joe is like a god in the city already and he's only played a game and a half."</p>
              <p>Carragher says Cole's red card for a rash tackle on Arsenal new-boy Laurent Koscielny during Sunday's 1-1 draw at Anfield should have been a booking.</p>
              <p>However Liverpool have decided against an appeal and he will now miss the next three Premier League matches but is available for Thursday's Europa League play-off clash with Trabzonspor and the second leg in Turkey the following week.</p>
              <p>He said: "You see the tackle he made so many times, trying to block a ball down the line, and if you don't get the ball, you can't stop yourself in mid-air.</p>
              <p>"To me, that type of tackle should be only a yellow.</p>
              <p>"He's going to be a major asset for us. He has already got the fans onside and was talking beforehand about how big a game this was for him."</p>
              <p>And Carragher laughed off his son's preference for Cole.</p>
              <p>He said: "You don't want a defender's name on the back of your shirt, do you?"</p>
              <p>Carragher reserves judgment on what the season has in store under new boss Roy Hodgson.</p>
              <p>He said: "We're Liverpool so shouldn't get carried away after drawing with Arsenal at home.</p>
              <p>"People talk about last season but don't forget that the year before, with the same team, we finished second.</p>
              <p>"We were never as bad as seventh. We're better than that. Maybe with a new manager and a couple of new players, we should be fighting for a top-four place. That has to be the aim."</p>
              <p>Carra admits it was the right time for Rafa Benitez to go but refused to criticise him.</p>
              <p>He said: "I'd never do that. I've got too much respect for him. Everyone's different, with different ways of doing things.</p>
              <p>"Everyone said the same about Gerard Houllier. I stuck up for him and I'll stick up for Rafa.</p>
              <p>"We had some great times but it was time for a change.</p>
              <p>"Ever since I've been here, we've never been thought of as the best team in the country. We've enjoyed the chance to prove people wrong.</p>
              <p>"I understand why people don't fancy us to get in the top four but we believe we can."</p>
              <p>Middlesbrough keeper Brad Jones, 28, is set to join Liverpool after his club agreed to let him complete the move.</p>

              <p>Liverpool boss Roy Hodgson said: "When we had to submit the list for the matches Brad Jones was not signed for the club.</p>
              <p>"We cannot put players on the bench that are not signed so Diego will be the substitute goalkeeper tomorrow.</p>

              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>ROY HODGSON is ready to dig his heels in and let Javier Mascherano leave Liverpool for nothing in two years.</strong></p>
              <p>The Argentine midfielder wants out as his family have failed to settle in England with ex-Kop boss Rafa Benitez keen to take him to Inter Milan.</p>
              <p>But the Italians will not match Liverpool's £30million valuation - leaving Masch with the prospect of staying put until January at least.</p>
              <p>Hodgson, preparing for tonight's Europa League play-off at home to Trabzonspor, would love to keep the player until the end of his contract in 2012.</p>
              <p>The Reds have offered Mascherano fresh terms but know he has no interest in signing.</p>
              <p>Barcelona wanted him last summer but the previous management talked him into giving them another season.</p>
              <p>New boss Hodgson said: "I'd be quite happy to work the two years with him. If he then wanted to walk away, then so be it.</p>
              <p>"The nicest thing of all would be if he signed a new contract, it's there for him. But nobody is putting him under any pressure.</p>
              <p>"I'm very happy he remains with us because in an ideal world if it was simply a situation of 'would we be prepared to listen to offers for Mascherano', I would say 'no, we aren't'.</p>
              <p>"It's only this promise that was made a year ago that lingers over my head, which means I'm even prepared to go as far as this.</p>
              <p>"We haven't had an offer for him. We want one that meets what we think is his value and Javier is perfectly happy with this - he doesn't expect the club to just let him walk out of here.</p>
              <p>"His problem is a familiar one that his wife doesn't come to Liverpool, so when he's here he lives alone.</p>
              <p>"But he realises he is a very valuable player, the best at what he does in the world and a club has to offer us what he is worth."</p>
              <p>Hodgson insists Inter's hopes of landing Dirk Kuyt are doomed and admitted he is keeping an eye on PSV Eindhoven's Swedish striker Ola Toivonen.</p>
              <p>The Anfield chief said: "I think he is a good player but that doesn't mean we are going to rush in and buy him tomorrow."</p>
              <p>Mascherano is out of the tricky tie against Turks Trabzonspor with a calf injury while Hodgson has to decision to make over Fernando Torres.</p>
              <p>The Spanish striker wants to play but lacks match fitness after a groin injury.</p>

              <p>The Slovakian star had two years remaining on his previous deal but has now committed to Anfield until 2014.</p>
              <p>"I'm very pleased. I have been at Liverpool for nearly three years and I really like it here.</p>
              <p>"I like the city, I like the club and I like the fans so I'm happy I am able to sign a new contract.</p>

              <p>Star pair Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres also pledged their futures to the club over the summer.</p>
              <p>Skrtel added: "Before I came here a lot of people thought I wasn''t good enough to play for Liverpool, but I think I have shown I am.</p>
              <p>"I'm happy to try and carry on giving good performances and doing my best for the club.</p>
              <p>"Signing a new contract gives me confidence and I will work hard in training every day to play as many games as possible.</p>

              <p>The former Manchester United and Chelsea chief executive joined forces with Creative Artists Agency - the firm brought in to handle Huang's Kop negotiations - after he was axed at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>Chinese tycoon Huang remains favourite to seize control at Anfield from Americans Tom Hicks and George Gillett.</p>
              <p>And, according to business giants Bloomberg, Kenyon has already held talks with Reds chairman Martin Broughton.</p>
              <p>Kenyon's shock involvement is certain to incense United fans, who were furious when he deserted Old Trafford for Chelsea - and will now be enraged he is helping bitter rivals Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Huang last week broke his silence about the takeover and said he was 50 per cent confident of sealing a deal.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">DIRK KUYT'S agent claims the Dutchman is weighing up a move to Inter Milan.</h2>
              <p>Kuyt has not expressed a desire to leave Liverpool but it appears the chance to follow former boss Rafa Benitez to Italy could be too good to resist.</p>
              <p>His representative Rob Jansen said: "Yes, there is real interest from Inter, but Dirk has not yet decided if he wants to leave Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"This is also a complicated transfer. Dirk is a key player for Liverpool, he has an ongoing contract and was recently in the World Cup final.</p>
              <p>"He may move to Inter or just stay at Liverpool. There is also the possibility that a player from Inter could be included in the deal with Dirk."</p>
              <p>Kuyt, 30, was rested for Liverpool's Europa League play-off clash with Trabzonspor last night.</p>
              <p>He was signed by Benitez from Feyenoord in 2006.</p>

              <p>And that has left the Argentine hardman facing at least another six months at Anfield - despite slapping in a transfer request.</p>
              <p>Mascherano wants out of Liverpool as his wife has failed to settle in England, and former Kop boss Rafa Benitez was keen to take him to Serie A.</p>
              <p>Inter Milan chief Benitez also wanted to raid his old club for Dirk Kuyt - yet now Hodgson has revealed the Italian giants' president Massimo Moratti has told him they will not be trying to sign any Anfield stars.</p>
              <p>The Reds chief claimed: "I spoke to Moratti on Wednesday about the fact they are not going to buy Liverpool players, and Dirk comes into that category doesn't he?"</p>
              <p>Kuyt's agent Rob Jansen is still claiming Inter want the Dutch striker, although Hodgson shot that down by insisting: "It is just not true."</p>
              <p>But one man who is leaving is £20million crock Alberto Aquilani, who is being lined up for a season-long loan to either Juventus or Napoli in Serie A.</p>
              <p>Hodgson admitted: "Last year he hardly played. If he has another like that, his value will be vastly diminished, but most importantly he'll be unhappy.</p>
              <p>"If he gets regular games it gives him the football he needs and protects the value of the player - but we're doing it with a view to bringing him back."</p>
              <p><strong>FK RABOTNICKI</strong> have been fined £8,000 following the racist abuse Liverpool's players faced during the Reds' 2-0 Europa League win in Skopje last month.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">KENNY HUANG last night dramatically pulled out of the battle to buy Liverpool.</h2>
              <p>The Chinese businessman, head of Hong Kong-based investment company QSL Sports, was willing to pay £350million to take over from co-owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett.</p>
              <p>Yet he has grown increasingly impatient at the slow progress on the deal, despite reportedly proving he had the funds available.</p>
              <p>And yesterday he finally decided enough was enough and announced he was withdrawing his interest.</p>
              <p>He revealed in a statement: "After due consideration Kenny Huang and QSL is withdrawing from the ongoing sales process and have notified Liverpool FC's chairman</p>
              <p>"We thank the many Liverpool fans who expressed support for our efforts and wish the club great success in the years to come."</p>
              <p>Huang's move sends the Reds back to the drawing board in their hunt for a buyer, with their claims of four other would-be investors being treated with huge scepticism.</p>
              <p>It also proves a huge embarrassment for chairman Martin Broughton, the BA supremo brought in four months ago primarily to sell the club.</p>
              <p>Yet there does remain the possibility of it being an elaborate tactic as Huang could well return and get the club on the cheap in October, when the American owners have to refinance to pay off a chunk of the £237m debt.</p>
              <p>That may easily see him taking control for around two thirds of what he was prepared to pay now, should the RBS - who own the debt - effectively seize possession.</p>
              <p>Huang was offering to repay the RBS, hand Roy Hodgson funds to bring in new players and finally build the long-awaited new stadium.</p>
              <p>Yet when it became apparent the deal was taking far longer to complete than he believed, he decided to walk.</p>
              <p>Huang added: "Our strategy and unique ability to expand the fan base in Asia would also have been of benefit to all. We regret we will not have the opportunity to implement it."</p>
              <p>A Syrian group fronted by businessman Yahya Kirdi was also in the running to replace the unpopular Yanks, who wanted around £600m for the club they bought in 2007.</p>
              <p>But that has also failed to develop, leaving the Reds staring at the nightmare scenario of ultimately being taken over by the bank.</p>

              <p>Barca are believed to have made a derisory £12million bid but the Reds will want at least the £18m they paid West Ham to net him in 2008.</p>
              <p>Kop manager Hodgson said: "Javier is not in the right frame of mind to play because his head has obviously been turned by the offer from Barcelona.</p>
              <p>"At the moment, the fee the club thinks is correct and one offered are far apart and unless that can be resolved, he might be unhappy for a long time."</p>
              <p>Hodgson did not want to get into suggestions that he had been either tapped up or was being sold without his approval.</p>
              <p>He added: "The discussions with Barcelona are being held at a high level. I don't want to start saying things that may or may not be true.</p>
              <p>"The danger is I could give an answer and if it is not 100 per cent correct, then all of a sudden I'm creating headlines.</p>

              <p>Mascherano was left out of the Reds squad for Monday's 3-0 defeat at Manchester City, and appears to be on the verge of a move to Barca.</p>
              <p>Guardiola admitted the Catalans are interested, but said: "I will speak about him when he's here — if he comes.</p>
              <p>"If a defensive midfielder arrives the needs of the team will be resolved. If one arrives I will be satisfied."</p>
              <p>Barca are believed to have offered £12million for Mascherano, but Liverpool won't want to talk at less than the £18m they paid West Ham two years ago.</p>

              <p>Senior Reds players were stunned when the Argentina midfielder apparently refused to play at Manchester City on Monday night.</p>
              <p>The Barcelona target then trained on his own at Melwood the morning after the 3-0 trouncing.</p>
              <p>Kop boss Roy Hodgson revealed last Thursday he planned to use Mascherano in the crunch match at City.</p>
              <p>But he had to rip up his tactics on Monday afternoon when he discovered Mascherano was in no fit state to play.</p>
              <p>A club source said: "The manager was thinking of a 4-2-3-1 formation, with Lucas and Mascherano as the holding midfielders.</p>
              <p>"But he had to have a complete rethink and go with a 4-4-2.</p>
              <p>"The senior players at the club were seriously hacked off with Mascherano on Monday night and that was clear when he arrived back on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>"There are players in that squad who are Liverpool through and through and they were fuming at what Mascherano did."</p>
              <p>But, last night, there was fresh hope a deal could be done between Barca and the Reds, who want £25million for Masch.</p>
              <p>Barca boss Pep Guardiola said: "If a defensive midfielder arrives, the needs of the team will be resolved."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, football deal-broker Keith Harris last night claimed a mystery bidder is closing in on a £500m takeover of Liverpool.</p>
              <p>He said: "The overseas buyer has completed due diligence. A huge amount of work has been done."</p>

              <p>Former Football League chairman Harris, who has had a hand in the sales of Aston Villa, West Ham and Manchester City, said due diligence has already been done.</p>
              <p>Harris also claimed the party he was representing was not one mentioned publicly before.</p>
              <p>He added: "A huge amount of work has been done.</p>
              <p>"It is none of the groups mentioned in the Press. The ball is now in our client's court to make an offer.</p>
              <p>"I don't think the deal will be done before the transfer window closes this month but the next pressure point is October, when some of the RBS loan of £237m has to be repaid.</p>
              <p>"It may happen then. But in the present climate these things are impossible to predict."</p>
              <p>Last week Hong Kong-based businessman Kenny Huang — whose interest was allied to the Chinese government — pulled out of the bidding process, while Syrian-Canadian Yahya Kirdi's much-publicised interest has been treated with scepticism.</p>
              <p>Harris said history has taught him that those who went public before an agreement had been reached rarely succeeded.</p>
              <p>He added: "The Chinese government involvement was always a bit far-fetched.</p>
              <p>"In any takeover situation, when people resort to announcing it to the media, you have to question the seriousness of the offer.</p>
              <p>"If the name of the prospective buyer comes out before the deal is done then probably it is never going to be done.</p>
              <p>"Look at when Chelsea was sold in 2003. My firm was advising the club and we only knew of Roman Abramovich on the Thursday before the deal was completed the following Tuesday."</p>
              <p>Harris worked on a bid for Liverpool two years ago for Kuwaiti Nasser Al Khorafi, whom it is claimed agreed a deal for £300m up front and another £100m based on financial performance only to pull out at the last minute.</p>
              <p>Harris said: "He just lost his appetite. No explanation was forthcoming."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">FULHAM want Dickson Etuhu to sign a new four-year deal - fearing Roy Hodgson will come in for his old player.</h2>
              <p>Several clubs have shown an interest in a player whose contract runs out next summer.</p>
              <p>Liverpool boss Hodgson is watching carefully, fully aware the 28-year-old midfielder could walk for free if the Cottagers fail to tie him down.</p>
              <p>Etuhu is keen to play abroad and a Fulham insider said: "Unfortunately everything has been left to the last minute.</p>
              <p>"Although the situation is not ideal, no one at the club wants him to go."</p>
              <p>Nigerian international Etuhu became a firm favourite with the Fulham fans under Hodgson, who admired his ball-winning tenacity.</p>
              <p>He cost the club £1.5million from Sunderland in 2008, having honed his skills with Norwich and Preston.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ALBERTO AQUILANI has finalised his season-long loan move from Liverpool to Juventus.</h2>
              <p>The midfielder joined the Reds in a £20million deal from Roma last season but failed to impress during his brief stint on Merseyside.</p>
              <p>Aquilani, 26, becomes Juve's seventh major signing of the summer and could seal a permanent £13million switch if he impresses during this campaign.</p>
              <p>A statement from the Serie A side read: "Juventus announce that an agreement has been reached with Liverpool for the loan of Alberto Aquilani with the option to buy the player at the end of the season for 16 million euros."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">DIRK KUYT has stunned Liverpool by admitting: I want out.</h2>
              <p>The Dutch star is desperate to join his old Kop boss Rafa Benitez at Inter Milan in a £13million move.</p>
              <p>But new Anfield manager Roy Hodgson rapped Benitez for reneging on an agreement not to poach his old favourites.</p>
              <p>Kuyt's agent Rob Jansen said: "The clubs continue to talk but Dirk has told Liverpool he no longer wants to be involved as this is something that regards his career and life.</p>
              <p>"It doesn't mean he wants to leave at all costs but when a club like Inter comes along it's normal to look into it further."</p>
              <p>Hodgson is already facing a losing battle to hang on to Javier Mascherano, with Inter faxing a £20million offer yesterday and Barcelona also in the hunt.</p>
              <p>And the new Anfield boss blasted: "When Benitez left the club he signed an agreement that he would not poach players from Liverpool and I think that still applies.</p>
              <p>"As far as I'm concerned, the agreement with Inter president Massimo Moratti still stands.</p>
              <p>"We have not received an offer from any club for Dirk Kuyt, this is obviously something going on behind the scenes with the agent talking to possibly the manager of Inter.</p>
              <p>"Two things. One, we don't welcome an offer and two, we haven't received an offer.</p>
              <p>"At this late stage in the transfer window it would be remarkably unusual for us to accept an offer for a player we don't want to leave for money we don't need.</p>
              <p>"I need the player, not the money. We have not received an offer and Dirk hasn't told me he'd want to leave if one came in."</p>
              <p>Hodgson left Mascherano out of the defeat at Manchester City and he is not involved against Trabzonspor tonight.</p>
              <p>Hodgson conceded Barcelona are favourites to land the Argentine. He added: "I don't want to force him on to the field that might make his transfer difficult. On Sunday I'll know one way or another if he's going to be here or at Barcelona."</p>

              <p>Owen ignored the intense hatred between the clubs' supporters as he agreed to play 45 minutes for the Kop against Everton at Anfield on Saturday week.</p>
              <p>Many United fans have still not taken to Owen a year after he moved to Old Trafford because of his Liverpool past.</p>
              <p>He spent eight years as a professional there before joining Real Madrid and then Newcastle.</p>
              <p>His reception from the Anfield crowd is not likely to be great either now he has joined the Red Devils to help them in their quest for a 19th title.</p>
              <p>United boss Alex Ferguson has given his blessing for Owen to take part in the match for Carragher, 32, who has spent his whole career with Liverpool and will donate the proceeds from the game to charity.</p>
              <p>Owen, 30, is looking for a decent run in the United team after recovering from a hamstring injury.</p>
              <p>He said: "I feel fine, fit and ready to go."</p>
              <p>Former Liverpool stars Robbie Fowler and Steve McManaman will also turn out for Carragher.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">INTER MILAN confirmed last night they have made an official £20million bid for Javier Mascherano.</h2>
              <p>Inter sporting director Marco Branca moved for the unhappy Liverpool player, also wanted by Barcelona.</p>
              <p>Branca said: "I sent an offer to Liverpool by fax on Tuesday and am waiting for a reply from them.</p>
              <p>"We're not speaking to the player at the moment because we want to do this in the right way and make sure that Liverpool are happy.</p>
              <p>"Everybody knows that Mascherano would like to change team and to change country. He also has a good relationship with our manager Rafa Benitez.</p>
              <p>"We've made a very good offer, around the amount they are asking for. We have a strong team here, the best in Europe, but we would like to add one or two players to make us even stronger."</p>
              <p>Barcelona have also tabled a £12m offer for him, £8m short of Liverpool's valuation.</p>
              <p>Mascherano was left out of the side beaten 3-0 at Manchester City on Monday, and had to train by himself the following day.</p>
              <p>He did not travel for the Europa League game away to Trabzonspor tonight.</p>
              <p>Kop boss Roy Hodgson admitted: "If he played against Trabzonspor it might prejudice the transfer and I don't wish to do anything like that to the player.</p>
              <p>"I'm hoping in the next couple of days things will be sorted one way or another but I have no idea which way that will be."</p>
              <p>Liverpool travelled without <strong>SIX</strong> first-team stars, the others being Fernando Torres, Steven Gerrard, Milan Jovanovic, Daniel Agger and Maxi Rodriguez.</p>
              <p>Hodgson said: "Steven suffered a slight back strain on Monday.</p>
              <p>"We have decided it would be unwise for Fernando to travel because he only played his first full game on Monday.</p>
              <p>"He is still really on a pre- season training programme. It would be wiser not to risk him if we want to use him against West Brom on Sunday."</p>
              <p>Liverpool could soon make another addition to their squad as they are still in talks with Fulham over left-back Paul Konchesky.</p>
              <p>Hodgson admitted: "It's by no means certain they are prepared to sell players but I'd be lying if I said he wasn't a name we have considered at left-back."</p>
              <p>Liverpool midfielder Alberto Aquilani yesterday joined Juventus on a season-long loan with the option for the Italian club to buy him for £13m in a year's time.  </p>

              <p>The Dutch striker has been at Anfield for four seasons now but usually only features as a bit-part player.</p>
              <p>Birmingham were keen last year and would still like to sign him, while the summer has been spent fending off rumours of a £9million move to Steve McClaren's German side Wolfsburg.</p>
              <p>Babel, 23, said: "I have been through a difficult time at Liverpool but I look upon this year as a new chapter.</p>
              <p>"I am trying to be positive and look forward. I have two years left on my contract and I love Liverpool. I am settled here. If I had the feeling I had done everything I can here then, maybe, I would look at something else.</p>
              <p>"But I don't have that feeling at all. I feel I can be important for Liverpool."</p>
              <p>And Babel insisted the Wolfsburg move never got beyond the rumour stage.</p>
              <p>He added: "I googled it and it said the deal was almost done! I knew nothing about it."</p>

              <p>Reds manager Roy Hodgson has said Benitez would be reneging on an agreement not to raid Anfield if he pursued Dutch forward Dirk Kuyt.</p>
              <p>But Benitez, speaking in Monaco ahead of tomorrow's UEFA Super Cup final between Inter and Atletico Madrid, ducked questions about any agreement.</p>
              <p>The Spaniard said: "I am the coach and I cannot sign players — that is for the technical director and the chairman.</p>
              <p>"I am fine like this — I can focus on my work on the pitch and that is all. I am the coach, not the manager."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Hodgson has denied any knowledge of Kuyt wanting to leave despite suggestions by his agent that talks between the Reds and Inter are continuing.</p>
              <p>He said: "Dirk has not expressed that sentiment to me."</p>
              <p>Hodgson insisted the assurances he had received from Inter president Massimo Moratti last week that the Italians were not intending to buy any Liverpool players still held firm.</p>
              <p>"When he left the club Rafael Benitez signed an agreement that he would not poach players from Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"We haven't received an offer from any club so this is something obviously going on behind the scenes, with the agent possibly talking to the manager of Inter Milan."</p>

              <p>Mascherano, who is desperate to quit Anfield, stunned boss Roy Hodgson by refusing to play in the 3-0 defeat at Manchester City on Monday.</p>
              <p>As a result, Hodgson has left the Argentina midfielder out of tonight's Europa League clash with Trabzonspor.</p>
              <p>And Messi believes Liverpool now have no choice but to let Barca talk to his fellow countryman.</p>
              <p>The Barca star said: "Javier won't play for the club again, I can assure you of that, and I think the Liverpool coach knows that now.</p>
              <p>"Javier's family are unhappy and the pressure of seeing that is making him depressed.</p>
              <p>"Liverpool must act humanely and let him go."</p>
              <p>As revealed by SunSport, Mascherano is also wanted by Inter Milan. The Italian giants have made an official bid for the player.</p>
