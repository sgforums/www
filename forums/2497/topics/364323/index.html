              *Benitez wins scrap for Glen*
              .
              .
              
              *LIVERPOOL have won the race to land Portsmouth's Â£19million full-back Glen Johnson. The England defender is expected to have a medical on Merseyside tomorrow - unless Chelsea or Manchester City can gazump the Kop at the last minute.*
              
              Johnson, 24, has opted for Anfield after emerging as one of the most sought-after men in the Premier League this summer. And his signing is a real coup for Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez, who feared the club's financial crisis would force him out of the bidding. 
              
              There is still the slight possibility Liverpool could be thwarted, with Chelsea determined to re-sign the man they sold to Pompey for just Â£4m two years ago. And City are willing to pay the Londoner Â£100,000 a week to move to Eastlands. 
              
              Johnson only signed a new four-year deal with Portsmouth in January but has made no secret of wanting a bigger stage.

              My first thought of this deal when I saw this was... What a waste of money by Rafa again...
              
              Â£19million for an error prone defender? This guy is like the kan chiong king, under pressure he is the kind who easily makes mistakes... 
              
              He has been at Portsmouth, so not much pressure on him... sometimes perform, sometimes don't perform also nvm, it gets overlook. But going to a bigger club and every match is a pressure match and shown on Tv... He will show his true form again when one minor mistakes gets played over and over and mentioned again and again...
              
              Not that he is totally bad lah, but $8m to $10m seems more reasonable... But Â£19million for this joker? Portsmouth must be kicking themselves silly in disbelieve...

              I don't think he himself belief City would let Richards go at only $5m... Maybe $10m might stand a better chance as he is only 20 yrs old and proven to be a strong defender already... Only recent form hasn't been great but, I belief he can get back to his previous form again and even improve from there by the time he reach 25 yrs old... 
              
              My opinion is, Richards will give you more value even at Â£19million than Johnson will ever be... The very least, he can play in 2 positions, right and centre... Johnson only right-back...

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think you should look at it that way, its still money that need to be return... Just because Portsmouth owe them $7m for Crouch doesn't mean they should readily forgo the payment by bidding excessively right?</div>

              *Liverpool set to sign Glen Johnson after Portsmouth agree Â£18.5m fee*
              .
              
              â€¢ Right-back expected to seal move within the next week
              â€¢ Chelsea withdrew from race to re-sign the England right-back
              .
              .
              
              *Liverpool expect to sign Glen Johnson within the next week after Portsmouth accepted their Â£18.5m bid for the England right-back and Chelsea withdrew from the race for their former employee. The deal will represent a significant breakthrough in the transfer market for Rafael BenÃ­tez, who was also informed today that Real Madrid's interest in Xabi Alonso has allegedly faded.*
              
              Johnson, along with David Silva and Gareth Barry, was a leading target for BenÃ­tez this summer and is clear to complete his move to Anfield after Liverpool matched Chelsea's offer for the 24-year-old last night.
              
              Though unable to compete financially with Chelsea and Manchester City, who also bid for Johnson, Liverpool are still owed Â£7m by Portsmouth from the deal that took Peter Crouch to Fratton Park last year. That will be written off as part of the Johnson fee, with Andrea Dossena and possibly Alvaro Arbeloa being sold by Liverpool to swell BenÃ­tez's budget beyond a net Â£20m.
              
              The England international considered a straight choice between Liverpool and Chelsea after electing against a move to City due to their lack of Champions League football.
              
              Johnson had indicated to Anfield officials that he favoured a move to Merseyside and that decision became simpler yesterday when Chelsea opted against re-signing the player they sold for Â£4m in 2007. It is believed problems selling JosÃ© Bosingwa may have forced Chelsea's sudden retreat, with the Stamford Bridge club unwilling to add another expensive right-back to their squad without off-loading the Â£16.2m Portugal international.
              
              Johnson's anticipated arrival at Anfield will be a major relief to BenÃ­tez following Barry's move to City and the possible repercussions for Alonso, a long-time target for the new Real Madrid president, Florentino PÃ©rez, and a player who remains disillusioned with his relationship with the Liverpool manager. The Anfield club have repeatedly insisted that Alonso is not for sale and, in the absence of any public declaration to the contrary from the player, Real's director-general Jorge Valdano has claimed defeat in attempts to lure the Spain international to the Bernabeu.
              
              His interview with Marca, however, may also be an attempt to force Liverpool to lower their asking price for Alonso and part of a protracted strategy to sign the 27-year-old.
              
              "Liverpool have issued an official statement to the public â€“ Xabi is a player who has little chance of joining Real Madrid," said Valdano. "We tried hard to sign him a few years ago. We had a meeting with Real Sociedad but, when I left (Madrid), they lost interest in him."
