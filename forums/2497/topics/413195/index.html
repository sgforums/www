              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Fandi Ahmad, has made up his mind.</strong></p>
              <p>He will move his family to Europe next year to give his sons Irfan, 13 and Ikhsan, 11, a chance to play professional football.</p>
              <p>Speaking exclusively to The New Paper, Fandi, 48, said: "I cannot think of myself anymore. My time has passed. I must now do everything in my power to help my sons realise their dreams.</p>
              <p>"Whether my boys make it or not, I don't know. But I have to give them the best chance to become professional footballers.</p>
              <p>And I can't do it in Singapore or Indonesia. I have to take them to Europe.</p>
              <p>"I will leave at the end of the year, to get everything set up for them. The boys will join me in March, once they complete their studies."</p>
              <p>The final European destination is still under discussion, although Fandi is now looking at Italy, where he could get a job as a sporting director.</p>
              <p>He also has looked at opportunities in England and Holland, though Italy has emerged as the top choice.</p>
              <p>Close friend and manager, R Sasikumar, is arranging for some Indonesian backers to buy a Serie B club.</p>
              <p>The deal, according to Sasikumar, is 80 to 90 per cent done. Once completed, Fandi will be appointed as sporting director.</p>
              <p>And he will bring his five children, and wife Wendy, to settle down in Rome.</p>
              <p>Said Fandi, who is currently coaching in Jakarta: "Trust me, this is not an easy decision for me to make. I am going to a new place and things will be very tough, I'm sure.</p>
              <p>"But I have to do this for my boys. I had my chance. This is theirs. I want to do everything in my power to help them succeed in life."</p>
              <p>So when did Fandi realise that he needed to let his boys chase the dream?</p>
              <p>"It was at the Arsenal Soccer Festival," said Fandi, speaking of the tournament held in June this year where both boys hit the headlines after being approached by scouts from Chelsea, Arsenal and Reading.</p>
              <p>Said Fandi, who became the first Singapore footballer to play in Europe when he signed for FC Groningen in 1983: "I knew they could play but at the festival, they were up against bigger boys and they showed that they could handle it.</p>
              <p>"Other coaches felt the same way too, and we were approached by quite a few clubs. I knew then that my boys had a chance. But it is up to me to make sure this is not wasted."</p>
              <p>Fandi's younger son, Ikhsan, was granted a trial with Chelsea. Both boys were also given trials at Arsenal and Irfan also got a trial at Reading.</p>
              <p>So what came of that?</p>
              <p>Explained Sasikumar: "The English clubs are interested. And if the boys had European passports now, we won't even be talking. They would already be there attached to one of the English clubs.</p>
              <p>"But it is not easy securing a work permit in England. That is why Italy may be our best bet. Fandi can get a job there and bring the family there.</p>
              <p>"They will go into the school system there and then try out for Italian clubs."</p>
              <p>Fandi knows that he is taking a gamble, and there is no sure thing in football.</p>
              <p>"Yes, we might go there, spend a lot of money and then nothing happens.</p>
              <p>But at least we would have given it a shot. I don't think I will be able to live with myself otherwise."</p>
              <p>But how talented are his sons? Are they better than their father at that age?</p>
              <p>"You can't say that yet lah," said Fandi with a laugh. "I was playing in the Under-18 team when I was 14. But I think they will improve as they grow bigger and stronger.</p>
              <p>"And they are going to have opportunities to improve that I never had. Given the chance to train with top teams in Europe, with better nutrition etc, I am sure they will become even better than me. At least, that's the plan."</p>
              <p>Of the two boys, the younger Ikhsan looked a standout, scoring seven goals in two matches at the Arsenal soccer festival.</p>
              <p>Said Sasikumar: "He is really something special. I first took him to a Milan soccer camp in June 2008, after watching him in Indonesia. He played so well, they invited him back for an Under-10 tournament in September the same year.</p>
              <p>"He scored eight goals in six matches in that tournament. Some of the scouts thought he was Brazilian.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Same problem</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"But the problem was the same. He had no European passport. No team is going to invest in him at that age without it being easy for them."</p>
              <p>Added Fandi: "Yes Ikhsan has it. That's clear. But Irfan works harder and can even play as goalkeeper like his grandfather (Ahmad Wartam) did for Singapore."</p>
              <p>And what about Singapore, Fandi?</p>
              <p>Are the boys going to play for Singapore? At this point in the interview, Fandi paused. It was clear that it was a difficult question that was eating into him.</p>
              <p>"Let me put it this way. Of course I would love for them to play for Singapore. They were born in Singapore and they should play for the Lions, like I did.</p>
              <p>"Unless I can't help it, they will play for Singapore. But I have to see how this European stint goes. I know that we will have to make a decision for the boys."</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Firstly, just to say, Fandi is a very nice person off the field and very humble and friendly... This alone, I hope he succeed in whatever he do. Secondly, he's a good soccer role model I think. Seems like a good father to me, who is willing to work hard to ensure his children gets to achive their goals. This is something not every parents will do for their kids. When I was young, I really wanted to stay at the Sentosa hotel but my parents wouldn't let me even if I begged. It would have meant something special to me, which I know it's silly but at less than $1k to achieve a simple goal, it's worth it. Now all grown up, even with $50k and staying in any hotel, it wouldn't beat how it feels if I get to stay there one time. Once something passed, it's hard or sometimes impossible to get it back.</p></div>

              <p>With proper training and fitness program, his sons could be the next asia pride if they take up Singapore citizenship of course, but i doubt they would since the plan is to play in Europe and 2 years of National Service at the critical period of time where player develops will no doubt severely disrupt the progress.</p>

              <p>national service is definitely an obstacle in proffessional football for youngsters, imagine they missed 2 years of training and playing at highest level, any tom dick harry can surpassed them no matter how talented our local players are.</p>
              <p>to me, fandhi is really a great father, letting his sons persue an alternate path, unlike most of our parents who chose what government wants us to be, in engineering , teaching, fiancial field etc. In my opinions, i felt that what fandhi did was already much more than FAS.i shall follow his footstep to send my boys overseas to play football.</p>
