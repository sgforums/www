              <p>Once you make exception on ns, where do you draw the line?</p>
              <p>Then there will be a growing list of parents who love their
              kids so much that they won't understand or accept the idea that why
              my son must serve and his no need? Afterall, it's only football to
              them and no big deal...</p>
              <p>Then the gov will have a hot potato on their hands they can't
              win. Cos no matter how you want to put it, there will be half the
              population who won't agree on it... So better to "let sleeping dogs
              lie"... Like this, no one will be too upset with anyone...
              lol.</p>

              <p><br>The real point is "a hot potato on their hands" and not how many can have such talent or just this 2 boys (who may not even make it even with special permission)...</p>
              <p>The question here is the larger picture... Why would the gov want to do something so controversial where it will only lead to a huge difference of opinion amongst the population?</p>
              <p>Even I as a football fan for years don't agree with such an arrangement so there is already a split here, imagine the hundreds of thousands who don't even follow football? Or the large number of women groups with sons coming of age to serve every year? They are not going to understand any explanation on why their sons have to be taken away from them to "suffer" while someone else sons to them, just kicking a ball around is deem more "special" to their sons... Imagine the unnecessary problem it will cause... and the votes is could cost?</p>
              <p>I understand they do make some kind of exceptions with academic talents but to say they get easy vocations is stretching it... The bond on them could easily last up to 6yrs and most of them can't wait to get out of it and earn better paid jobs in the private sector. But they have no choice as most accepted it in the first place because they couldn't afford their study fee abroad or even locally. Compare 6 yrs to 2 yrs... And also, they can be useful for some 30 over yrs after they come back, what can 2 retire footballers contribute to the country? Be a football coach to the national team?</p>
              <p>The bottomline is, even President scholars have to serve so what's the big deal about football? Sometimes, when you don't do anything, nobody will blame you... But if you try to be smart, you could lose half of the hearts... It's just as simple as that...</p>
              <p>Like I said, "let sleeping dogs lie"... Just my take on this...</p>
