Mourinho claimed Johnson had dived to win a penalty and Everton responded by saying they would make an official complaint to the Football Association. Everton released a joint statement with Johnson's agent on Monday on the issue and have also taken legal advice.<br><br>"First I would like to say I have the utmost respect for Everton Football Club, David Moyes and their players," he stated. "That's why I love to play them and especially at Goodison Park, where the atmosphere is magnificent.<br><br>"After seeing it again on the video, [referee] Mr Halsey did wonderful work and both decisions for penalties were correct. "Did Andy Johnson try to avoid a collision with my goalkeeper? It seems now the answer to that is yes, "Everton, his manager and he deserve my apologies," said Mourinho. Everton chief executive Keith Wyness added: "Common sense has prevailed and this is an end to the matter.<br><br></div>

Mourinho was furious after Newcastle ace Butt fouled Arjen Robben.<br><br>But Sky Sports pundit Ray Wilkins said: Â“ThatÂ’s bang out of order from Jose. "We have a pop at players when they do that and managers should not be doing it." The gesture sparked an exchange of words with Glenn Roeder, although the Toon boss later tried to play down the bust-up.<br><br>He said: Â“We were just exchanging pleasantries. I donÂ’t need to say what we were saying to each other.Â” But Roeder was furious with Foy, claiming the ref cost his side a place in the Carling Cup semi-finals.<br><br>Sub Didier Drogba scored a terrific winner following a 79th-minute free-kick after ButtÂ’s foul on Robben. Yet Newcastle insisted the kick was taken from the wrong place. Roeder said: Â“ItÂ’s the refereeÂ’s responsibility, when they give free-kicks, to make sure it is taken from where the incident happened.<br><br>Â“I questioned one or two of my players for not recognising that but Nobby Solano said heÂ’d asked the referee to move the ball back and heÂ’d refused. Â“Four yards makes a big difference when you are looking to open up an angle. Â“It was a fantastic strike. But if it was taken where it should have been taken, then I donÂ’t believe he would beat Shay Given from there.Â”<br><br>Earlier in the day, Johnson accepted MourinhoÂ’s grovelling apology and will not carry out his threat to sue. Everton striker AJ was seething after the Chelsea chief labelled him a diver following SundayÂ’s 3-2 win at Goodison.<br><br>But legal action was put on hold when Mourinho said Â‘SorryÂ’. His outrageous comments had brought a stinging attack from the England striker and his club. Johnson said: Â“I am pleased that Mr Mourinho has apologised for the comments he made. This is now the end of the matter. Â“Everton and myself can now concentrate on the games ahead.Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Card waver Mourinho to meet managers' leader</strong></span><br><br>John Barnwell, the chief executive of the League Managers Association, will remind Jose Mourinho that he should not be gesturing for players to be booked when he has a meeting with the Chelsea manager early next month. Mourinho gesticulated that Newcastle's Nicky Butt should have been awarded a yellow card at St James' Park on Wednesday night, three days after calling for Everton's Andrew Johnson to be booked during Chelsea's 3-2 victory at Goodison Park.<br><br>Barnwell does not believe Mourinho should be disciplined for his behaviour, although he admitted the Chelsea manager had overstepped the mark. "We are not calling for action to be taken," said Barnwell. "There will be private words behind the scenes, which I do normally if we dislike things. Waving [imaginary] yellow cards, whether it is flippant or aggressive, whether it's players or managers, is not acceptable. I will see Jose in a fortnight's time and no doubt we will talk about these minor issues.<br><br>"We deplore players waving [imaginary] yellow cards and through the managers and through the PFA [Professional Footballers' Association] I think we've had some effect [on players], and now you are seeing very much less of that on the pitch. If we get one manager [waving cards], no matter how flippant - and I think Jose's was a flippant one - then that is something that is not desirable. But Glenn Roeder handled it beautifully. He got straight to the heart of it, the two managers spoke and, in his words, the thing has been put to bed."<br><br></div>
