              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger cut a forlorn figure as the Arsenal boss conceded his side 
              lacked the maturity to win the title. </strong></p>
              <p>Danny Rose’s wonder 30-yard strike followed by a 47th-minute second from 
              Gareth Bale was too much for the Gunners despite a late consolation from Nicklas 
              Bendtner.</p>
              <p>And Wenger admitted his players were second best as Spurs clinched their 
              first league north London derby win in 11 years.</p>
              <p>Wenger said: ‘We lost a game we couldn’t afford to lose in the title race and 
              that shows we are not mature enough. If you want to win a championship you can’t 
              lose this type of game.</p>
              <p>‘A point tonight was not good enough. We wanted to win. We are six points 
              behind (Chelsea) and we’ll continue to fight, but this makes it very, very 
              difficult.</p>
              <p>‘As long as it’s not mathematically impossible, it’s not impossible.</p>
              <p>Our job is to fight and we will do that. All credit to Spurs — they defended 
              very well. If Tottenham want to fight for the Champions League they can show 
              they have the quality to do it (by beating Chelsea on Saturday).’</p>
              <p>For 19-year-old Rose, who was playing his first Barclays Premier League 
              match, it was a night he will never forget. His stunning left-foot strike had 
              Spurs boss Harry Redknapp drooling.</p>
              <p>Redknapp said: ‘It was an amazing goal for Danny. He’s a young kid and I gave 
              him a first chance tonight. He tweaked his ligament just before half-time so I 
              had to take him off, but he’s full of running and that was a wonder strike. He 
              will never forget that.’</p>
              <p>Even Wenger said: ‘Their first goal was one in a million. It gave them 
              confidence and gave them the start to then defend very well.’</p>
              <p>The win keeps Tottenham in the hunt for fourth place, one point behind 
              Manchester City and the all-important Champions League spot.</p>

              <p><strong>Redknapp added: ‘We are still in there. It’s going to be hard but we are 
              still in there. We have a very difficult run-in, starting against Chelsea, but 
              we are still on track and we have got a big chance.’</strong></p>
              <p>For Spurs, it was the perfect response to Sunday’s 2-0 FA Cup semi-final 
              defeat by Portsmouth. Redknapp said: ‘I thought it was a really good London derby, competitive and 
              played in a great spirit.</p>
              <p>‘We worked very hard and lifted ourselves after a very difficult day on 
              Sunday. To come out and turn in a performance like that was great.’</p>
              <p>Tottenham captain Ledley King added: ‘It was a massive game, coming off such 
              a disappointing result in the Cup.</p>

              <p><strong>‘It was a good time to play Arsenal. We didn’t have a time to dwell on the 
              Cup — we had to make sure we were right for this.We’ve seen the table. It’s a 
              big, big result for us. We feel like we can beat anybody — now we have to do 
              that against Chelsea.</strong></p>
              <p>‘We have quality in the squad so, if we perform like that, why can’t we (get 
              fourth place)?’</p>
              <p>Robin van Persie, playing his first match for five months after rupturing his 
              ankle ligaments on international duty with Holland, came on after 67 
              minutes.</p>
              <p>The striker tested Tottenham goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes with a left-foot 
              volley after 80 minutes and came desperately close to beating the Brazilian 
              three minutes later with a curling left-foot free kick.</p>
              <p>Wenger said: ‘Van Persie looked sharp and dangerous when he came on and he 
              transformed our game because, apart from that, we were not efficient up 
              front.’</p>
              <p>Only a string of saves from Gomes late on prevented Arsenal from scoring an 
              equaliser.</p>
              <p>King said: ‘He’s one of the best in the world at the moment. Time and time 
              again he’s there for us.’</p>
              <p>Gomes added: ‘We now have a chance (to get fourth place).’</p>

              </p><p class="article"><strong>Danny Rose, on his league debut, put a great big thorn in the 
              side of Arsenal's title hopes with a stunning 30-yard volley which set Spurs on 
              the road to a famous victory. </strong></p>
              <p class="article">But it was Heurelho Gomes who came up smelling of roses at the 
              end with a string of brilliant saves - three of them denying Arsenal supersub 
              Robin van Persie.</p>
              <p class="article">In doing so, Gomes ensured Spurs registered a first league win 
              against the Gunners in 21 attempts stretching back to 1999 - and maintained 
              their challenge for the fourth Champions League qualifying spot.</p>
              <p class="article">There was a time when Gomes was the laughing stock of the 
              Premier League as he flapped around his penalty area and was tipped for the axe 
              as soon as manager Harry Redknapp took over.</p>
              <p class="article">Neither Redknapp, nor the Spurs fans who cheered Gomes off the 
              field last night, could ever have imagined the Brazilian would become a cult 
              hero.</p>

              <p>I saw the first spurs goal... it was like AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!</p>
              <p>Then I knew arsenal would probably lose, so i went to sleep... and yes indeed they did lose.</p>
              <p>Firstly, arsenal's "spine" is damn weak. Almunia, Silvestre and Denilson??? That is the weakest combination we can get.</p>
              <p>When i saw vermaelen hopped off and silvestre to replace him, thats it already. Even though sol campbell was on fire, and did great, but with silvestre anything can happen.</p>
              <p>Denilson is the worst player in the first half, drawing unneccessary fouls, mis passing the balls, ball watching, he simply sucks to the max!!!!</p>
              <p>Arsenal would never win the title this season. Maybe next season they will be a force, but they need better defenders than silvestre, and younger faster ones too. In defensive midfield, buy another dfn mid, other than song. Stop relying on skinny ones like denilson (not everyone is a flamini). We need a tough one in the middle of the park.</p>
