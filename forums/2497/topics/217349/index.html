            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>United look to end fine Bolton home record</strong></span><br><br>MANCHESTER, England, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Premier League leaders Manchester United are gearing up for a major test of their title credentials at near neighbours Bolton Wanderers on Saturday.<br><br>Bolton are unbeaten at home but United manager Alex Ferguson is looking to end that record and extend an impressive start to the season which has raised hopes of a first championship win since 2003.<br><br>"Bolton have not lost a goal at home, which is a fantastic record and only reflects the job that Sam (Allardyce) continually does there," Ferguson said on Friday.<br><br>"It won't be easy, but we are playing well and I am happy with the consistency and the form," he told reporters.<br><br>"It's going to be consistency we need if we are going to really challenge for the league and have a real go.<br><br>"You always know it's going to be a hard game. We are prepared for a hard game and you have to perform in hard games.<br><br>"We are not expecting it to be easy, but hopefully we can keep our run going," he added.<br><br>Bolton's direct approach has come in for criticism from rival managers in the past, with Arsenal notably struggling to come to terms with their tactics when they go to the Reebok Stadium.<br><br>However, United are yet to lose at Bolton in the Premier League and Ferguson has never found fault with the way Allardyce's side has played.<br><br>"I think if there has been criticism (from anyone) it's simply because he has beaten them," Ferguson said.<br><br>"Nobody likes to lose and therefore you maybe find reason to think the way they play is unfair. It's a silly argument and I don't understand it.<br><br>"Everybody has got their own way, but I couldn't possibly think that any Bolton fan would be disappointed with how their fortunes have changed over the last few years and that's who Sam will be most interested in."<br><br>Bolton, who are third in the table, remain an aerial threat from set pieces.<br><br>But Ferguson believes they have altered their style of play to accommodate players like summer signing Nicolas Anelka, who the United manager admitted had interested him at times during his much-travelled career.<br><br>United have a virtually fully fit squad to choose from with Cristiano Ronaldo and John O'Shea being added to the players who beat Liverpool last Sunday to maintain top spot from Chelsea on goal difference.<br></div>
