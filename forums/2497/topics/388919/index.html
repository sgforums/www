              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger has accused English football and sections of the media of a conspiracy against </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Arsenal </strong></span></a><strong>and applying double standards. Wenger is fuming at the criticism aimed at William Gallas after his damaging tackle on </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/bolton-wanderers.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Bolton's</strong></span></a><strong> Mark Davies on Wednesday.</strong></p>
              <p>He attacked the readiness of so many to condemn his player while accepting <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/stoke-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Stoke's</span></a> right to kick the Gunners out of their stride in Sunday's FA Cup fourth-round tie.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">'I am always absolutely amazed that people get away with that,' snapped absolutely all right. When people say before a game they will kick you, that shows intent.</p>
              </div>
              <p>'The most important thing is that players like Cesc Fabregas are protected. You do not come to watch the players who kick him. You come to watch players like him play football. We must never forget that.'</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Wenger has been stung by comments since the 4-2 win against Bolton, when referee Alan Wiley failed to spot the bad foul by Gallas on Davies in the build-up to Arsenal's second goal.</strong></p>
              <p>Bolton manager Owen Coyle branded it 'an assault' in the heat of the moment but back-tracked yesterday and confessed his post-match comments were 'a bit strong'.</p>
              <p>Wenger also hit out at <span style="font-style: italic;">Sky</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> Sports News</span> for showing regular re-runs of the Gallas tackle while ignoring incidents like one when Matt Taylor stepped on Fabregas and pulled his hair when the teams met at The Reebok three days earlier.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS">
              <p class="imageCaption">'We are all brainwashed by one or two main medias who decide what we have to talk about,' said Wenger.</p>
              </div>
              <p>'Some incidents they have not picked are sometimes more important. 'I had no issue with the tackle, I think it was accidental. I think there was a bit of an overreaction with the way it was treated. I cannot say all the tackles we got in the last two games were completely accidental.</p>
              <p>'Ask anywhere in the world if Arsenal play fair football and you will get the same answer in every single country. Look at the fair play league and Arsenal are top (second, actually).'</p>
              <p>Asked if he thought Bolton's tackling had been malicious, the Arsenal boss replied: 'Of course. On Fabregas alone you had four clear penalties in two games. At Bolton, they pulled his hair and stood on his neck.'</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>The media is clever mah, they must write about someone or a club that is controversial and easy to stir up emotions. And Wenger is right in a way, players like Gallas involved in such incidents will always stirred up interests amongst the readers. LIke you realised, any news that seems slightly controversial but is linked to Man U, Liverpool and Arsenal seems to attract alot of excessive reporting. Somehow I felt, Chelsea seems to be the least affected amongst these tradtional big 4 clubs.</p></div>
