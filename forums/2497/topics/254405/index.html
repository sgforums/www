We are a rich club, so why should we sell players?<br><br>"The other problem could be if players want to leave but they don't want to leave and they are all happy.<br><br>"Dimitar is happy. Maybe I spoke to him a bit more lately to tell him how popular he is, but maybe I don't have to tell him.<br><br>"He knows, he's a sensitive guy and loves it over here so I see no reason for him to think differently."<br><br>Tottenham have had to play 19 more games this season than last, including three in the last week of the campaign as they secured Uefa Cup qualification.<br><br>Jol admits it was a struggle at times against Manchester City, but paid tribute to his side for battling until the end.<br><br>"It was not easy because we were the only team to play three games in the final week," he said.<br><br>"It showed in the second half but the players showed a lot of resilience and character. We had a few heroes out there." </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for me, I just felt that there are too much smoke and fire on this until I believe Berbatov is going to leave...<br><br><a href="http://www.tribalfootball.com/article.php?id=39695" rel="nofollow">http://www.tribalfootball.com/article.php?id=39695</a><br><br>Spurs keeper Robinson urges Berbatov to stay<br>tribalfooball.com - May 16, 2007<br><br>Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson is urging teammate Dimitar Berbatov to resist a big club move away this summer.<br><br>"We finished the best of the rest and it's up to teams like ourselves, Everton and Bolton who are finishing fifth, sixth and seventh consistently to break into the top four and break the mould," said Robinson on Sky Sports News.<br><br>"I don't think we're far off. We've got to keep hold of the players we've got. There is a lot of speculation about one of our players, it's important to keep him and make a couple more additions.<br><br>"Then I don't think we will be far off from breaking in."<br><br>Robinson played a crucial role in Spurs finishing fifth and reaching the latter stages of three cup competitions, but the impact of Berbatov meant the Â£10.9million signing from Bayer Leverkusen took centre stage.<br><br>"He's very special. He's naturally gifted, a natural goalscorer and a high-quality player," added Robinson.</div>
