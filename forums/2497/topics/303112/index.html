            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/01_03/084capello_468x391.jpg"><br><br><strong>Fabio Capello will make John Terry sweat on his future as England captain and he has also refused to confirm whether David Beckham will ever earn his 100th international cap. The England manager has ruled out a private meeting with Beckham prior to next month's friendly against Switzerland, insisting that all players will be treated as equal and judged on merit.</strong><br><br>Terry will miss the game due to injury and while sources close to the Chelsea defender remain confident he will continue as captain when he returns, Capello declined the opportunity to confirm as much after Monday's World Cup fixtures meeting here.<br><br>'The captaincy is a very important decision,' said Capello, who chose to speak through an interpreter even though his English is much improved. 'And the captaincy issue is a very important one for England. There are many things I have to evaluate and I must come up with the choice that is right and important. A captain must be a leader, someone who carries the team, somebody who in every moment is important for the team. 'I'm evaluating whether to decide for a definitive captain or to appoint a provisional captain (for Switzerland). I have first to know the candidates well because it's such an important decision. But please don't take this as indecision. I want to get to know the players well.'<br><br>Capello again stressed the importance he places in player discipline and headlines that have not reflected well on Terry may well have registered with the Italian. 'I believe players must set an example, in particular for the young, when they are part of an important group like the England team,' he said. Beckham's off-the-field conduct has rarely been in question but the former England captain will worry that his coach at Real Madrid has no intention of meeting him before next month's friendly. Not least because both he and his advisers thought Capello would see him on a visit to Arsenal's training ground, which the FA regularly hire and where Beckham is staying fit during the MLS close season.<br><br>Capello, however, said he had no intention of arranging such an encounter. 'I am accustomed to meeting managers,' he said. 'But I will speak to the players when we get together. Of course, there are exceptions. I may speak to players who are injured. 'But I have not met Beckham. My first week was taken up by meetings and English lessons. Beckham is important for England and can still give a lot but, as everybody knows, all the players are equally important to me. I consider them all on the same level. A manager has feelings but, first and foremost, he has to take decisions.'<br><br>After little more than a week in the job, England's referees rather than the players under his consideration appear to have made the biggest impression. He wishes to pay them a compliment, though, rather than join many of his contemporaries in criticising them. 'The first thing I noticed were the referees,' he said, 'because they whistle so little compared to those in the rest of Europe. I also noticed the total movement of the team which escapes you when you watch English football on TV. 'That is something that has impressed me in matches I've seen. I know all the players but I want to see them in action. One or two matches is not enough.'<br><br></div>

'We wanted certain matches to be played in September and June, and I believe we got the best we could,' said Capello. 'English players are at the top of their condition in September and the match with Croatia is important and possibly decisive.' </strong><br><br>Capello did not want to end the qualifying campaign with Croatia Â— and again he got his wish. They will travel to Wembley in September 2009. Belarus will be the final match. More surprising, perhaps, was a desire to go to Kazakhstan in June 2009, when it could be very hot. The FA insisted it would be a night-time kick-off and said it remained preferable to travelling there during what can be the extremely cold winter months.<br><br>He is not rushing to any conclusions on the challenge ahead. 'I have seen things which go beyond my expectations but also things that left me perplexed,' he said. 'The team I want is in my head, taking into account what I have seen so far, and the games of England I've watched. But to have an idea of what I can achieve, I first need to know the players well Â— not only their characteristics with the ball, but their tactical sense on and off the ball.<br><br>'The five friendlies I have between now and September will help me to evaluate what team and what style of play to go for, hoping there are no injuries. But there are two main things I want from the five friendlies. 'First, to try to create a team and second, to try to discover players who can be integrated into the group, finding new players. 'Already I realise that the England team is something different. Everything has made a big impression on me. I was accustomed to the great pressure that comes with Real Madrid but Madrid are a club Â— this is a whole nation. 'I did not expect that the England newspapers would follow football with such interest.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>FABIO CAPELLO'S first dilemma as England boss will be to choose the next Three Lions captain.</strong><br><br>Chelsea skipper John Terry currently wears the armband but Capello is yet to decide whether he will continue in the role.<br><br>Ex-captain David Beckham is likely to lead the team for the friendly with Switzerland on February 6 when he will who his 100th cap.<br><br>But who should be given the honour after the match?<br><br><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00419/beckham1_120x95_419351a.jpg"><br><br><strong>David Beckham</strong><br><br>Age 32, caps 99, goals 17<br><br><strong>THE</strong> ex-England captain is the bookies' favourite to be given the armband for next month's friendly with Switzerland, when he should earn an emotional 100th cap. Beckham was sensationally dumped as skipper when Steve McClaren took over as manager in August 2006. But he eventually forced his way back into the team after a return to form for Real Madrid. Capello was his manager at the Spanish giants and the Italian was impressed by the way Becks battled for his place with both club and country.<br><br><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00419/terry1_120x95_419356a.jpg"><br><br><strong>John Terry</strong><br><br>Age 27, caps 42, goals 4<br><br><strong>THE CURRENT</strong> Three Lions and Chelsea skipper is expected to regain the captaincy after the Switzerland friendly. Terry took over the role from Beckham in September 2006 after a close-run contest with Liverpool's Steven Gerrard. Despite England's nightmare Euro 2008 qualifying campaign, JT remains a favourite with the Three Lions faithful. His hardman image and no-nonsense approach at the heart of the national team's defence is inspirational.<br><br><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00419/neville_120x95_419358a.jpg"><br><br><strong>Gary Neville</strong><br><br>Age 32, caps 85, goals 0<br><br><strong>MANCHESTER UNITED</strong> skipper with a wealth of experience after making his England debut back in 1995. Neville has spent 10 months on the sidelines after suffering a serious ankle injury in March last year. But he is well on the road to recovery and is expected to return to United's starting XI in the next few weeks. Age could be against his selection as Three Lions captain as he will be 35 when the next World Cup takes place in South Africa in 2010.<br><br><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00419/gerrard1_120x95_419360a.jpg"><br><br><strong>Steven Gerrard</strong><br><br>Age 27, caps 63, goals 12<br><br><strong>THE</strong> Liverpool skipper lost out to current captain Terry for the armband under McClaren. Gerrard has been vice-captain for the past 18 months and has often led the team in Terry's absence. The midfielder has been one of England's most consistent performers since making his Three Lions debut against Ukraine in 2000 and his experience of leading the Reds to two Champions League finals is invaluable. The long-term uncertainty about whether Gerrard and Frank Lampard can play together could be an issue in his selection.<br><br><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00419/lampard1_120x95_419361a.jpg"><br><br><strong>Frank Lampard</strong><br><br>Age 29, caps 60, goals 14<br><br><strong>THE</strong> Chelsea star was a target for the boo-boys during England's disastrous Euro 2008 qualifying campaign. But he has been a regular starter for the Three Lions and that may not change under Capello. Vice-captain to Terry at Stamford Bridge and has plenty of experience when it comes to leading the Blues. Lampard has struggled to repeat his fantastic goalscoring record with England and is an outsider for the skipper's role.<br><br></div>

Ferdinand's partnership with Terry is seen as one of the best in world football and he is likely to play a key role under Capello. Ferdinand has led United in the past, although he has been accused of losing concentration during matches. But that is the only thing which could go against him if he is considered for the captain's armband.<br><br><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00419/owen2_120x95_419365a.jpg"><br><br><strong>Michael Owen</strong><br><br>Age 28, caps 88, goals 40<br><br><strong>A LIVING</strong> legend for England and well on his way to breaking Sir Bobby Charlton's record of 49 goals for his country. Owen, still only 28, has scored 40 goals in 88 appearances for the Three Lions. Injuries have hampered his career at club level but he is an automatic choice when fit. The Newcastle striker has skippered the Three Lions before when he was Beckham's vice-captain.<br><br><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00419/rooney1_120x95_419366a.jpg"><br><br><strong>Wayne Rooney</strong><br><br>Age 22, caps 40, goals 14<br><br><strong>THE Manchester United</strong> ace would be an outside bet for the captain's armband. Rooney became England's youngest ever player when he made his debut back in February 2003 aged just 17 and he has been a fans' favourite ever since. His passion and work rate have always been applauded by the England faithful, although he did struggle to control his temper during the early days of his career. Rooney has been tipped as a future United captain after leading the Red Devils already this season. But it could be a bit soon for him to land the England role.</div>
