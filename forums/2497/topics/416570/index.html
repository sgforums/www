              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">SPURS are lining up a sensational swoop for Emmanuel Adebayor.</h2>
              <p>The North Londoners want the unsettled Manchester City striker on loan in the January transfer window.</p>
              <p>They also fancy an option to buy him at the end of the season. And while the sides are bitter rivals for a top-four Premier League spot, City have not ruled out a deal.</p>
              <p>A Tottenham insider said: "There is a real chance we could land Manu in the transfer window - although a lot does depend on who pays his wages.</p>
              <p>"City expect us to pay the bulk but the big question is how far our board are prepared to go."</p>
              <p>Former Arsenal striker Adebayor, 26, earns £160,000 a week - double what anyone else is on at White Hart Lane.</p>
              <p>Last year he hit 14 goals but this term has played only eight Premier League games and four of his five goals have been in the Europa League.</p>
              <p>And there have been reports of dressing room bust-ups with City boss Roberto Mancini, with the centre-forward unable to command a regular start.</p>

              <p><strong>Emmanuel Adebayor is ready to go to war with Manchester City to force a loan move to Tottenham in January.</strong></p>
              <p>Former Gunners striker Adebayor is desperate to go to Spurs, even though he knows it would make him even more of a hate figure among Arsenal fans than he already is.</p>
              <p>Spurs boss Harry Redknapp, who already caused a furore by signing former Arsenal captain William Gallas, is keen on Adebayor and even wants City to pay half of his £120,000-a-week wages so he fits into the wage structure.</p>
              <p>Adebayor, 26, has had a succession of bust-ups with City boss Roberto Mancini and they are now ready to let him go out on loan in January.</p>
              <p></p>
              <div class="news_mpu_article"></div>
              <p>City have drawn up a hit-list of players they are ready to do business on in January and Adebayor is at the top along with the likes of Roque Santa Cruz and Shaun Wright-Phillips.</p>
              <p>Big-spending City have been reluctant to sell to any of their top four rivals and refused to let Craig Bellamy go to Tottenham last summer.</p>
              <p>Liverpool have been sounded out as City would far rather Adebayor goes to Anfield but it is believed they are so keen to offload him they are seriously considering doing a deal with Tottenham.</p>
              <p>There has also been interest from Juventus but Adebayor is keen to stay in England even if it means becoming public enemy number one at Arsenal.</p>
              <p>Adebayor has had a string of rows with Mancini and now the City boss regards him as a troublesome figure. Adebayor will use that as a weapon if he needs to force his way out in January because he is desperate to get more regular games.</p>
              <p>But Adebayor must still overcome the huge obstacle of persuading City not only to let him go to Tottenham but to also to get them to pay half his wages to help a rival club potentially finish above them.</p>
              <p>Redknapp believes Adebayor could help Tottenham make a push for the title and, having won over the fans on Gallas, believes the ex-Arsenal striker would be accepted at White Hart Lane.</p>
              <p>Aston Villa are keen on England winger Wright-Phillips who may be allowed to go in January after talks over a new contract stalled.</p>
              <p>Paraguay striker Santa Cruz, 29, is desperate to quit and AC Milan have expressed an interest but City would have to take a huge loss on the £18m paid for him in June 2009.</p>
              <p>Milan believe they may be able to get him for around £7m while there has also been interest from Lazio, Blackburn and Espanyol.</p>
              <p>Shay Given is also unsettled at City but they do not want to let him leave, even though Fulham and Manchester United are watching developments.</p>
              <p>There is also interest in Pablo Zabaleta from AC Milan, while Jo and Michael Johnson may also be allowed to go.</p>
