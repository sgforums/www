            <div class='col-md body'><strong>David Bentley has admitted he has been left upset by Stuart Pearce's stinging criticism of him for pulling out of the England Under-21 squad.</strong><br><br><img src="http://images.skysports.com/images/playerpics06_07/Premiership/Blackburn/bentley-david_englandcheer.jpg"><br><br>Blackburn ace Bentley dropped out of the squad for the European Championship finals last week because of fatigue.<br><br>Bentley made the decision to miss the tournament in Holland as he does not want to suffer burn-out and he wants to be fresh for next season as he looks to break into Steve McClaren's plans for the senior England team.<br><br>The decision infuriated Under 21 boss Pearce with the former Manchester City chief questioning Bentley's desire to play for his country.<br><br>Bentley is upset at Pearce's accusation and says he is patriotic to his country.<br><br>"I personally rang up Stuart Pearce last Thursday to have a conversation with him man-to-man and tell him why I had taken the decision," Bentley told The Mirror.<br><br>"Now it seems that I'm being punished for my honesty.<br><br>"What Stuart Pearce said was so harsh. I was disappointed to hear him say that. The FA knew as soon as the Under 21 squad was announced that there was a problem.<br><br>"I realise that as a manager he has to be strong and also that he was disappointed. But I'm the most patriotic person you could ever wish to meet - every bit as much as Stuart Pearce.<br><br>"To be called up for the senior squad against Brazil and Estonia meant everything to me and I worked all season for that.<br><br>"I have played nine times for England for the Under 21s and the B team. If you go back and watch those games, you will see that I have always given everything, absolutely everything, because I am always so proud to play for my country."<br><br>Bentley's decision to miss Under 21 duty has raised doubts about his future England prospects, but the former Arsenal youngster feels it would be unfair if the incident comes back to haunt him.<br><br>"If this decision affects my England career, so be it. I don't think it should," added Bentley.<br><br>"I'm going to have a proper break, get over this and get myself right."</div>

The Under-21 manager does not think he will pick Bentley if he gets the opportunity in the future after the Blackburn wingerÂ’s last minute refusal to join the squad left England one man short for the European Championships which begin today in Holland. </strong><br><br>Bentley pulled out on Thursday night despite being urged by senior England manager Steve McClaren to go. The last player to snub his country, Chris Sutton, never played for England again after refusing to turn out in a B international. Bentley claimed senior England players had warned him he would damage his chances of making the senior squad for Euro 2008 if he tired himself out by playing in the summer.<br><br>Bentley said: "It wasnÂ’t a rash decision, I asked senior players at England Â“what do you feel like, come October or November?Â” and they said Â“you hit a brick wallÂ”."<br><br>Pearce, whose team start their campaign tomorrow against the Czech Republic, said: "If any decisions need to be made in respect of his future, the Football Association probably need to make those decisions. "Would I pick him again? ThatÂ’s a difficult one. ItÂ’s how itÂ’s perceived within the team group."<br><br></div>
