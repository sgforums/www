              <p><strong>Andrei Arshavin’s agent has revealed the Euro 2008 star has had more
              than five offers for his signature, amid reports that Manchester United
              have entered the race.</strong></p>
              <p>Arshavin has been outstanding for Russia in their thrilling run to
              the semi-finals, scoring against Sweden and Holland in two
              man-of-the-match performances.</p>
              <p>Barcelona are the playmaker’s ‘dream’ club, but Arsenal’s interest
              is well-known, while United are also said to be preparing a bid.</p>
              <p>Arshavin’s agent would not go into specifics, but he believes the
              eventual winners for his client’s signature will have to pay €20
              million (£16 million).</p>
              <p>“Given the team’s (Russia’s) performance, I think the transfer value
              has grown for Arshavin, Yuri Zhirkov and Igor Akinfeev - three players
              who may leave to play abroad,” said Alexei Safonov to Business FM.</p>
              <p>“Zenit have received more than five proposals from England and
              France, but Arshavin wants to go to Spain – football that is suited for
              him.</p>
              <p>“His transfer price is about €20 million. Zhirkov’s is close to that
              amount. Zhirkov could play in England and in Germany and Italy. "</p>

              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger believes Russian magician Andrei Arshavin will go to England or Italy - and not Spain as the player himself prefers.</strong></p>
              <p>The Russian midfielder has proved an electrifying presence at the Euro 2008 finals as his unfancied team have made it to the semis against Spain.</p>
              <p>His impressive performances against Sweden and Holland have come after the player inspired Zenit St Petersburg to their Uefa Cup triumph over Rangers in Manchester.</p>
              <p>Such fantastic play has led the midfield dynamo to become one of the hottest properties in world football.</p>
              <p>Arshavin himself has spoken of how joining Barcelona - who he has supported all his life - would be a 'dream'.</p>
              <p>But the canny Wenger - who has proved himself a great judge in the transfer market - believes the Russian will be bound for the Premier League or Serie A.</p>
              <p><span>He said: "What is quite amazing is that Russia is the only country where a player like Arshavin suddenly comes to the world's attention at the age of 27. That is not possible anywhere else.</span></p>
              <p> "I wish I'd seem him at 21 or 22. I predict he will come to the Premier League, or go to a big club in Italy. The way he plays is something very special."</p>
              <p>He added: "He could be tempted by wanting to play in the best league, of course. And it could happen. Would you be surprised? If you ask me do I think he will be in the Premier League? I would say yes because that's a prediction."</p>
              <p>But Wenger admitted he does not know the situation at Zenit, or whether the player wishes to stay with the Russian side.</p>
              <p>"Maybe he'll want to stay because they play in the Champions League."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is hoping to lure Andrei Arshavin to the Premier League despite the Russia star setting his heart on a move to Barcelona.</strong></p>
              <p>Arshavin has attracted the attention of Europe's leading clubs after shining at Euro 2008 and admitted this week it is his 'dream' to play for the Catalan giants.</p>
              <p>The 27-year-old is refusing to discuss his future until Russia's European Championship campaign is over but Zenit St Petersburg are already braced for his departure.</p>
              <p>And Wenger reckons the English game would be ideal for Arshavin. 'He could be tempted by wanting to play in the best league, of course. And it could happen,' the Frenchman told The Sun. 'Would you be surprised if it did?  If you ask me if I think he will be in the Premier League, I would say yes because that's a prediction.'</p>
              <p>However, Arshavin said: 'I have supported Barcelona all my life.  Barcelona are my dream. I never thought I would have a genuine chance to play for the club. Let's see how the situation unfolds.  'For now I can't say anything for sure. At the moment I'm a player of team Russia and I'm only thinking about doing well in the semi-finals.'  </p>

              <p>actually, I saw the interview by espn and the coach.</p>
              <p>his explanation is that given the low profile of russian league, players such as arshavin aren't spotted until they play in big internationals.</p>
              <p>do note his team did win the UEFA cup..</p>
