            <div class='col-md body'>John Terry has been fined Â£10,000 and reprimanded by The Football Association following a charge of improper conduct.<br><br>The Chelsea captain had been charged by The FA in relation to comments he made after the Premiership champions' defeat at Tottenham Hotspur on 5th November last year.<br><br>He was sent off in the second half of the 2-1 loss at White Hart Lane and later appeared to bring into question referee Graham Poll's integrity.<br><br>On Monday, Terry admitted the charge of improper conduct and his punishment was decided by The FA's disciplinary commission on Tuesday.<br><br>In handing out a Â£10,000 fine and reprimand for the England skipper, the commission suggested the defender's cause was not helped by the lack of an apology.<br><br>The commission stated that "whilst noting the late admission to the charge, and the excellent previous disciplinary record of John Terry, [we] were extremely disappointed that the integrity of referee Graham Poll had been called into question, and that no public apology had been forthcoming for his admitted improper conduct."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>$10,000 only...  Mourinho fine his own player even more than the FA... So what is $10,000 to Terry, one roll at roulette or 4 days pay only... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p143/zococl/diarra.jpg"><br><br><strong>JOSE MOURINHO is to fine Lassana Diarra Â£60,000 for defying his authority.</strong><br><br>The Chelsea boss got tough on his midfielder after three breaches of club discipline in two weeks. The midfielder, 21, first argued with Mourinho after being denied permission to join Paris St Germain on loan.<br><br>In protest, Diarra turned up 40 minutes late for the team-meeting ahead of the FA Cup third round match with Macclesfield on Saturday.<br><br>Diarra had been told he would start that match 48 hours earlier, his first start of the season, and his decision to arrive in a suit rather than the regulation leisure gear was viewed as another blatant act of defiance.<br><br>Frank Lampard was forced to play even though Mourinho had planned to rest the England man. SunSport understands Diarra has since aggravated the situation by being absent from training on Monday without permission.<br><br>Now the club is to hit him with a massive fine of six weeksÂ’ wages. DiarraÂ’s actions are being seen as agitation in order to be allowed to leave the club. He is likely to be left out of tonightÂ’s Carling Cup squad.<br><br></div>
