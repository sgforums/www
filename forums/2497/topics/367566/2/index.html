              <p>Bayern Munich president Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has dismissed latest reports suggesting <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> are close to landing Franck Ribery.</p>
              <p>He told <em>Sport1</em>: "The media should be very grateful as there has been no better subject than Franck Ribery and Bayern this summer.</p>
              <p>"Our opinion has not changed in respect to Ribery. I am completely
              relaxed and I can say that from the start we have always felt that he
              would stay.</p>
              <p>"I am optimistic that Franck will be with us for our first game of the season against Hoffenheim.</p>
              <p>"Bayern has the last word and our view is very firm and we are not going to speak about this every day."</p>

              <p class="article">"Right now we are just thinking of improving the fitness of the players, 
              not thinking about the transfer market. We have the quality there and we

              <p class="article">Benitez paid nearly £18million for Glen Johnson and has been fending off

              not expected to resume until early next week.</p>

              <p>The match, Bayern's first under new coach Louis van Gaal, could
              see Germany striker Mario Gomez make his first appearance in the

              <h1>Franck Ribery Pulls Out Early Of Bayern Munich Training Again</h1>

              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/49966_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="227"></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Not for the first time this summer, Franck Ribery had to leave Bayern Munich’s <span class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;"><span style="color: #0464d1;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #0464d1 ! important; font-family: Verdana,Arial; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">training</span></span></span> ahead of schedule because of injury.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">The Frenchman has already had to miss
              two previous sessions last week, the first of which stirred up a
              massive storm when he was accused of faking an injury to skip training
              with the squad to protest Bayern’s refusal to let him join Real Madrid.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">In yesterday’s programme, Ribery left
              the pitch just 60 minutes into the session due to a recurring problem
              in his left knee. However, there was no suspicion of malice this time
              as his team-mates and his club believe that the injury has now gotten
              quite serious, while neither the German nor Spanish press have
              speculated on any rebellious behaviour. </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">“Everything that he does is under close
              scrutiny now, be he would not have exaggerated anything,” Hamit
              Altintop was quoted as saying by <em>AS</em>.</span></p>
