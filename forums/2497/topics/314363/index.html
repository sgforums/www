              <p>I feel that these people opinions are useless and they try to say it as if they already know that which team is going to win because of what reasons.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yet, they are being paid of their job. Its a crazy world. So much for being expert. They are expert , but actually they cannot really tell who is really go to win a match because they are too many factors to is actually happening in a match.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They like to comment as if they know how to manage the team themselves and criticise players and managers.... with the use of theri pen</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a soccer fan, I feel that these people are getting salary too easily.</p>

              <p>Cant be helped much. There's got to be someone doing the commentings and analysts. And they are public characters...meaning whereever they go, they might get some hi or insults from pple they dont know.</p>
              <p>Anyway, they have to comment one day before the match and anything can happen within that one day too. Good tipsters always bet only a few hours before the match but never 1 day before. So you cant really expect much from analysis made a day ago.</p>

              <p>Truth is, even an expert collects info up to the time before kick off, he still dun noe how the match will really turn out. yah, what you say is true, there is some downside to them being public figure....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No football expert will say that actually admit that they cannot tell what is happening to the match and how the match will really turn out. "football expert" has to say something of reasonable logic so that he will convince at least half the group of readers or viewers, They has to write emotively enough by criticsing and praising so that it will rouse the spirits of supporters when they win or criticise a lose team or manager so that those who dislike the team can join in the laughing of their enemy team.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is the fact. Such formula makes newspaper sell. They dun really noe what is going on and how things will turn out. But they do know that they have to write and comment in a certain way that will hit the sales target andenable them to get their salary.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I mean, they do know roughly, who is likely to win or lose. They do have many experience and knowledge of technical aspects, but other than these things, there is nothing much they can offer readers about who will win the game and why they really win the game. The reasons are complex and many, and they really dun noe.</p>

              <p>well, their job is just to paint up the matches.</p>
              <p>Imagine, their so called experiences were back from the old-days where it is already totally irrevelant.</p>
              <p>anyway, I do prefer more local fans/players coming in cause I dont know why we can't have some local inputs from SG.</p>
              <p>to be fair, I think SteveMac do give generally good comments. At least he played @ the top level.</p>
