              for the planned crisis talks with Michael Ballack as Chelsea are
              preventing the injured midfielder from traveling.</h2>
              <p>Ballack and Löw had been trading barbs through the press in Germany,
              which was started by the ex Bayern suggesting that the Bundestrainer
              had been disrespectful in his treatment of both Torsten Frings and
              Kevin Kuranyi during the recent World Cup qualifiers.<br><br>A meeting
              was to be held in Germany imminently in order to calm the situation,
              but now things have got a little more complicated.<br><br>"He's a
              player for Chelsea. If Joachim Löw wants to talk with him, I invite the
              coach of the national team to come here and stay with us one or two
              days to talk with him but Ballack can't travel now," said Scolari.<br><br>"He's recovering and has treatment to undergo with the doctors. It's not well for Ballack or for Germany if he travels.<br><br>"But if Joachim wants to talk, it's my pleasure to invite him here to speak with Michael. To travel now is impossible."</p>

              <h1>Löw Wins Power Struggle- Ballack Apologises</h1>

              <h2>The power struggle between German national team trainer Joachim Löw
              and captain Michael Ballack seems to be at an end for now with the
              international midfielder issuing an apology for his recent criticism of
              the Bundestrainer.</h2>
              <p>Late last night Ballack released a statement via the sid news agency which read:  </p>
              <p><em>“I knew that I would receive criticism for my comments in the
              press, but I didn’t expect it to be this big.  Therefore I have to
              admit that it was a mistake to have chosen this path.  I will sit down
              with Joachim Löw as soon as my health permits and will apologise for my
              conduct.  Because one thing is clear, I’m only interested in the
              success of the team.”</em>  </p>
              <p>Ballack had earlier given an interview with the ‘Frankfurter
              Allgemeine Zeitung’ in which he seemingly criticised Löw and demanded
              more honesty and respect.  He was roundly criticised for doing so and
              it seemed that his role as German captain was up for discussion.  </p>
              <p>Bild has reported that Ballack telephone Löw personally last night
              to explain his actions.  “I phoned Jogi today and told him that it
              wasn’t my intention to criticise his work as Bundestrainer, but just to
              protect and support my fellow team mates.  I value Jogi Löw personally
              as a person and as a trainer” Ballack explained.  </p>
              <p>“My interview was to do with a situation, not a particular person. 
              I didn’t want to attack anyone personally, but just discuss things that
              are close to my heart as captain openly and critically.   </p>
              <p>“I chose to do it at this time point as we had just played well and
              won and in my opinion the trainer is in an untouchable position.  It
              would have been weak of me to have given the interview had we lost two
              games in a row” the Chelsea midfielder added.  </p>
              <p>The foreseen meeting between Ballack and Löw will however have to
              wait until Ballack has recovered from the foot operation he recently
              underwent. </p>
