              </div>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Cesc Fabregas is so desperate to leave Arsenal for Barcelona that he has offered to give up more than £4million worth of bonuses. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Just a week before the start of the new Premier League season, the 24-year-old Spaniard has told Arsenal he will waive the payments - believed to relate to loyalty bonuses on the remaining four years of his contract - in a last-ditch bid to force through a move. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Fabregas did not travel to Lisbon, where Arsenal were beaten 2-1 on Saturday night by Benfica. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said Fabregas had not been ‘ready to play’. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Wenger added: 'He’s not injured. He’s training normally but hasn’t played since Bolton, which is two and a half months. The situation with Cesc is not sorted out but I don’t want to talk about it any more.' </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But the latest twist in the protracted saga of the Arsenal captain’s desire to return to the club he left at 16 amounts to an official transfer request.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The Arsenal Supporters’ Trust drew attention to the £4m clause in Fabregas’s contract last week and the player himself has now offered to give up his right to the money to make the deal easier for Arsenal to accept. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>It could prove decisive, although Fabregas will still have to see if Barcelona raise their latest offer of £32m plus £5m in additional payments, rejected by Arsenal last week.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Arsenal have insisted since the start of the summer that Barcelona will have to pay £40m for Fabregas and the Catalan club’s vice-president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, and director Raul Sanllehi left London on Friday still having failed to secure coach Pep Guardiola’s prime summer target.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The impasse over Fabregas threatens to jeopardise manager Arsene Wenger's transfer plans. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Arsenal cannot make a move for £20m Valencia target Juan Mata until they have secured a price for either Fabregas or Samir Nasri, who was also left out of the squad travelling to Portugal. </span></p>
              <p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Serious consideration has now been given to selling Nasri to Manchester City for £25m, which would provide the funds for a Mata bid if Barcelona do not come back with a better offer for Fabregas.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>According to reports in France, Wenger lost faith in Nasri after a poor performance against Boca Juniors in the Emirates Cup. But Wenger insisted: 'It’s nonsense. I don’t know where these stories come from.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>More worrying for Arsenal is the realisation they are making little progress in their recruitment of a much-needed centre-half. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Some close to the deal expect Everton and Arsenal to agree on a deal of around £15m for Phil Jagielka but the England player is not pushing for a move and Arsenal cannot be sure they will land their man. </span></p>

              <p>Pretty much that both has given up hope. </p>
              <p>If Nasri bothered to stay at OM, he would have won the 09'-10' league title.</p>

              <p>I feel that Nasri is about to become one of the best player in the Premier League very soon... Last season, the first half of it, he was amazing and easily the best player in it... Only the 2nd half of the season, he lost steam, lost his way... But I don't think anyone can put the blame on his lost of form in the second half of the season cos the whole Arsenal side just fall off like they normally do in te past few seasons already... So maybe at a different club, the motivation may be the difference...</p>
              <p>Who ever gets Nasri this year or next for free, is going to get a very good player... and also still very young...</p>

              <p>I dont get the Fabregas hype at all. Sure he's an excellent player on his day, but when the team is playing poorly he doesnt step up and make the difference like Ronaldo, Xavi etc. And besides, i think Wilshere will do just as well in his role.</p>
              <p>The real problem with Arsenal is their fucking defense. The last reliable goal keeper they had was David Seaman. That says a lot. I cant remember the number of times they've conceded on corner kicks. But Wenger still think that they can win with an S League defense.</p>

              <p>Barcelona definitely want him... Moreover, he is a Spanish and like in England where English players have an extra premium, the same goes for Spanish ones in Spain too as they have a foreign players number limit as well...</p>
              <p>Well, the guy is a good player no doubt, top assists for his club in the last two seasons now and he is still very young so can still get better... So Arsenal wanting $40m isn't too much cos he still have a good number of years ahead of him... But Barce coming with $23m offer, with add ons... what nonsense is this? If they want him so badly, pay the clubs asking price, why haggle until like this... If I was an arsenal fan it would make me very unhappy with the way things are going with the Fabregas / Barcelona nonsenses...</p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Barcelona are certain they have finally succeeded in their long pursuit of Cesc Fabregas with a package worth around £31million.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Arsenal were still waiting to receive any such bid but the clamour from reliable Catalan sources suggested a verbal agreement was very close.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>And to make matters worse for Arsene Wenger, he also looks set to lose Samir Nasri to Manchester City after a change of heart at the Emirates.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The latest Barcelona bid for Fabregas is thought to be a £25.5m transfer fee plus £5.25m of add-ons, depending on the Arsenal captain’s success at the Nou Camp.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Fabregas has agreed to forgo £4.4m he is owed by Arsenal as a loyalty payment, which had been a sticking point in this summer’s negotiations. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Barcelona have included this sum in the transfer package, claiming it takes the total beyond the £35m asking price, but Arsenal see this as a payment saved, rather than part of the fee paid.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The clubs are deep in talks about the details, such as how much is to be paid up front. The Gunners want the £25.5m now but Barca are offering £18m with the rest to follow next year.</span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Arsenal appear to have accepted that Barcelona cannot greatly increase their bid by the end of the month, and that Fabregas is set on returning to the club he left eight years ago.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The 24-year-old has not played for Arsenal since a defeat at Bolton in April. Wenger was ready to name him in the squad for Tuesday’s Champions League play-off against Udinese, but the midfielder is well short of match fitness.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The latest move is set to bring an end to one of the longest-running transfer sagas and Fabregas could even be unveiled by the weekend.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The midfielder has made it clear this summer that he wants to finally rejoin the club he left as a 15-year-old boy.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Arsenal have also decided to accept bids of £22m for Nasri, which could leave them bereft ahead of their opener at Newcastle on Saturday.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Juan Mata is expected to join from Valencia and Wenger is chasing at least one centre half.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Arsenal fans, who have put up with six seasons without a trophy, have only seen Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Gervinho arrive in major deals this summer.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Wenger, who turned the Gunners into a force in English football in the 90s, is under pressure to end their long wait for silverware.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But with the threat of both Manchester clubs, Chelsea and a rejuvenated Liverpool, that task appears as tough as ever. </span></p>

              <p>I think it may still not be over as Arsenal view his loyalty bonus as money saved on their part, while Barcelona deem it as additional transfer fee to the deal... There could still be more negotiation to settle this area...</p>
              <p>Cesc is a<span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>dding insult to injury by happily paying to leave Arsenal... What a terrible captain to have... Wasted all the years Wenger took to groom him and even made him club captain... </span></p>

              <p>Well, we never know what can happen... Cos as long as Wenger is still there, Arsenal will still be a good side... Who knows what could happen right? maybe the $55m they received for Nasri and Fab may actually be a good thing? Like Wenger going out and getting some good defenders... It may actually help as a forward going team, Arsenal is still very good... And players like <span style="color: #000000;">Wilshere</span><span style="color: #000000;">, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Walcott</span><span style="color: #000000;">, Ramsey, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Chamakh may step up to be the new stars... </span></p>
              <p>Not to forget <span style="color: #000000;">Robin Van Persie and the new guys Gervinho, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and perhaps the Mata guy too...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Remember, Arsenal has the best creative team work so, individual stars may not matter as long as they play as a team that's what matter most...</span></p>
