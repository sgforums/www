            <div class='col-md body'><strong>FOSTER &amp; WOODGATE START FOR ENGLAND</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.teamtalk.com//Images/81455.jpg"><br><br>England boss Steve McClaren has confirmed Jonathan Woodgate will start for his country in tomorrow's friendly against Spain at Old Trafford - and revealed the defender is a player he has "always admired". The Real Madrid player, lent to Middlesbrough for the season, comes into the starting line-up along with on-loan Watford goalkeeper Ben Foster- who will make his senior debut at the home of his parent club Manchester United.<br><br>Also back is Newcastle midfielder Kieron Dyer, following a lengthy spell on the sidelines with a succession of injuries. McClaren told Sky Sports: "I have always admired Jonathan. Since he has been back in the Premiership, he has been a revelation. He has kept away from injuries and he's a good player. "He is dying to play for England again, and we look forward to it."<br><br>Asked about the decision to call up Foster, McClaren added: "Nobody has got the experience that Paul Robinson has got - we need to give these goalkeepers a chance. Chris Kirkwood is injured, so this gives Ben the perfect opportunity. "Kieron is another one I have always admired - his performances for Newcastle have been full of maturity, and I'm looking forward to seeing that maturity tomorrow."<br><br>Shaun Wright-Phillips, who suffered racist abuse when the sides met in a friendly in Madrid in November 2004, has returned to the starting line-up - with Aaron Lennon unavailable because of a stomach bug. However, McClaren is keen to play down the significance of the Chelsea wide man's return to the team. "It's a big night for everybody - for Foster, Woodgate, Dyer - for everybody. I understand that [Wright-Phillips' previous experience against Spain]. But a lot of water has gone under the bridge since then, and a lot of good has been done in the fight against racism."<br><br>McClaren sees the Spain match as "the beginning of a big year" and added: "I hope we will finish it with qualification. "Is it make or break? I don't see it as that. We need to qualify for the Euros next year, so there is no added pressure on me or on anybody. "The only pressure is to win football matches and to achieve our target - which is qualification. I'm not even going to think about (not qualifying)."<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Hmm... i wonder if Woodgate does well for England alongside Rio, Does it mean that Gerrard should remain as captain and Terry can be on the bench in future matches..?</span></div>

But Arsenal star Fabregas insists the Spaniards have players of their own who can cope if England try to overcome their technical and skilful play with such tactics.<br><br>He said: "We always try to play football. Both teams have great potential and, when these kind of games come up, you always want to win for your country. "It will be tough because we know how England can play. It will be tough but we think we can beat them. If England try to rough us up, we can handle that. Definitely.<br><br>"I think we all know that England will try to go for the physical aspect of the game because they think we don't like to play the physical game. "But I think right now we have a good mix of experienced players, who have been playing in England and the Spanish league, and I think we are capable of coping with that.<br><br>"We may try to make a mix of playing nice football on the ground and going for the physical game. Myself and Xabi Alonso have been used to it for the last three years playing in England with Arsenal and Liverpool. "I cannot see there being a problem. Our players also play Champions League football against English teams so they all know what we are talking about. "I don't see any problem and we can cope but we respect England because they have a great team and a great midfield."<br><br>Fabregas believes Spain can use the game with England as a launchpad to revive their faltering hopes of qualifying for the 2008 Euro finals. He said: "We are really focused and motivated for this game. We know that we underachieved at the World Cup and have had up-and-down results in the European qualifiers.<br><br>"We have not been at our best recently but we have a team capable of doing much better. It is more than capable of putting things right. We have an excellent group of players and Wednesday is an opportunity to begin a good run."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pearce reign starts with draw<br><br>Stuart Pearce's tenure as England Under 21 coach began with a draw against Spain at Pride Park.<br><br>The Manchester City chief had much to ponder at the break as his side trailed by two goals, but a second-half fightback garnered a draw thanks to efforts from David Nugent and Leroy Lita.<br><br>England made a low-key start to the match and duly slipped behind on 34 minutes.<br><br>The goal was a comedy of errors as far as England were concerned, as Scott Carson sliced his kick and Curtis Davies, who appeared handicapped by a facial injury, was beaten to the loose ball by Raul Garcia.<br><br>Garcia fed the ball to Roberto Soldado and he confidently rounded Carson before slotting home.<br><br>The Spaniards grabbed a second moments before the break as Antonio Barragan drove forward before feeding Jurado who slotted beyond the exposed Carson.<br><br>Preston striker Nugent cut a forlorn figure in the first half, but he was handed more support after the break and duly brought England back into the contest on 50 minutes.<br><br>Spain failed to deal with a David Bentley free-kick and Nugent showed great awareness to kill the bouncing ball instantly before ramming home from 12 yards.<br><br>The Spanish still carried an attacking threat and Cisco saw a shot cannon off a post, while Carson had to be alert to push over a fine volley from Raul Garcia.<br><br>England held firm and grabbed an equaliser 11 minutes from time as Lita pulled off his marker to head home a fine cross from Davies.<br><br>Both sides had chances to win the game, Jurado dragged a good chance wide for Spain and Kieran Richardson saw a powerful shot saved as Pearce began his reign with a draw.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Foster handed England start<br><br>Goalkeeper Ben Foster will win his first cap for England on Wednesday after being named in the starting line-up to face Spain at Old Trafford.<br><br>Coach Steve McClaren has named his XI more than 24 hours in advance of the game at Old Trafford and he confirmed Watford's Foster - on loan from Manchester United - would make his debut.<br><br>McClaren explained on Sky Sports News his reasons for handing Foster his first call.<br><br>"It is purely for experience," he said. "ItÂ’s a good opportunity and nobody has got the experience Paul Robinson has got.<br><br>"Ben Foster, Carson, Kirkland - none have played in Europe and have that experience.<br><br>"We need to give these keepers below the experience. Unfortunately, Chris Kirkland is injured so it gives Ben Foster the perfect opportunity to start the game."<br><br>Jonathan Woodgate has been recalled for the first time in four years, after proving his fitness at Middlesbrough, and he will partner former Leeds team-mate Rio Ferdinand in central defence.<br><br>"IÂ’ve always admired Jonathan and since heÂ’s returned to the Premiership heÂ’s been a revelation," he added.<br><br>"Of course, heÂ’s a good player. To have him fit and available, and I know himself, heÂ’s dying to play for England again. So we all look forward to it."<br><br>Phil Neville has been preferred to Gareth Barry at left-back, while his brother Gary will start as usual on the right.<br><br>"He [Barry] was close, but if I want to play players in an international game then I want him to play in his position, where he plays for his club - so IÂ’ve decided to go for Phil Neville," he said.<br><br>The midfield sees another recall as Newcastle's Kieron Dyer comes in, and McClaren said: "Another one we havenÂ’t seen for a couple of years.<br><br>"HeÂ’s someone IÂ’ve admired from his performances for England before and again, when heÂ’s come back into the Newcastle side his performances have been full of maturity and IÂ’m looking forward to seeing that maturity tomorrow."<br><br>Dyer will form a five-man system with Michael Carrick and Shaun Wright-Phillips named alongside Frank Lampard and captain Steven Gerrard, all providing support for lone front-man Peter Crouch.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Striker Wayne Rooney has been ruled out of a re-shuffled England side to face Spain in Wednesday's friendly. England manager Steve McClaren said Rooney, who picked up a back injury in Manchester United's 4-0 win at Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, had not recovered in time and would be replaced by Peter Crouch.<br><br>McClaren will try again with a 4-3-3 formation used in last November's 1-1 friendly draw in the Netherlands, with Crouch flanked up front by Shaun Wright-Phillips and Kieron Dyer. Wright-Phillips gets his chance at Old Trafford after McClaren said Aaron Lennon had been ruled out by a stomach bug that had dogged the winger for several days.<br><br>Holding player Michael Carrick will anchor a more familiar three-man field, with Frank Lampard to his left and Steven Gerrard on the right. Bigger changes are in store at the back, largely due to injury absences, with Phil Neville stepping in after England lost both their left backs, Ashley Cole and Wayne Bridge.<br><br>Captain John Terry's long-term injury absence means he will be rested and his place alongside Rio Ferdinand handed to Jonathan Woodgate, with Gary Neville at right back.<br><br>McClaren dropped first-choice goalkeeper Paul Robinson in order to give Ben Foster his England debut and a taste of international football.</div>

Kyle Lafferty's poor first touch saw him waste an early Northern Ireland chance while Chris Brunt also tested Wales keeper Danny Coyne. Substitute Grant McCann hit the Welsh crossbar in the second half as Northern Ireland started to exert control.<br><br>Jason Koumas showed some neat touches but the Welsh were badly missing the class of the absent Ryan Giggs. With David Healy out because of injury, Northern Ireland boss Lawrie Sanchez paired Lafferty and Ivan Sproule up front for the game watched by a 14,000 full house.<br><br>Wales boss John Toshack decided not to risk captain Giggs in the freezing conditions while highly-rated Southampton defender Gareth Bale was only on the bench. The best chance of the opening half fell to Lafferty in the third minute but he was unable to control Chris Brunt's superb long ball and the Burnley striker's shot was easily saved by the recalled Coyne.<br><br>Craig Bellamy had the home defence on the back foot in the seventh minute and Michael Duff's defensive header almost ended up in his own net. More good Bellamy running set up a chance for Jason Koumas in the 13th minute but the shot was sliced well wide. Koumas's excellent passing was the main feature of the first half and he also tested Taylor with a curling 17th-minute free-kick.<br><br>The quiet opening was followed by an even duller second quarter with Brunt's shot, which tested Coyne in the 28th minute, a rare moment of excitement. The half-time substitutions included Michael Ingham's introduction for Maik Taylor in the Northern Ireland goals.<br><br>Northern Ireland picked up the pace after the break and Sammy Clingan's miscued effort almost looped over Coyne in the 48th minute. The pedestrian nature of the contest was finally interrupted when Northern Ireland substitute McCann thundered a 20-yard shot off the bar in the 63rd minute.<br><br>Brunt then sliced a Northern Ireland chance wide as the action belatedly began to liven up. Northern Ireland continued to press in the closing stages but they were unable to break down the Welsh defence.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Northern Ireland:</strong> Taylor (Ingham 46), Duff, Craigan (Webb 79), Hughes, Capaldi, Gillespie, Davis, Clingan (McCann 60), Brunt, Lafferty (Thompson 68 ), Sproule (Shiels 67).<br><br><strong>Wales:</strong> Coyne, Duffy, Evans, Collins, Nyatanga, Davies, Koumas, Robinson, Parry (Crofts 80), Vaughan (Cotterill 46), Bellamy, Cotterill (Easter 70).<br>Subs Not Used: Jones, Bale, Morgan, Ricketts, Valentine, Llewellyn.<br><br><strong>Referee:</strong> C Richmond (Scotland)<br><br></div>

Substitute Simao Sabrosa got the first eight minutes from time, slotting in Ricardo Quaresma's right-wing cross.<br><br>Chelsea's Ricardo Carvalho wrapped it up in stoppage time, hooking home a cross to hand Scolari a second win over his home country as Portugal manager. Lucio went closest for Brazil, but his shot slammed against the crossbar.<br><br><strong>Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari:</strong><br>"Victory over a team that has been top of the world rankings and five times world champion gives us more self-esteem and confidence before our next Euro qualifying match against Belgium. "It was a very good game and either side could have won but we made the better use of our opportunities, although they had more opportunities than us. "It was a good technical game and I think the English fans enjoyed it. It was very much from the South American school of football, but Portugal are part of the South American school.<br><br>"More importantly, I think they gained a lot of confidence from the victory. It was a good chance to see some new players and observe how they reacted."<br><br><strong>Brazil coach Dunga:</strong><br>"We anticipated these would be dangerous opponents. We should have played the ball more down the wings because, when you go through the middle, you leave yourself open to counter-attacks.<br><br>"We have to learn from it. We are starting to prepare for the World Cup. This showed us we have much left to learn. That is football. "I thought we would win, but you are not always going to.
