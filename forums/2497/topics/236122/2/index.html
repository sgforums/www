"We now hope that all measures will be taken to clear the good name of the national coach and the RFEF disciplinary committees."<br><br>Aragones caused controversy in October 2004 when he was heard in a training session telling striker Jose Antonio Reyes that he was better than "that black sh it", referring to the Spaniard's Arsenal team mate Henry.<br>The 68-year-old Aragones was originally fined 3,000 euros for behaviour "contrary to the good order of the sport" by the RFEF.<br><br>The offence was upgraded to "conduct which could be considered to be racist" by the government-run CEDD and both Aragones and the RFEF successfully appealed against that decision to the Spanish court.<br><br>The RFEF were unable to say, however, whether Aragones would still have to pay the fine for the original charge. "My lawyer told me this morning," Aragones told Cadena Ser radio late on Tuesday. "I went to court because it was a stain on my reputation and because the offence did not exist as some judges believed."<br><br>Aragones initially apologised after widespread criticism of his behaviour, saying he had not meant to offend anyone and that his conscience was clear. He stirred further controversy, however, by mounting an energetic defence of his comments before a friendly against England in November 2004.<br><br>That match in Madrid was marred by racist abuse of England's black players by sections of the crowd. Spain play England in a friendly at Old Trafford on Wednesday.</div>

Andres Iniesta's second-half thumper clinched Spain's 1-0 victory tonight in the last ever friendly at Old Trafford. But McClaren claimed his side's low-key 90 minutes had provided valuable insights for England's troubled campaign to reach Euro 2008.<br><br>He said: "I thought Ben Foster did well, Jonathan Woodgate and Rio Ferdinand were very good at the back, and I was very pleased with Kieron Dyer - he tried to make things happen." "It's very difficult in a friendly when you have to make changes. "I was really looking at individuals and how they adapt. "But it is difficult to get any cohesion you could see that."<br><br>McClaren admitted Iniesta's 63rd minute strike was the touch of extra class England's drab efforts lacked. He said: "We created opportunities but just lacked that final bit of quality.<br><br>"It was always going to be a tough game with all the players we had missing but I learned quite a bit about a few that came back."<br><br></div>
