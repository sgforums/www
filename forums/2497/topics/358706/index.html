              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">ALEX FERGUSON insists tonight’s clash with Arsene Wenger is their biggest EVER.</h2>
              <p class="article">This will be the <strong>39th</strong> time the two managers have met in all competitions with 
              the record level at <strong>14 wins each</strong> and <strong>10 draws</strong>.</p>
              <p class="article">There have been some fierce, controversial and dramatic encounters down the 
              years in league and cup.</p>
              <p class="article">But a place in the Champions League final beckons tonight — and that means 
              more to both than anything else.</p>
              <p class="article">United chief Ferguson said: “There is no question the clashes we have had in 
              the past with Arsenal will not reach the proportion of this.”</p>
              <p class="article">United lead the semi-final tie 1-0 after the first leg at Old Trafford and 
              they are aiming to become the first club to successfully defend the trophy.</p>
              <p class="article">Fergie added: “It is strange that no one has defended the trophy. It is a 
              challenge.</p>
              <p class="article">“We are in a good place going into the game. We have a lead and we are only 
              one kick away from Rome. It is a big incentive for us.”</p>
              <p class="article">A goal for United will mean Arsenal have to score three.</p>
              <p class="article">But with Rio Ferdinand fit again to partner Nemanja Vidic at the back that is 
              unlikely, so United will be going for goal from the off.</p>
              <p class="article">Ferguson said: “I think we will need to score and we have that goal threat 
              about us which is a big bonus.</p>
              <p class="article">“We have the ability to score and if we did it would put us in a very strong 
              position. But I am expecting a very close game. You cannot call it.</p>
              <p class="article">“They are two terrific sides and it should be quite an engrossing game. I 
              don’t think anybody is going to be disappointed with this match.”</p>
              <p class="article">This will be Ferguson’s sixth semi-final having been successful in only two.</p>
              <p class="article">In 1997, they lost both legs 1-0 to Borussia Dortmund. Five years later they 
              went out on away goals to Bayer Leverkusen and were soundly stuffed 5-3 on 
              aggregate by AC Milan in 2007.</p>
              <p class="article">But a third trophy — and a fourth in all for the club — would change their 
              standing.</p>
              <p class="article">Ferguson added: “When I first came into management, it was a dream to get into 
              the European Cup at some time as a manager.</p>
              <p class="article">“You think of clubs like Barcelona and Madrid, Bayern Munich, Inter Milan, AC 
              Milan, Juventus and we have played them all. I’ve always said over the years 
              that Manchester United have not won the European Cup enough.</p>
              <p class="article">“My biggest regret is not winning it more than we have. We have a terrific 
              history but it is not the same as AC Milan, Real Madrid, Liverpool, Bayern 
              Munich and Ajax, who have all won it four times or more.</p>
              <p class="article">“We have regrets about that. We have been unlucky from time to time and, on 
              other occasions, we have disappointed.</p>
              <p class="article">“But I tell myself it is a challenge because we should have done better.</p>
              <p class="article">“This year we have the opportunity to get four. Hopefully, we won’t miss out 
              on that.</p>
              <p class="article">“At times we have thrown semi-finals away. The Dortmund tie was one. We had so 
              many chances it was amazing we didn’t do it.</p>
              <p class="article">“On other occasions, like the the first game in the semi against Bayer 
              Leverkusen, we were a bit nervous and very unlucky in the second leg. We had 
              three shots cleared off the line and hit the bar.</p>
              <p class="article">“We were unlucky not to win it. The semi against Milan we were just not in it 
              and were very disappointing.”</p>
              <p class="article">Ferguson’s fear is his side might miss the chances that make the difference at 
              the Emirates tonight.</p>
              <p class="article">United should have sealed this tie by half-time in the first leg and Wenger 
              warned straight afterwards he wanted to make Ferguson regret that.</p>
              <p class="article">While the contest will be fierce, there is more warmth between Fergie and 
              Wenger now than in the past.</p>
              <p class="article">Indeed of late, Ferguson has been full of praise for the Frenchman, while he 
              has taken his verbal war to Rafa Benitez at Liverpool instead.</p>
              <p class="article">Ferguson said: “I can only admire the fact Arsene has kept his philosophy. He 
              has never changed it.</p>
              <p class="article">“His teams always want to play football, he believes in young players. 
              Manchester United have always been that way, too.</p>
              <p class="article">“You can only respect that and I do. He has brought fresh players in at the 
              right time of the season and they have the ability to go with it.</p>
              <p class="article">“It’s going to be a fantastic game. Two good football teams and there won’t be 
              a lot in it. It could even go to penalty kicks. Who knows?”</p>
