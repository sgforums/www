              <p><span><strong>Arsenal have given Arsene Wenger their unequivocal backing and will give the beleaguered Frenchman £55million to rebuild his ailing squad.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Majority shareholder Stan Kroenke and the Gunners board remain 100 per cent behind the Frenchman despite being resigned to a seventh consecutive season without a trophy.</span></p>
              <p><span>The north London club's season went from bad to worse on Saturday as they crashed out of the FA Cup after to a 2-0 defeat at Sunderland.</span></p>
              <p><span>Saturday's loss came just three days after Arsenal's humiliating 4-0 defeat against AC Milan in the Champions League - a result that virtually sealed their exit from the competition.</span></p>
              <p><span>This season's struggles have, for the first time, raised major question marks over Wenger's role as manager.</span></p>
              <p><span>However, the Arsenal board remain staunch in their backing of the under-fire manager and still believe Wenger is the man to revive the club's faltering fortunes.</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>As it stands, Wenger is under no danger of the sack - only a sensational shift in opinion between now and the end of the season from the Gunners board will alter that stance. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Furthermore, the Gunners hierarchy are adamant the Wenger will remain the club's manager until, at the very least, his contract expires in 2014.</span></p>
              <p><span>The only situation that would result in Wenger no longer remaining the Arsenal hotseat would be if he decided to resign at the end of the season.</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>The news will come as a major boost to Wenger, who will now focus all of his attentions on securing Champions League qualification.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>And the Gunners board will underline their commitment to Wenger in the summer by handing him a hefty transfer budget to help bolster his squad.</span></p>
              <p><span>As <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span> revealed on Friday, Wenger is planning an overhaul of his squad in the summer.</span></p>
              <p><span>High profile names such as Mario Goetze, Lukas Podolski, Eden Hazard and Matias Suarez all feature on Wenger's shopping list.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span>But despite the Gunners hierarchy giving their manag</span><span>er </span><span>substantial financial backing, Wenger knows he faces a huge fight to land his top targets, especially if they fail to secure a top-four finish this season.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span>Meanwhile, Gunners legend George Graham - who won nine major trophies with the club during his time as a player and manager - has launched a scathing attack on his former club.</span></p>
              <p><span>He said: 'I think Arsenal are in crisis. I think it’s been slipping away for the last couple of years and they’ve not been replacing the players that left four or five years ago. 'They’ve got money to buy players and I can’t understand why Arsene didn’t go out and buy some real quality players in the summer.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'Nowadays you’ve got to introduce youngsters coming through like Sir Alex Ferguson does. But at the same time he’ll buy the ready-made player who costs £25m because they’re not afraid to do it.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'I think Arsene has overdone the youth policy and the players coming in are not as good as the ones that have left.' </span></p>

              <p>If he wanna make Gooners into a force,why did he not invest his money wisely in proven talent?I bet only RVP can walk into any European Cup team anywhere.The rest are only good for Europa League teams.Arsenal is as good as finished as long as he is overdoing his youth policies.AW might as well ask David Seaman,Tony Adams and company to come back to play for him.</p>
              <p>They used to have stars like Bergkamp,Overmars and Petit but they have not been adequately replaced.That explains their current state.</p>
