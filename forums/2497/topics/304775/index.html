Your other players are in positions to defend the second ball.<br><br>"With man-to-man marking, attackers can drag defenders all over the place by taking them away from the danger area.<br><br>"It is a collective responsibility whereas man-for-man marking is based on personal responsibility."<br><br><strong>ARGUMENTS AGAINST</strong><br><br>The most common opposition to the system is that zones don't score, players do, so mark the player.<br><br>But Wilkinson explains there is a further layer to the argument.<br><br>He said: "Players score from dangerous zones. What do goalkeepers do on corners anyhow?<br><br>"They zone mark because until the ball is kicked they don't know where the ball will go.<br><br>"They don't concern themselves with players, they concern themselves with the ball because it's the ball that scores."<br><br>And he dismisses the notion that defenders have to compete with attackers who have a run on them.<br><br>"Attackers get a run on you whether you are zone defending or man-for-man marking," Wilkinson said.<br><br>"They always calls the shots. You start from a standing position but once the ball is in flight, you've got the distance the ball travels to get yourself moving.<br><br>"Lots of teams in the Premiership mark zones on the wide free-kick, because if you try and mark runners you end up running into each other and you can't jump anyway.<br><br>"You've got to remember that the higher up you go, the greater the quality of the delivery.<br><br>"That's one thing you can't do anything about, you have to assume that the people who are taking it can hit the button."<br><br><strong>TEACHING THE SYSTEM</strong><br><br>Liverpool's defending as a team has been widely praised with the team matching a club record for consecutive clean sheets in the league.<br><br>Wilkinson says: "Benitez's record, before he came to Liverpool and since he arrived, says that undoubtedly in achieving some things he's a master.<br><br>"I'd be careful about arguing with him on defending because his record isn't bad, particularly in Europe.<br><br>"It is a difficult thing to coach. It's more complex than man-to-man but it is more effective.<br><br>"But it's only more effective if it's covered comprehensively and players understand not only their roles but the roles of others."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But 1 negative aspect of the Zonal Marking system is that a small player defending that space might come face to face with a taller attacker also attacking that very same space should the ball fly over the first man guarding infront of the near post.</div>
