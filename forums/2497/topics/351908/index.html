              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Former England star Paul
              Gascoigne revealed his heart stopped three times while in rehab in a
              Sky News interview being broadcast on Monday.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Gazza told Sky News
              presenter Kay Burley that last year's sudden rumours that he had died
              were closer to the truth than the public realised.</p>
              <p>He said: "My heart failed on us a few times," adding that his father John had collapsed with worry at his illness.</p>
              <p>Gascoigne has endured a love-hate relationship with the British
              public, a brilliant footballer whose career was marred by alcohol and
              violence towards his ex-wife Cheryl.</p>
              <p>Addressing the attack he said: "If you are sitting in a
              restaurant and somebody calls your mum a w****, which she did, and for
              no reason, I don't like that and yes, I got a hold of her arms and I
              did put my head against her head, I didn't head butt her but I threw
              her to the floor and yes I was disgusted with myself for what I did.</p>
              <p>"I went to therapy; I sat with 15-20 women and told them
              exactly what I did. I got punched off a few women for doing what I did
              but I took the punches and I accepted it, I got hammered but I went
              through this course and it is the one thing I ever did in my life and
              that was it and I get hammered for it."</p>
              <p>In a startlingly frank admission he says he feels "used" by his son Regan.</p>
              <p>He said: "I have drove down to be with my son and he takes us to
              the school and shows them obviously this is my dad, and I went to
              assembly and then I sign everything for the kids, and then see, that is
              it proved to everyone that I am his dad, sort of thing and then he goes
              back home and that leaves me, I don't know, I feel like I am being used
              by my own son here."</p>
              <p>The interview, in the company of his father, sister Lindsay and
              two young nephews shows the ex-Newcastle and Tottenham player having a
              kickabout on the beach.</p>
              <p>He proudly declares: "No-one is ever going to be as good as I was."</p>
              <p>The player is visibly moved when both the youngsters say he is their favourite ever player.</p>
              <p>He said: "The kids have been scared, they have been scared of
              us, you know, coming round the house and that, the way I was and in the
              state I was in, but coming to the beach and playing football is
              brilliant."</p>
              <p>Gascoigne has had a well-publicised battle with alcohol, and
              admits that only four months ago he was drinking 30 cans of Special
              Brew (strong lager) per day.</p>
              <p>In reference to his religious beliefs he says: "I just thank
              him for today you know, if I don't drink I just say thanks, thanks for
              not letting me have a drink today."</p>
              <p>But Gascoigne says he can be around alcohol without giving in to temptation.</p>
              <p>"I can be around it now because all I have got to do is remember
              my last drink. If I remember my last drink, which I can't, well I sort
              of can, getting fed with a spoon because I had the shakes that bad."</p>
              <p>He also describes his suicide attempt.</p>
              <p>"In the bath yes, it's the easy way out they say, you know, take
              a few sleeping tablets, nice little warm bath and have a few drinks and
              just drop. I had just had enough, I had had enough of everything, you
              know."</p>
              <p>Gascoigne continues: "I rang my sister just to say, I am going
              to run a bath. I think she might have had a clue, I don't know if it
              was a plea for help but I did have enough anyway so I wasn't bothered.</p>
              <p>"And I just said, look I am in the bath and I will always love
              you, or something like that, and put the phone down, and I run the bath
              and I lay in the bath and just felt myself dropping off and I remember
              just getting ready, like dozing off you know and then the police burst
              in. About six police dragged us out of the bath."</p>
