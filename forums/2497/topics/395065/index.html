              <h3>CARLOS TEVEZ has proved all the doubters wrong with a fantastic season 
              in 
              Manchester City's colours.</h3>
              <p>The big-money capture of the Argentine has paid off with his hat-trick 
              against 
              Wigan his second treble since joining the club.</p>
              <p>But was he the best signing of last summer?</p>
              <p>Take a look at our top ten and then let us know your thoughts using the 
              feedback form and exclusive poll.</p>
              <h4><strong>TOP TEN SIGNINGS OF THE SUMMER</strong></h4>
              <p><strong>1. Carlos Tevez -
               Unattached to Man City, £25m</strong></p>
              <p>After a few games, the knives were out for the South American striker. 
              Sir 
              Alex Ferguson was right not to sign him, his first touch wasn't good 
              enough, 
              his goal return was poor. But he worried his old club in a thrilling 
              derby 
              and, once off the mark in the league against another of his former teams
               in 
              West Ham, he hasn't looked back. 19 goals in 26 starts is some record 
              and he 
              also weighed in with another six in six in during the Carling Cup run, 
              which 
              included three strikes against the Red Devils. The main man behind 
              City's 
              push for fourth spot and, if he gets them into next season's Champions 
              League, it'll definitely be a case of money well spent.</p>
              <p><strong>2. Thomas Vermaelen - Ajax to Arsenal, £10m</strong></p>
              <p>Some scoffed when Arsene Wenger splashed out on the Belgian centre-back,
               with 
              rumours in Holland suggesting the Gunners had overpaid. Now he looks 
              like a 
              steal after an accomplished first campaign at Premier League level. His 
              partnership with William Gallas was rock-solid before the Frenchman got 
              injured and he's already an Emirates favourite. Composed and cultured in
               
              possession, he weighs in with more than his fair share of goals.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Richard Dunne - Man City to Aston Villa, £6m</strong></p>
              <p>City have also made mistakes in the market and offloading Dunne is 
              clearly one 
              of them. The uncompromising Irishman was a popular figure with the 
              supporters at Eastlands but jettisoned by former boss Mark Hughes to 
              make 
              way for Kolo Toure and Joleon Lescott. Yet he's had better seasons than 
              both 
              of them and been a rock at the back for Villa. Reliable and rugged, he 
              has 
              helped the Midlanders go all the way to the Carling Cup final and book a
               
              return to Wembley to face Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals.</p>
              <p><strong>4. Darren Bent - Tottenham to Sunderland, £10m</strong></p>
              <p>Maybe he didn't go the right away about leaving Spurs when Tweeting 
              obscenities about his bosses but Bent was desperate for first-team 
              football 
              to show he would score goals at the top level. When he got the move he 
              craved, he hasn't stopped hitting the net and managed goals against all 
              of 
              the 'big four'. With his tally standing at 20 in 32 league games, there 
              is 
              no denying he has been one of the shrewdest signings of 2009. His record
               has 
              always been impressive but it was a gamble from Steve Bruce - one that 
              has 
              struck gold for the Black Cats manager.</p>
              <p><strong>5. Niko Kranjcar - Portsmouth to Tottenham, £2m</strong></p>
              <p>Harry Redknapp likes a bargain and the Croatian was an absolute steal. 
              With 
              Pompey about to endure the worst year in their history, the midfielder 
              was 
              picked up for a song and has adapted well to life at White Hart Lane. 
              With 
              his fellow countrymen Luka Modric and Vedran Corluka at the club, he has
               
              been made to feel at home and become an important member of the side. 
              Undoubtedly one of the biggest bargains over the past year or so.</p>
              <p><strong>6. Joe Hart - Man City to Birmingham, loan</strong></p>
              <p>With City splashing the cash, there was always going to be value around 
              in 
              picking up the players pushed to the fringes. Shay Given is an excellent
               
              keeper so the obvious option was to loan Hart out. There were no 
              shortage of 
              takers but Birmingham have benefitted hugely from having the England 
              hopeful 
              on board. The youngster has developed into a top-class goalie and the 
              only 
              problem is trying to convince City to sell him permanently. Scott Dann 
              and 
              Roger Johnson were also astute acquisitions from Alex McLeish but Hart 
              has 
              been the pick of the bunch.</p>
              <p><strong>7. Antonio Valencia - Wigan to Man United, £16m</strong></p>
              <p>Ferguson had the Ecuadorian earmarked as the replacement for Cristiano 
              Ronaldo 
              for some time and he's exceeded expectations in his first season at Old 
              Trafford. An old-fashioned winger who likes to beat his man and deliver 
              the 
              ball into the box, he has supplied Wayne Rooney with plenty of chances 
              this 
              term. His manager has admitted he just needs to come out of his shell 
              because he has a shy personality, and there is the feeling that he 
              doesn't 
              realise how good he can be. That said, he was man of the match in his 
              first 
              major final with United and there could be more medals on the way this 
              season.</p>
              <p><strong>8. Kevin Doyle - Reading to Wolves, £6.5m</strong></p>
              <p>Wolves had been accused of not scoring enough goals until their recent 
              win at 
              West Ham, but there's no blame attached to their record buy. His goal 
              return 
              of seven from 28 matches is almost identical to his international record
               but 
              his game is not all about putting the ball in the net. Doyle has 
              developed 
              into an ideal lone striker, capable of shielding the ball, keeping 
              possession and putting in a lot of selfless work. Mick McCarthy's system
               is 
              bringing the best out in him and he's worth far more than what they paid
               
              Reading for him now.</p>
              <p><strong>9. Jamie O'Hara - Tottenham to Portsmouth, loan</strong></p>
              <p>Pompey's money troubles have been well documented but they picked up a 
              gem 
              when signing the Spurs midfielder for the season. O'Hara has proved 
              himself 
              to be Premier League class and his determined displays have lifted the 
              Fratton Park faithful. Although he misses out on the big FA Cup 
              semi-final 
              against his parent club, there will be other grand occasions for him 
              later 
              in his career - obviously starting with the final in May if Spurs are 
              beaten. He won't stay on the south coast when Portsmouth go down and 
              it's 
              unlikely he'll remain at White Hart Lane. But he'll have a choice of 
              where 
              to play his football next term, that's for sure.</p>
              <p><strong>10.Damien Duff - Newcastle to Fulham, £4m</strong></p>
              <p>Many pundits saw the Irish winger as a player on the way down. Hampered 
              by 
              injuries, he had failed to reproduce the form that made him one of the 
              most 
              exciting players at the 2002 World Cup. While this season has been 
              heartbreaking on the international front, and he missed a gilt-edged 
              chance 
              to win the play-off with France, things have gone swimmingly at Craven 
              Cottage. Duff has weighed in with eight goals and added experience and a
               
              touch of quality to Roy Hodgson's midfield. With the Europa League run 
              still 
              going strong, he can be delighted with his contribution and reassured 
              that 
              his career is back on an upward curve.</p>
