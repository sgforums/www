              Mason on Saturday after aiming a slap at Liverpool's Javier Mascherano,
              who had earlier appeared to make contact with his face in an
              off-the-ball incident.</p>
              <p>Boro appealed on the grounds that the offence did not amount to
              violent conduct but a regulatory commission rejected the claim as
              "frivolous" and increased the mandatory three-match ban for the offence
              to four.</p>
              <p>An FA statement said: "At a regulatory commission hearing
              today, a claim for wrongful dismissal from Middlesbrough's Jeremie
              Aliadiere was rejected.</p>
              <p>"The commission decided that the claim was frivolous and
              increased Aliadiere's suspension from three matches to four matches as
              a result with immediate effect.</p>
              <p>"Aliadiere was shown a red card for violent conduct following
              an incident during the second half of Middlesbrough's match against
              Liverpool on 23 February."</p>

              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Middlesbrough have launched an attack at
                  disciplinary chiefs after Jeremie Aliadiere's appeal against his red
                  rard at Liverpool was dismissed.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Boro chief executive Keith Lamb was fuming at the decision, branding it "a travesty of justice".</p>
              <p>Lamb said: "We are furious and totally astounded that the
                  commission, without consultation, should consider our appeal to be
                  frivolous.</p>
              <p>"Who are they to know our minds when we made this appeal?</p>
              <p>"We are appalled at the decision and the entire process. How can
                  nameless, faceless people on a commission decide that our genuine claim
                  for equality and justice be dealt with in such a flippant manner?</p>
              <p>"It is a disgraceful comment to suggest our claim was
                  frivolous. We agonised over it before deciding to submit a claim for
                  wrongful dismissal.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"The Oxford Dictionary definition of frivolous is 'not serious,
                  shallow, silly or trifling', while in fact we spent more than two days
                  considering whether or not to appeal the incident.</span></p>
              <p>"It seems strange that only recently Chelsea's appeal against
                  Michael Essien's three-match ban was rejected but not considered
                  'frivolous'.</p>
              <p>"It appears that there is one rule for the big boys and another for the rest of us."</p>
              <p>Lamb insisted Boro had decided to appeal only after studying television replays and canvassing opinion on the decision.</p>
              <p>He said: "We considered Jeremie's dismissal to be extremely harsh.</p>
              <p>"We find the inconsistency displayed in this whole incident unacceptable and quite unbelievable.</p>
              <p>"According to the referee's report, he had a 'good, clear view'
                  of the whole incident, including Javier Mascherano grabbing Jeremie
                  Aliadiere's face and Jeremie's subsequent reaction.</p>
              <p>"However, he decided that while Mascherano's actions were
                  acceptable and needed no further action, our player's light flick was
                  'violent conduct' and merited a straight red card.</p>
              <p>"How can it be fair that one player receive a straight red card while the other receives no punishment at all?</p>
              <p>"To further quote the Oxford Dictionary, the adjective 'violent'
                  is defined as 'involving great physical force', which anyone who has
                  seen the incident hardly describes Jeremie's actions."</p>
              <p>Aliadiere will miss tomorrow night's FA Cup fifth round replay
                  against Sheffield United, Saturday's league clash with Reading and the
                  trip to Aston Villa a week later.</p>
              <p>Should Boro make the FA Cup quarter-finals, Aliadiere would sit
                  out the last-eight showdown with Cardiff, but if they go out tomorrow
                  night, he would be suspended for the return to former club Arsenal on
                  March 15.</p>
              <p>Lamb said: "If anything in this whole farcical affair was frivolous, it was the original incident.</p>
              <p>"How on earth can Jeremie Aliadiere think he has been treated
                  fairly in this whole charade when the outcome is clearly a travesty of
                  justice?"</p>
              <p>FA rules dictate that the regulatory commission can only
                  rescind a red card when the referee has made a "clear and obvious
                  error", and appeals where that is not found to be the case are regarded
                  as frivolous.</p>
              <p>It is understood Mr Mason saw the whole incident, but took no formal action against Mascherano.</p>

              <h2>FOUR-GAME BAN FOR ALIADIERE</h2>
              <p>The FA have really pulled off a cracker here - no ban for William Gallas for kicking out at Nani, only a three-match ban for Martin Taylor for (accidentally) snapping Eduardo's ankle, but now a four-match ban for Jeremie Aliadiere for a little slap at Javier Mascherano in a tit-for-tat handbags. They weren't happy with the 'frivolous' nature of Boro's appeal.</p>

              <p>Middlesbrough striker Jeremie Aliadiere has been handed a four-match ban after having his appeal against the red card he received at Liverpool rejected.</p>
