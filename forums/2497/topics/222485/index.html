            <div class='col-md body'>Silvestre says he would like to play in Spain and that Bowyer is a dirty player<br><br>Manchester United defender Mikael Silvestre has revealed that he would like to play in La Liga at some stage of his career.<br><br>The Frenchman has been used sparingly this term by Sir Alex Ferguson after losing his place to Nemanja Vidic.<br><br>Although the 29-year-old is happy at Old Trafford, he could emerge as a target for other clubs next year - but has no intention of returning to France.<br><br>When quizzed on whether he would ever consider leaving United, he told Foot Interviews: "Sure, why not? Whats certain is that, for the moment, I am excluding any possibility of a return to France - even if you should never say never. Its not because I dont love my country, but simply because I know the league too well. Personally, I would like to discover a new style of play. Ive done Italy in the colours of Inter, England in the jersey of the Red Devils. All thats left for me is Spain."<br><br>Silvestre has paid tribute to Louis Saha, Sundays goalscorer against Chelsea, for helping compensate for the loss of Ruud van Nistelrooy.<br><br>The prolific Dutchman was off-loaded to Real Madrid after a fall-out with Ferguson but Saha has stepped into the breach effectively.<br><br>"Fortunately, we have Little Louis," he replied when asked about Van Nistelrooys departure.<br><br>"At the end of last season, he already succeeded in relegating Ruud to the bench. This season, he has confirmed [this decision]. He brings us an enormous amount - starting with goals."<br><br>The Red Devils stopper also had words of criticism for West Hams Lee Bowyer, whom he describes as his worst opponent.<br><br>"The worst? Thats Lee Bowyer," he stated.<br><br>"He, on the pitch, is really a poor type. He gives you cheap shots from behind. He really has a dirty mentality. Thats typically the type of player I hate."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Brown and Mik on brink of exit</strong><br><br>MANCHESTER UNITED defenders Wes Brown and Mikael Silvestre are considering their Old Trafford futures.<br><br>Brown, who has started just one league game in the last nine, has seen boss Alex Ferguson to voice his frustration.<br><br>The England centre-back, 27, was not even on the bench against Chelsea on Sunday and his contract is up at the end of next season.<br><br>Frenchman Silvestre, 29, has not started a league game since the 1-0 defeat against Arsenal in September. He is third choice left-back behind Gabriel Heinze and Patrice Evra.<br><br>Silvestre has now said he would be ready to leave Old Trafford to play in SpainÂ’s La Liga.<br><br>Asked if he would consider leaving United, Silvestre replied: Â“Sure, why not?<br><br>Â“WhatÂ’s certain is that, for the moment, I am excluding any possibility of a return to France.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s not because I donÂ’t love my country but simply because I know the league too well.<br><br>"I would like to discover a new style of play. IÂ’ve done Italy in the colours of Inter, England in the jersey of the Red Devils. All thatÂ’s left for me is Spain.Â”<br><br>Brown has grown up at United progressing from the academy. He was once described by Ferguson as Â‘the most naturally gifted English defenderÂ’.<br><br>But the player believes he is at an age where he should be a first-team regular.<br><br>There will be no shortage of takers for Brown, who would like to stay in the North West. That will alert the likes of Bolton with Brown available for around Â£4m, while Silvestre is valued at the same figure.<br><br>United take on Everton at Old Trafford tonight likely to field the same side which drew against Chelsea.<br><br>According to UnitedÂ’s assistant manager Carlos Queiroz, there is still a sense of disappointment at Old Trafford that they did not win.<br><br>He said: Â“We are never pleased when we donÂ’t win. Chelsea had more possession in the second half but I think we created the best opportunities.<br><br>Â“Now it is important to react against Everton with the right mentality and motivation, especially with so many other important games coming up.<br><br>Â“We need to be in a good position in January to attack the second stage of the Premiership campaign.<br><br>Â“If we are in a strong position at the end of January then we should be able to move forward. I honestly believe we can win the title.Â”<br></div>
