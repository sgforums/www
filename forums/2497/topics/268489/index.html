            <div class='col-md body'>Villa Seal Harewood Deal<br><br>Aston Villa manager Martin O'Neill believes new signing Marlon Harewood could prove the bargain of the season.<br><br>The striker has joined the midlands giants from West Ham on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee, reported to be in the region of Â£4million.<br><br>And O'Neill is backing his latest recruit to shine at Villa despite a season to forget in London last term.<br><br>He said: "Marlon has done it before at this level and I am sure he is more than capable of scoring goals for us in the Premiership this time around.<br><br>"All right, he did not have the best of seasons last time, but he has come here knowing he will have to fight for his place and I think that speaks volumes about his character.<br><br>"I think we've got ourselves a player with plenty of self belief.<br><br>"That is not self belief which is bordering on arrogance, but if we can inject Marlon with a little bit more confidence and get the right players around him I believe he can be a real success with our club.<br><br>"Two years ago we all thought we had seen the stabilisation of transfer market prices.<br><br>"But the new media deal with the Premiership chairmen is having its effect and we are seeing prices start to go up again."<br><br>The arrival of Harewood takes O'Neill's spending to an estimated Â£30million since he arrived at the Villa helm a year ago.<br><br>But the former Nottingham Forest and Hammers front man insisted his move back to the midlands brought with it no extra pressure.<br><br>Harewood said: "It had looked as if I was going to Wigan and I was very close to sealing a deal there, but I asked for an extra 24 hours to speak to my wife and think things over.<br><br>"Then I heard through my agent that West Ham had given Villa permission to speak to me and of course I wanted to keep my options open.<br><br>"I phoned Wigan and informed them of the situation and they were very understanding about that.<br><br>"But when Martin O'Neill phones you up and tells you he wants to bring you to a club like Villa, and tells you all about his plans for the future, then of course it's a very exciting prospect.<br><br>"I had a great time at West Ham and although last season was a struggle down there the club eventually managed to stay in the Premiership."<br><br>Harewood admitted he would have some regrets about the way his Upton Park career came to an end.<br><br>"Was I disappointed with the way it ended for me at West Ham? Yes and no," he added.<br><br>"But my time at West Ham is behind me now and I have to look forward to life with Aston Villa.<br><br>"I have come here ready to fight for a place in the team, I am under no illusions there is a shirt waiting for me.<br><br>"It is up to me to impress the manager and earn a place in the team.<br><br>"But I think I am capable of having a very good season and that Aston Villa are capable of having a very good year as well."<br></div>
