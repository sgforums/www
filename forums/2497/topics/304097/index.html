            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Rafael Benitez is confident of remaining as Liverpool manager, despite the ongoing uncertainty surrounding his position.</strong><br><br>Reds co-owner Tom Hicks raised further doubts over Benitez's long-term future at Anfield by revealing that he and George Gillett had held talks with Jurgen Klinsmann about possibly replacing the Spaniard.<br><br>Furthermore, Liverpool's recent form has done little to ease the pressure on Benitez as they have picked up just two wins in their previous seven Premier League fixtures.<br><br>But Benitez is defiant that he is not feeling the strain, and has revealed he expects to stay on as Liverpool boss for at least another year.<br><br>"I know you might ask. I will not say anything but I have a lot of confidence that I will be sitting in this chair in a year's time," he said in the Daily Star Sunday.<br><br>"I have two-and-a-half years of my contract [left].<br><br>"I'm really pleased to be here and I have a lot of confidence I will be here in the future.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DIC reports</span></strong><br><br>"My relationship with the players is really good. A lot of them have asked 'What's going on?' My Answer to them is to keep going."<br><br>Meanwhile, reports continue to circulate that Hicks is considering an offer from the Dubai International Capital group, who tried to buy The Reds 12 months ago.<br><br>A spokesman for Hicks has denied the speculation, but rumours that the American owners are trying to refinance their deal continue to grow.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>*Torres expects Rafa to stay*<br><br>Fernando Torres does not believe Rafa Benitez will leave Liverpool despite ongoing speculation about his future.</strong><br><br>Benitez's relationship with co-owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett has become strained in recent months and it was recently revealed that Jurgen Klinsmann had been spoken to about the possibility of replacing the Spaniard.<br><br>A number of Premier League managers have lost their jobs this season but Torres, who was brought to Anfield last summer, expects Benitez to stay.<br><br>"It's all a lie. Benitez will not leave and he will not be sacked," Torres told Spanish newspaper Publico.<br><br>"I can't see that happening. I don't think English football has lost its patience like it seems."<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Less pressure</span></strong><br><br>Torres believes he has improved since his move to the Premier League because he has a lower profile in England than Spain.<br><br>He said: "It's different here (to Madrid). I can go and have a coffee without any pressure. I can go for a walk and not be reminded at every step that I am a footballer.<br><br>"That allows me to be more calm on the pitch and enjoy myself more.<br><br>"I can see that I play for a team which is respected by its rivals.<br><br>"And it is easy to get along with (Steven) Gerrard on the pitch. You don't have to do anything strange, wherever you move he gives you the ball. He is fantastic."</div>
