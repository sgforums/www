              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1120905" rel="1120905_3" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1120905/Fergie-Ronaldos-sale--Real-Madrid-bid-120m.html"></a></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> manager Sir Alex Ferguson has declared the club would turn down any offers of £120million from Manchester City or Real Madrid for World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo.</strong></p>
              <p>Ferguson made his startling announcement last night following AC Milan's decision to accept a world-record bid of £110million from City's Abu Dhabi billionaires for Brazilian superstar Kaka.</p>
              <p>The United manager went on to insist the decision to make Ronaldo 'unsellable' at any price had come from American owners the Glazer family, despite United carrying an estimated debt of £700million in the middle of a global credit crunch.</p>
              <p>A bullish Ferguson, whose side face Derby County this week for the right to play in the Carling Cup final at Wembley, also predicted last summer's transfer saga involving Ronaldo and Real Madrid would not be repeated with the resignation of Real President Ramon Calderon following a vote-rigging scandal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/01/18/article-0-031689E4000005DC-504_233x346.jpg" alt="Manchester United Manager Sir Alex Ferguson" width="233" height="346"></p>
              <p><em>strong position: Sir Alex Ferguson</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><strong>While the arrival of City's oil-rich owners threatens to change football as we know it, Ferguson was quick to assert his star asset was beyond even their financial muscle.</strong></p>
              <p>He said: 'Kaka is one of the top three players in the world and if he's worth £100million, so are Lionel Messi and Ronaldo. You could argue Ronaldo is worth £120million because he is the World and European Player of the Year.</p>
              <p>'But there is no chance the owners would want to sell him even if City came calling with £120million this summer. I am absolutely sure of it.</p>
              <p>'They want him here even more than me. They are strong about that.' Predictably, Ferguson has been delighted to see the back of Calderon, whom he blames for trying to unsettling Ronaldo last summer. And in his most optimistic message yet, he indicated the war by Real Madrid to land Ronaldo was now disappearing.</p>
              <p>'We are in a strong position with Ronaldo. We did our hard work in the summer to settle him down and we did well. He's fully settled here. 'I expected it all to surface again this month but it's been quiet. Maybe it's because Calderon has had his wings clipped.</p>
              <p>'Do you think I would do a deal with Real Madrid? We've done our hard work and that is the end of the matter. 'Cristiano has made the point that he could only have won all the awards he's been winning lately by being at Manchester United. He knows that and we are proud of the boy because he's the first United player and the first player based in England to win the World award.'</p>
              <p>Ferguson also indicated talks will start soon about offering 35-year-old Ryan Giggs a new contract. Giggs, United's record appearance-holder, was widely praised for his performance in the vital 3-0 win against Chelsea last weekend. 'He has got to be considered world-class even at his age,' said Ferguson. 'He is incredible and would deserve to be among the candidates for Footballer of the Year.'</p>

              hmm..if Man City offers 150m, it will be stupid not to sell.  I would say, sell.  With this money you can buy other exciting players. (3 at least).  
              
              Ronaldo is definitely not worth 150m loh...if the shieks think he does, ok, lets sell.
