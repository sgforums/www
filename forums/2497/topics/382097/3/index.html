              <div>
              <p><abbr><span>Liverpool</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span>Rafa Benitez</span></abbr> insists he gets it right in the transfer market - when he has money to spend.</p>
              <p>The relative lack of cash at the club has made risk-taking essential for <abbr><span>Liverpool</span></abbr> and Benítez admits to making mistakes in the market.</p>
              <p>"When we have spent big, normally it’s been very good business," he told <em>The Times</em>. "Torres, Mascherano, Reina, Alonso. Keane is a good player but we had to sell him because he was not playing at the level we knew he could play. Ryan [Babel] was signed for the future and we are waiting for his improvement. He has to be more consistent.</p>
              <p>"With the fringe players, we needed to take a gamble on Bosmans and one, two million-pound players. Some of these players have not been good enough for us. It is a risk you have to accept when there is not too much money about."</p>

              <p>with no sugar daddy like chelsea, and wenger spending within his budget all these years, arsenal did not bad, although they last won any trophy in 2005, 4 years ago. last league title they won was in 2004. they were beaten finalist in CL in 2006.</p>

              <p><br>anelka was offloaded because he was causing a lot of problems in the bench.. he was a talent with freon in his veins.. but when he was younger and pretty immature, he was a disruptive force.. and when he went on his travels to RM and loads of other places, he wasn't really settled until Chelsea and before that, Bolton..</p>
              <p>Adebayor is a hack.. i think he misses more open goals than scores... a big mouth, a disruptive and indisciplined force, and i'll bet will be more problems for Hughes than he's worth in the near future...</p>
              <p>Cole is still Cole.. his game hasn't improved or deteriorated much... with his terrible attitude in the locker room, i think The Arse was better off without him..</p>
              <p>there have been many who seem damned good but would be hard to fit them into other teams..</p>
              <p>and many who are good at other teams and find it hard to settle into Arsenal... they do play a different type of football to almost every other English club... which makes them bloody exciting to watch  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
