              <p><strong>11.40:</strong> Gareth Southgate has dismissed that ridiculous rumour about getting Phil Neville in as a player coach.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>11.25:</strong> A signing! Well, the permanent signing of a
              loan 'star'. Blackburn have signed Gael Givet, who they had on loan
              from Marseille last season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>09.46:</strong> One for fans of idle, European speculation (we
              all are, surely?) now, and 'reports in Spain' suggest that Everton are
              in talks with Atletico Madrid about signing Jose Antonio Reyes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This would be the same Reyes who didn't like the cold in London.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>09.43:</strong> Here's an interesting one. A very interesting one, in fact.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Birmingham Mail reports this morning that Brum have been
              trying to tempt a mystery player to the West Midlands, and that player
              is....Patrick Vieira.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Blimey.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However...: 'Vieira gave the transfer some thought but
              eventually admitted he wasn't keen, even though Blues were quite
              prepared to meet his massive wage demands.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ah well. Fun while it lasted, eh?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>09.23:</strong> The <span class="instorylink">Gossip Column</span> is here now - and it claims that ManYoo are closing in on Karim Benzema and City are closing in on Samuel Eto'o. So there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>09.21:</strong> Another quick line on that Maicon story. Reports in Italy suggest that City will offer Elano and £19m for the right-back.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>09.17:</strong> Now Cesc may only have said last night that he
              is committted to Arsenal, but that hasn't stopped those wags in Italy
              from linking him with a move to AC Milan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Corriere dello Sport claim that Milan will sell Andrea Pirlo to help fund a £30m move for Fabregas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>08.35:</strong> Marc-Antoine Fortune is on the move, and it seems he has two options.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It's a straightforward choice - Celtic or Hull City," Michael Manuello told The Daily Record.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We're in discussions with both over personal terms. I expect a decision by the end of the week.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Marc doesn't have to meet Tony Mowbray to know what it is like
              to play for him at Celtic because he already knows the manager very
              well and trusts him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"But he does have a choice to make. He has to weigh up all his options."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>08.08:</strong> Quick line from last night, and Maicon's agent reckons one side of Manchester want his man.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Real are interested and I think Manchester City too, but not United" said Antonio Caliendo</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"However, it is up to Massimo Moratti to decide. I would be happy if Maicon stayed here to try and win the Champions League."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>08.05:</strong> Roger Johnson completed his move from Cardiff
              to Birmingham for the somewhat beefy fee of £5million yesterday, but as
              one might expect he isn't admitting to being intimidated by the amount
              of noughts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The fee in a way does add a bit of pressure, but I will just do what I do" said Johnson.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It is a massive fee but I take pressure in my stride and just
              crack on. Hopefully I will do as well as I did at Cardiff and do the
              same for Birmingham."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>08.02:</strong> Pip pip, and top of the morning to you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hmmm. Not much around this morning, so we'll kick off with a
              rumour from the Press Association last night, who claimed Manchester
              United are sniffing around Real Madrid striker Klaas Jan Huntelaar.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Stick around though - we're sure we'll come up with something better than that soon.</p>
