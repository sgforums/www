              <p>Bridge has pulled out of England's World Cup plans after describing his relationship with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> defender <abbr><span class="glossary-term">John Terry</span></abbr> as "untenable and potentially divisive".</p>
              <p>The news is only likely to heighten the powderkeg atmosphere between Bridge and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>'s Terry when City visit Stamford Bridge on Saturday.</p>
              <p>Bridge - who was due to be watched by <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fabio Capello</span></abbr> at the game - is thought to be unwilling to shake the Blues skipper's

              </div>
              <p>Wayne Bridge has pulled himself out of contention for England and
              the World Cup after revelations over John Terry's affair with his
              former partner.</p>
              <p>In a statement released by his lawyers.
              Manchester City left-back Bridge said his position in the squad is
              'untenable and potentially divisive' and he has decided to make himself
              unavailable for selection.</p>

              <div class="ins cleared xolcc bdrcc" style="font-style: italic;">
              <p>'I
              have thought long and hard about my position in the England football
              team in the light of the reporting and events over the last few weeks.</p>
              <p>'It has always been an honour to play for England. However, after
              careful thought I believe my position in the squad is now untenable and
              potentially divisive.</p>
              <p>'Sadly therefore I feel for the sake of the team and in order to
              avoid what will be inevitable distractions, I have decided not to put
              myself forward for selection.</p>
              <p>'I have today informed the management of this decision. I wish the team all the very best in South Africa.'</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>It leaves Fabio Capello without both his first-choice left-backs for Wednesday's friendly with Egypt, with Chelsea's
              Ashley Cole sidelined by a long-term injury, but more alarmingly this
              summer's World Cup which Bridge has confirmed he will not play in.</p>
              <p>He
              said: 'Sadly, for the sake of the team and what would be inevitable
              distractions, I have decided not to put myself forward for selection.</p>
              <p>'I
              have thought long and hard about my position in the England football
              team in the light of the reporting and events over the last few weeks
              and have today informed the management of this decision.</p>
              <p>'I wish the team all the best in South Africa.'</p>
              <p>The move comes after lurid details about a relationship between
              Bridge's former partner Vanessa Perroncel and Chelsea defender John
              Terry came to light last month.</p>
              <p>Bridge
              played with Terry for Chelsea and England but was left shocked when he
              discovered his team-mate had an affair with his former partner. It
              occurred after Bridge's move to Manchester City just over a year ago.</p>
              <p>Terry was ultimately stripped of the England captaincy by Capello,
              who earlier this week spoke of his optimism that Bridge would continue
              to play for his country.</p>
              <p>However, after a lot of soul searching, the 29-year-old feels it is an impossible situation for him to contemplate, after <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span> exclusively revealed today that defender will not shake Terry's hand
              when the pair clash at Stamford Bridge this weekend in their first
              encounter since the revelations appeared.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/25/article-1253695-0812E593000005DC-954_468x286.jpg" alt="Wayne Bridge and John Terry" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>'Potentially divisive': Bridge has rejected the chance to play alongside Terry</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>It was the delicate balancing act Capello knew he was carrying out when he<br>retained Terry in his squad whilst removing the coveted armband.</p>
              <p>The
              Italian hoped Bridge would remain involved and was scheduled to see
              both men in action on Saturday, when Chelsea entertain Manchester City.</p>
              <p>Roberto Mancini spoke about the certainty of Bridge's return to the
              England fold but there was always a feeling the full-back held a
              different opinion.</p>
              <p>News that he would not even shake Terry's hand prior to this
              weekend's game hardly gave credence to the belief any clear differences
              could be patched up.</p>
              <p>As Bridge has not formally announced his retirement from international<br> football, it can only be concluded that he would consider a return should Terry<br> not be involved.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/25/article-1253695-04D6193E0000044D-24_468x286.jpg" alt="Vanessa Perroncel" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Woman trouble: Bridge's ex Vanessa Perroncel had an affair with John Terry</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Terry must now carry with him the additional burden of knowing
              his own actions have resulted in someone he used to class as a close
              friend missing the biggest tournament any professional can be involved
              in.</p>
              <p>Quite apart from dealing with that fall-out, Capello must
              find himself alternatives at left-back given Ashley Cole is presently
              ruled out for three months with a broken ankle.</p>
              <p>Attention
              will immediately fall on Everton's Leighton Baines, who has yet to win
              a senior cap but has been in outstanding form for his club, and Aston
              Villa's Stephen Warnock.</p>
              <p>Warnock, 28, was named in Capello's squad for the recent friendly
              defeat to Brazil but his only international experience amounts to six
              minutes as a substitute against Trinidad and Tobago in June 2008.</p>
              <p>However,
              the England coach will get to see him in action during Sunday's Carling
              Cup final between Aston Villa and Manchester United at Wembley and,
              unless Capello decided to shunt Joleon Lescott into a full-back role,
              he would be the favourite to face Egypt.</p>

              <p>I suppose the only thing that John Terry can do to get back his own honour would be to offer to give up his own place in exchange for having Bridge play for England.</p>
              <p>Yeah, I know, England without John Terry isn't gonna be good for Capello's plans, but hey, it's all his fault for not keeping his terry in his pants in the first place.</p>
              <p>I certainly cannot respect a fella who cheats on his wife with his best friend's girl, and then doing nothing when that best friend gives up the honour of representing England at the world stage as a direct result.</p>

              <p>actually as a professional, and now that the deed has already been done, terry needs to consider if england needs him or bridge more. If it is bridge, he should offer to quit the team instead.</p>

              <p>The thing is, you just don't mess around with your best friend's girl, even if their relationship is on the rocks or they've just broken up or anything like that.</p>
              <p>It's not so much about Terry cheating on his wife; it's about <em>who</em> he was cheating with. If he had been soliciting a hooker in London's red light district then no one would really care except for Mrs Terry.</p>
              <p>Seriously, if Terry wants to regain any respect that he has lost, what he should do is to call for a press conference and say something like:</p>
              <p>'<em>I sincerely apologize to my good friend Wayne for my betrayal, and I am willing to forsake my place in the England team if that is what it will take for him to forgive me and to don England's colours in the World Cup</em>.'</p>
              <p>That would certainly be a nice gesture, and for all you know, Bridge and Terry may just shake hands, hug, and play together in South Africa.</p>

              <p>Bridge cannot contemplate sharing a dressing room with Terry, who is

              stripped of the captaincy following his much-publicised indiscretions.</p>

              <p>"I was flying back from Milan when Wayne Bridge announced that

              <h1>EXCLUSIVE: John Terry didn't say sorry - the real reason Wayne Bridge quit England</h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Wayne Bridge made himself unavailable for the World Cup because
              of John Terry’s failure to apologise, leaving him convinced he could
              not spend any time in close<br>proximity to the disgraced former England captain.</p>
              <p>Bridge
              gave serious thought to walking away from international football from
              the moment news broke of Terry’s affair with his recently estranged
              partner, Vanessa Perroncel.</p>
              <p>But when Terry showed no signs of
              remorse in the statement he issued the day he was stripped of the
              England captaincy — and in his conduct towards Bridge himself — the
              Manchester City full back realised living in such close quarters to his
              one-time friend and colleague for the duration of a tournament was
              going to be impossible.</p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/25/article-0-08767EB6000005DC-896_233x359.jpg" alt="Right, I'm off: Bridge leaves Manchester City training after dropping his bombshell" width="233" height="359">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Right, I'm off: Bridge leaves Manchester City training after dropping his bombshell</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The pair did have the briefest of exchanges, abruptly ended by
              Bridge when he realised the identity of the caller. That did not stop
              Terry telling senior members of the England coaching staff that he had
              made contact in a vain attempt to allay their concerns and protect his
              position as England captain.</p>
              <p>Bridge still agonised over the
              decision, his mind torn between the sense of responsibility he feels
              towards his country and the sheer horror of having to deal with Terry.</p>
              <p>A
              shy man who has never felt comfortable with the celebrity status many
              millionaire footballers enjoy, he also struggled with the idea of being
              at the centre of so much media attention.</p>
              <p>On Thursday, Fabio
              Capello tried to persuade Bridge to remain an England footballer at a
              time when a serious injury to Ashley Cole, and concerns over the
              fitness and form of Rio Ferdinand, Terry and Glen Johnson, have left
              the Italian facing a serious defensive crisis.</p>
              <p>If Cole fails to recover in time for the World Cup, Capello regards Everton’s Leighton<br>Baines
              or Aston Villa’s Stephen Warnock as the only serious options at left
              back, although he may yet consider the versatile James Milner as an
              option.</p>
              <p>Bridge has been in regular contact with Capello’s assistant Franco Baldini, the man<br>who
              liaises with the players on the England manager’s behalf. Baldini did
              everything he could to assure Bridge that he still had a future with
              England.</p>
              <p>In a long conversation he told the player that the
              management were extremely sympathetic to his situation and offered him
              their full support.</p>
              <p>‘No one can feel how Wayne feels at the moment,’ said a source close to the Capello<br>camp.
              ‘He was told it would be silly to give up an opportunity to play in the
              World Cup but obviously he has changed his mind a lot in the last three
              or four weeks. He has been thinking about it every day.</p>
              <p>‘He
              just cannot carry on with the scandal, so he has decided to give it up.
              He was told how much we care about him. He’s a really nice guy. He was
              told how disappointed we are with this decision.</p>
              <p>‘But we wish
              him all the best, and he knows the door is always open even though this
              is apparently his final decision. You know how many left backs we have
              fit and available? Baines and Warnock — that’s it.’</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Unrepentant: Terry has refused to apologise to Bridge</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Last night Capello said he hoped Bridge would have a change of heart. ‘I was flying<br>back from Milan when Wayne Bridge announced that he would not stay with us for the<br>Egypt match next week and also in South Africa for the World Cup,’ he said.</p>
              <p>‘It
              surprised me but I respect the decision of all the players. But the
              door is always open for him. We have time. There are still three months
              until I decide my final squad for South Africa. I hope Wayne Bridge
              will be with us at the World Cup.’</p>
              <p>In fairness to Bridge, a factor in his decision was putting the welfare of the England squad ahead of any personal ambition.</p>
              <p>He
              knew how much unwanted attention his inclusion would attract and he
              could not be certain his presence alongside Terry would not prove
              divisive.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>So many questions: Capello has decisions to make</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>In a statement issued through his lawyers yesterday, Bridge said: ‘I
              have thought long and hard about my position in the England team in the
              light of the reporting and events over the last few weeks. It has
              always been an honour to play for England. However, after careful
              thought I believe my position in the squad is now untenable and
              potentially divisive.</p>
              <p>‘Sadly, therefore, for the sake of the team and in order to avoid what will be inevitable<br>distractions,
              I have decided not to put myself forward for selection. I have today
              informed the management of this decision. I wish the team all the very
              best in South Africa.’</p>
              <p>Even this week, Bridge was left distinctly unimpressed by an interview Terry gave to a<br>national newspaper. Again there was no remorse. Just the self-obsessed nonsense of someone with no sense of responsibility.</p>
              <p>‘I want to the win the World Cup and the Champions League and I’m not ashamed to say it,’ Terry declared.</p>
              <p>‘I’m playing my heart out,’ he then went on, even if the evidence at the San Siro on<br>Wednesday
              night would suggest otherwise. ‘I’m responding (to a situation of his
              own making) by doing what I’ve always done; by looking straight ahead.
              I’ve got broad<br>shoulders and nothing is going to knock me off my stride.’</p>
              <p>As
              someone who knows Terry said after he emerged from that brief encounter
              with Capello at Wembley: ‘Remorse? John thinks it’s a detective John
              Thaw used to play on TV.’</p>
              <p>PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor said his union had tried to resolve the situation.</p>
              <p>‘The
              PFA offered to help and contacted both parties with a view to acting as
              mediators,’ said Taylor. ‘But neither came back to us. I am surprised
              and saddened that this matter could not be resolved.’ </p>

              <p>Bridge still intends to line up against Terry when Manchester City meet Chelsea at<br>Stamford Bridge on Saturday, a game Capello plans to attend.</p>
              <p>But
              Bridge’s absence from next week’s friendly at Wembley adds to the
              problems Capello must contend with a mere three-and-a-half months
              before the World Cup begins.</p>
              <p>England qualified in style but
              they have been seriously knocked out of their stride by the injuries to
              Ferdinand, Cole and Johnson, as well as the loss of form suffered by
              Terry recently amid concerns about his fitness.</p>
              <p>Ferdinand would have been named captain next week and Capello still wants him to<br>report to the team hotel in Hertfordshire for the meeting the manager intends to have<br>with his players.</p>
              <p>After the recent scandals concerning Terry and Cole, Capello will remind them of their responsibilities.</p>
              <p>Yesterday
              Sir Alex Ferguson said he did not object to Ferdinand travelling to
              Hertfordshire despite the need for treatment on his chronic back
              condition.</p>

              <p>The way I see it, Terry really has nothing (much) to lose by
                  reciprocating the gesture and publicly apologizing to Bridge. The
                  way I see it, if he were to do the press conference I
                  suggested:</p>
              <p><strong>If Bridge forgives him unconditionally
                  =&gt;</strong> Terry gets back his honour, they both play in
                  South Africa, and they become best of friends again.</p>
              <p><strong>If Bridge doesn't forgive him =&gt;</strong> Bridge
                  becomes the bad guy, Terry gets back his honour, Bridge doesn't
                  play in South Africa.</p>
              <p><strong>If Bridge forgives him but still refuses to play with
                  Terry =&gt;</strong> Bridge becomes the bad guy, Terry gets back
                  his honour, Bridge doesn't play in South Africa.</p>
              <p><strong>If Bridge goes back to the England team but kicks Terry
                  out =&gt;</strong> Bridge becomes the bad guy, Terry gets back his
                  honour, Terry doesn't play in South Africa.</p>
              <p>Seriously, silence is the worst thing that John Terry can do
                  right now.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>well, the irony now is that with Terry's silence, some factors are applauding his focus on the football and not letting anything else ruin his concentration.</p>
              <p>And given England's friendly coming up, some even questions why Bridge is making his decision now, is it a ploy to "screw" terry given the media spotlight is on Cole's affairs?</p>
              <p>Footballing wise, I think Terry is a man-mountain for Club and Country.But morally, he is the pits (to do what he did and still lie about it).</p>

              <p>Actually I feel this kind of things can not only just blame Terry. Bridge's ex wife plays a part too. It takes 2 hands to CLAP!</p>
              <p>If the ex-wife wasn;t h0rny, why would they had an affair? Anyway even if WB doesn't play, there are still many England left-backs who can do a decent job that he does such as Stephen Warnock and Leighton Baines.</p>

              <p>No one said that Bridge's girl is innocent.</p>
              <p>All we're saying is that had Terry been thinking with the right kind of head, he would have realized that bonking his best friend's girl is probably the worst idea in the world.</p>
              <p>And while it takes two hands to clap, it takes only one hand to keep his pants zipped.</p>
