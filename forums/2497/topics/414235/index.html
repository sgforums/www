              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Fancy a move to England? Argentina legend Diego Maradona</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Diego Maradona may be English football's public enemy No 1, but all 
              the Argentina legend wants for his 50th birthday is a job in the 
              Barclays Premier League.</p>
              <p>The so-called 'Hand of God' cheat admits 
              he's been talking to Kevin Keegan about life at the top in England and 
              is eager to get back into work after being disappointed when leading his
               country at this year's World Cup in South Africa.</p>
              <p>Maradona was linked with the Aston Villa job before Gerard Houllier replaced Martin O'Neill in the West Midlands.</p>
              <p>And while the former Napoli striker says he never had talks about that job - he would be keen in other opportunities.</p>
              <p>'Of
               course I would like to manage in the Premier League,' he told Sky 
              Sports News ahead of his milestone birthday on Saturday. 'It has very 
              good teams, an exceptional level and great players.</p>
              <p>'The only problem is all the teams I like in England have good coaches. If any important job comes along I will accept it.</p>
              <p>'I was looking at Arsenal and Chelsea, and talking to Kevin Keegan.</p>
              <p>'Everything
               is so professional there: the players, the managers, the coaches. The 
              players are surrounded by everything they need. Everything is 
              phenomenal.'</p>

              <p>Despite having little coaching experience, Maradona was a 
              controversial choice as Argentina boss Alfio Basile was axed two years 
              ago this month.</p>
              <p>His tactical acumen was often questioned, ensuing 
              in fiery exchanges with the press, but players rallied around the former
               No 10 in the run-up to the World Cup.</p>
              <p>However, his side were 
              spanked 4-0 by Germany in the quarter-final and Maradona lost his job 
              soon after in a dispute over the make-up of his backroom staff.</p>
              <p>The one-time drug abuser admits he won't walk back into that job any 
              time soon, but he also sought to set the record straight about reports 
              linking him to a plethora of jobs since the summer.</p>

              <p>'I want to be very clear that I didn't offer myself for any job, nor 
              did anyone offer me anything,' he said. 'It bothered really me when I 
              was mentioned for Mexico and Aston Villa.</p>
              <p>'But I know I will 
              go back with the national team some day, that is my fate. I'm waiting. 
              They took away the national team from me unfairly.</p>
              <p>'I don't want 
              to talk about it, it doesn't deserve any words. I am in too good a mood 
              to talk about people who don't deserve my words. But I do miss the 
              national team.</p>
