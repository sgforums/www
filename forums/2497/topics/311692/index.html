              <p class="art-p"><strong>Steven Gerrard appears to have been ruled out of the race to become Fabio Capello's long-term England captain as the Italian looks for the on-field lieutenant who can be his eyes and ears.</strong></p>
              <p class="art-p">Chelsea skipper John Terry and surprise runner Gareth Barry are both in the frame to take over the role in France next week. But David Beckham can expect to enjoy a final outing as captain - if he is picked to earn his 100th cap.</p>
              <p class="art-p">Capello will unveil his provisional squad for the Paris friendly today, and is set to confirm a significantly different selection from the one he announced for his opening match last month. Arsenal's teenage prodigy Theo Walcott is poised for his first senior call since he went to the 2006 World Cup under Sven Goran Eriksson and never kicked a ball in anger.</p>
              <p class="art-p">Uncapped Aston Villa striker Gabriel Agbonlahor is firmly in the frame alongside Middlesbrough stopper David Wheater. Capello intends to change the entire culture of the England squad and team he inherited from Steve McClaren. And it looks like being a case of Hello, Goodbye to Liverpool's Gerrard as Capello's captain after just one match - the coach's first in the 2-1 Wembley win over Switzerland. While Capello believes Gerrard can be the same inspirational figure for his country he has proved to be time and again for his club, the England boss is concerned that he has yet to transfer his Liverpool form to the international stage.</p>
              <p class="art-p">The Italian fears Gerrard may be inhibited by the burden of leading the Three Lions and wants him to have the freedom to play his natural game, acting as a talisman for the team. It means a new captain - as Capello promised when he said he would give trials to three or four potential skippers before making his final choice for the kick-off to the World Cup qualifying campaign next season.</p>
              <p class="art-p">Capello is determined to find a leader in the mould of his former AC Milan skipper, the magnificent Franco Baresi. Terry, who led McClaren's team on 13 occasions but missed the Swiss game with a broken foot, is favourite. Beckham, set to be given the all-clear to compete to become only the fifth England centurion, would be the obvious compromise candidate if he is named in the starting side on his milestone appearance. Villa skipper Barry has emerged as a serious contender, with Capello understood to have been impressed with his tactical acumen and footballing intelligence during last month's training session.</p>
              <p class="art-p">Michael Owen has publicly admitted his anxieties and is no longer an automatic selection - despite his 40 England goals. But the Newcastle striker will be included for the trip to the ground where he scored on his last international visit, coming off the bench under Kevin Keegan to equalise in 2000.</p>
              <p class="art-p">Agbonlahor could start however as the foil to Wayne Rooney, with his pace having caught the eye of the new England high command. Walcott has also impressed Capello and his coaching staff with his cameo appearances off the Arsenal bench. Frank Lampard is certain of a recall after injury while Glenn Johnson, Michael Carrick and Stewart Downing, all cut from the last provisional squad when Capello reduced his list to 23 names, should get another opportunity.</p>
              <p class="art-p">But the surprise name could well be Boro defender Wheater, who has impressed Capello with his rugged, no-nonsense attitude. The centre-half would have been included to face the Swiss but for a crucial Under-21 game for Stuart Pearce's team.</p>
              <p class="art-p"><strong>Probable Squad:</strong> James, Carson, Kirkland, Bridge, A Cole, Ferdinand, G Johnson, Brown, Terry, Woodgate, Wheater, Lescott, Carrick, Gerrard, Barry, Jenas, Hargreaves, J Cole, Lampard, A Young, Downing, Beckham, Walcott, Bentley, Lennon, Agbonlahor, Owen, Rooney, Defoe, Crouch.</p>

              <p class="art-p"><strong>THE CANDIDATES TO LEAD ENGLAND.. AND WHO HAS THE 'BARESI FACTOR'</strong></p>
              <p class="art-p"><strong>JOHN TERRY</strong></p>
              <p class="art-p">Caps: 42 As Captain: 13</p>
              <p class="art-p">Leadership: Held his Chelsea side together in the storm caused by Jose Mourinho's departure.</p>
              <p class="art-p">Commitment: Nobody puts their body on the line more than JT, and has the bruises, cuts and broken bones to prove it.</p>
              <p class="art-p">Experience: First-choice for England since 2003. Reputation not sullied by McClaren reign.</p>
              <p class="art-p">Baresi Factor: Has to use his brain when his legs won't get there, and able to break out from the back too.</p>
              <p class="art-p"><strong>DAVID BECKHAM</strong></p>
              <p class="art-p">Caps: 99 As Captain: 58</p>
              <p class="art-p">Leadership: A huge influence at his peak, but even Becks knows those days are past. Aware that he may be an impact player for the rest of his England career.</p>
              <p class="art-p">Commitment: Gone are the days when he could run himself ragged, yet still cares deeply and passionately.</p>
              <p class="art-p">Experience: Only Moore, Wright and Robson have led England more times.</p>
              <p class="art-p">Baresi Factor: He was always about inspiration rather than cold-headed composure.</p>
              <p class="art-p"><strong>STEVEN GERRARD</strong></p>
              <p class="art-p">Caps 64 As Captain: 7</p>
              <p class="art-p">Leadership: Talisman of Liverpool for almost a decade and arguably the most inspirational player in English football. But does appear stifled by Three Lions armband.</p>
              <p class="art-p">Commitment: Total and unapologetic. Would do anything to win for club and country.</p>
              <p class="art-p">Experience: Seven times England skipper under three managers.</p>
              <p class="art-p">Baresi Factor: Capello wants someone who can embody his thinking. But Gerro may be too much of a free spirit for that.</p>
              <p class="art-p"><strong>GARETH BARRY</strong></p>
              <p class="art-p">Caps: 17 As Captain: 0</p>
              <p class="art-p">Leadership: Skippered Villa for two seasons, and also led David Platt's Under-21s. Martin O'Neill is huge admirer of his qualities.</p>
              <p class="art-p">Commitment: Knows how to put his foot in when required, but he rarely over-commits and keeps onside with the refs.</p>
              <p class="art-p">Experience: England debut in 2000 and played under six international bosses, yet less than 20 caps.</p>
              <p class="art-p">Baresi Factor: Twice reinvented, from left-back to centre-half, then into midfield. Can think way through a game.</p>
              <p class="art-p"><strong>WAYNE ROONEY</strong></p>
              <p class="art-p">Caps: 41 As Captain: 0</p>
              <p class="art-p">Leadership: The one England player capable of changing a game on his own.</p>
              <p class="art-p">Commitment: Too much at times, especially if frustrated. Seven bookings and a red card already on England duty.</p>
              <p class="art-p">Experience: Still only 22 but has been on the scene for five years.</p>
              <p class="art-p">Baresi Factor: Not much at first glance - but the chains of office could make the difference.</p>
