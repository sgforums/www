The Chelsea boss insists he will walk away with Â£1million in his pocket and land another job inside a couple of months if Chelsea sack him.</strong><br><br>His boast came as Abramovich made a fresh move for Portsmouth coach Avram Grant. The swoop is sure to leave Mourinho fuming. Blues owner Abramovich tried to install Grant earlier this term to help Andriy Shevchenko discover his scoring touch.<br><br>But the move was vetoed by Mourinho, who insisted only he picked his coaching staff Â— not Rom Â— and warned he would quit if there was any interference. He believed Abramovich was trying to make Grant assistant manager, replacing Steve Clarke. Rom claimed that was not the idea and has now decided Grant will join the coaching team Â— whether Mourinho likes it or not.<br><br>The billionaire remains furious over MourinhoÂ’s criticism of the board and the claim that he was unable to buy players. A source close to Abramovich said: Â“Roman is still annoyed with Jose and doesnÂ’t know whether he will be manager next season.<br><br>Â“Jose has to see things from RomanÂ’s point of view if they are to work together in the long term. Â“Roman wants Grant and Jose needs to realise that.Â” Mourinho has now said the only way he will leave is if he is sacked.<br><br>He added: Â“The only pressure is the pressure I make on myself. I donÂ’t accept pressure from other people.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The past few weeks he seem to have tried very hard to get back into Roman's good books but it looks like Roman is not interested and didn't turn up for their matches... Even their Carling cup celebration Roman wasn't interested and didn't even bother to attend cos he didn't want to see jose... and having to answer questions from the players that jose's future is still with chelsea.<br><br>I guess the writing is on the wall for jose... So now he seem to be talking tough again and have abandon any idea of getting into Roman's good book anymore...<br><br>I thought his compensation was $5m... now only $1m... wouldn't be much to Roman to get this headache out of his head...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Maybe jose can walk across London to West Ham... Maybe they may need a new manager...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Mourinho: Let Roman sack me if he dares</strong></span><br><br><strong>Jose Mourinho may be living on borrowed time at Stamford Bridge, but the brazen Chelsea chief is showing no signs of stress as he prepares to face Porto on Tuesday evening. Mourinho has been shadow boxing with Roman Abramovich since the summer, but on Monday night he taunted the man who will decide his future at the end of the season. The Chelsea boss is in bullish mood ahead of Tuesday night's Champions League clash which stands at 1-1 after the first leg. He invited Abramovich to "make me a millionaire" if he decides to sack him. </strong><br><br>Despite winning the Carling Cup - his fourth major trophy in less than three seasons at Chelsea - success in the Champions League appears to be the only way Mourinho can safeguard his future at Stamford Bridge. Mourinho said: "If the club decides to sack me because of bad results, that's part of the game. If that happens, I'll be a millionaire and I will get another club a couple of months later.<br><br>"There is no pressure on me. I don't accept pressure from other people. I've won a lot of things in my career, but I cannot win every time, every year or every week. "I have a happy family, my kids are healthy, I have a lot of friends and I live a good life. The pressure I put on myself is the pressure I put myself under since I was a kid.<br><br>"One day I will play against Chelsea. You cannot make your career thinking about I was in this club or that club. You have to play the game without special emotions. It's just another game.<br><br>Mourinho has a contract with Chelsea until 2010 and although it is worth Â£20m, he will have to accept a fraction of that figure if he takes up another position. That prospect is increasingly likely and it is known that Abramovich, who is an intensely private individual, has not been impressed with Mourinho's frequent public outbursts.<br><br>Abramovich will take a view on Mourinho's future at the end of the season, but if their season implodes against Porto this evening, he is unlikely to survive much beyond May 13.<br></div>
