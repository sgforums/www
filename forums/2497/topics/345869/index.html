              <h1>Crazy Rafa blames the world and admits: I don't know what is happening at Liverpool anymore...<br></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img title="Rafa in new 'crazy' rant" src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00721/LIVER-SPLASH1_721418a.jpg" alt="Rafa in new 'crazy' rant" width="516" height="250"></p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">LIVERPOOL lost further ground in the title race as Rafa Benitez went closer to losing the plot. </h2>
              <p class="article">The Kop boss launched into another bizarre tirade no one could understand — just 19 days after his notorious rant at Alex Ferguson. </p>
              <p class="article">And with outcast striker Robbie Keane only on the bench, Benitez saw his side squander a 1-0 lead against Wigan and the chance to draw level with Fergie’s Manchester United at the top.</p>
              <p class="article">The Anfield boss, whose side slipped to third after being held 1-1 at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/wigan-athletic.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Wigan</span></a>, admitted he was disappointed to take only a point from a game he claimed became ‘crazy’ in the second half.</p>
              <p class="article">In a post-match analysis that left people scratching their heads, Benitez babbled: “We didn’t kill the game and in the second half it was a crazy game. </p>
              <p class="article">“And when it is a crazy game, you cannot control things. Why was it crazy? Because it was crazy.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <h4>Disappointed</h4>
              <p class="article">Then, in a lucid moment after the 1-1 draw, he said: “We lost two points. We were much better in the first half. I am not disappointed with Wigan’s approach. I am disappointed with other things. </p>
              <p class="article">“We’ve been giving away too many points. This has happened in the last three games and it’s something I don’t like. </p>
              <p class="article">“I know why but I cannot say anything. The players were OK, the second half it changed because it was crazy.” </p>
              <p class="article">Benitez appeared to launch a veiled attack on ref Phil Dowd for not protecting his players. He added: “I was talking to my players about things on the pitch but there are some things you can’t control.” </p>
              <p class="article">Liverpool have not won any of their four games since Benitez had a go at Ferguson for confronting referees. </p>
              <p class="article">But the Kop chief said: “I have no psychological battles with him.”</p>

              haha..he really lost his marbles.
              
              Looking at his cryptic reply regarding the future of Robbie Keane, you can tell as much.  Reminds me of the morbic replies that Avant Grant gave towards the end of last season.
              
              Liverpool, another season of empty handed-ness.  come this weekend, the nail will be driven into the coffin when they play Chelsea.

              <p><strong>Rafael Benitez appears to be losing the plot. </strong><strong>The Spaniard's </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool </strong></span></a><strong>side lost further ground in the Barclays Premier League title race after drawing 1-1 at Wigan, and the Anfield boss afterwards claimed he became ‘crazy’ in the second half.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Benitez garbled: ‘We had control of the game in the first half and didn’t kill it off. In the second half it was a crazy game. 'When you don’t control crazy games you don’t win points. I don’t know what is happening.</p>
              <p>'Actually I do know, but I can’t say anything about it. It is just crazy. 'You can’t control what you can’t change. It could be like this for years. 'Alex Ferguson has been here for 22 years and you can see what it means when you have been here for so long. The past three games have something in common I don’t like.’</p>
              <p>Benitez refused to explain whether his anger was directed at his players for letting slip a 41st-minute lead handed to them by Yossi Benayoun, at referee Phil Dowd who awarded the late penalty from which Mido equalised, or the outside influence of his old enemy, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United</span></a> boss Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p>So, is Benitez losing the plot? Here's the evidence to suggest he is:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h1><span style="font-size: large;">RESULTS</span></h1>
              <p>Four draws and only one win in 2009 has seen Liverpool squander top spot on the Premier League. And that one victory was against Championship side Preston in the FA Cup. Liverpool are now third in the table after League draws at Stoke, home to Merseyside rivals and at Wigan.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Remember, the amazing press conference where Benitez had a pop at old foe Ferguson earlier this month?</strong></p>
              <p>Since his attack on Fergie, Benitez has failed to produce a win. Meanwhile, European and world champions United have produce six stunning victories. The latest being a thumping 5-0 rout of West Brom.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex has kept his cool throughout, steadily chipping away at Liverpool's title aspirations as United march on. Here's what the United manager said the day after Rafa's rant: 'People say every season, it's going to be three or four teams challenging for the title,' said Ferguson. 'But I'm of the opinion it comes down to two teams when you enter the last month.</p>
              <p>'Chelsea have contested the league for the last four years and I think they have the experience to be our main rivals again. You have to think that will count for something. It's a change for Liverpool fans and players to even be talking about winning the league. They haven't been able to do that for 19 years, or at least a good few years.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large;">TACTICS</span></p>
              <p>Dirk Kuyt has been fantastic for Benitez this season. So much so that Juventus have expressed an interest in signing the Dutchman. But the Liverpool boss failed to name the forward in his starting XI at Wigan - and didn't even bring him on as a substitute until the 75th minute at the JJB.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Best of friends: Benitez welcomes Robbie Keane to Liverpool last summer</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Hauling off Liverpool's living legend - and consistent match-winner - Steven Gerrard five minutes from the final whistle, when the Reds should have been pushing for a winner, was widely seen as a mistake.</strong></p>
              <p>Benitez explained that his captain was tired. Why does he keep picking Lucas? And why did he spend £20million on Robbie Keane when he clearly doesn't rate him?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large;">ANFIELD ANGST</span></p>
              <p>Benitez's refusal to sign a new contract at Anfield has highlighted deep division within the Liverpool hierarchy. It is reported that the Spaniard is at loggerheads with chief executive  Rick Parry over his role in transfer policy and  influence over the club's academy. </p>
              <p>His difficulties with American owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett have boiled over into public attacks, including criticism of the club's handling of the lack of contract negotiations with Daniel Agger.</p>
