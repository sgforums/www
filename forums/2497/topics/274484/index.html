Curbishley is furious that Konchesky alleged: "There was, and still are, a lot of unhappy players at the club who don't like him."</strong><br><br>The West Ham manager is said to be particularly unhappy about Konchesky's assertion that: "I am sure that is one of the reasons why Carlos Tevez didn't stay at the club and also why Darren Bent refused to sign."<br><br>It is understood that Curbishley, who allowed Konchesky to move to Fulham during the summer, is most upset by that specific allegation. Tevez was in and out of the West Ham team before Curbishley took over in mid-season and the Argentine blossomed when the former Charlton manager decided to play him further up the pitch.<br><br>Bent had been quoted as saying that he decided on a move to Spurs rather than West Ham because he didn't feel that Curbishley, who was his manager at Charlton, could improve him any more as a player but the striker has since denied saying that.<br></div>

Konchesky played under Curbishley at Charlton and West Ham but left the East End club this summer and insists the Hammers chief was his motivation for leaving.</strong><br><br>"There was, and still is, a lot of unhappy players at the club who don't like him. I am one of them and he knows that, and that is why I left the club," he told The People. "I know there are a lot of players who don't think he is any good. "I am sure that is one of the main reasons Carlos Tevez didn't stay at the club, and also why Darren Bent refused to sign for West Ham. It was because of the manager. "He is hard to get on with. He doesn't have much banter; he is serious all the time, he keeps himself to himself and doesn't get involved - very old school."<br></div>
