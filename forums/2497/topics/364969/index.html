              <h1>CHELSEA HUNT KOP ACE</h1>
              <div class="image-holder"><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00045/516_Torres_45975a.jpg" alt="" width="516" height="230"></div>
              <h2>Carlo Ancelotti ready to launch audacious bid</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>CHELSEA are ready to test Liverpool's resolve with a £50million bid for Fernando Torres.</h3>
              <p>Carlo Ancelotti has already targeted Torres' Spain strike partner David Villa, offering Valencia £35m. Now the Blues boss is ready to make an audacious attempt to unite Villa and Torres at club level.</p>
              <p>Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez will do all he can to block the move. But he is worried the huge sum offered by Chelsea could tempt American owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks.</p>
              <p>Liverpool's true financial state will be revealed over the coming weeks and Benitez is beginning to fear the worst.</p>
              <p>At the end of the season Benitez was hopeful of landing 27-year-old Villa. Now he not only has to face up to Chelsea signing Villa but also targeting Torres.</p>
              <p>Villa's proposed move to Real Madrid has not gone through because Chelsea's bid is £4m higher and is preferred by debt- ridden Valencia.</p>
              <p>Now Blues owner Roman Abramovich is prepared to take advantage of Liverpool's own money worries by making the sort of offer he hopes Gillett and Hicks will not be able to refuse.</p>
              <p>It is understood a tentative inquiry was made by a third party in April about how much it would cost to prise Torres away from Anfield.</p>
              <p>The message from Liverpool at the time was that there was no chance of Torres being sold. Then in May the 25-year-old striker signed an improved deal to 2013.</p>
              <p>If necessary, Ancelotti and Abramovich will settle for just landing Villa. But if there is even an outside chance of snatching Torres away from Anfield, they will take it.</p>

              <h1>Chelsea join £18million race to grab Liverpool ace Xabi Alonso</h1>
              <div id="article-body">
              <div class="art-o art-align-left"><img src="http://images.mirror.co.uk/upl/m4/jun2009/0/0/xabi-alonso-pic-getty-572586689.jpg" border="0" alt="Xabi Alonso (pic:Getty)" width="450" height="296"></div>
              <p><em>Chelsea have joined the race to sign Spanish midfielder Xabi Alonso.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The Blues will go head-to-head with Real Madrid in an £18million battle for the Liverpool star. The future of Alonso, 27, has been the subject of intense speculation since the end of the season. He cast further doubt about where he will be playing next season during the Confederations Cup tournament in South Africa.</strong></p>
              <p>Alonso was non-committal about his plans – the broadest hint yet that he is on his way out of Liverpool, who are also battling to keep Argentine international Javier Mascherano.</p>
              <p>Mascherano is wanted by Barcelona – and sources in Spain last night suggested that if he did join the European champions, Manchester United would move for Barca’s versatile Yaya Toure. Chelsea have also been alerted to Alonso’s unrest and he is a player who is admired by new manager Carlo Ancelotti. The Italian is aware Chelsea need to bring down the average age of their midfield.</p>
              <p>Frank Lampard was 31 yesterday and Michael Ballack will be 33 in September.</p>
              <p>Temporary manager Guus Hiddink said before he left his stand-in role in May that Chelsea needed to inject younger players into their squad – and Alonso would fit the bill perfectly.</p>
              <p>He arrived at Anfield five years ago from Real Sociedad for £10.5m and has established himself as a key member of the first-team squad under Rafa Benitez. But his relationship with the manager became increasingly frosty last season and it now looks likely that he will be on his way out of Liverpool this summer.</p>
              <p>Real would love to bring him back to Spain. It is appreciated at the Bernabeu that while Real will have an unstoppable strike force with the likes of Kaka, Cristiano Ronaldo and possibly Franck Ribery, there is also the need for more stability in central midfield.</p>
              <p>Alonso would bring that balance. He has developed into a highly-rated part of the Spain outfit who have the No.1 ranking in the world following their success in Euro 2008 a year ago in Austria and Switzerland.</p>
              <p>Alonso is certain to be an integral part of Vincente del Bosque’s plans for the World Cup finals in South Africa next summer. But it has also been recognised at Chelsea that Alonso has adapted well into life in the Premier League and he speaks perfect English.</p>
              <p>His style would also suit Ancelotti and he could now become the former Milan manager’s first major signing at Stamford Bridge.</p>

              <p>If Ronaldo is worth 80 million to Man U. Then Liverpool will have to price Torres at least 90 million. With that price tag, we will seriously consider selling. If Chelsea buy Torres at 90 million we will give Chelsea a 20% discount on Alonso and sell him to you at 25 million.</p>

              <p>eh by saying that we are GOING BACK to being a mid table club means we have actually been a mid table club before? Hmm lets see... for the last 20 years, Liverpool has only finished 8th once and 7th once and has never finished lower than that for the last 20 years. Hardly a mid table team huh.</p>
              <p>Now lets look at chelsea....hmmm...a mid table team? Lets see. 11th four times and 14th twice. Looks more like Chelsea has a history of a mid table team then Liverpool huh.</p>

              <p>Chelsea has been wanting to spend big this season only that Kaka, Villa and maybe Ribery didn't want to join them... But make no mistake, Chelsea will spend a decently large amount before the window close... And they will be 'hot favourite' for the title next season...</p>
              <p>The best policy, take your rivals best players... Strengthen yours team at the same time weaken theirs... 2 birds with one stone...</p>
              <p>Roman has made some money lately I guess... His company share price came down to around $5 from $116 from July to late last year, but it has now improve this year and its now up again to like $19... lol.</p>

              <p>I think alot of football club owner are underestimate the cost of running it. Player wages are getting higher and higher and is eating into their profit badly. Other than super billionaires like the Russian and arab.  I don't see other club are doing well. Valencia, West Ham, Portsmouth, Newcastle, Liverpool and Man Utd are heavily on debt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> I will not surprised Liverpool owner will cash in on Torres plus they will get rid of one of their highest paid player.</p>

              <p class="article">He vowed: "Madrid are obviously spending lots of money and I'm sure Alex

              <h2>ALONSO EXPECTS TO STAY AT LIVERPOOL.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso has said that he is not planning to leave the club this summer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Spain international has recently been linked with a move to
              Real Madrid amidst rumours of a rift between himself and Reds boss
              Rafael Benitez.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Alonso did not rule out a move away from Liverpool but insisted that he is happy at Anfield.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I am happy at Liverpool but in football you cannot close the
              doors on anything because you don't know what will happen. I do not
              plan to go," he told <em>El Pais</em>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"With Sami Hyypia already gone, I am one of the senior players alongside Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"There was strong interest in me from Madrid (in 2004) but
              Liverpool came and that is where I went. It was not a wrong decision,
              not for me anyway. I have played at Liverpool, a special club, and
              grown as a player and won titles."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 27-year-old also denied that his relationship with Benitez
              has deteriorated in light of the manager's indecision over his future
              last year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Each one has his own point of view. He is the manager and I try to do the best with what he tells me," Alonso added.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We have a good professional relationship. We speak normally,
              saying what he wants from me and what I can give. He makes the
              decisions and we try to execute them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Last summer there was certain indecision and I did not know
              what was going to happen. I finished up playing well, though. I have
              had two quite complete seasons."</p>

              <p>eh by saying that we are GOING BACK to being a mid table club
              means we have actually been a mid table club before? Hmm lets
              see... for the last 20 years, Liverpool has only finished 8th once
              and 7th once and has never finished lower than that for the last 20
              years. Hardly a mid table team huh.</p>
              <p>Now lets look at chelsea....hmmm...a mid table team? Lets see.
              11th four times and 14th twice. Looks more like Chelsea has a
              history of a mid table team then Liverpool huh.</p>

              <p>Haha I will not deny that, because its true after 1989, Liverpool has not won the league. But I was pinpointing on the guy' s statement that Liverpool was A MID TABLE team.

              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rafa Benitez</span></abbr> has fears of losing star striker <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fernando Torres</span></abbr> to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>The <em>Sunday Times</em> says the Reds manager fears that Torres could be lost to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> in a £60 million heist.</p>
              <p>Chelsea inquired about the 25-year-old earlier this year and Benitez
              believes the London club are now ready to offer as much as £60m.</p>
              <p>Chelsea are in the market for a marquee signing to launch Carlo
              Ancelotti’s reign as manager. Billionaire owner Roman Abramovich
              promised to top Madrid’s offers for Kaka this month, only for the
              Brazilian to decide that the Spanish club had a greater status.</p>
              <p>While Torres is loyal to Benitez and will not agitate for a
              move, he recently signed an improved contract which takes him to 2013
              without committing to anything more than the option of an additional
              year at Anfield.</p>
