              <h2>As if to confirm that Robinho's transfer from Real Madrid to
                  Chelsea truly is going ahead, the Chelsea Online Megastore has already
                  begun taking orders for replica kits with the player's name on the back.</h2>
              <p>Alongside Deco, Terry, Lampard, Cech and all the rest, a proud Chelsea fan can now wear the name of Robinho on his back.<br><br>This morning it was discovered that the Blues have already begun taking orders for Robinho replica kits (see <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.chelseamegastore.com/stores/chelsea/products/product_search.aspx?search=robinho">here</a></span>), indicating the club's confidence that a deal for the Brazilian will go through imminently.<br><br>Although
                  the winger has yet to be assigned a squad number, this shirt, coupled
                  with the fact that chief executive Peter Kenyon has predicted that the
                  transfer will take place today, seems to confirm that a deal is on the
                  cards.<br><br>Last week Robinho announced that he was looking to leave
                  Real Madrid in favour of the London outfit after a tumultuous summer in
                  which he was banned from going to the Olympic Games and endured
                  fruitless contract negotiations.</p>

              <h2>CALDERON: NO ROBINHO DEAL YET</h2>
              <div><img src="http://images.football365.com/08/08/240/Robinho_1134122.jpg" alt="Robinho - heavily linked with Chelsea."></div>

              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><strong>Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon insists Robinho will not be sold unless the club land a replacement. Reports had suggested that the Brazil international was close to agreeing a move to Chelsea, with a deal set to be struck before the weekend.</strong></p>
              <p>The player's agent Wagner Ribeiro had confirmed that a switch to England appeared imminent and that his client would be leaving the Bernabeu before the end of the transfer window.</p>
              <p>However, with Real's top target, Valenica striker David Villa, remaining at Los Che, Robinho may be forced to stay in the Spanish capital. Calderon certainly believes that is the case, stating once again that the player is going nowhere while he remains an integral part of the first-team fold.</p>
              <p>"The coach and the sports director want the player to stay and I am sure he will," Calderon said. "Our squad is complete and it is impossible for us to have one better than the one we have."</p>
              <p>Calderon also responded to accusations made by his Valencia counterpart Vicente Soriano that Real had acted in a high-handed manner during their pursuit of Spain international Villa.</p>
              <p>"I don't understand their anger," he said. "Soriano told me it would have to be a very large bid, and as a result I said we would not be interested, and that's it," he said.</p>

              <p><strong>Chelsea have risked angering Real Madrid by advertising replica Robinho shirts for sale before the transfer for the Brazil forward has been completed.</strong></p>
              <p>Chief executive Peter Kenyon is confident of wrapping up the deal for the 24-year-old, with Chelsea's official offer online pre-empting the move by taking orders for kits with Robinho's name printed and the number 'to be confirmed'.</p>
              <p>Despite Real president Ramon Calderon insisting "the coach and the sports director want the player to stay and I am sure he will", Robinho's departure from the Bernabeu appears inevitable.</p>
              <p>Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard believes Robinho could "light up the league".</p>
              <p>"He is a fantastic player, I saw a lot of him last season watching the Spanish games. He had a very good season until he got injured and it broke his season up a bit," Lampard said on official Chelsea website chelseafc.com.</p>
              <p>"He has great flair, and something that would be nice to bring into our team. We have flair players already but he is another option and he could light up the league.</p>
              <p>"He will have to get used to it because it is different to Spain, but he showed he is a world-class player both at Madrid and for Brazil, and world-class players adapt."</p>

              <h1>Madrid Play Good Cop, Bad Cop Over Robinho</h1>
              <h2>Just as Robinho's move to Chelsea looked set to go through, Ramón Calderón has announced that the Brazilian will not be leaving. At least not yet.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/33587_news.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Los Merengues' president told reporters that the Spanish club's squad was complete and hinted that the only way a player could go was if a replacement was brought in first. Madrid are attempting to sign one more player before the transfer window closes but have already been rebuffed in their bids for David Villa and Santi Cazorla.<br><br>Without any new arrivals, Chelsea may well end the summer disappointed as Calderón will do everything he can to ensure that Robinho does ont move to England. "The coach and the sports director want the player to stay and I am sure he will," he stated.<br><br>"Our squad is complete and it is impossible for us to have one better than the one we have." Chelsea have already begun to sell the club's new shirts with Robinho's name on the back and Calderón may have made the statement to placate fans worried that a hole would be left in the squad.<br><br>Madrid have reportedly turned their attention to Valencia's Joaquín, who would play down the right flank in place of the wantaway Brazilian.</p>

              <h2>Top Five Uses For Your Robinho Chelsea shirt</h2>
              <p>1. Name your child Robinho and plead ignorance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Have your name changed by deed poll. That goes for you too, Roman Robinho.</p>
              <p>3. Use it as a duster - it’s the right colour anyway.</p>
              <p>4. Rip the R, N, H and O off and pretend you went for John OBI Mikel.</p>
              <p>5. Storm into Abramovich’s office, slap him round the face with it and demand a refund.</p>
