              <p>why did chelsea start with ferriera instead of ivanovic?</p>
              <p>ferriera obviously cant handle beal's pace.  it was a terrible mistake.</p>
              <p>is terry a hero or villain?</p>
              <p>he missed the penalty that could have won chelsea the CL.</p>
              <p>his sex scandal caused chelsea a lot of misery and points. </p>
              <p>his handball led to the penalty that resulted in spur's opening goal.</p>
              <p>his 2 silly tackles resulted in a red.  how many games will he missed in the run in?  will it cause chelsea the title?</p>
              <p>chelsea lost the initiative right from the start when they played deep in their own half.</p>
              <p>spurs were fantastic and deserved the victory.  its a good thing for the premiership.</p>

              <p>I think Chelsea just felt the pressure that is why they performed the way they did as the last 10 mins even with 10 men, they showed they are still a force to be reckon with...</p>
              <p>I just think the way United won at City had effected them mentally. It also gave Spurs all the encouragement to fight for their own destiny... which they did with great determination.</p>
              <p>Now United have another problem of their own, and that is how to beat a Spurs side with such strong beliefs next week?</p>
              <p>But to be honest, I felt the title race was realistically all over last week when United drop points at Blackburn... But those 2 points could still come back to haunt them... Had they got those 2 points, I think they will have a much better chance from the last 3 matches of the season... Now it seems, it might be a little too late but at least last night's results kept the Premier League interesting for another few weeks... And still kept United's slim hope alive.</p>

              This year's EPL is the closest and most exciting in years, not just in the title race but also the race for 4th spot. This weekend's matches and results simply add to the excitement and uncertainty.
              
              My comments on the Tot v Che game. Tottenham took the game to the league leaders and played very very well. For the 2nd time this season, Chelsea were made to look like a pale shadow of their usual self (first time was against Inter) by their opponents. Bale, rejuvenated this season, was the main source of danger for tottenham down the left as always. I thought Pavyluchenko linked up well with his teammates in attack but were let down by 2 very bad finishes by his standards. You could almost felt his disgust and dissapointment he had with himself just by looking at his body language. Hope he will come back stronger and better after this game, after having such a rich vein of form weeks ago. Dawson was rock solid throughout the match, and with Capello watching the game, he could well be a surprise candidate to make it to south africa. The JT handball was never a handball, but the penalty awarded made up for the other penalty appeal seconds prior to the handball incident, which was definitely a penalty. Lastly, it's a been a long time since Didier Drogba played a full match and felt almost non-existent during the game.
              
              To summarize, the league leaders got run over by a white truck last night.

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">CARLO ANCELOTTI saw Chelsea slip up at Spurs but roared: This changes nothing. Ancelotti's men blew a chance to stretch their lead at the top by losing 2-1 at White Hart Lane.</h2>
              <p class="article">Manchester United are just a point behind after they beat deadly rivals City in the early kick-off. But the Stamford Bridge boss insisted: "The title is still in our hands.</p>
              <p class="article">"We don't have to be afraid — we just have to look to the next game against Stoke. "I don't think the players were nervous, we knew how important this game was. "We didn't do so good but Tottenham played very well, at the same level as they did against Arsenal. "We were a little bit down, but this is football."</p>
              <p class="article">Spurs boss Harry Redknapp meanwhile claimed his side were worthy winners — and exceeded their performance in midweek. He said: "We deserved, there's no doubt about that. I thought we were even better today than we were against Arsenal.</p>
              <p class="article">"That first 30 minutes or so we completely dominated and then we had some great chances in the second half. "We missed three or four unbelievable opportunities to really kill them off completely."</p>
              <p class="article">Despite opening up a two-point lead in fourth over fellow Champions League rivals Manchester City, Redknapp is refusing to get carried away.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: "I still think it's going to be close. Villa and Liverpool have it all to do to catch us but certainly Man City have still got a great chance. We have still got to go to City."</p>

              <p>There is only one more hurdle left in chelsea's race to the title IMO and that is liverpool... If pool upped their game and forced out a win or draw, they might just allow manchester united to grab their 19th title to eclipse liverpool's record...</p>
              <p>If they want to deny manchester united the chance to get the title, they can play an under-strength side and bend over for chelsea to get all 3 points... but they might risked finishing 7th... lol... dilemma sia</p>

              <p>So far most of the sides have been very professional about it like Blackburn despite nothing to play for did all they could to stop United... And Big Sam is also Fergie's good friend. So I don't expect Pool to turn over for their last match of the season at Anfield.</p>
              <p>To be honest, Its very difficult to get points at Anfield especially for big sides... Cos they always up their game when big sides come calling... So I don't really expect Chelsea to get all 3 points there cos they are under pressure at the moment so might not play their normal game...</p>
              <p>On a side note, Fergie might try one of his famous mind games again... lol... Like years ago he hinted Leeds might not go all out against Newcastle when Newcastle was leading the table cos they didn't like United... But in the end, it worked... Leeds played their hearts out as the world was watching them and they probably didn't want to be accused of throwing the match on purpose so they beat the league leader...  lol.</p>
              <p>Then as we all know it now, Keegan cracked up... lol.</p>

              <p>But having said that, it's still Chelsea's title to lose though... Actually United already dead but now given a slim chance back into it...</p>

              <p>man u plays spurs on sat. chelsea v stoke is sun. So man u can go top, provided they hold their nerve. That will give chelsea tremendous pressure.</p>
              <p>Having said that, if chelsea keep steady and win all remaining 3 games, including the one at anfield, they deserve to be champions. I have always thought of them as being better than man u becos of their physical presence and skills all around the team.</p>

              <p>Spurs will be a tough nut to crack. Man U will have to be at their very best to beat Spurs.</p>
              <p>Stoke? Although they did beat Chelsea before, that was more like a 'bad day at the office' for Chelsea. And remember, the upcoming Chelsea-Stoke match will be at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>So this weekend will be really interesting.</p>
