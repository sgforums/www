              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> The future of Rafa Benitez at Liverpool
              appears to be in doubt following the club's disappointing results this
              term. Benitez is continually being linked with a move away from Anfield
              and initially appeared to be on his way to Juventus.<br><br>However, La Vecchia Signora eventually decided to go for Alberto Zaccheroni instead. This doesn't mean the speculation about Benitez have come to an end though, as Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu now appears to be his next destination.<br><br>A report from England claims that Real president Florentino Perez isn't too happy with the results under current head coach Manuel Pellegrini. Therefore, Pellegrini could be replaced by Benitez at the end of the season.<br><br>However,
              it appears to be very unlikely that Real will go for the Liverpool boss
              if they indeed decide to part company with Pellegrini.<br><br>Benitez
              not only has a bad relationship with technical director Jorge Valdano,
              but the former Valencia chief is not exactly known for his attracting
              style of football either. The Real Madrid fans are likely to be unhappy
              with an appointment of the 49-year-old Benitez should it arise. </span></p>

              <p>Rafa, if I were you, I will just head back to RM, since I am not welcome anymore at Anfield. you will be given loads of money to spend at RM, so if you dun bring RM the trophies they crave, out you go. its the revolving door policy at RM, thats the risks you or anyone have to take. even if you have won the trophies, you can still be sacked for playing bland and boring football. knowing your brand of negative and defensive football, I will not bet against you getting sacked sooner rather than later at RM.</p>

              <p>Can't be true lah... Didn't Real's technical director Jorge Valdano said Liverpool's style of play under Rafa is like a shit hanging from a stick at the centre of the pitch... lol.</p>
              <p>So does he really want the Real team to play that way now?</p>
              <p>I suspect it could all be Rafa's men making news again like the one with Juve... They are very smart, they make their man a "hot property" with all these rubbish rumour and the Pool boss buys it and thinks Rafa is 'Gold'... lol.</p>
              <p>Can't use Juve anymore cos they got someone else now so try Real lor...</p>
              <p>By right he should have been given the sack a few weeks back already... But he has smart agents...lol. Got him a 5 yrs deal when he was 'hot' and now he is made for life...</p>

              <p>Capello is way way over-rated....................always coaching

                  predictable..............always the same old way of

              <p>once that joker has set a formation and tactics for a team, he normally sticks to it................the only reason why he was still successful was becoz he'salways coaching the top clubs..............</p>
              <p>at AC Milan - he was fired at his 2nd stint after he failed to reverse Milan's decline..............</p>
              <p>he has never coached a ''normal'' club............always the top teams............Milan, Juve, Roma, Real............and he only can win when the club is at it's prime...............when Milan not doing well, he can't win........</p>
