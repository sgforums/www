              <p>Chelsea and Manchester United, the Premier League's two
              representatives in tomorrow's Champions League final, owe creditors
              £1.5bn between them. According to the latest accounts of Chelsea
              Limited, the company which owns the football club, Chelsea owed £736m
              to all its creditors. United's accounts, also recently filed at
              Companies House, showed total creditors at £764m. Those unprecedented
              figures will fuel concern that at this time of English football's
              greatest club triumph its clubs are carrying too much debt.</p>
              <p>Covering
              the year to June 30, 2007, Chelsea's accounts show that the club's
              largest creditor was the owner himself, Roman Abramovich, who had
              poured £578m into the club, not as a donation but as an interest-free
              loan. As stated by the chief executive, Peter Kenyon, in February,
              Chelsea did not owe "external debt" to any bank.</p>
              <p>However, with
              Abramovich's £578m loan, introduced to sign players and pay wages since
              he bought the club in 2003, plus general amounts owed, taxes and some
              categories listed among creditors for formal accounting purposes,
              Chelsea's creditors stood at £736m in total.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's director
              of communications, Simon Greenberg, confirmed that the £578m, described
              in the accounts as "Other loan", is indeed the loan from Abramovich.
              Greenberg reiterated that Chelsea has no "external debt" and pointed
              out that the creditors included season-ticket holders for 2007-08,
              whose money has technically to be treated as owed until the season is
              over, "and other normal operating creditors". The figure also included
              £36.3m still owed on a Eurobond taken out by Chelsea's previous owner,
              Ken Bates, in 1997. That, the last of Chelsea's "external debt", was
              then repaid last December.</p>
              <p>Kenyon released headline figures from
              these accounts in February, highlighting that the club made a record
              turnover, £190.5m, and that its losses were down from £80.2m in 2005-06
              to £75.8m last year. Kenyon said then that the club was in a healthy
              financial position, still aiming to break even by 2009-10, partly
              because it did not owe money to outside creditors and retained
              Abramovich's support. "With the company being external debt free and
              our ownership clearly demonstrating continuing commitment to the long
              term," Kenyon said, "I am very confident about the future."</p>
              <p>United's
              accounts showed the club's total creditors at £764m. United does have
              "external debt" - £666m owed to financial institutions, including £152m
              to hedge funds - taken on by the Glazer family when they bought the
              club in 2005, then loaded on to United itself. While United's loans
              incurred interest of £81m last year, the loan to Chelsea by Abramovich
              is interest-free. Abramovich has funded Chelsea's extraordinary
              acquisition of stars and, although transfers showed a profit last year,
              he continued to allow Chelsea to be run at a substantial loss.</p>
              <p>Kenyon's
              role is to transform Chelsea into a club which can survive on its own
              earnings. In February he acknowledged it was an "ambitious" target to
              aim to be self-financing by 2009-10 but the accounts bear out
              commercial progress in all areas. Having finished runners-up in the
              Premier League, won the FA Cup and League Cup and reached the Champions
              League semi-final, the club's sponsorship, match-day and media income
              all increased to push total turnover 25% up.</p>
              <p>However, there is no
              doubt that the club remains wholly reliant on Abramovich's continued
              funding. Chelsea's chairman, Bruce Buck, has stressed that Abramovich
              "loves football" and will not "walk away" from Chelsea.</p>
              <p>If the
              owner's enthusiasm were ever to wane, and Abramovich decided he did
              want his loan back, the accounts show that Chelsea would have 18 months
              to find the money.</p>

              <h2>`CHELSEA OWE £578m TO ABRAMOVICH`</h2>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>The money Roman Abramovich has poured into Chelsea is in the form of an interest-free loan rather than a donation, according to reports.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to recent accounts, the club owe a massive £736million to assorted creditors, and The Guardian claims around £578million of that figure is owed to Abramovich. It was previously thought that the Russian had simply ploughed this money into the club as a donation, an assumption that was encouraged by chief executive Peter Kenyon, who emphasised that Chelsea had no 'external' debts when announcing reduced losses in February of this year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The club announced record turnover of £190.5million, bringing their losses down to 'just' £75.8million from £80.2million, but it is still a long way from the fiscal independence that Kenyon craves. "With the company being external debt free and our ownership clearly demonstrating continuing commitment to the long term, I am very confident about the future," Kenyon said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, given that these funds are in every sense a loan, and therefore in theory could be called in, Chelsea would be in serious trouble should Abramovich ever tire of his plaything and decide he wants his money back.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Guardian suggests that should that situation occur, Chelsea would have 18 months to pay back the money. Given that Kenyon optimistically expects the club to 'break even' by 2010, that might be a struggle.</p>
