              <p>I really feel for Raddy, for his post match interview, he was spot on with regards to the referee being distracted by the comments made by the Iran coach. The Iran coach claims that since Singapore and China enjoy good relationship and the referees are all from China, he seems to suggest that Singapore will enjoy some added advantage. Throughout the match the refereeing was simple awful. Fouls given for perfectly timed tackle, fickle-minded decision with regards to the penalty, Iranian players so obviously time-wasting and yet no bookings were given.</p>
              <p>However, Singapore didnt perform enough to suggest that they deserved to go through. Passes were wayward, players cant hold on to the ball and the defence were outrun by the Iran players.</p>
              <p>I thought Singapore started the 2nd half brightly but lacked the
              spark Alam Shah may be good but he needs an equally capable strike
              partner with him upfront. He can be seen fighting alone for majority of
              the match!</p>
              <p>P.S I was sick hearing Sasikumar commenting the match, he sucks big time man. They should just hire someone else to do the commenting, even Shebby Singh, although he suck as well, is a better commentator than Sasi.</p>
              <p>Did you guys managed to hear this during the match?</p>
              <p>Sasi: Player A is a talented player, we've seen him play in the AFC Champions League, ang moh and i think that he will be in the spotlight soon, playing in big league.</p>
              <p>Ang Moh Commentator: I think he's absolutely rubbish! It was you who think he's that good.</p>
              <p>Sasi: . . . . .</p>

              <p>Clearly Spore cannot match a superb Iran side.</p>
              <p>Can see clearly the differences both play.</p>
              <p>Iran play top class football (though not world class).</p>
              <p>Spore play SEA top football.</p>
              <p>The different is both in different class.</p>
              <p>Look at Iran players, fast, and make spaces so easy.</p>
              <p>Spore dont even know how to make spaces for them.</p>
              <p>Even spore go to qatar, spore will be going to beaten like a beggar!</p>
              <p>How to improve? Spore players must not make silly mistakes, spore players must run and get the loose balls, spore players must not stand and wait. Spore players must move fast.......they must play very compact and solid team.</p>
              <p>The way Spore play is very loose. Many holes all over the place. If Japan or Korea play Spore, the score would be something like 6:0.</p>
              <p>The last game, Spore must not play like last night. Or else can kiss goodbye.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Iran's side is not even the FIRST TEAM.<br><br>To be honest, the 3rd goal was disappointing. SG players, if you noticed, 3 players was running back to the defensive line, but guess what? 1 of them dunno why, decided to stop running, and that leads to the ball passed to the person...<br><br>u get what i mean? if he ran back, the person who was going to pass might hesitate and it wun be a goal already.</p></div>
