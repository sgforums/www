              <h2>Sports source "France Football" claims that Frank Lampard's move
              from Chelsea to Internazionale is signed, sealed and delivered. The
              England international midfielder has apparently reunited with coach
              José Mourinho at the San Siro in a deal worth €9m.</h2>
              <p>The French paper says Lampard has signed a four-year contract with the
              Nerazzurri after a total of seven seasons of play at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>Lampard
              has been linked with a move to Inter Milan for several weeks now,
              following the appointment of Mourinho as the new boss of the Italian
              champions.<br><br>Mourinho has been relishing the prospect of reuniting
              with the England international, having coached him during his time at
              the helm of Chelsea.<br><br>France Football suggests that Lampard will be rewarded with an annual salary of 7.3 million euros at the Giuseppe Meazza.<br><br>The
              London-based club are now on the lookout for a creative midfielder to
              replace Lampard, with reports suggesting Luiz Felipe Scolari to have
              found his man under the form of Deco, who is on the transfer list at
              Barcelona.</p>

              <h1>Lampard In Milan To Complete Inter Switch</h1>
              <h2>Frank Lampard has arrived in Italy to complete his proposed 9 million euro transfer to Internazionale.</h2>
              <p>Following reports from France Football on Friday night that the deal
              for Lampard had been agreed between Inter and sellers Chelsea, it is
              now understood the England midfielder is travelling to Milan this
              weekend to undergo a medical.<br> <br> According to Italian media sources, Lampard touched down in Positano
              last night and will be in Milan to sign the contract later today.<br> <br> The details of the deal, so far as is known at this stage, are that
              Lampard will earn some 7.5 million euros per season over the lifetime of a
              four-year contract.  <br><br>That would represent an estimated 2.5 million
              increase, more or less, from what he is on at Chelsea, who would
              received a 9 million euro transfer fee.<br> <br> The relatively low size of the fee reflects the fact that Lampard only
              had one year left on his existing contract with the Blues.<br> <br> The player has reportedly been keen to link up again with new Inter
              manager Jose Mourinho, with whom he struck up a strong working
              relationship at Stamford Bridge.<br> <br> Speculation in Italy suggest that an agreement over Portuguese
              international Deco facilitated the Lampard transfer.<br><br>Apparently Inter,
              who like Chelsea wanted to sign Barcelona's midfielder, agreed to back
              out of the race for Deco, leaving the coast clear for Luiz Felipe
              Scolari to recruit him for his new Chelsea squad.</p>

              <p class="art-byline"> </p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Frank Lampard is close to sealing a megabucks deal to join Jose Mourinho at Inter Milan. The Chelsea midfielder had talks with the Italian giants yesterday and has agreed in principle to a four year deal worth £6million a year.</strong></p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Chelsea can expect to receive a transfer fee in the region of £7m for the 30-year-old, who has one year left on his contract. Talks between Lampard and Milan will continue today but the player has told friends that, barring a last-minute hitch, he will join the Serie A champions.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">He would be reunited with former Blues boss Mourinho, who took over at the San Siro last month. Lampard and Mourinho enjoyed a close relationship at Stamford Bridge, where they won league titles in 2004-05 and 2005-06, as well as the FA Cup and League Cup . Lampard has scored more than 100 goals for Chelsea since 2001.</p>
              <p class="art-byline"> </p>
              <p class="art-byline"><em>I think this deal is true, cos its appearing in more and more different Sports web pages... Anyway, its not a done deal yet... But very likely and soon too if Chelsea don't act now...</em></p>

              <p><strong>Lampard has been linked with a move to Inter Milan for several weeks now, following the appointment of former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho as the new boss of the Italian champions.</strong><br><br>France Football claimed on Friday that Lampard had signed a four-year contract with Inter, worth €7.3m a year, and that the Nerazzurri would pay Chelsea a transfer fee of €9m.<br><br>This deal has not become official yet though, and there are reports emanating from Stamford Bridge that Chelsea are fighting tooth and nail to prevent the player from leaving.<br><br>Indeed it is even said that if Lampard refuses to sign a new contract in West London, Chelsea could decide to let the player rot in the reserves for a year until his contract expires in 2009. Lampard would then be able to leave on a Bosman transfer as he would be a free agent.<br><br>Inter have made the signing of a top class attacking midfielder their summer priority, and they are also believed to be on the verge of capturing FC Porto star Ricardo Quaresma.</p>

              <h1>Lampard Refuses To Comment On Inter Reports</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/29236_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="230"></p>
              <h2>Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard has refused to confirm whether
              reports claiming that he has already signed for Inter are true - though
              the fact that he did not take the chance to deny the stories either
              could be seen as being telling.</h2>
              <p>France Football claimed on Friday that Lampard had signed a four-year
              contract with Inter, worth €7.3m a year, and that the Nerazzurri would
              pay Chelsea a transfer fee of €9m.<br><br>Lampard, who is currently
              holidaying in Italy, refused to be drawn out when pressed to comment on
              the rumours by local journalists.<br><br>"Inter? Let's wait and see. For the moment I am here on holiday with my family," said the 30-year-old. <br><br>"My future at Chelsea? I don't know anything yet," he added.<br><br>"Italy is a beautiful country but I am not due to meet anyone here."<br><br>According
              to the latest reports from London, Chelsea are dead set against the
              player leaving, and it is even being claimed that they would rather let
              Lampard rot in the reserves than let him join Inter.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Mourinho in Lampard defeat</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>JOSE MOURINHO appeared to signal defeat in his bid to land Frank Lampard last night. Deco’s £8.3million arrival at Stamford Bridge as Big Phil Scolari’s first signing cast doubt over Lampard’s Chelsea future.</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The England midfielder still has to hold face-to-face talks with the new Chelsea boss and has failed to reach an agreement on a new contract. With his old boss Mourinho taking over at Inter Milan a move looked likely — but last night the Special One claimed it would not happen this season.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Mourinho — who has already had a £6.8m bid rejected — said: “This season? I don’t think so. “Why won’t he? Well, it’s not because we don’t want him to, but I’m sure Chelsea and Chelsea’s officials don’t want to sell him.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“However for the next season it will be easier for him to join me at Inter. “I’m 100 per cent sure in 2009/2010 he will be playing here.” Lampard, 30, is calm about the situation and will continue his family holiday in Sicily regardless of developments in west London.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">With one year on his contract to run, it is up to Chelsea to offer him an extension. So far, however, no talks between Chelsea and Lampard or his agent Steve Kutner have taken place. Scolari has told Chelsea he wants to see the England midfielder in person before anything else happens. That meeting is scheduled for next Monday.</p>

              <h1>Lampard To Inter Agreed For £7m</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/160_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="276"></p>
              <h2>Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard is reported to have agreed to join
              Internazionale, with the clubs agreeing on a fee of £7 million, despite
              recent claims that a deal would not be reached this summer.</h2>
              <p>Former Blues boss Jose Mourinho, now in charge of Inter, said earlier
              this week that signing Lampard would not be possible this summer,
              hinting that a deal would be reached at the end of the coming season.<br><br>However, the <em>Daily Mail</em> reports that a fee has been agreed between the two clubs following
              Chelsea's decision to sign Deco, which is said to have left Lampard,
              30, extremely disillusioned as to where he stands at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>The
              England international is thought to have been offered £6 million-a-year
              at San Siro on a four year contract, though there has been no public
              announcement from the club to suggest as such.<br><br>The report
              concludes stating that once the former West Ham United man returns from
              holiday in Sicily at the end of this week he will be officially
              unveiled as Jose Mourinho's first signing.</p>
