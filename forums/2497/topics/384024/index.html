              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Tony Pulis apologised to his players on Monday for the violent outburst that has pushed James Beattie towards the exit door at </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/stoke-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Stoke City</strong></span></a><strong>.</strong></p>
              <p>The club have launched an internal investigation after <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/index.html"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: #003580;">Sportsmail’s</span></span></a> revelations that Pulis and Beattie came to blows in the wake of Saturday’s 2-0 defeat at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal </span></a>because of a row about the players' Christmas party.</p>
              <p>But Pulis, who, it is understood, was naked when he attempted to butt the 31-year-old former England striker, called his players together before training yesterday and said sorry for his conduct.</p>
              <p>Pulis and Beattie argued after the Stoke manager told his players they were expected to report for training on Monday.</p>
              <p>Beattie responded by reminding Pulis that he had told them they could extend their Christmas party — in London on Saturday night — into a two-night affair and report back for training a day later.</p>
              <div id="ext-gen32646" class="moduleHalf">
              <div class="relatedItemsTopBorder"> </div>
              <div class="relatedItems">But when Beattie highlighted what he considered to be a breach of their agreement and a harsh reaction to the defeat at the Emirates, Pulis exploded in a fit of rage.<br></div>
              </div>
              <p>As he was emerging from the showers in the dressing room he lunged towards Beattie, with the players astonished both by the violence and the fact that the towel he was wearing had fallen to the floor.</p>
              <p>Acknowledging that Beattie’s comments did not warrant such a reaction, Pulis apologised to the whole squad — although not for cutting short their festive celebrations — before overseeing what was described last night as an excellent training session.</p>
              <p>Pulis and Beattie also had words — Beattie reported for training but, because of a knee injury he has been nursing this season, went to the gym for a work-out — and, while a truce has been called, it is unlikely to result in the former <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/everton.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Everton</span></a> forward staying at The Britannia Stadium beyond the January transfer window.</p>

              <p><strong>Pulis, sources say, is now intent on off-loading the player he signed from Sheffield United in January for £3.5million.</strong></p>
              <p>Privately the Stoke manager blames Beattie for the controversy, feeling that he gave the players no such permission to miss training on Monday and that Beattie, among a number of senior players, had been made to look foolish in front of their more junior colleagues having promised that they would ‘sort it’ and get the whole weekend off.</p>
