              <p>Liverpool squad is pretty lean at the moment as there are some players who are not up to experience and lacking in hunger.</p>
              <p>The best line-up is the team Kenny deployed last sunday. (He surprised me as I was assuming he will stick to his UK pets)</p>
              <p>As to whether Kenny will be retired, it is largely dependent on whether the UK players can wake up and play hard for Liverpool or else the swansea situation will occur again.</p>
              <p>It is also dependent on what players Liverpool can buy in Jan 2012.</p>
              <p>I believe Henry will allow Kenny to achieve champion league qualification for next season before he decide to change his manager.</p>
              <p>I am not so sure whether Kenny can handle the challenge for Champion League.</p>
              <p>Maybe we can get Ah Ben for this special role.</p>

              <p>of all the legendary players at liverpool, only kenny has successes, the rest like souness, evans all flopped. this season, liverpool fared quite well against the top sides, drawn w united, beaten arsenal and chelsea, facing city this sunday. not bad for kenny, as liverpool is still in the running for top 4, never mind the BPL title, which is beyond them this season.</p>
              <p>on his record of buying players, carroll is the flop among them all for his panic buy. this guy is not worth the 35m paid for him. the most he is worth is 10-15m, thats all. only suarez is a great buy. as for stewart downing, charlie and henderson, it is still too early to say, but these british players are all brawn, pacy and little skills compared to the europeans.</p>

              <p>The manager feels that the FA's appeal against the severity of <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/21046/Wayne-Rooney"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Wayne Rooney</span></a>'s ban at Euro 2012 does not set the right example.</p>
              <p>The Manchester United striker's UEFA suspension was reduced to two matches at the same time as Dalglish was addressing the media at a press conference, and the Liverpool boss believes the FA should look at its own actions before tackling other issues.</p>
              <p>"I find it a bit strange the FA are supposed to be setting an example for things yet they appeal against Wayne Rooney's three-match ban,'' he said. "I don't think that's a good example to set.''</p>
              <p>Dalglish labelled the way the FA has dragged its heels over Suarez's racism charge as a "joke'' - despite both clubs being told not to speak about the incident until a decision is made.</p>
              <p>"The fact it has taken nine weeks to get a decision on one of the other charges is a bit of a joke as well. Much longer and he might get a testimonial,'' Dalglish added. "I don't think that has helped as well. The circus which is around about him has been caused mainly by that. That will be done sooner rather than later and we will move forward.''</p>
              <p>Dalglish pointed out that if Rooney had been judged on the FA's own rules, a three-match suspension would have been automatic, but the FA has since issued a statement in response.</p>
              <p>It read: "To promote speed and consistency, stakeholders in England agreed a standard formula encompassing a fixed penalty sanction should be applied across the game by The FA. The system has been in operation for many years and meets the demands of the domestic game.</p>
              <p>"The FA's system allows clubs to make a claim of wrongful dismissal - to reduce a sanction to zero - or appeal the severity of a sanction. Both of these processes are dealt with prior to the player's next fixture.</p>
              <p>"UEFA chooses to operate a different process for European matches, based on a sliding scale, under which each sanction is determined individually by a disciplinary panel. In any event, a minimum one-game ban will always be applied by UEFA.</p>
              <p>"This process meets the demands of UEFA football where the period between fixtures is greater than that in the domestic game."</p>

              <div id="article-body-blocks">
              <p><strong>Two years ago it was Rafa Benítez with his folded sheet of paper containing various "facts" about perceived </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Liverpool" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong> grievances. On Thursday in the same room </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Kenny Dalglish" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/kenny-dalglish"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Kenny Dalglish</strong></span></a><strong> went one better, with a DVD display illustrating why Liverpool were more sinned against than sinning at Fulham on Monday, a match that earned the club a double dose of disciplinary trouble from the Football Association, with </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Luis Suárez" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/luis-suarez"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Luis Suárez</strong></span></a><strong> accused of making an offensive gesture to home supporters and Liverpool charged with failure to control their players following the dismissal of Jay Spearing. "If anyone wants to see the truth it's on the screen," the Liverpool manager said.</strong></p>
              <p>"If we have infringed rules we will have to accept it and take the punishment, but I'm not certain what the rules are when it comes to disputing a decision," Dalglish added. "What I do know is that referees are inconsistent with their interpretations. The only intent in Jay's mind was to get the ball, and normally our discipline is good, as our film clip can prove.</p>
              <p>"If you look at the way Craig Bellamy was being provoked [by Clint Dempsey] at Fulham you can only say his discipline was unbelievable. He didn't commit a foul, he didn't respond to the player shoving his head into his face, and yet he was the one to get booked. Once that happened we ended up having to take him off so we weren't left with nine players."</p>
              <p>Footage from the game does appear to support that point, and Dalglish said it would be presented to the FA if Liverpool were asked to defend themselves, along with clips of Suárez being wrestled to the floor in the penalty area by Brede Hangeland and getting nothing, Andy Carroll being fouled and Bellamy being wrongly penalised for a harmless tussle with John Arne Riise.</p>
              <p>"We just want to be dealt with fairly," Dalglish said. "We want the same rules to apply to us as to everyone else. At Fulham I think we got the short end of a lot of 50-50 decisions that on another night might have gone our way. Anyone watching the clips can see that for themselves."</p>
              <p>Uppermost in Dalglish's mind is the latest charge to hit Suárez, two months after the Uruguayan was accused of racial abuse by Manchester United's Patrice Evra, a case which the FA has still to bring to a conclusion. Apart from being dismayed by the time that original investigation is taking – "Nine weeks to reach a decision is a joke, if it goes on any longer it will soon be due a testimonial" – Dalglish fears his player is being deliberately wound up by opponents and receiving scant sympathy from referees. "I've seen the picture [of the gesture] now and I'd rather be sitting here talking about football," the Scot said.</p>
              <p>"The charge only landed yesterday afternoon and I have yet to speak to him about it, but everyone at this club will stand by him. We know what the truth is. Because he's such a fantastic player, opponents who can't stop him on the pitch find other ways to get at him. People are entitled to tackle him, but tackle him fairly. That's all we are saying.</p>
              <p>"People are just jumping on the bandwagon now and accusing him of this, that and everything else. He is happy here, happy in his environment, but we need the outstanding issues to be cleared up before we can start talking about the man as a footballer."</p>
              <p>Dalglish claims he can list four other players who have made similar gestures to the one Suárez made and escaped without charge, though he is reluctant to say who they may be. He disagreed that the Suárez gesture to the Fulham crowd was in any way comparable to the Wayne Rooney outburst into a television camera at West Ham that saw the Manchester United player charged and banned for a couple of games last season.</p>
              <p>"I don't see any similarities between the two incidents at all," he said. "Saying they are a bit like each other is like saying a man is a bit like a woman. We have picked out at least four other instances that were just the same and the players were not charged. All we are asking for is some clarity on the matter."</p>
              <p>Despite being without a league goal since the start of October, a fortnight before the United game and the trouble with Evra, Dalglish is convinced Suárez remains popular with supporters and will continue to be central to the club's plans.</p>
              <p>"The contribution he makes is important, it is not necessary for him to score every week as long as he continues to terrorise people," he said.</p>
              <p>"As long as opponents have to resort to verbals to try and get to him he must be doing something right. The fans recognise that. They will be right behind him on Saturday, because they know what's been going on. At the end of the day he's not been getting a fair crack of the whip."</p>

              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Luis Suárez" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/luis-suarez"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Luis Suárez</strong></span></a><strong> has been granted more time to respond to the improper conduct charge he received for allegedly making an offensive gesture to Fulham supporters at Craven Cottage last week.</strong></p>
              <p>The Football Association charged the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Liverpool" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><span style="color: #005689;">Liverpool</span></a> striker after photographs emerged of him making a one-fingered gesture following the club's 1-0 defeat by Martin Jol's team, a game in which Jay Spearing was sent off and Liverpool were charged with "failing to ensure its players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion" in the aftermath of the midfielder's dismissal.</p>
              <p>Suárez and Liverpool were given until 4pm on Monday to respond to the charges but that deadline has been extended as the player prepares his defence. Such extensions are not uncommon, although the latest deadline has not been announced.</p>
              <p>Fulham fans had accused Suárez of diving during the game and continued to barrack him as he headed for the tunnel afterwards. His manager, <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Kenny Dalglish" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/kenny-dalglish"><span style="color: #005689;">Kenny Dalglish</span></a>, issued a staunch defence of the Uruguay international that included showing journalists a DVD of fouls he claimed were committed on Suárez at Fulham but went unpunished by the referee, Kevin Friend. Dalglish said Liverpool intended to use the footage as part of their defence to the FA.</p>
              <p>Suárez is also still waiting to discover when the FA is to hold a hearing into allegations, which he denies, that he racially abused Patrice Evra during Manchester United's visit to on 15 October.</p>
              <p>Dalglish last week described the delay as "a joke" and believes the unresolved case has led to people "jumping on the bandwagon and accusing him of this, that and everything else. We need the outstanding issues to be cleared up before we can start talking about the man as a footballer."</p>
