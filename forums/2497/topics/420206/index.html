              <p><span><strong>The manager and the year may have changed but Liverpool's problems away from home continued as Kenny Dalglish's first Barclays Premier League match since returning as boss ended in defeat at Blackpool.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Liverpool's troubles on the road contributed to the departure of Roy Hodgson last weekend but the Seasiders showed October's win by the same score at Anfield was no fluke.</span></p>
              <p>.<span>Fernando Torres had given Dalglish the ideal start with a third-minute strike but goals from Gary Taylor-Fletcher and DJ Campbell extended Liverpool's miserable away league record to just two victories in almost 13 months.</span></p>
              <p><span>It was not the start the 59-year-old Scot was expecting on his return to the top flight after more than 12 years away.</span></p>
              <p><span>Dalglish said when he took over at the weekend he did not think the game had altered much.</span></p>
              <p><span>However, when he was last in charge of Liverpool almost 20 years ago, Blackpool were in the old Fourth Division and the times are changing as Blackpool secured their first league double over Liverpool since 1947.</span></p>
              <p><span>It had all begun so well for the visitors, looking to bounce back from Sunday's FA Cup exit at Manchester United.</span></p>
              <p><span>After that game Dalglish had promised to get Torres back to his best after a laboured season and he was true to his word as the Spaniard struck in double-quick time from the kick-off.</span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><span><strong>And the goal came from another of the manager's tactical decisions, which saw the returning Glen Johnson, whose partner gave birth to a boy last night, lined up in an unfamiliar left-back position after Martin Kelly's impressive display against United.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Dalglish was rewarded for keeping faith with youngster Kelly as he set up the opening goal.</span></p>
              <p><span>When Dirk Kuyt span the ball out to the defender he advanced over the halfway line before rolling a pass into the inside-right channel.</span></p>
              <p><span>Torres did not need a second invitation, racing into the area and even from a tight angle he was able to fire a ferocious shot past Richard Kingson and into the roof of the net.</span></p>
              <p><span>It was only the Spain international's second goal in his last nine matches and just his seventh of the season.</span></p>
              <p><span>The visitors' joy lasted only until the 12th minute, however, as when Raul Meireles carelessly gave the ball away to David Vaughan in midfield he played in Taylor-Fletcher to exact the ultimate punishment by running through the defence to roll a shot under Jose Reina.</span></p>
              <div class="artSplitter">

              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>All the players then ran to the touchline to hold up a T-shirt with the words '4 Butch you Bluenose RIP' - a reference to Macclesfield player Richard Butcher who died suddenly this week.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Blackpool had the better chances in the remainder of the half, with Campbell heading wide from five yards and Taylor-Fletcher almost catching out Reina with a lob from the right wing after the goalkeeper duffed his kick.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The home side stepped up the pressure after the break with Charlie Adam's left-footed drive beaten away by Reina, who then tipped over Vaughan's shot.</span></p>
              <span style="font-size: small;">
              <p>And indeed Blackpool - now up to ninth - looked likelier to get a third goal than Liverpool did to grabbing an equaliser.</p>
              </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The Reds have now lost 10 of their 21 league matches and eight out of 11 on the road.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">If Dalglish wants the job on a permanent basis he will have to find a way of eliminating results such as this.</span></p>

              <p>honestly i think u are just biased against dalglish.. and pro-hodgson i have no idea why.</p>
              <p>yes i would agree that hodgson took over a sinking ship. he had his chances to plug the holes but did not do so. He had 31 games to prove himself. 31. and u are on kenny's back after 2 games?</p>
              <p>rafa got liverpool to 7th last season and was fired.</p>
              <p>hodgson's liverpool just b4 he was fired was 3 points above relegation. Statistically he is by far the worse manager liverpool ever had.</p>
              <p>you say dalglish lost to a newly promoted side, hodgson did that too. at ANFIELD.</p>
              <p>if hodgson took over a sinking ship, dalglish took over the same ship with his players low in confidence becos of hodgson.</p>
              <p>The reason why liverpool fans think that he can do the job is that he was the last manager to lead liverpool to the title. he is a LEGEND. so what if pool fans are biased towards him. he DESERVES that based on his liverpool track record. u are the one who is biased against him and liverpool. be more objective pls.</p>
              <p>i think he is currently the best man for the job. the fact that he is willing to take on the club which is on the down just shows his love for this club. which manager now would be willing to take over liverpool at this juncture?</p>

              <p>I agreed with club18 that no manager in his sane mind would take over Liverpool at the start or middle of the season.</p>
              <p>Ah Roy was actually a brave man to take the role and perform his job.</p>
              <p>It is beyond his coaching ability to beef up the team with sub-standard and attitude players.</p>
              <p>Coupled with his tactics and his handling of the press, he have to leave as he cannot take the heat.</p>
              <p>Ah Ken can actually reject the role of the part time manager when he was holidaying in Qatar.</p>
              <p>But, he took the role and have so far show the courage of getting behind his men even though they are making silly mistake outside the field.</p>
              <p>He is willing to bite the bullet to save a ship that no one want to save and having a field day in making fun of.</p>
              <p>That is what he is about - a true leader.</p>
              <p>As for fans, they are also true Reds in their heart as they have stuck by their team even though the team is being mocked and joked about every day.</p>
              <p>That is what supporting Liverpool is about.</p>

              <p>liverpool supporter right :) I do admire the love that true kop fans have for your king kenny but then again, your club's in a crisis. Soft spots should stay aside. He hasn't been in the modern game for more than a decade. The last time he managed newcastle and celtic, things didn't work out. Should say something about his inconsistent managerial ability.</p>
              <p>The times that he won the league title with liverpool, England's first division was going through a period of transition, having been banned from europe for years due to the heysel disaster. When the likes of man utd first came out and competed in europe, they struggled because play has changed from the days of kick and rush to continental style football. The time when he won the title with blackburn, he had the fantastic duo of shearer and sutton....but that's the end of any title ever since.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Call it whatever you like it but I am still of the firm believe that he isn't the right man for the job... Unless Pool just want to be a mid table side of course. In that case, why sack Roy?</p>
              <p>I am definitely not pro-Roy... lol. I just feel sorry for the guy... I thought he was treated very badly by the Liverpool fans and Dalglish played a leading role to his removal... </p>
              <p>I felt Dalglish who was over-looked by the board for the job shouldn't have told the world he wanted the job just before the former Pool board was about to announce Roy's appointment... It was not necessary as it created a difficult tension for Roy throughout his time there...</p>
              <p>I have this feeling Dalglish back-stabbed Roy over the last few months so as to land his job... So how can you even look at this guy and like him? He is a back-stabber in my opinion... But retribution will be around the corner i belief...</p>
              <p>And some Pool fans who belief this Dalglish will be any better are naive... True the guy won them their last title but how long was that? About 20 yrs ago? My goodness, I don't think Sg had internet service at all or wasn't up fully during those days and yet the guy crack like an egg shell under pressure from what I also don't know... weekly matches?</p>
              <p>What about his last 2 managerial jobs? Newcastle sack him after poor results and replaced him with Ruud Gullit wanting more 'sexy football'... That said more than enough i think...</p>
              <p>Then there is Celtic... I think most of the average managers going up North manage to win the title with Celtic or Rangers... O'Neill, Strachan, Alex McLeish or even former United assistant manager Walter Smith... And Dalglish ? Not done it before... hmmm...</p>
              <p>So don't say I am biased towards him... Cos realistically, if he is good enough... I can accept his abilities. But honestly, I don't see it at all... Cos I honestly belief he is finished as a top man... It's like a young guy telling us he is marrying Ms Universe. But what Year we must ask, that is the point right? And not she is a Ms Universe only... Cos what if she is a Ms Universe 20 yrs ago? Is she still the same girl 20 yrs ago? I don't think so...</p>
              <p>I suspect even the current board / owners don't fully trust he can do the job well otherwise why interim only when he has made it very clear he wants the job full-time? And don't give me that rubbish that nobody else wants the job... O'Neill is free, Frank Rijkaard too... Both are out of a job and there are many others out there as well...  </p>
              <p>So I am sticking my neck out here to say Liverpool won't win anything worthwhile while Dalglish is in charge... There...</p>
              <p>If they do, I will take my words back and give credit where it's due but not to someone living on past glory which ironically, that's what the club and some of their fans are doing right now...</p>
              <p>In time, some pool fans will finally wake up and realize what I said here had any merits or not...</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">KENNY DALGLISH will send Liverpool out in the first home game of his Second Coming in the Merseyside derby on Sunday.</h2>
              <p>It could hardly have been orchestrated better (or worse, depending on the outcome).</p>
              <p>Not even by Rodgers and Hammerstein, whose musical Carousel first brought us You'll Never Walk Alone.</p>
              <p>But this is no little merry-go-round Dalglish suddenly finds himself on.</p>
              <p>It's a terrifying rollercoaster ride on football's Big Dipper.</p>
              <p>One that right now is heading in one direction with Liverpool just four points off the drop zone and counting the near £40million cost of paying off Rafa Benitez, Roy Hodgson, their platoons of assistants plus assorted transfer fees and contracts of players not fit to wear the Liverpool shirt.</p>
              <p>If Dalglish cannot apply the handbrake, it will take him and much of the reputation he built at Anfield over 14 glorious years down with it.</p>
              <p>Sunday's visit of Everton is followed by a trip to Wolves, whose 1-0 win at Anfield two weeks ago proved the beginning of the end for Hodgson.</p>
              <p>Further defeats to go with the 2-1 reverse at Bloomfield Road that saw Blackpool complete their first league double over Liverpool since 1947 and Dalglish could start to reflect on his managerial comeback as the worst decision of his life.</p>
              <p>And eventually lead to a situation where Liverpool fans, currently still in the Tunnel of Love, are left staring at their boots in silent embarrassment as the man they willed back into the job on a tide of emotion comes up short.</p>
              <p>At the same time, there will be many opposition supporters relishing that very scenario and gloating that Liverpool, in getting what they so desperately wanted, got what they deserved.</p>
              <p>They say never go back. Especially in a situation where there is so much to lose.</p>
              <p>Even more so when you have been away from the game for two decades, a game that is ever-changing and so much more demanding and medically and technically advanced than Dalglish remembers.</p>
              <p>And so much more unforgiving.</p>
              <p>Sure, he has been watching games. But from the safety and security of the directors' box, a viewpoint from where countless sacked managers have long lamented it always looks so much easier.</p>
              <p>Already, after just two games, the engaging smile that accompanied his re-emergence after 12 years away from the Premier League is being replaced by a tetchy, non-committal shrug.</p>
              <p>Asked after the Blackpool debacle whether he would be bringing in any new players, Dalglish replied: "Dunno - haven't asked."</p>
              <p>Yes, Dalglish has his own droll sense of humour but it was not exactly a confidence-booster.</p>
              <p>Liverpool fans, as it is, must be feeling a little queasy after all the recent ups and downs.</p>
              <p>Three months ago, they were in a state of euphoria as John W Henry came dashing to the rescue with promises of a new era, fresh funds, close co-operation with supporters' groups, etc, etc.</p>
              <p>Bad Yanks out, good Yanks in.</p>
              <p>After watching an initial 2-0 defeat at Goodison, Henry saw Liverpool respond with four league wins in six games.</p>
              <p>They then lost four of the next six and Hodgson was sacked.</p>
              <p>In came Dalglish after a campaign orchestrated by fans, old playing cronies and a media mafia that extends far beyond Merseyside for whom King Kenny can do no wrong.</p>
              <p>Suddenly there were <strong>EIGHTEEN</strong> video links about Dalglish's homecoming on the Liverpool website.</p>
              <p>Kenny at his first Anfield Press conference, Kenny taking training at Melwood, Paul Dalglish on his dad's return and gushing tributes from the usual suspects.</p>
              <p>Once again, we had lift-off. And now it's played two, lost two - and the 1-0 FA Cup defeat at Old Trafford could have been 4-0.</p>
              <p>Yes, it's early days but there was little for Liverpool fans to get excited about in the display at Blackpool. Basically, they were as poor as they had ever been under Hodgson.</p>
              <p>The pass-and-move, flowing football they had been expecting under the new caretaker? Er, sorry, not quite ready yet.</p>
              <p>Whether it will <strong>EVER</strong> materialise is probably not a subject Liverpool fans even want to consider right now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="float-right padding-left-10 width-300 padding-bottom-10 padding-top-10">
              <div class="grey-ad-line width-300 position-relative">
              <p> </p>
              Up on Tyneside, though, it will be the subject of some debate for Newcastle fans who recall Dalglish's 19-month reign with little more than a shake of the head.</div>
              </div>
              <p>There they saw Kevin Keegan's attacking philosophy replaced by one of dreary caution. Dullglish.</p>
              <p>In the 1997-98 season, Newcastle dropped from second to 13th on the back of five goalless draws and <strong>TWENTY</strong> other games that ended either 1-0 or 0-1.</p>
              <p>Sure, Liverpool were without Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard against Blackpool. But, as Michael Owen said, you can't rely on two or three players to consistently dig you out of a hole.</p>
              <p>You need men with fight, commitment and stamina.</p>
              <p>A real passion and belief in the club. Like those wearing the Blackpool shirt on Wednesday night.</p>
              <p>Not a collection of foreign mercenaries for whom a relegation battle is anathema, and for whom the name Dalglish raises as many quizzical eyebrows as it does appreciative nods of recognition.</p>
              <p>As for Gerrard, he's hardly helped the cause, either.</p>
              <p>When Dalglish was looking for a performance of maturity and leadership from his skipper at Old Trafford, Gerrard managed to get sent off after half an hour for a reckless challenge on Michael Carrick.</p>
              <p>Just when he needs him most - even more with Carragher out until late March - Gerrard misses three vital games.</p>
              <p>Now Henry is on the way back for 'crisis talks' with Dalglish and Damien Comolli, the so-called Director of Football Strategy (chief scout in less important times), a player-recruitment officer whose record at Spurs was considerably more hit and miss than the unqualified success the Frenchman might like to claim.</p>
              <p>And so the Big Dipper ploughs on. Through the wind and the rain.</p>
              <p>Heading we know not where.</p>

              <p>honestly i think u are just biased against dalglish.. and pro-hodgson i have no idea why.</p>
              <p>yes i would agree that hodgson took over a sinking ship. he had his chances to plug the holes but did not do so. He had 31 games to prove himself. 31. and u are on kenny's back after 2 games?</p>
              <p>rafa got liverpool to 7th last season and was fired.</p>
              <p>hodgson's liverpool just b4 he was fired was 3 points above relegation. Statistically he is by far the worse manager liverpool ever had.</p>
              <p>you say dalglish lost to a newly promoted side, hodgson did that too. at ANFIELD.</p>
              <p>if hodgson took over a sinking ship, dalglish took over the same ship with his players low in confidence becos of hodgson.</p>
              <p>The reason why liverpool fans think that he can do the job is that he was the last manager to lead liverpool to the title. he is a LEGEND. so what if pool fans are biased towards him. he DESERVES that based on his liverpool track record. u are the one who is biased against him and liverpool. be more objective pls.</p>
              <p>i think he is currently the best man for the job. the fact that he is willing to take on the club which is on the down just shows his love for this club. which manager now would be willing to take over liverpool at this juncture?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>what has he got to lose taking over liverpool now or any other time.  if he gets the sack he gets a fat pay check like any other manager doesnt he?</p>
              <p>what makes you think he is doing it coz he loves the club? </p>

              <p>as to the backstabbing part, dalglish gave his full backing to hodgson when he was appointed. look at what hodgson said somewhere along the lines of dalglish having every right to put his name forward for appointment.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1291361/Kop-legend-Dalglish-backing-Hodgson-s-new-Liverpool-regime.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1291361/Kop-legend-Dalglish-backing-Hodgson-s-new-Liverpool-regime.html</a></p>
              <p>and halfway thru he asked the fans to give hodgson more time as he was convinced hodgson was the right man (which he was wrong)</p>

              <p>dalglish is given a 6 month contract as an interim manager. so he's 
              not a long term solution (but could be if he does well enough)</p>
              <p>he prolly wun be fired but even if he was, the payout will be nahdah.</p>

              I guess the only people who thinks that Hodgson should not be sacked are the so called United fans...He made far too many mistakes in the last six months of his tenure. His long ball tactics, lack of tactical strategies and his love for Konscheski are there for everyone to see. There is no place for compassion in the football management world and I see the same treatment given to Dalglish eventually if he fails to improve the team in the next six months. Moreover, Hodgson is given a golden handshake, mind you.
              
              Sure Dalglish's managerial skills are questionable but we don't have much options at the moment cos not many managers would want to take the risk to come over to Liverpool at this point of time with the limited resources given. He receives the deserved homecoming because he is always a Liverpool legend. Would the United fans do the same if Robson or Cantona ever return to Old Trafford on a managerial role? Hell Yes! So I dun see anything wrong with the reaction of all Liverpool fans towards his homecoming.
              
              I can't see any objective comments made by the so-called United fans...They may need to worry more on the ever  increasing debts of their club than anything else instead.
