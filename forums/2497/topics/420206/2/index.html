              <p>Yes, Roy had to go...Kenny was in to unite the fans, he is certainly better in terms of man management as well.</p>
              <p>The owner had to decide whether to stick with Roy or continue burning hole on their pocket. There were more than 10,000 unsold tickets for the Blackburn game! Even the season ticket holders couldn't be bother to turn up for the game.</p>
              <p>It is a big statement from Zocoss regarding the backstabbing thing. I honestly did not expect it come out from him. Kenny has said nothing during Roy tenure but urged the fans to totally back Roy! That was after Roy said that Kenny's best role at the club is to continue as the club's ambassador. He felt threatened by Kenny's popularity to be honest...And what did he say regarding Frank Rijkaard? He said something like "he must be a very good manager to be sacked by Galatasaray? Damn...I felt totally ashamed as Liverpool supporter!</p>

              <p>Dude, I don't think you should make such sweeping statements on fans of other club.</p>
              <p>I'm sure the warning signs on managerial change are all there for all to see when the kop started chanting "Hodgson for England" and calls for Dalglish to be the manager. If Dalglish wants stability for the club in time like this, the least he could do was to come out and clear the air instead of publically admitting that he'd loved to take over Liverpool a second time.</p>

              <p>I wish to link this to an earlier discussion: Was Dalglish still bitter that the job went to Hodgson instead of himself despite letting the board know of his intention? So sensing the opportunity to strike, he managed to stir the Anfield crowd by keeping mum the entire time, leading them to believe that he will be the man to lead Liverpool out of the dark.</p>
              <h1><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/7812523/Kenny-Dalglish-puts-himself-in-contention-for-remarkable-Liverpool-return.html">Kenny Dalglish puts himself in contention for remarkable Liverpool return</a></h1>
              <p>Also, Blackpool was on a 2 game losing streak! Surely it's a shoo-in victory for Liverpool right?</p>
              <p>Robson is a managerial joke please. The best thing he did was probably saving West Brom from relegation in the final match of the season 04-05. The rest was just disaster. Cantona? Who did he ever manage? Nike Commercials? Don't even mention Keane. He was a great leader but a really poor manager as seen during his spells at Sunderland and Ipswich. The only ex-United player worth taking a shot at being United Manager is probably Steve Bruce.</p>

              <p>I think you would find many fulham fans who thinks roy shouldn't be sacked as well, or maybe villa fans surprised he's sacked before houllier who has done a far worse job with villa than o'dreary....no need to stir things up with man u fans</p>
              <p>roy's love for konchesky can be said is the same as pool's fans love for kenny. he did a job at fulham and roy thought that he could do the same at pool, obviously it didn't work out so far....</p>
              <p>whether it would work out for kenny remains to be seen as well</p>

              <p>didn't the owners burn a bigger hole by sacking roy??</p>
              <p>well frank rijkaard really has done nothing besides barca, and during his time at barca it was somewhat like the situation between rangers and celtic, yes he did well to break the stranglehold by barca's only realistic rival but that's just that..he did win the champs league but there's pool fans who dun rate benitez too...</p>

              <p>dude, based on the last 20 years? other than liverpool &amp; blackburn, kenny got newcastle to 2nd too. while roy switched like 15 clubs including relegating kenny's blackburn after 2 seasons.</p>
              <p>liverpool fans are realistic - we don't expect kenny to win the league, but we can see kenny is an improvement over roy who may very well relegate liverpool - just 4 points from relegation when he left</p>

              <p>On Newcastle, who were a top 4 club back then... Kenny took over in like the last 4 months when they were already in the top 4 position and they ended that season well.</p>
              <p>It's the following season that I am referring to... Where he had full control from before the start of the season and replaced Keegan's players... That season I think they ended up completely out of the top 10... 12 or 14 place I think...</p>
              <p>If Rafa takes Pool from 2nd to 7th and the fans blamed him, the Newcastle fans does not have the right to blame Kenny for taking them from 2nd to out of the top 10? On top of that, replaced Keegan's attacking football with dull boring football? you say leh...</p>
              <p>On Roy and Rafa... One had 6 yrs in charge, the structure from youth to reserved to first team were all under his controlled... Who arrived and who goes were all down to him for 6 long years... The other, only 6 months... Didn't even had a real opportunity to spend the new owner's money, you say leh...</p>
              <p>Just wonder how come you are defending Rafa now? I thought you don't like him?... lol.</p>
