              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">RAFA BENITEZ'S Liverpool future was hanging by a thread last night after another Euro disaster.</h2>
              <p class="article">Diego Forlan's extra-time strike gave Atletico Madrid an away-goal triumph as the Reds were denied an all-English shootout with Fulham in the Europa League final.</p>
              <p class="article">Goals from Alberto Aquilani and Yossi Benayoun had put the Reds in the driving seat - before former Manchester United striker Forlan pounced.</p>
              <p class="article">Kop boss Benitez looked distraught by his team's defeat and dodged questions about whether he would still be in charge next season.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "The future is Chelsea at home on Sunday and after that it is Hull. Those are the games we have to concentrate on and after that we will see.</p>
              <p class="article">"It's true that this game summed up our season when so many things have gone against us.</p>
              <p class="article">"The season was not good enough and after the Hull game we must make sure we are ready for next season.</p>
              <p class="article">"This was an amazing game. We were on top of them for a long time and it was a pity to concede such a late goal.</p>
              <p class="article">"Even when we were leading 2-0 we knew we had to keep working hard and the players did that.</p>
              <p class="article">"It was also a pity their goal did not come from good counter-attacking but from a lucky rebound with the ball going against us."</p>
              <p class="article">Benitez admitted whoever is in charge at Anfield will face a major rebuilding task.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: "People have been saying we need three, four or even five new players and I agree.</p>
              <p class="article">"But I do not think it will be more of a problem bringing new players in because we have not made the final.</p>
              <p class="article">"Liverpool is a massive club and the name of the club is there to see."</p>
              <p class="article">Forlan, who also scored Atletico's goal in last week's 1-0 first leg win in Madrid, said: "When Benayoun scored, I thought that was it.</p>
              <p class="article">"But we picked ourselves up quickly. We knew we only had to score one goal and obviously it was a great feeling to get it. Now we can look forward to playing Fulham."</p>

              <p>With 21 minutes left of their semi-final second leg against Hamburg at Craven Cottage, Hodgson's men were trailing to Mladen Petric's stunning first-half free-kick.</p>
              <p>However, Simon Davies produced his own moment of brilliance to bring the scores level on the night and Zoltan Gera poked home a second goal seven minutes later to take Fulham to their first European final.</p>
              <p>Hodgson said: 'After going a goal down against the run of play, I think we've made a major piece of history here tonight. That atmosphere is something I think we'll all remember for a long time.'</p>
              <p>Fulham will return to Hamburg for the final on May 12, when they will face Atletico Madrid, who beat <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool</span></a> on away goals with an extra-time strike by Diego Forlan.</p>

              <p><br>I think it might actually happen... If Fulham did win in the final and fail to qualify for the top 6... Uefa might give them that Portsmouth spot... Portsmouth's spot (FA Cup Winners spot) have so far not been made clear but some said it could go to Liverpool for finishing 7th on the league table... But what if Fifa does the same for the EC as they plan with the CL? Takes away the 4th place team's spot if the winner isn't from the top 4 and in this case, take away the 6th spot but this time there is an extra place cos of Portsmouth's problems? In a way they don't need to take away the 6th place cos there is still one place available so might give it to Fulham if they are the defending champion...</p>

              <p><br>I think it might actually happen... If Fulham did win in the final and fail to qualify for the top 6... Uefa might give them that Portsmouth spot... Portsmouth's spot (FA Cup Winners spot) have so far not been made clear but some said it could go to Liverpool for finishing 7th on the league table... But what if Fifa does the same for the EC as they plan with the CL? Takes away the 4th place team's spot if the winner isn't from the top 4 and in this case, take away the 6th spot but this time there is an extra place cos of Portsmouth's problems? In a way they don't need to take away the 6th place cos there is still one place available so might give it to Fulham if they are the defending champion...</p>

              <p>It was said that the <strong>top 4</strong> in the EPL qualify for CL, <strong>5th</strong> qualify for europa league..</p>
              <p>FA
              cup winner Winner qualifies for Europa league. If chelsea wins (or
              lose) this season's FA cup, Portsmouth would qualify for Europa League.
              Portsmouth is banned from next season's europe competition because they
              did not registered at all. However, they would like to fight the ban.
              If the ban is unsuccessful, the Europa league place would go to the
              highest placed team in the league not already qualified for europe.
              Thus <strong>6th</strong> position in the league qualifies for europe as well.</p>
              <p>Carling
              cup winner qualifies for Europa league as well. Since manchester won
              and is already in europe next season, then the Europa league place
              would go to the highest placed team in the league not already qualified
              for europe. Thus the <strong>7th</strong> position in the league qualifies for europe as well.</p>
              <p>Europa
              league winner gets qualification into next season's europa league group
              stages regardless of their league standings in their own league.
              Therefore if fulham wins, they gets <strong>invited back </strong>to Europa league as winners to defend.</p>
              <p>Fair
              play table. If the EPL has one of the top 3 rankings in Fair play in
              Europe (which they are now), the highest team in the Fair play table
              not already in europe next season qualifies for Europa league. The
              current standings shows arsenal, tottenham, fulham, man utd and chelsea
              as the top 5. Since Arsenal, Tottenham, Fulham, Man utd and Chelsea
              would most likely qualify for europe next season. Fulham would get to
              qualify for Europa league next season via the Fair Play Table, if they
              dont win this season's Europa league. However, if they win, then the
              Europa league place would go to the highest placed team in the Fair
              Play Table not already qualified for europ, and the team that is
              currently occupying this position is the <strong>recently relegated Burnley FC</strong>.</p>
              <p>So
              next season those qualifying for Europe (for sure) Chelsea, Man Utd,
              Arsenal. Those likely to qualify includes Tottenham, villa, city and
              liverpool. However, the team that finishes 7th is in a precarious
              situation as their place in Europa League might get revoked if
              Portsmouth wins the appeal for their europe ban. And this team is
              likely to be <strong>Liverpool FC</strong> (worst scenario).</p>
              <p>The worst scenario would be Portsmouth winning the appeal,
              Fulham winning the Europa league and Burnley qualifying for Europe.
              That would totally shame Liverpool FC to the max, especially with <strong>2 relegated clubs</strong> playing in the Europa league, Europe's 2nd tier competition.</p>
              <p>Anyway,
              I got a feeling that Liverpool would qualify for Europe next season.
              Their 2 remaining games is against Chelsea and Hull City. Losing to
              chelsea and winning hull city should be enough to guarantee them entry
              into the Europa league provided that the other teams (city, spurs and
              villa) falters against their rivals. <strong>City</strong> needs to face aston villa and spurs and west ham united. They would need at least <strong>6 points</strong> to be sure of Europe (win 2 lose 1). <strong>Spurs</strong> faces City, Burnley and Bolton and needs <strong>5 points</strong> to be sure of Europe (Win 1 draw 2). <strong>Villa</strong> faces City and blackburn and needs <strong>5 points</strong> to be sure of Europe, which is equivalent to <strong>winning both matches</strong>. By getting the required points, they will all finish <strong>above liverpool FC</strong>.
              To make matters interesting, Chelsea must win against Liverpool to have
              1 hand on the trophy, losing or drawing against pool would allow man
              utd to almost have both hands on the trophy. Therefore, Chelsea must
              win against liverpool. If liverpool loses, then matters get interesting
              as their rivals can "relax" as they are guarantee at least an Europa
              league placing. They will still fight for CL place though.</p>
              <p>However,
              if Liverpool FC does indeed finishes 7th, I believe the FA would
              definitely reject the Portsmouth Appeal and instead let Liverpool
              qualify for the Europa League, given that liverpool is a more well
              known club with a great history and definitely one club that has much
              more appeal than portsmouth. Therefore, <strong>Liverpool would still be in Europe</strong> next season, albeit by the "underhanded" means. <strong>Poor Portsmouth.<br></strong></p>

              1 thing that i'm not sure about is Carling cup. I think they have removed the europa slot from winner of that competition, hence making it the mickeist of all mickey mouse cups.
