The FA have no further comment to make on this subject."<br><br>The news has sparked fears that Steve McClaren's successor could be dragged through the Italian courts in an effort to prove his innocence.<br><br>Soho Square chiefs will be hoping the probe will not affect Capello's preparation for England's first match in charge, which takes place on February 6 against Switzerland.<br><br></div>
