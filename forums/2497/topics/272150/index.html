            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/05_02/terryDM2905_468x510.jpg"><br><br><strong>John Terry should be stripped of the England captaincy unless he gives more respect to officials, claims former top referee Graham Poll. England's most high profile official, who retired at the end of last season, said: 'My view is nothing personal. The captain of England should be a role model.' </strong><br><br>In his autobiography, Seeing Red, exclusively serialised in Sportsmail from today, Poll exposes the bad behaviour of Terry and his manager Jose Mourinho. He questions whether the ferocious verbal abuse that he suffered from Chelsea last season was a premeditated attempt to influence decisions and provides a startling insight into life as a referee.<br><br>Poll accuses Mourinho of 'targeting referees' and 'putting them under pressure' , as well as 'trying to affect their decision making'. He says Mourinho is a 'truly great coach, but as a human being his methods are open to question'. He also accuses Mourinho of a 'filthy defilement', which he says, 'included a disgraceful personal comment about me and Sir Alex Ferguson', during one of the final matches of his 26-year refereeing career.<br><br>In an exclusive interview to coincide with the book serialisation, Poll says today: 'I don't think John Terry should be the England captain.' It follows Terry's Â£10,000 FA fine last season for accusing Poll in an 'utterly unfounded allegation that I had produced a deliberately falsified account of his red card (at Tottenham)'.<br><br>Poll said: 'Terry had his version of events proven false and then was not big enough to apologise or even acknowledge publicly what he had done. 'You will make your own judgment about whether that behaviour befits an England captain. I know what I think. 'It wasn't conduct becoming of an England captain. JT, have a look at yourself.'<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>nah. i kinda agree with Poll. I feel Stevie. G is the best captain in the current England squad. Terry is not at all inspirational. He may put his body on the line, be committed to the cause and launch full-blooded tackles with superb aerial prowess, but his character is not something which glows as a role-model.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Regardless of how Terry is as a player and a captain, I still prefer Stevie G to be the captain really for England.<br><br>Terry being the captain will mean England will still remain as a defensive-minded team where its players are not motivated to go all out.<br><br>Stevie G on the other hand, with his centre midfield position and all-action display is a more likely person where the other players would want to follow. This will bring benefits to the England setup.<br><br>Still, Poll retires already still want to make news...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> He really likes being in the spot-light.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Peharps his 3 yellow cards were also intentional.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
