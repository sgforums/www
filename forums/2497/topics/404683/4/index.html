              <p>You lost money on Holland, that's why you crying foul now. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>When you are going for the ball accidentally made contact with the opponent's leg(s), it's a foul but no yellow card.</p>
              <p>If you go for the opponent's leg(s) instead of the ball, it is a yellow card offence, which is what most of the Dutch players are doing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>lol if i say i bought draw will u believe me? i not denying spain is the better team. but u cant deny the webb is helping the spainish players. If spain were to win by not over acting and diving  and the help of ref. i have no problem saying tat spain deserve to win the champion. but losing in such a way is clearly not the kind of final i would want to see. Holland and spain play so hard to reach the final and either side lose in such a way will be sad to see. ok holland play dirty isnt spanish players play a part too? by acting and diving?  And ref is helping spainish side no doubt about tat. Oh ya i watch soccer too and know the rules :D and abt the de jong kong fu kick ya i tink is a bad foul but i dun tink is on purpose. oh ya didnt u say When you are going for the ball accidentally made contact with
                                          the opponent's leg(s), it's a foul but no yellow card. maybe he de jong was going for the ball too but accidentally made contact with the opponent chest? accident do happen but diving and acting is u do on purpose. when xavi kick the opponent leg and crying for penalty i feel so disgrace abt his attitude.</p>

              <p>When you raise your leg to that level, it's considered dangerous play, else every player would kick the opposing player on the head during corners, on the pretext that they were going for the ball. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>lol if i say i bought draw will u believe me? i not denying spain is the better team. but u cant deny the webb is helping the spainish players. If spain were to win by not over acting and diving  and the help of ref. i have no problem saying tat spain deserve to win the champion. but losing in such a way is clearly not the kind of final i would want to see. Holland and spain play so hard to reach the final and either side lose in such a way will be sad to see. ok holland play dirty isnt spanish players play a part too? by acting and diving?  And ref is helping spainish side no doubt about tat. Oh ya i watch soccer too and know the rules :D and abt the de jong kong fu kick ya i tink is a bad foul but i dun tink is on purpose. oh ya didnt u say When you are going for the ball accidentally made contact with the opponent's leg(s), it's a foul but no yellow card. maybe he de jong was going for the ball too but accidentally made contact with the opponent chest? accident do happen but diving and acting is u do on purpose. when xavi kick the opponent leg and crying for penalty i feel so disgrace abt his attitude.</p>

              <p>the fouls committed by the spanish are typical in a football match.  play-acting and exaggerating is also part of the modern game.  i agree with beta that some of the tackles committed by the dutch are malicious.  they went for the leg instead of the ball. </p>
              <p>the dutch were lucky to have gotten only one red.</p>

              <p>When you raise your leg to that level, it's considered dangerous
              play, else every player would kick the opposing player on the head

              <p>At one glance, it may seem as though the referee was biased against Holland.</p>
              <p>But seriously, pretty much all the cards that Webb dished out were justifiable under the circumstances, and if he had really played by the book, even more would have been dished out.</p>
              <p>Hell, both Robben and de Jong could have been sent off, and Holland would have been down to <em>eight </em>men.</p>
              <p>de Jong could have been red-carded for that truly malicious kung fu kick to Alonso's chest.</p>
              <p>Robben could have gotten a second yellow card for kicking the ball into goal after the whistle had already been blown. The ref perhaps gave him the benefit of the doubt because of the vuvuzelas, but we don't know what were Robben's intentions for sure.</p>

              <p>The point is not whether he failed but the intention was already there...puyol and van bommel were lucky to be still on the pitch...</p>
              <p>i dun think de jong's kick was intentional, it looked bad and was dangerous so yellow card was right...</p>
              <p>I think if the dutch didn't play the way they did, then it'll be just like watching germany vs spain all over again...spain passing around while the opposite could only watch...can't totally blame dutch for being physical although it wasn't nice to watch too..and i dun think dutch can play total football even if they wanted to against a team like spain.</p>
              <p>iniesta and xavi were a disgrace for waving the imaginary card at every opportunity even when it was clear that they dived...xavi for that pen appeal as well when it was clear he just kicked into heitinga's leg and tripped himself..</p>

              <p>Holland starting with Van Bommel and De Jong for every match already signal their intention to break down the opponent's attacks and midfield. Robben was stupid, he should have gone down under the challenge from Puyol then Webb will have no choice but to send Puyol off. Like what Iniesta did to Heitinga.</p>
              <p>Anyway again, the dutch were truly testing Howard Webb's patience with their constant fouling and at times over the board tackling of the legs instead of the ball, and Iniesta always draw fouls no matter who he plays against and yet they kept giving him the chance to go down which he is entitled to when there is contact.</p>
              <p>And yeah the waving of the imaginary card has to go. The spanish team is known for their theatrics, but yet again who gave them the chance to do it? None other then the Dutch.</p>
              <p>But anyway, thats how teams plays against Barcelona nowadays i guess.</p>

              <p>They're abit like Arsenal pass too much and reluctant to take the shot, although i should be saying Barcelona, but Barcelona creates much more chances and tend to be more clinical with em. This Spanish team is probably something like Barcelona without the penetration and skills of Messi.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>The Dutch fully derserved to lose. De Jong was lucky that Webb, under the pressure of the WC final, is reluctant to show a straight red card in the first half. We could have easily ended with 9 Dutch and 10 Spanish players left by the end of ET.</p></div>

              <p>It is a good match.</p>
              <p>Both sides play well with equal chances of winning the world cup.</p>
              <p>Holland is very creative in creating chances.</p>
              <p>Indeed, Holland has to start kicking legs like what they do to Brazil. Simply, because, in the terms of skills, Spain and bazil is just much better. But well, getting world cup is not about individual skills, reputation or whatever.</p>
              <p>I consider the referee is bias to both sides. He is more of a whim. I guess. But becoz of that, we get to see an exciting match with extra time. Any misjudgement like red card and penalty could easily cause the whole match to be ruined.</p>
              <p>Hence, thumbs up for the whimpy referee.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
