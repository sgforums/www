              <h1>EXCLUSIVE: Owen Hargreaves tells England manager Fabio Capello: I won't make World Cup</h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>An emotional Owen Hargreaves is resigned to missing this summer's World Cup.</p>
              <p>With his Manchester United
              playing career in the balance, Hargreaves has spoken to the England
              boss Fabio Capello, who has decided there is very little, if any,
              chance of the player making the trip to South Africa in June.</p>
              <p>There
              are growing fears that, at 29, the midfielder is losing his battle with
              tendinitis in his knees that has limited him to 25 starts for United in
              three years, costing the club nearly £1million each.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/27/article-0-02B2659500000578-451_468x458.jpg" alt="Owen Hargreaves " width="468" height="458">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Out of action: Hargreaves has not played a competitive game in over 500 days</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>It is 18 months since he last played and, after more than a year of
              rehab following operations on both legs, he has reverted from training
              with the first team to daily workouts with the club's physios.</p>
              <p>Last month Capello expressed the hope that Hargreaves, a candidate
              to fill England's troubled full-back positions as well as the holding
              role, would soon be back playing to confirm his fitness and take up a
              place in the England squad.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Down and almost out: Owen Hargreaves </em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But recently the weekly bulletins from United's medical staff to the
              Italian have been less encouraging and Hargreaves, who was voted
              England player of the year after the last World Cup, has been left in
              an increasingly emotional state.</p>
              <p>Although Sir Alex Ferguson has not given up hope on him making what
              would be a remarkable comeback, the next four days will merely
              emphasise what he will miss if his career really is all over.</p>
              <p>He is due at Wembley today, to watch his club-mates try to claim the
              Carling Cup, and will be staying just miles from the Grove Hotel, where
              the England players will gather to prepare for Wednesday's friendly
              against Egypt.</p>
              <p>With new captain Rio Ferdinand also struggling with a long-term back
              injury that has restricted him to just 34 of the past 92 games for club
              and country, plus doubts over the fitness of Ashley Cole and Glen
              Johnson, and the row between Wayne Bridge and John Terry, Hargreaves'
              news is the last thing Capello wanted to hear.</p>
              <p>A broken leg and knee problems delayed his move to United after the
              2006 World Cup in Germany, but he crowned his first season in
              Manchester by scoring a penalty in the shoot-out victory in the 2008
              Champions League final against Chelsea.</p>
              <p>However, his knees soon began to fail again and he played only three
              more games the following season, his last coming more than 500 days
              ago, in a 1-1 draw with Chelsea.</p>

              <p>'I probably shouldn't have played in that game,' said Hargreaves.
              'I struggled to drive my car for three days afterwards. Something was
              very wrong.</p>
              <p>'The last year has been difficult. As an athlete you think you are
              invincible. You don't think something of this magnitude will happen. I
              obviously had the problem when I came to Manchester United from Germany
              in 2007 and we tried to manage it.</p>
              <p>'Part of the problem for me was my competitiveness. I was new to
              United and they had spent a lot of time, energy and money in getting me
              from Bayern Munich.</p>
              <p>'I wanted to do well, obviously. I came with symptoms (of
              tendinitis) but everyone said, "Don't worry, it will go", so I always
              tried to be available. But playing on it made it worse. I wanted to
              play, though, so I played through it.'</p>
              <p>Recalling his doctor Richard Steadman's admission that he had never
              seen such bad tendons in 35 years of surgery, Hargreaves added: 'It was
              a dark day, hard to take because this was coming from a guy who was 72
              years old and had seen a lot of knees.'</p>
              <p>Hargreaves returned to United last September and resumed training
              but an intended comeback in November was put on ice. Even as recently
              as December, Capello held out hope for him. Fully aware of his valuable
              versatility, he said: 'He has to play.'</p>
