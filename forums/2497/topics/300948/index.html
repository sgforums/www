"I really hope it happens - and especially that I am eligible to play in the Champions League.<br><br>"But until the contract is signed and I am presented to the press in my new shirt, nothing is done."<br><br>Bolton are expected to ask for 26 million euros for Anelka - 14 more than they paid Fenerbahce for him in August 2006.<br><br>And agent Doug Pingisi is sure the in-form frontman is destined to leave sooner rather than later.<br><br>"Nico is ready to join a club at the height of his talent and his football," he said. "I would love to see him sing the Champions League anthem every year."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Nicolas Anelka was dramatically pulled out of the Bolton squad to face Sheffield United in the FA Cup as his move to Chelsea inched closer last night. The 28-year-old striker's transfer would have been placed in jeopardy if he had faced United in the third round tie this afternoon because he would not have been able to play for Chelsea in later rounds. </strong><br><br>Bolton manager Gary Megson decided to leave him on the sidelines after talks with the France international. Sources close to Anelka said they expect his transfer to go through next week after telling Megson he wanted to quit the Reebok Stadium.<br><br>Chelsea have made a bold attempt to take him on loan for the rest of the season but Bolton are demanding Â£11million to secure his release. Megson's decision to leave out Anelka is a clear indication that he will be moving.<br><br>Megson said: "It is a competition we want to do well in. The team that goes plays will be selected on what has gone on and what is coming up." Chelsea boss Avram Grant wanted the deal completed before their tie against Queens Park Rangers, but the two clubs could not agree terms.<br><br>It means Grant may have to play Claudio Pizarro up front against their Championship opponents at Stamford Bridge today, but at least the club have finally found a sense of humour.<br><br>The visitors book at their Cobham training centre had been signed by a 'Nicolas Anelka' yesterday with an arrival time of '1pm' but it appears Grant will be kept waiting a little longer. "Berbatov and Kaka were also in there. Maybe Anelka's here," said a relaxed Grant.<br><br></div>
