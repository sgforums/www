              <p><a href="http://www.goal.com/en/teams/england/97/man-utd-news"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> manager </strong><a href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/scotland/8123/sir-alex-ferguson"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson</strong></span></a><strong> has revealed that he finds having to sell members of his playing squad agonising.</strong><br><br>The 67-year-old has said that a manager becomes so involved with the players at a club that inevitably a family-like relationship is formed.<br><br>Although the Scottish tactician admits he relishes the pressures that come with taking charge of one of the world's biggest teams, he insists it is always extremely difficult having to tell players they are no longer needed, even if it is essential to do so.<br><br>"I’m at a great club and the driving demand to always be at the top is a good for me," Ferguson is quoted as saying by <em><span style="color: #333332;">The Sun</span></em>. "I love getting up in the morning. I like getting in to training early and watching the players train. I’ve never lost that.<br><br>"The leadership qualities needed at a club like Manchester United are high. You have to have respect from the players. "The horrible part of football is you fall in love with your players.<br><br>"A time comes when you see a deterioration and you know you have to make the change. A lot of people can’t do it. "They’re like your family but you must make those changes."<br><br>Meanwhile, turning his attentions to the Red Devils' Champions League semi-final second leg at Arsenal on Tuesday, Ferguson has opined that he would not be surprised if the tie was settled by a penalty shootout.<br><br>“These are two good football teams and there won’t be a lot in it,” he said. “It could even go to penalty kicks.”</p>
