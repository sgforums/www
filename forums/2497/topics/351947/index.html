              <p><strong>Tomas Rosicky’s return from injury has been put on hold once again. </strong></p>
              <p>The midfielder has not played for Arsenal since January 2008 on account of a hamstring tendon problem.</p>
              <p>There had been signs that Rosicky’s problems were in the past, as he
              had been tentatively pencilled in to return early in April.</p>
              <p>However, he has suffered a setback and Arsenal have opted to put all plans on hold for the Czech schemer for a fortnight.</p>
              <p>“Tomas has had a little setback of one week so he will be out for
              two weeks again,” said Gunners chief Arsene Wenger. “We have to be a
              bit more patient than in the start.</p>
              <p>“I told you two weeks ago that he would be back in full training but he will not.</p>
              <p>"He’ll be back in full training in two weeks’ time now.”</p>

              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Long-term absentee Tomas Rosicky has revealed that he is not worried about his latest injury setback. </strong></p>
              <p>The Arsenal midfielder has been out of action for over
              a year with a hamstring tendon injury and after numerous failed
              comebacks still finds himself sidelined.</p>
              <p>This time, after manager
              Arsene Wenger had confirmed that the Czech Republic ace would return to
              first team training in two weeks, a groin injury has delayed his latest
              comeback by an extra week.</p>
              <p>Despite yet more disappointment for
              the 28-year-old he insists that he has not been perturbed and declares
              he feels almost back to normal.</p>
              <p>"I don't want to jinx it, but it seems that my football life is getting back to normal," he told his own website.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p>"Had the groin problem not occurred, and
              the groin injury is nothing serious, I would have most likely been
              already training with the first team.</p>
              <p>"The most important thing is that the place where I have the cursed hamstring is okay and endures the training sessions."</p>
              <p>The
              groin injury is likely to rule Rosicky out of the upcoming
              international matches but he appears to be over the worst of an injury
              which forced him to question whether he would ever play again.</p>
              <p>"I can't wait to start playing and the stress which made me feel low in the past is now gone," he added.</p>
              <p>"During the injury I was having various thoughts in my mind. For instance, that I would never play football again.</p>
              <p>"Fortunately
              with the return to a normal football routine with training sessions, in
              which I have constantly been doing improvements, the stress has gone
              away.</p>
              <p>"The groin is not a thing which should prevent me from returning and I feel safe."</p>
