            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Hong Kong businessman Carson Yeung is expected to step up his bid to buy Birmingham during the next few days.</strong><br><br><img src="http://images.skysports.com/images/stadia/41.jpg"><br><br>The billionaire, who was unsuccessful in his attempt to take control of Reading, has already had his representatives visit St Andrews and inspect the club's finances.<br><br>Blues owners David Sullivan and David and Ralph Gold are happy that Yeung has the sufficient funds to buy them out - if they decide to sell for around Â£50million.<br><br>But they need to be satisfied that such a move would take the club forward and that Yeung and any of his business partners would have the good of the club at heart.<br><br>Sullivan has made it clear on several occasions that he would be happy to sell his stake in the club after 14 years and he has become tired of the travelling from his Essex base to the Midlands.<br><br>But it is understood chairman David Gold has more of an open mind about relinquishing his involvement in Blues whom he helped to rescue from major financial problems when linking up with them in 1993.<br><br>Gold would not comment but a source close to the club said: "David Sullivan has always said he would go if the right offer came but it is not quite the same situation with David Gold.<br><br>"It is not as if he would do the deal just for the money and it is not going to be a case of it changing his life if he sells up."<br><br>Sullivan and the Golds would also insist that funds would be available from Yeung - or any potential buyer - for manager Steve Bruce as he looks to build a squad capable of stopping in the Premier League after gaining promotion.</div>
