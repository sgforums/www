              <p><strong>Brazilian striker Ronaldo quizzed by Rio police after motel 'row with transvestite prostitutes'</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/05_01/RonaldoTransvestite_468x338.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><em>Brazilian transvestite Andre Luis Ribeiro Albertino, known as Andrea Albertino, reportedly holding the car documents of AC Milan player Ronaldo.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Brazil striker Ronaldo was questioned by police after a run-in with three transvestite prostitutes he took to a motel. The AC Milan star left an upmarket Rio de Janeiro nightclub with the call girls, according to police, but offered them about £300 each to leave when he discovered they were men.</strong></p>
              <p>Two accepted but Ronaldo claims the other, Andre Luis Ribeiro Albertino, demanded £15,000. Andre, who prefers to be called Andrea, says she has a receipt from Ronaldo of the purchase of three transvestites for Sunday night and also claimed the 31-year-old took drugs.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo admitted he knew they were prostitutes when they met on Sunday night, but did not realize they were transvestites until they got to the motel. She posted a grainy video on YouTube which purports to show Ronaldo and also posed with car documents said to belong to the three-time FIFA World Player of the Year.</p>
              <p>Prostitution is not illegal in Brazil. However, according to reports in Brazil, he told a police officer he feared the episode could end his career. Police chief Carlos Augusto Nogueira Pinto said: "Ronaldo's testimony is more reliable. From zero to 10, I give his testimony a nine. "He was very excited and wanted to go out and have fun, without the press knowing.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/02_03/Ronaldo2202_228x327.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>Ronaldo offered the prostitutes £300 each to leave when he discovered they were men.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Ronaldo said he is not good in the head and that he is going through psychological problems because of his recent surgery. "But he committed no crime at all, it was immoral at best."</p>
              <p>The player is back in Brazil recovering from a career-threatening knee injury. Ronaldo released a press statement, saying: "In view of recent events and in order to clarify the athlete Ronaldo has never been a user of drugs, had no criminal complaint registered against him and is the victim of an attempted extortion."</p>

              <h1><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ronaldo in hiding in Brazil after incident with prostitutes ends with transvestite facing charge of extortion.</span></h1>
              <p> </p>

              <p><em>Front pages of Brazilian newspapers showing pictures of Brazilian soccer star Ronaldo and transvestite Andre Luis Ribeiro Albertino, as known as Andreia Albertine in Rio.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Ronaldo went into hiding on Tuesday after an encounter with cross-dressing prostitutes that prompted police to investigate whether to charge one with trying to extort money from the three-time FIFA Player of the Year.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The AC Milan striker, in Brazil recovering from a knee surgery, cancelled two TV appearances, and local media said he will continue physiotherapy at his home. Police said Ronaldo committed no crime, but he was accused by one prostitute of using drugs and not wanting to pay. Prostitution is legal in Brazil. The transvestite could face charges of extorting money and stealing his vehicle licence, police said.</p>
              <p>"One of the transvestites said in his interview that the transvestite known as Andreia asked him (Ronaldo) for 50,000 reais (£14,892)," detective Carlos Augusto Nogueira told reporters. "It's very likely that he (Andreia) will be charged with extortion."</p>
              <p>Ronaldo acknowledged to police he knew they were prostitutes but did not realize they were cross-dressers until getting to a motel in the early hours Monday morning, when one allegedly tried to extort money from him to hide the story from the media, according to police.</p>
              <p>The motel manager - identified only as Luisa - said Ronaldo, who was dressed and appeared to be sober, tried to get rid of the prostitutes after realizing they were men. She told police Ronaldo offered the prostitutes $600 (£305) to end the incident but they would not accept dollars. The manager then converted the money into reais for Ronaldo, but before he made the payment Andreia asked for 50,000 reais to keep the story from the media.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/05_01/TransvestiteAndreia_468x587.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><em>Andre Luis Ribeiro Albertino, also known as Andreia Albertine, answers media questions in Brazil on Tuesday.</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><strong>A motel waiter, who was not identified in the police documents, told police the prostitute went to the street and yelled "the Phenomenon didn't want to pay." Witnesses also Andreia ripped out the phone wires to keep Ronaldo from calling for help, and broke into his car to steal his belongings. That prostitute later showed local media a vehicle document belonging to Ronaldo.</strong></p>
              <p>Police inspector Carlos Augusto Nogueira said there was no evidence drugs were involved in the incident. But he said Ronaldo and the prostitutes must return to the police station for further questioning next week. Nogueira added the one prostitute might be charged with extortion.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo will not be charged, Nogueira said, unless he threatened to physically assault the prostitutes, as one hinted. The case made front-page headlines in several Brazilian newspapers Tuesday. And a brief video clip of Ronaldo at the motel, apparently recorded by one of the prostitutes, became a big hit in Brazil after being posted on the YouTube website.</p>
