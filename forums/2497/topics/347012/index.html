              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Police have seized Manchester
              United forward Carlos Tevez's £140,000 Bentley after it was found he
              did not have a full UK driving licence.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The Argentina international
              was stopped by traffic officers on the hard shoulder of the M60 near
              Stretford in Manchester and they impounded his white Bentley
              Continental GT Speed.</p>
              <p>Police said they asked him to pull over, suspecting the car's windows were too dark.</p>
              <p>Tests at the roadside showed the tint was illegal, police said.</p>
              <p>Tevez, 25, is now being investigated by Greater Manchester
              Police for driving without a valid licence and could face prosecution,
              a police source said.</p>
              <p>The maximum penalty for driving without a valid licence carries a £1,000 fine and six points.</p>
              <p>A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: "Shortly after
              9.20am on Friday 6 February 2009, traffic officers pulled over a
              Bentley close to junction 7 of the M60.</p>
              <p>"The officers were concerned certain windows were illegally tinted.</p>
              <p>"They were tested and found to be too dark so a prohibition notice was issued to the driver.</p>
              <p>"When asked to provide his documentation, it was discovered the
              driver did not have a full UK driving licence and was advised to
              arrange removal of the car.</p>
              <p>"As he could not arrange this, the car was removed under Section 165 of Road Traffic Act 1988."</p>
              <p>In 2007, fellow United star Cristiano Ronaldo was stopped by
              police and fined for having blacked-out windows on his £140,000 Bentley
              convertible.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo was stopped by police again on Thursday and given
              "advice" by police who thought he was speeding but did not manage to
              register his actual speed, said Greater Manchester Police.</p>
              <p>A police source said that, by the time the officers had
              prepared their monitoring equipment, the Portuguese ace had slowed down
              from about 55mph in the 50mph zone.</p>
              <p>A police spokesman said: "On Thursday 5 February 2009, around
              3pm, traffic officers on A34 Kingsway stopped a car they believed was
              being driven at speed.</p>
              <p>"The car slowed as officers approached it so no official speed check could be made.</p>
              <p>"However the driver was pulled over, had his documents checked and was advised on his driving.</p>
              <p>"There was no evidence that any offences had been committed."</p>
