              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">JOE COLE will certainly have less stormy weeks at Liverpool than the past one has proved. In the space of five days the new Kop idol has been sent off, found guilty of speeding, set up a crucial Euro strike . . . and er, missed a penalty to boot.</h2>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">JOE COLE'S week from hell continued last night as his penalty miss left Liverpool with a Europa League mountain to climb.</h2>
              <p>Cole's blunder followed a red card against Arsenal last Sunday and being found guilty of speeding on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>His spot flop came on 52 minutes, after Lucas was hauled down.</p>
              <p>With skipper Steven Gerrard rested, Cole stepped up - and gave keeper Onur Kivrak an easy save to his left.</p>
              <p>The former Chelsea midfielder admitted: "It was a bad penalty and I hold my hands up.</p>
              <p>"The last penalty I took was when I was about 13 - and I scored that one."</p>
              <p>At least his pinpoint 45th-minute pass set up Ryan Babel's winner.</p>
              <p>Kop boss Roy Hodgson said: "You can't blame anyone else if you miss a penalty.</p>
              <p>"We deserved a second, which would have made next week's trip to Turkey more comfortable.</p>
              <p>"Now it won't be comfortable at all."</p>

              <p>The £23million Italian spared City's blushes by scoring after coming on as a sub.</p>
              <p>But hothead Balotelli, 20, also picked up a yellow card and Mancini said: "We must work on that because it will be different in the Premier League than in Italy.</p>
              <p>"We must have a word with him but he had a great debut and I'm so happy that he scored.</p>
              <p>"He is a good player but he needs to improve and get to know everybody." Balotelli limped off towards the end with a knee injury.</p>
              <p>But Mancini said: "We think it's not too serious. It was probably just a kick, but it is not a problem.</p>
              <p>"In the end this was a very good result for us."</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson admitted his side now face a testing trip to Turkey next week after a gaining a slender advantage over Trabzonspor on Thursday night.</strong></p>
              <p>Ryan Babel scored the only goal as the Reds beat the Turkish Cup winners 1-0 in the first leg of their Europa League play-off at Anfield.</p>
              <p>Victory would have been much more comfortable had Joe Cole converted a second-half penalty and debutant Christian Poulsen not had a goal disallowed.</p>
              <p>"I think with our second-half performance we can probably count ourselves unlucky," said Hodgson, who made seven changes and gave captain Steven Gerrard a night off.</p>
              <p>"We probably did deserve the extra goal which would have made the trip to Turkey more comfortable. Now it won't be comfortable at all.</p>
              <p>"If you miss a penalty you can't blame anybody but yourselves but I thought we were unlucky with the disallowed goal.</p>
              <p>"Overall I am very pleased with the result and performance, especially second half, but whether it will be good enough to take to Trabzonspor, only time will tell."</p>
              <p>Cole's miss continued a miserable week for the former Chelsea midfielder, who was sent off against Arsenal on Sunday and found guilty of speeding on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>He now begins a three-match domestic suspension starting with Monday's Barclays Premier League trip to Manchester City. </p>
              <p>Cole was quick to shoulder the blame after missing the penalty.</p>
              <p>Asked when he last took a penalty, Cole told ITV1: "When I was about 13, and I scored that one.</p>
              <p>"It was a bad penalty (tonight). It was pre-determined that I'd take it but you can't dwell on those things.</p>
              <p>"It was a bad penalty but we won 1-0 so we'll take the positives from that."</p>
              <p>On his new playmaking role for Liverpool, Cole said: "It's nice. I'm finding my feet in there.</p>
              <p>"It's my job to do that, to make goals, and it was nice to do that for Ryan tonight. He's a terrific player. I'm enjoying my time here, I've had a decent start."</p>
