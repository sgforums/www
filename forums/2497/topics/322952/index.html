              <div style="margin: 0px 0px 15px;">
              <p class="introcopy"><strong>CHELSEA last night offered Frank Lampard a new £140,000-a-week take-it-or-leave-it contract which would make him the highest-paid player in British football, in a desperate bid to keep him out of the clutches of Inter Milan.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="padding7north" style="font-size: 12px; margin: 4px 5px 4px 0px; line-height: 17px; text-align: justify;">
              <p class="storycopy"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">The attempt to persuade the England midfielder to stay came after Express Sport revealed yesterday that contract talks had reached deadlock and that Lampard was upset that new manager Luiz Felipe Scolari had not yet contacted him to assure him of his future at the club.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Geneva;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 12px;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">If Lampard accepts, he will move above captain John Terry in the Stamford Bridge pay scale as the highest earner at the club – and in the country. Terry is on around £135,000 a week, while other stars such as Germany skipper Michael Ballack and Andriy Shevchenko are earning around £130,000 a week.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Geneva;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 12px;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Chelsea’s dramatic late move appears to be a last-ditch offer to the England midfielder, who is due back for pre-season training on Monday. </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">New manager Scolari, though, has still not spoken to Lampard, who will return from holiday in Sicily tomorrow.  Sources have described the player as “disillusioned” by the silence from the Brazilian and ready to leave. The £8 million signing ofPortugal midfielder Deco earlier this week was hardly a positive sign.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Geneva;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 12px;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Inter, managed by Lampard’s former mentor Jose Mourinho, are convinced they have clinched a £7m  deal for the player with a £6m-a-year contract on offer, although no talks with Lampard have taken place.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Geneva;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 12px;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">One more sign that Scolari has Lampard some way down his list of priorities is that the manager has found the time for talks with centre-back Ricardo Carvalho in a bid to persuade him to stay. </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Geneva;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 12px;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Carvalho is a £24m target for Inter, but Scolari met the Portuguese star last week and begged him to stay at Stamford Bridge. The fact that the coach went out of his way to do that with another Blues player could spell the end of  Lampard’s Stamford Bridge career.</p>

              <p>I belief Chelsea's main objective isn't to keep Lampard... I think its more to do with Roman don't want to lose anything to Jose... So he is not going to let any Chelsea players join Jose at Inter if he can help it...</p>
              <p>So if money is a problem, then its no problem... But weather Lampard is used to the fullest or even get to play often under Scolari is another matter altogether... I belief with Scolari's boy Deco joining and Ballack... Lampard will be squeeze out and he probably won't like it considering that he is seen as Chelsea's no.2 after Terry...</p>

              <p>well, it takes some time to reap the rewards of building a team.  u cant expect chelsea to win all the trophies in a rebuilding season can u? maybe 1-2 seasons to go to rebuild a good team. </p>
              <p>and another thing,even with the bestest players, it takes time to gel them into a strong unit.</p>

              <p>what mentality? chelsea isnt made up of winning team mentality, but winning ego mentality.  theres big big egos in the team, which makes each of them proud to play in the blue jersey.  i cannot stress more that chelsea has most international captains in their team.</p>
