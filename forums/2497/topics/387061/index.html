              <p><strong>Patrick Vieira is expected to join <span style="color: #003580;">Manchester City</span> on a six-month loan deal by the start of next week. The former </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Arsenal</strong></span><strong> captain has spoken with his former Inter Milan coach Roberto Mancini, now the boss at Eastlands, and a deal is ‘99 per cent agreed’.</strong></p>
              <p>First, the 33-year-old has been asked to stay in Italy and provide cover for injury-hit Inter, who play Chievo tomorrow and Siena on Saturday.</p>
              <p>After that the France midfielder is expected to fly to Manchester and put pen to paper on the short-term loan, which carries the possibility of an 18-month contract to follow if everything goes well for both parties during his loan period.</p>
              <p>Vieira has been desperate to quit Inter since last summer, when France coach Raymond Domenech made it clear he needed to be playng regular league football to guarantee a place in this summer’s World Cup squad.</p>
              <p>He was on the brink of joining Tottenham last August after a bold move from Harry Redknapp but then had second thoughts when his former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also showed interest.</p>
              <p>Vieira had led the Arsenal ‘Invincibles’, who were unbeaten champions in 2003-04.</p>
              <p>Mancini suggested there would be a number of January arrivals yesterday when he said: ‘All the players want to join Manchester City. That is normal with a big club which is going to have a big future.</p>
              <p>'People are not only talking about Patrick Vieira, they are also saying Ivan Cordoba and Cristian Chivu.’</p>
              <p>However, instead of Inter’s Chivu, Mancini is expected to sign Argentinian left back Cristian Ansaldi from Russian champions Rubin Kazan, as first revealed by Sportsmail last month, for around £6million.</p>

              <h1>Man City to hand Vieira £150,000-a-week</h1>
              <div>
              <p><abbr><span>Manchester City</span></abbr> are ready to pay Patrick Vieira massive wages to sign him on-loan from <abbr><span>Inter Milan</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>The former <abbr><span>Arsenal</span></abbr> captain, whose clashes with Roy Keane came to symbolise the London club's rivalry with <abbr><span>Manchester United</span></abbr>, is meeting Internazionale in the next few days to determine whether he is still wanted at San Siro after losing his place as a mandatory first-team fixture since José Mourinho took over from City boss <abbr><span>Roberto Mancini</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>The <em>Guardian</em> says the proposal at City is to sign him initially on loan until the end of the season, and paying him £150,000 a week would be no problem for a club of such immense wealth.</p>

              <p> <a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1240804" rel="1240804|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1240804/Arsenal-manager-Arsene-Wenger-surprised-Patrick-Vieiras-proposed-Manchester-City.html"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger believes Manchester City will reap the rewards when they complete the loan signing of Patrick Vieira but admits he is 'surprised' his former captain has opted for a move to Eastlands.</strong></p>
              <p>The out-of-favour Inter Milan midfielder will sign a six-month loan deal with the mega-rich club by the start of next week in a desperate bid to force his way into France's World Cup squad.</p>
              <p>Vieria, 33, is expected to fly to Manchester and put pen to paper on the short-term loan, which carries the possibility of an 18-month contract to follow if everything goes well for both parties during his loan period.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Wenger came close to re-signing his former skipper in the summer but decided to keep faith with his young Guns, such as Aaron Ramsey and Denilson - a move which appears to have paid off, following the Gunners good run of form and emergence of Wales international Ramsey as a real contender to Cesc Fabregas' midfield crown.</p>
              </div>
              <p>'I will respect Patrick forever for what he has done and what he has achieved here,' Wenger said.  </p>
              <p>'We have young players in his position and are not in a real need to bring players in this position.'</p>
              <p>The Arsenal manager added: 'I was surprised it was Manchester City, because there were more talks about other clubs, but it is a good opportunity for him. </p>
              <p>'I believe he will still be very effective in the Premier League because he has been injury free for three or four months and that is what he needed.'</p>
              <p>Vieira played over 300 games for the Gunners and was instrumental in the 'Invincibles' side that went unbeaten for an entire League season in 2003-04.</p>

              <p>Jose
              Mourinho confirmed that Vieira would leave Inter following the club's
              1-0 victory over Chievo on Wednesday and Vieira has now said he wants
              to link up with Roberto Mancini at Eastlands to bolster his hopes of
              representing France at the World Cup.</p>
              <p>"I wanted to go to the World Cup and I need playing time," he told <em>Canal 
              Plus</em>. "It's over, after a year in Turin and three and a half years in Milan.</p>
              <p>"I have objectives and I can't achieve them by staying at Inter where I am not 
              part of the coach's choice.</p>
              <p>"What's important for me is to go to Manchester City, to show the coach that I 
              am the same as I was during the period when he was at Inter. All this will help me get into the France team."</p>
              <p>Vieira
              last played an official game for France in September 2007. He has
              played 12 league games for Inter this season as well as two in the
              Champions League.</p>

              <p>He told the <em>club's website</em>: "Patrick is a world class midfielder with a winner's mentality and will fit into this group very well.</p>
              <p>"He knows me and my staff well, and importantly he also knows what the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> is all about. He will not need much time to settle in.</p>
              <p>"Patrick is one of the great players of his era with every almost every
              honour in the game against his name. I am sure City fans will welcome
              him warmly and appreciate the contribution he will make."</p>
