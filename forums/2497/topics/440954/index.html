              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Tottenham</strong></span></a><strong> manager Harry Redknapp has revealed he will be back on the White Hart Lane touchline soon.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The 64-year-old has spoken about his heart scare, revealing he had chest pains and struggled to breathe as he ran at home.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>He had two stents inserted to unblock coronary arteries on Wednesday, forcing him to miss Thursday's Europa League Group A game at Rubin Kazan.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>However, he has made good progress in his recuperation and is planning to return to the White Hart Lane touchline "in a couple of weeks".</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>He told <em>The Sun</em>: 'I have a running machine at home and run or jog for around half an hour several times a week to help stay fit.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'But this time I went on and had been running for no more than about two minutes when I felt pains in my chest. I had hardly got going when it went tight and I was struggling to breathe.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'As soon as that happens you know the best thing to do is stop immediately, which I did.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I wasn't that frightened if I'm honest - but it was clearly a warning sign from within.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I just stopped running there and then and I went to see the club doctor at Spurs. He got me in to see a specialist on Saturday and by Monday I was in hospital.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I've had narrow or blocked arteries for some time. I've been taking tablets for it just like a lot of people my age do. It's no big thing.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>On Wednesday's procedure, Redknapp continued: 'They didn't even put me out. I was sort of half-conscious while they did what they had to do and now it's all taken care of.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I haven't had a heart attack. It was just that the specialist told me the arteries needed doing now.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'So we arranged it all and here I am. I feel fine and everyone tells me I will soon be feeling better than ever.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I'm lucky that I work in an industry where there are experts and specialists on hand to look after you properly.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Redknapp says his doctor has told him to put his feet up 'for the next couple of weeks'.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>He said: 'That's handy because after this weekend we have a break for international matches coming up anyway.</span></p>
