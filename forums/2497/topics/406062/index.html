              <h1>Manchester City target James Milner wants to leave Aston Villa, 
              admits Martin O'Neill<br></h1>

              </div>
              <p>Martin O'Neill admits that James Milner has voiced his desire to 
              leave Aston
               Villa for a lucrative move to Manchester
               City.</p>
              <p>The Villa Park manager is ready to let go of the 
              England international, but only if City up their bid.</p>
              <p>The 
              Eastlands big-spenders have already bid more than £20million, but 
              O'Neill is said to rate the 24-year-old at £30m.</p>

              </div>
              <p>‘There is a question mark over James Milner,' 
              said O'Neill. 'I had a conversation with James before the World Cup and 
              he intimated that he would like to go at that time.</p>
              <p>‘I haven’t
               spoken to him since. I know there have been conversations with his 
              agent and our chief executive.</p>

              </div>
              <p>'Manchester City have made an offer for the player but certainly 
              there is a difference in valuation.</p>
              <p>‘But I’m sure things will get 
              resolved. James is due back next week after an extended stay after the 
              World Cup – the same as the rest of the World Cup players like Emile 
              Heskey, Stephen Warnock and Brad Guzan.</p>
              <p>‘They are all due back
               next week and I imagine things will get resolved one way or the other 
              in the very foreseeable future.’</p>
              <p>Villa would be disappointed to 
              lose one of their key players and offered to make Milner the highest 
              paid player in the club's history during talks before the World Cup 
              finals.</p>
              <p>However, O'Neill said that the former Leeds and Newcastle 
              player had turned down proposal and made it clear he wanted to move to a
               bigger club.</p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>first
               revealed in May that City had identified the versatile player as a 
              central part of their transfer plans, but they have been busy signing 
              other stars as the pursuit dragged on.</p>
              <p>City are wary of being 
              exploited and while Roberto Mancini this week admitted he wanted Milner,
               he warned the asking price was too high.</p>
              <p>'When Manchester 
              City want to buy a player, other clubs ask much more than is normal,' 
              said the Italian. 'This is not good and it is not right.</p>
              <p>'We 
              have bought three good players already but now Inter Milan, for example,
               are asking a lot of money for Mario Balotelli, and we want to wait.</p>
              <p>'We
               are interested in good players like Balotelli and Milner but we have 
              time before the market closes in August. We have a lot of different 
              choices.'</p>
