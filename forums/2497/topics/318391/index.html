              <p><strong>Chelsea began preparing for life without manager Avram Grant last night by confirming that disgraced striker Didier Drogba will be sold this summer. The £24million forward, sent off late on in their Champions League Final defeat by Manchester United, can leave Stamford Bridge.</strong></p>
              <div class="clear">
              <p>While the search is on for a big-name manager, Chelsea will trim their first team squad to 25 names as part of a major overhaul and will add another three top quality signings to challenge United for the Barclays Premier League and European Cup next season.</p>
              <p>Chief executive Peter Kenyon continues to work on taking highly-rated Palermo striker Amauri to Chelsea but the Brazilian, who now has an Italian passport, is considering rival offers from both Milan clubs as well as Juventus.</p>
              <p>Kenyon said: 'We've brought in one player, Jose Bosingwa from Porto, who strengthens a position which has been an issue for us. We'll take our time to look at what else is needed but I think that's two rather than 20.'</p>
              <p>Grant's role is also being resolved by the owner Roman Abramovich, chairman Bruce Buck, director Eugene Tenenbaum and Kenyon.</p>
              <p>But Chelsea are seeking a new manager to revive a squad who failed to win a trophy.</p>

              <p><strong>Meanwhile, captain John Terry, who missed the penalty that could have won the Champions League for Chelsea, may be subjected to a UEFA study of his clash with United striker Carlos Tevez following Drogba's red card.</strong></p>
              <p>Terry has denied any wrongdoing and UEFA spokesman William Gaillard said: 'We must wait for the report from the referee and the UEFA delegate. If the referee says he saw the incident and that the player did not spit then that would be the end of the matter. But if he says he did not see the incident we will go back to the video images.'</p>
              <p>Tevez refused to point the finger at Terry but said: 'I do not understand the attitude of Terry. He told me that I was not a sportsman because I would not put the ball out. For me, this is a forgotten subject now.'</p>

              <h1>Chelsea's Didier Drogba gets up to his old histrionic tricks in Champions League final</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="story"><strong>Why did Terry take Chelsea's fifth penalty?</strong> <br>Terry was not in Chelsea's original list of penalty takers but with Drogba having been sent off the captain put himself forward ahead of Kalou and Anelka for the high pressure moment.</p>
              <p><strong>Did he really slip?</strong> <br>Yes. As he stepped up to take his penalty, right-footed, he left boot gave way and crossed across his body. The slip was almost certainly down to a mixture of fatigue - the Chelsea captain has suffered a succession of injuries this season and had just completed 120 gruelling minutes in the torrential rain of Moscow - and the rain-soaked pitch.</p>
              <p class="story"><strong>What happened to Rooney?</strong> <br>He started brilliantly but his overall performance mirrored his season - expectations just too high. His game suffered in the second half particularly when he switched to the right-hand side of a five man midfield. It doesn't suit the precocious youngster and his performance seemed to suffer as a consequence.</p>
              <p class="story"><strong>Was Tevez spat at?</strong> <br>Terry was accused of appearing to spit at United's Carlos Tevez near the end in the incident that saw Didier Drogba red-carded. As referee Lubos Michel was showing the Chelsea front man the card, Terry leant down and appeared to cover his mouth as he whispered something into Tevez's ear. Some say they saw him spit but Terry vehemently denies that.</p>
              <p class="story"><strong>Did the pitch cause players to cramp up? Did players wear the wrong boots?</strong> <br>Cramp was clearly in evidence, but after 120 minutes of high-octane football, it was to be expected, just as it is in almost ever Wembley Cup final. As for the boots, players with blades swapped for studs, including Ashley Cole, but the heavy rain during extra time will have had an affect.</p>
              <p class="story"><strong>Was Moscow a success?</strong> <br>Logistically it was a nightmare, with the stadium a long way from the city centre. The game though was one of the best finals in the last decade, bettered only by Liverpool's triumph over AC Milan in Istanbul. And the fans were immaculately behaved.</p>
              <p class="story"><strong>How many players have been sent off in a Champions League final?</strong> <br>Incredibly, just two: Jens Lehmann went in 2006, playing for Arsenal against Barcelona in Paris The second came on Wednesday when Drogba slapped Nemanja Vidic.</p>
              <p class="story"><strong>Who was the best/worst diver of the night/most histrionic?</strong> <br>Didier Drogba by a long way. The Chelsea striker's histrionics are the subject of a dossier kept by Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez, and the Ivorian did not disappoint.</p>
