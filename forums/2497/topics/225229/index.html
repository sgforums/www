            <div class='col-md body'>Hargreaves again makes case for Man Utd move<br>tribalfooball.com - December 13, 2006<br><br>Bayern Munich midfielder Owen Hargreaves has again stated his ambition to join Manchester United as the days count down to the reopening of the transfer market.<br><br>"It's about the opportunity to possibly play in another league I haven't played in before, which is also the country I represent and where my family lives," said Hargreaves.<br><br>"If people don't understand that, I don't expect them to. It's not their life. It's mine. But I don't think anyone in the football world is in the same situation as mine."<br><br>When Ferguson failed to land his primary summer target he bought Michael Carrick from Tottenham for ï¿½18.6million and Hargreaves accepts if Bayern continue to dig their heels in during the next transfer window he may lose the chance of a move to Old Trafford.<br><br>"Nobody at any club is going to wait for anyone forever," Hargreaves told The Times.<br><br>"I don't want to go into too great depth about it because it's not down to me. I received a lot of criticism for suggesting it would have been a great opportunity, but sometimes you need to say it. I don't feel bad about anything I said or did.<br><br>"Anybody who sees them play at the moment knows it's a very special team and they're in a great time.<br><br>"But it's not like I'm saying I want to go to AC Milan or Inter Milan because they're offering me more money.<br><br>"It's because it's England and because Britain is where my family is. My parents and my brothers are in Canada, but the whole of my dad's side of the family is in Bolton and my mum's side is in Rhyl.<br><br>"I think some people don't realise that. They think I'm half-German or something, but I'm not. I was brought up by a British family. It just happened to be in Canada."<br><br><strong>how many times must he state that  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </strong></div>
