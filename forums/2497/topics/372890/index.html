              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> have completed the signing of AEK Athens defender Sotirios Kyrgiakos to a two-year contract.</p>
              <p>Reds boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rafa Benitez</span></abbr> said: "He has had experience in Scotland with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rangers</span></abbr>, and in Germany with Eintracht Frankfurt as well as with the Greek national side.</p>
              <p>"He is strong and good in the air, and we were looking for experience and he is the perfect answer."</p>
              <p>Kyrgiakos, who has been capped 50 times by Greece and will be unveiled
              to the media tomorrow, described his decision to move to England as
              "the biggest challenge of my career".</p>
              <p>The tough-tackling defender moved back to Greece in 2008 after one season at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rangers</span></abbr> and two with Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>
              <p>Benitez maintains that Kyrgiakos will be an excellent signing
              for the Reds, saying: "He is a tough defender who is strong and good in
              the air.</p>
              <p>"He has a strong character and we were looking for these things.</p>
              <p>"He can score goals and will be a threat from corners and
              free-kicks. He is very strong in defence but he will need time as
              always to settle into the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr>. He will be a very good signing for us.</p>
              <p>"We knew the player when he was with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rangers</span></abbr> and we've been watching videos of him at Frankfurt and the national team. Our scout department had a lot of information.</p>
              <p>"We have talked about the things he has done before and the things he
              will have to do for us. It was good. He knows what we want and he's
              ready to work."</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rafa Benitez</span></abbr> says new signing Sotirios Kyrgiakos is the man to replace Sami Hyypia.</p>
              <p>"Since Sami left the club, we have been looking for a player with
              quality and Sotirios is the kind of player we were looking for," the
              boss told his weekly press conference at Melwood.</p>
              <p>"Our fans have knowledge of international football and he has
              played in Scotland, Germany and Greece, so I think everyone will know
              he is a strong, aggressive player who is good in the air.</p>
              <p>"He will be a physical presence in both penalty areas, which is
              good for us because he is exactly the kind of player we were looking
              for. He can give us something different."</p>
