            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">It's been a colourful old year as far as sport is concerned. Zidane saw red, Materazzi saw stars and Poll saw yellow - three times.<br><br>England fans might want to erase 2006 from their minds, but before we see the old year out, take 10 minutes to have a laugh at what happens when sporting folk open their mouths.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>SEXISM IS ALIVE AND WELL</strong></span><br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42396000/jpg/_42396409_womanwashingup270.jpg"><br><span class="small">Newell's idea of a career woman.</span><br><br>"She shouldn't be here. I know that sounds sexist but I am sexist. This is not park football, so what are women doing here? If you start bringing in women you have big problems. It is tokenism for the politically correct idiots."<br><strong>Luton manager Mike Newell blames assistant referee Amy Rayner for the 3-2 defeat by QPR.</strong><br><br>"Next time I'll learn to dive maybe, but I'm not a woman."<br><strong>Thierry Henry's views on Barcelona after Arsenal's Champions League final defeat. </strong><br><br>"There were a couple of girls shouting at me from the floor. At first I thought they fancied me but then I worked out they were shouting at me to miss. I don't really listen to women when they shout at me. If I was at home with the wife I'd just go to the bedroom and ignore her."<br><strong>Peter Manley, runner-up in the PDC World Darts Championship - and evidently living in the 1950s. </strong><br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>THE WARNOCK AND MOURINHO SHOW</strong></span><br><br>"He is almost a Yorkshireman with a Portuguese accent."<br><strong>Warnock on Mourinho.</strong><br><br>"My wife will be glad about Mourinho coming to Bramall Lane because he's a good looking swine, isn't he?"<br><strong>Warnock warms up for the Barclays Premiership after Sheffield United's promotion is confirmed. </strong><br><br>"Places like this are the soul of English football. The crowd is magnificent, saying '**** off Mourinho' and so on.<br><strong>Mourinho revels in the abuse he received from Blades fans at Bramall Lane. </strong><br><br>"The worst thing about playing Chelsea is having to listen to Mourinho afterwards."<br><strong>Barcelona defender Edmilson.</strong><br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>COMMENTATORS' CLASSICS</strong></span><br><br>"Snakes on a plane? What's that all about?"<br><strong>ITV's Andy Townsend, when asked about the film Snakes on a Plane on Talksport. </strong><br><br>"Most managers would give their right arm for a European Cup, and Bob Paisley had three."<br><strong>Football Focus presenter Manish Bhasin. </strong><br><br>"Scholes walks away a bit gingerly."<br><strong>David Pleat after Paul Scholes had been hurt during Man Utd's Champions League game against Celtic.</strong><br><br>"People need to understand what kind of goldfish Wayne Rooney lives in."<br><strong>Graham Taylor on Rooney.</strong><br><br>Commentator: "Did you ever have a lucky charm Graham?" Graham Taylor: "Yes, my wife. But I never laid her on the touchline."<br><strong>Taylor on Stuart Pearce's daughter's toy horse, which he had been placing on the touchline. </strong><br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>THE REST</strong></span><br><br>"We went to watch a show - Billy Joel. Half of the foreign lads weren't quite sure who Billy Joel was, but I enjoyed it anyway. For the Charlton game I'll really punish them - I'll take them to see Mamma Mia."<br><strong>Portsmouth boss Harry Redknapp celebrates the 3-1 win over Fulham in unconventional style.</strong><br><br>"It's been harder this year, Liverpool have got better, Man U have got better, Arsenal have got better, and Tottenham have joined the quartet of five teams."<br><strong>Chelsea's Joe Cole celebrates winning the title against Man Utd - you do the math. </strong><br><br>"By the time you read this we'll have had a scan on Fabregas. His foot blew up after the game and that's not the best sign."<br><strong>Arsene Wenger on Fabregas's 'explosive' foot.</strong><br><br>"I think they are disingenuous. Their behaviour doesn't surprise me - they sell d***os for a living."<br><strong>Crystal Palace chairman Simon Jordan on Birmingham owners David Sullivan and David Gold. </strong><br><br>"There's no problem with Jermain. I wouldn't swap him for Miss World - he would probably swap me for Miss World though."<br><strong>Martin Jol on Jermain Defoe's future. </strong><br><br>"I'm not the biggest fan of Elvis Presley. He's all right, he gets the job done. But he's not quite 50 Cent or Eminem."<br><strong>Andy Murray disses The King.</strong><br><br>"When I looked down the leg was lying one way and my ankle was pointing towards Hong Kong - so I knew I was in serious trouble."<br><strong>Manchester United's Alan Smith on the horrific injury he suffered against Liverpool in the FA Cup.</strong><br><br>"Don't be fooled by the way I look. People say you eventually start to grow to look like the missus but I wouldn't be that unkind to my Sandra."<br><strong>Harry Redknapp. </strong><br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42396000/jpg/_42396527_bellamyfan203.jpg"><br><span class="small">You wouldn't be lying to me would you Craig?</span><br><br>"He says he's a Red, but they all say that when they sign, don't they?"<br><strong>Steven Gerrard is suspicious about new team-mate Craig Bellamy's claim to be a lifelong Liverpool fan. </strong><br><br>"He taught me a new phrase because he said he was 'over the moon' to be back at Liverpool and I had never heard that before."<br><strong>Robbie Fowler impresses new Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez with his wide-ranging vocabulary.</strong><br><br>"At Madrid we all kiss each other before we go out. Against Jamaica, Aaron Lennon was waiting to replace me and as I approached I reached forward to kiss him, but then thought 'no, better not'."<br><strong>David Beckham on the difference between English and Spanish customs. </strong><br><br>"I put on a video of one of his recent fights and it made my eyes water, there were so many low blows. I want a big family so I was straight on the phone to sort out some insurance for my meat and two veg!"<br><strong>Super featherweight Kevin Mitchell before his Commonwealth title fight with Ghana's George Ashie. Mitchell won the contest on points, with everything intact.</strong><br><br>"You only have to fart in the box to concede a penalty these days."<br><strong>Leeds manager Kevin Blackwell bemoans a penalty decision given against them.</strong><br><br>"I have no regrets, but it is a big surprise to me because he cancelled his contract to go abroad. Have you sold Portsmouth to a foreign country? No."<br><strong>Arsene Wenger expresses his surprise upon hearing that Sol Campbell is poised to join Portsmouth.</strong><br><br></div>
