              <h1>Silvestre takes it upon himself to advise Arsene</h1>
              <p><strong>Mikael Silvestre has done little to improve his dwindling stock by demanding Arsene Wenger remedy Arsenal’s ‘weaknesses’.</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.arsenal.com/assets/_files/scaled/498x343/aug_08/gun__1219306236_silvestre_gallery3.jpg" alt="" width="498" height="343"></p>
              <p><strong>Silvestre has barely covered himself in glory in amidst a less-than
                  glorious Gunners defence in recent weeks and, for many, is indicative
                  of the soft centre that Wenger must address over the summer.</strong></p>
              <p>Wenger has been typically coy on his transfer window recruitment
                  drive but has hinted that he may bow to the increasing pressure to add
                  more experience to the fledglings that were so starkly shown up against
                  Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Silvestre - as guilty a party as any against Chelsea on
                  Sunday - feels that such games have highlighted just how much The
                  Gunners must strengthen.</p>
              <p>"We have played against top sides and shown weaknesses. It's for the boss to analyse that," said the Frenchman.</p>
              <p>"It has been a very bad week - two defeats at home. Now we need to
                  concentrate on the last two games and stay professional to the end.
                  People talk about character - but the character is there.</p>
              <p>"These players are going to grow. You learn more when you have
                  defeats like this. But it's a bad season overall. It's disappointing to
                  finish where we have."</p>
              <p>Whilst Wenger will focus his attentions on the field, many eyes will
                  be looking to the Emirates Stadium boardroom where Stan Kroenke on
                  Tuesday purchased two more ordinary shares of the club but maintained a
                  28.3 percent stake in the club.</p>

              <p><strong>Robin van Persie has urged every Arsenal player to stay and fight to end the club’s four-year wait for silverware. </strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/arsenal/van_persie_weird_480.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>Van Persie, who is in talks to sign a new contract in North
              London, was responding to the inevitable panic caused by Sunday’s 4-1
              home defeat at the hands of neighbours Chelsea. </strong></p>
              <p>Having conceded four to Liverpool and three to Manchester
              United in recent weeks, the temptation to hit the panic button is all
              too real for supporters of Arsenal right now.</p>
              <p>However, Sunday’s defeat overshadows the fact that The Gunners
              were 21 games unbeaten in the league prior to kick-off, as well as the
              fact that Alex’s goal was the first conceded in the league at home
              since Robbie Keane’s strike for Liverpool back in December.</p>
              <p>Last summer Arsenal lost key men in Matheiu Flamini, Alexander
              Hleb, Jens Lehmann and Gilberto Silva, but Van Persie has urged the
              class of ’09 to stick together.</p>
              <p>"The main thing for me is that we stay together," said the Dutchman, who has a year to run on his current deal.</p>
              <p>"If we lose three or four every year it is hard to get the spirit in. Hopefully we can stay here and have a real go at it.</p>
              <p>"If we can produce games like we did this year there is room for
              improvement - if you look at our midfield it is between 20 and 22."</p>
              <p>Arsenal will finish the season having reached the semi-finals
              of the Champions League and FA Cup, as well as finishing fourth in the
              table.</p>
              <p>Van Persie insists, given Arsene Wenger’s budget, the potential for the future is huge.</p>
              <p>"If you look at our squad and different teams, for example
              Chelsea, Manchester United or Liverpool, what they cost and what we
              have cost, that has something to do with it. We can be proud of
              ourselves."</p>
