              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>WESLEY SNEIJDER has warned Real Madrid AGAINST signing Cristiano Ronaldo. The Holland star claims the huge salary the Manchester United ace would command will create a bad atmosphere in the dressing room.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Asked if Ronaldo's signing would be bad for morale, Real midfielder Sneijder said: "“The truth is yes. "It’d be bad for the dressing room because he would earn better wages than the rest of the squad. “It wouldn’t be a problem to me but some team-mates wouldn’t fancy it. "Here we have players like him — Arjen Robben and Robinho for example. “For sure I want to play with Cristiano but the dressing room’s harmony has to be maintained.”</p>
              <p class="article">Sneijder, 24, also insists reigning the La Liga champions can go on to further success <strong>WITHOUT</strong> the Portuguese winger. Ronaldo, 23, has been linked with a record-breaking £75million move after admitting it was his dream to play for Real.</p>
              <p class="article">But Sneijder insisted: “To me this Madrid side doesn’t need to make signings. We’ve been very solid and the team has improved. “This squad is quite strong and is going to be even better next year.</p>
              <p class="article">“Cristiano is a great player and him coming at Madrid would be welcomed by the entire group. “But right now nobody can say anything because speaking well about him shows a lack of respect to the players we have — and Real Madrid have talented ones.” And Sneijder claims Real already have a player of similar stature to Ronaldo within their ranks.</p>
              <p class="article">Sneider said: "I want Robinho stay at Madrid because I think he’s almost as good as Cristiano Ronaldo. “People criticise Robinho for not having shone in big games but Cristiano did the same when I watched Manchester United’s important games. “It’s not a criticism. I’m just trying to explain that a player can’t be at his best all the time.”</p>
              <p class="article">Sneijder's comments come on the same day that Marca claim - for roughly the 17th time - that the Glazers are ready to negotiate with Madrid for Ronaldo rather than let him rot in the stands.</p>

              <p><br>Far from it i think... Otherwise Real would do more to hold on to them... Sneijder did quite well in the Euro but at Madrid, he is somewhat ok only... Like we saw in that game against Russia, no consistency... Robinho, well... Despite Real rating him like a $48 million pounds player to Chelsea... We can see that he is not highly regarded at Real at all and earn only $30,000 a week with Real still refusing to give him a better deal...</p>
              <p>Sneijder I would say, is not even better than Fabregas... I see him more as a squad player like Carrick and Hargreaves only... Not bad, rather good actually but not great...</p>
              <p>The only players i feel that would come close to Ronaldo is Robben and Messi... But Robben has quite a few weakness like physical strength and injury prone... Messi, great player with moving the ball but not so great with his heading, shooting and freekicks...</p>
              <p>That could very well explain why Real are ready to let them go in their pursuit of Ronaldo...</p>

              <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo will 'be here soon', says Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/graphics/2008/07/17/ufnron.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="small"></p>
              <p class="story"><strong>The drawn-out saga of Cristiano Ronaldo's transfer to Real Madrid has had a destabilising effect on the Madrid dressing room. With no further indication as to whether Ronaldo will become a Real player before the start of the new season, one team member has taken it upon themselves to find out the latest development by going straight to the top.</strong></p>
              <p class="story">According to Spanish sports daily AS, an unnamed player jokingly asked Real president Ramon Calderon when Ronaldo would be joining the club to be greeted with a smile and a "Don't worry, he'll be here soon" reply.</p>
              <p class="story">Wesley Sneijder has already aired his concerns at Real's determination to acquire the 23-year-old this summer. The Real midfielder has questioned the wisdom of signing Ronaldo because of the effect his wages would have on the squad</p>
              <p class="story">While separating himself from any financial envy, Sneijder believes that some members of the Spanish champions' squad would not be happy earning less than the Portuguese star. "The truth is that could happen a bit. It would be bad for the squad if one player had a much higher salary than the rest," he said. "It would not matter to me, but I know that there are other players that would not like that. But I do not want to say much because every day there is different news."</p>
              <p class="story">It has been claimed that Ronaldo could earn £200,000-a-week by joining Real who will also break the world record transfer to persuade the Glazers to finally part with last season's top goalscorer.</p>
              <p class="story">On paper, Real may be one of the world's richest clubs but earlier this year they were forced to take out a £30 million loan to cover operating costs and to compensate for the estimated £30m loss in annual revenue of David Beckham's move to Los Angeles Galaxy last summer.</p>
              <p class="story">Spanish newspaper Marca, however, believe Real will now take out another loan, this time in the region of €70m to fund their bid. Their thinking being that Ronaldo's arrival will recoup their losses in merchandising and promotional deals. United continue to insist that Ronaldo is not for sale even though Dimitar Berbatov is most likely to become the Portuguese international's replacement as he nears a £28m move to Old Trafford.</p>
              <p class="story">Barcelona are reportedly ready to scupper United's bid to bring in the Spurs striker with a €30m bid as their negotiations with Arsenal over Emmanuel Adebayor look to have broken down. Real's rivals have cash at their disposal following the £19.8m departure of Ronaldinho to AC Milan.</p>
