              struggled to make any impact against Shamrock Rovers in his first
              appearance for Real Madrid as the Spanish giants sneaked a 1-0
              pre-season friendly win.</p>
              <p>The 2008 World Player of the Year made his debut for
              the Primera Liga runners-up in Dublin after his record-breaking move
              from Manchester United.</p>
              <p>But the £80million man failed to shine as
              he came in for close attention from Rovers defenders and he was
              withdrawn at half-time.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo's fellow summer arrival Karim Benzema proved the match winner as he struck the only goal of the game in the 87th minute.</p>
              <p>Former
              United hero Ronaldo was given two chances to produce with a free-kick,
              but sent the first one well wide and the second into the wall.</p>
              <p>The
              best scoring chance in the first half fell to the hosts as Sean
              O'Connor cut in from the right-hand side before sending a low shot just
              wide.</p>
              <p>Real looked more dangerous after the break, with Rafael van
              der Vaart going close twice, the second with a spectacular overhead
              kick, and Benzema striking the post in the 56th minute.</p>
              <p>Eventually, it was ex-Lyon ace Benzema who won it, latching on to a long ball to score the only goal three minutes from time.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>In my opinion, I don't think Ronaldo will survive for long in Real. He will not get the same treatment in Real as when he was in Man Utd. Fergie was patient and gave him almost automatic starts everytime. But I don't think Real Madrid has the same patience. I'm guessing after a few starts of no excitement, he will eventually be dropped to the bench and that is when things will get ugly given his diva attitude lols... Maybe in La Liga, he will perform better? Lets wait and see, quite interesting to see what's gonna happen to him lolx..</p></div>

              <h1>Benzema steals show on Ronaldo's opening night</h1>

              <p><strong>DUBLIN
              - Cristiano Ronaldo wore the white of Real Madrid on Monday for the
              first time since his record move from Manchester United, playing 45
              minutes in a 1-0 friendly win over lowly Irish side Shamrock Rovers.</strong></p>
              <p>But it was fellow big-money
              signing Karim Benzema who spared the Spanish side's blushes, striking
              three minutes from time against a team who flirted with bankruptcy four
              years ago and whose highest earner pockets around 1,000 euros a week.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo's every touch was booed
              by the 10,915 fans squashed into Rovers' Tallaght Stadium, where
              capacity was trebled to see Real's Galacticos who had trained for a
              week on the outskirts of Dublin.</p>
              <p>Some tried to catch a glimpse
              of the world player of the year from nearby apartments, many with
              190,000 euro for sale signs attached, roughly what Real's new number
              nine earns a week.</p>
              <p>The Portuguese received a
              hostile reception and Rovers centre-half Pat Flynn sent the winger
              clattering to the floor after his first touches had sent him speeding
              past defenders in trademark style.</p>
              <p>With Kaka in Madrid alongside
              Real's other Confederations Cup representatives and Benzema starting on
              the bench, Ronaldo provided the only first-half evidence of Real's
              audacious spending spree of more than 200 million euros.</p>
              <p>Despite resting five leading
              players, the hosts matched their opponents in the first half, allowing
              only fullback Marcelo a clear sight at goal.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo drew the biggest cheer
              of the first half when his free kick went well wide and when a second
              effort tamely struck the wall 15 minutes later, the crowds taunts of
              "who are ya" grew louder.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo played no further part as new Real coach Manuel Pellegrini made nine changes at halftime.</p>
              <p>Former Lyon forward Benzema was
              among the changes and after having a scuffed shot cleared off the line,
              he controlled a long ball expertly and coolly finished in the 87th
              minute to seal victory.</p>
