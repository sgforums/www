            <div class='col-md body'>Seems like people in Europe are also fed-up and are now planning how to control chelsea's unfair and unreasonable behaviour... If all goes as their intention, very soon chelsea won't be able to use cash as a means to success. They will have to depend on real team management skills rather than cash and proper club management from the CEO in order they make profit rather than lost every year.<br><br>Looks like UEFA main aim is Chelsea. Cos no other club currently is losing money every year and yet spend the most as well. Since June 2003 when Abramovich became the owner of Chelsea, he have spent Â£276m on players alone and made losses of Â£228m on club.<br><br>If the rule were in place today, chelsea would only be allowed to spend no more than $30m a year.<br><br>So maybe Abramovich may lose interest in football in a few years time when he realise he has no more advantage and move on to a more expensive sport like F1 motor racing which he is rumour to have an interest too.<br><br>If all goes as Uefa's plan, then Mourinho better get ready to pack his bags and jump ship cos if not very soon he and everyone else will know he is not so Special after all.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><span style="color: olive;">ROMAN'S FACING A CASH CAP<br>By David Mcdonnel<br><br>CHELSEA are facing a curb on their seemingly limitless spending power in a move designed to ensure they cannot buy whoever they like with Roman Abramovich's millions.<br><br>Growing anger at Chelsea's ability to dominate the transfer market through Abramovich's huge personal fortune has led UEFA and EU ministers to devise plans to ensure greater fairness.<br><br>Chelsea are currently allowed to run up massive losses as a business while spending vast amounts of money on players because they are bankrolled by Abramovich, who is worth an estimated Â£10billion.<br><br>But plans to limit spending by clubs in accordance with their annual turnover could see Chelsea's total spending in a season reduced to just Â£30million - the amount they spent on Andriy Shevchenko this summer.<br><br>Sports minister Richard Caborn attended a Brussels meeting which discussed reining in Chelsea and ensuring the double Premiership champions are not allowed to dominate because of their unique financial strength.<br><br>Caborn said: "There is support for the idea of introducing a better relationship between income earned by clubs and the amounts spent."<br><br>Under Abramovich, Chelsea have spent Â£276m on players and made losses of Â£228m.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The European Union and soccer authorities have no plans to introduce salary caps on players, the CEO of UEFA said on Friday.<br><br>Speculation that UEFA, European football's governing body, and EU governments were seeking to restrict players' wages had grown since the release of the EU-sponsored European Sports Review in April.<br><br>Lars-Christer Olsson told Reuters a new draft of the report will be released before the end of the year with a refined recommendation to limit the overall amount a club can spend on salaries. "This was a misconception. We don't want to say that a player can't be paid X amount of money," Olsson said.<br><br>"But what we do say is that there needs to be a limit on a club's wage bill in the context of the overall revenue; cost controls so that they don't go into debt."<br><br>UEFA believes making clubs more financially accountable will force them to spend more on development and training rather than just individuals.<br><br>The G14, which represents 18 of Europe's richest and most powerful clubs, also advocates this approach.<br><br>UEFA hopes to have the European Sports Review adopted by EU governments in December. It covers all aspects of soccer, such as doping, players' agents and commercial rights.</div>
