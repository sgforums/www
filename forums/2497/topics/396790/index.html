              <p><strong>Martin O’Neill fears his top players James Milner and Ashley Young will be 
              targets for the top four clubs this summer. </strong></p>
              <p>Milner and Young have been the two stand-out players during an <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/aston-villa.html">Aston 
              Villa</a> campaign that has again promised much, but so far failed to deliver a 
              tangible reward.</p>
              <p>With England manager Fabio Capello certain to name Milner as part of his 
              World Cup squad and contract negotiations under way, O’Neill is fully aware that 
              the spotlight may be about to focus even more closely on his two prize 
              assets.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">Young, 24, was last season’s Young Player of the Year and has also been 
              linked with a switch away from Villa Park. </div>
              <p>The Villa manager, who has confirmed 24-year-old Milner is due a pay rise, 
              has little doubt that the midfielder is now close to the finished product.</p>
              <p>‘I wouldn’t be surprised that James Milner and Ashley Young have attracted 
              attention from the very best clubs here and abroad,’ he said.</p>
              <p>‘I rate them that highly and they have shown maturity on the field and off 
              it.</p>
              <p>‘Milner’s performance against Everton was extraordinary. I’m delighted for 
              him.</p>
              <p>‘He’s down as one of the four young players of the year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/16/article-0-08FD5C6A000005DC-255_306x461.jpg" alt="Ashley Young " width="306" height="461">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Star turn: Ashley Young</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>‘Assuming that Wayne Rooney doesn’t win both — and he deserves the main 
              accolade — then I think that James would be deserving of the young player. He 
              has been that brilliant. </strong></p>
              <p>‘Milner has been a revelation. He has stepped infield 20 yards and just been 
              fantastic.</p>
              <p>'He has the energy, the determination and, more importantly, he has the 
              ability.</p>
              <p>‘He’s in the centre of that midfield and looks like he’s played there since 
              he was 16.’</p>
              <p>Milner joined Villa in the summer of 2008 and is the most-capped England 
              Under 21 player, with 46.</p>
              <p>O’Neill is hoping that the fact he can guarantee Milner and Young first-team 
              football at Aston Villa — rather than just a place as part of a squad — might 
              help sway any decision about a move.</p>
              <p>‘I think both of them would grace any side,’ added O’Neill.</p>
              <p>‘But they might be forced into a more rotational system — and just at this 
              minute that would be a consideration for them. Most players want to play every 
              single week.</p>
              <p>‘We haven’t had the luxury. I went up to watch Manchester United at Wigan and 
              it was eye-opening looking at the Manchester United players sitting in front of 
              me, not even on the subs’ bench.</p>
              <p>‘I’d like them (James and Ashley) to stay here and see if we can break into 
              that bracket.’</p>

              <p>Villa probably have the least chance of a top 4 finish in the next few years... The way I see it now is, Chelsea and City will be there among to top 4 for next season... Make no mistake about it, City are about there now and they will used this season's experienced to good effect from here on... I expect them to be a regular in the top 4 from next season onwards... United, Arsenal and Pool, one will definitely get push out from the top 4 if they don't continue to improve their squad.</p>
              <p>So the other 2 spots left are for United, Arsenal, Spurs and Pool to fight for it... Villa are much further from them. So they should leave Villa if they plan to play very top level football... </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Villa probably have a lot lesser money than Liverpool... Only their manager isn't making a big fuss about it... I think every year they might lose their best player(s)... But they just try living within their means i guess... That could explain the smaller squad as it translate into lesser expenses as well... So Villa can only hope for a top 7 next season if Everton don't push them out of it... lol.</p></div>

              <p>I hope United do manage to get <span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333;"><span style="font-style: normal;">James Milner for next season... $20m also should be ok i feel as he is still very young.</span></span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Milner is 1 of the most versatile English players around right now. I would rate him higher than Ashley Young. If Young leaves, Milner can go back to right wing, Downing on the left, Petrov &amp; Reo-Coker in the centre. That would be the best midfield combination for Aston Villa.</p></div>
