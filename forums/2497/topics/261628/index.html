            <div class='col-md body'>Villa join the hunt for Jaaskelainen<br><br>Aston Villa have joined the race to sign Bolton goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen.<br><br>O'Neill has made an inquiry for the 32-year-old who recently rejected a contract extension with the Trotters. He is searching for a new first-choice goalkeeper with Thomas Sorensen's days at Villa Park apparently numbered.<br><br>He has only 12 months of his contract and there have been no signs of O'Neill offering him a new deal even though the Danish international claimed a couple of months ago that he was in the best form of his career.<br><br>Bolton are understood to be looking for around Â£4.5million for Jaaskelainen but will be hard pressed to get that given the short amount of time left on his contract.<br><br>Villa will face competition with Sunderland believed to be among the clubs also chasing Jaaskelainen who has made more than 350 appearances for Bolton.<br><br>He cost Bolton just Â£100,000 when signed from VPS Vaasa nine years ago.<br><br>Meanwhile, Villa midfielder Craig Gardner will relish the challenge if O'Neill brings in players who will be competing for his place this summer.<br><br>He said: 'Villa have money to spend and are being linked with a lot of quality players. There is a lot of transfer speculation flying about at the moment.<br><br>'But I will welcome whoever the manager brings in and will look forward to playing alongside them. I will keep my head down and battle to keep my place.'<br></div>

I feel myself that I played well last season.<br><br>"Therefore, I don't believe that Martin O'Neill wants to offload. Rather, I believe O'Neill is looking for a back-up."</div>
