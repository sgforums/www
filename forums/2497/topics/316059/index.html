              <h1>Wenger is facing exodus as Milan pursue Arsenal star Flamini</h1>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_01/0204arsenal1AFP_468x410.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger is today faced with a potential exodus at Arsenal this summer as AC Milan continue their pursuit of Mathieu Flamini. Milan have offered the midfielder £60,000-a-week after tax in their bid to lure Flamini to the San Siro - much higher than the pre-tax £55,000-a-week on offer at the Emirates.</strong></p>
              <p>"Along with (Rino) Gattuso and (Massimo) Ambrosini, he can bring strength and substance without losing any quality," said Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti. "Flamini has exceptional dynamism, he can play three roles, even in front of defence."</p>
              <p>Winger Alexander Hleb is also the subject of strong interest from Inter, while goalkeeper Jens Lehmann is certain to leave the club in the summer after falling behind Spaniard Manuel Almunia in the pecking order.</p>
              <p>Star midfielder Cesc Fabregas will inevitably be the subject of the usual interest from Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona, although it seems unlikely the Spaniard has stated his desire to stay put. But when asked about his preparations for next season, boss Wenger admitted: "The biggest target now is to keep the team together."</p>

              <p>Wenger is a stingy old man.</p>
              <p>He should invest in his squad <strong>regardless </strong>of the potiental exodus. Btw a few players leaving also called exodus arh?</p>
              <p>The time when Leeds went relegated and bankrupted, that was exodus.</p>

              <p>Actually I feel Flamini is quite ungrateful if he do leave... Arsenal and more so Wenger was the one that got him where he is today and now with some popularity he wants to leave them... Although its not confirm yet but i think it seems quite likely considering that he had the whole of the last 6 months to commit himself but he didn't... And about 2 weeks ago Wenger set him a date-line till the end of April to give him an answer, he has still not done so...</p>
              <p>Today i guess that date-line has passed and he still keeps quiet about all this... I think he is playing a delaying game and just waiting for his contract to run out then leave cos if not, it won't be comfortable for him to see eye to eye with the others everyday... And who knows, maybe from now till the end of Jun he may get more offers... So i guess he is still keeping his options open and if no better offer comes along, he may stay back...</p>

              <p><br>I don't think he leaving (should he leave) has anything to do with the Arsenal's transfer policies... Maybe he think Milan is a bigger club... or just give him more $$$ and he will stay back... But i am just surprised Arsenal let him run down his contract just like this... cos a player of his age and skill can still commend a transfer fee of around $10m to $12m or maybe even $15m...</p>

              <p><strong>Emmanuel Adebayor's agent has rubbished talk the striker will leave Arsenal in the summer. The Togo international, who scored a second-half hat-trick in the 6-2 thrashing of relegated Derby on Monday night, has recently been linked with a move to AC Milan.</strong></p>
              <p>However Adebayor's representative Stephane Courbis denies the player will leave the Emirates Stadium in the summer. "We have not received concrete offers," said Courbis.</p>
              <p>"Obviously, it is logical that Emmanuel is demanded. "I have to meet his club when the season ends to speak about his future. "Today he is happy at Arsenal, he showed it on Monday, but you know football, everything goes very quickly.</p>
              <p>"However, we will not talk before the season ends, as Arsenal are focused on trying to finish second."</p>

              <h2>FLAMINI DECISION IMMINENT - WENGER</h2>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is expecting a decision on Mathieu Flamini's future at the club by Saturday.</strong> <strong>The 24-year-old French midfielder is out of contract at the end of the season and Juventus are believed to be keen on signing the player.</strong></p>
              <p>Wenger expected to find out what the former Marseille man was planning to do next by the end of April, but said on Friday: "The latest is that we are at the end of April but it is still not sorted out. "Certainly we should get an answer today or tomorrow."</p>
              <p>Asked what he thought Flamini's decision would be, Wenger told Arsenal TV Online: "I'm always positive because I believe the link he has with the club will be stronger than all the other different attractions that he can have. "I know that if it's down to football then he will stay here. If it's down to football or financial resources he might not stay here.</p>
              <p>"He is free to choose a different direction, everybody is free out of contract and you have to respect that." Wenger is also sticking to his guns on Alexander Hleb, and insisted he has yet to be contacted by any club despite Inter Milan coach Roberto Mancini registering an interest in the player.</p>
              <p>The Frenchman also admitted his surprise at the news that Keith Edelman was leaving his post as managing director to seek a "fresh challenge". "We didn't expect that and I don't know why (he is leaving)," Wenger added.</p>
              <p>"Does he go somewhere else or has he chosen a different direction? You have to respect that. "He has done well in a very difficult period and everybody is conscious of that." Wenger believed the success of Manchester United and Chelsea in reaching the Champions League final underlined the strength of the Premier League and joked: "It's an FA Cup final abroad and so that could be the 39th game that everybody looks for."</p>

              <p><em><strong>Milan have offered the midfielder £60,000-a-week after tax in their bid to lure Flamini to the San Siro - much higher than the pre-tax £55,000-a-week on offer at the Emirates.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>Not surprise if flamini wish to leave because the money offer by milan is almost double that of arsenal after tax.</em></p>
              <p><em>but flamini has to consider whether he wish to spent half of next season at milan bench or become the driving force for arsenel midfield next season.</em></p>
