The Blades failed last month in their high court bid to force new Premier League disciplinary action against West Ham over the Carlos Tevez affair; they had hoped to pave the way for a retrospective points deduction that would send West Ham down while keeping United in the top flight. Once that avenue of attack was cut off, they revealed they would consider suing West Ham for compensation of between Â£30m and Â£50m.</strong><br><br>"After consideration and discussion with our legal advisers Sheffield United are today initiating legal proceedings against West Ham United as we seek substantial compensation for our relegation from the Premier League," said Toby Craig, a member of the club's legal team. "This action is distinct from the arbitration proceedings between the club and the Premier League during the close season," he continued. "We have always said that we will do everything in our power to secure justice for Sheffield United and restore the integrity of English football which has been tarnished by this affair. Once proceedings have been issued we will await a response from West Ham before making any further statements."<br><br>United were relegated to the Championship after finishing three points behind the Hammers, whose only penalty for including banned clauses in the contracts of Tevez and Javier Mascherano - and then deliberately concealing them from the Premier League authorities - was a Â£5.5m fine. By maintaining their Premier League status this season, West Ham secured a share of the television rights money worth in excess of Â£30m.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">West Ham resist Sheffield's Â£50m legal claim </span><br><br>West Ham last night threatened their own legal action over "repeated slurs" after Sheffield United launched a claim against them for damages which they claim could amount to Â£50 million. In another extraordinary day in the Carlos Tevez saga, the law firm Denton Wilde Sapte initiated proceedings on behalf of United against West Ham claiming "breaches of contract". West Ham responded by describing United's action as "desperate" and lacking "legal merit". They said that any proceedings brought against them would be "vigorously defended".</strong><br><br>It all means the cloud of Tevez could hang over Upton Park for another six months, with Sheffield United's case expected to be heard by an independent three-man arbitration panel which would be set up in accordance with Football Association rules. Previously Sheffield United took their initial complaint to the High Court following the original independent disciplinary commission's decision to fine West Ham rather than dock them points for breaking League rules over third-party ownership and acting in good faith.<br><br>A central element in the case against West Ham is a document dated Dec 1, 2006, which, according to Sheffield United, relates to a third-party agreement that was not considered by the original disciplinary commission. "It seems that West Ham concealed the existence of this document in order to shield their new owners, who have publicly maintained that they were innocent of any involvement in a third-party agreement," said a Sheffield United statement.<br><br>"As a result, the contents of the third-party agreement dated Dec 1, 2006, were not taken into account by the Premier League or the disciplinary commission that punished West Ham. The disciplinary commission did not deduct points from West Ham for seven specific reasons, including that the club's new owners had made full disclosure of all relevant documents and had no involvement with the third-party contracts in the first place."<br><br>West Ham, who continued their summer spree yesterday with the Â£6 million signing of Kieron Dyer from Newcastle, have challenged the authenticity of the amended agreement, saying it was not signed in December by Tevez. They also deny withholding it from the League. Last night, a statement said: "West Ham made the Premier League fully aware of the existence and status of the agreement in question. This agreement was included in the documentation produced for the disciplinary commission who were also aware of its existence throughout the proceedings. Sheffield United's latest assertions demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation.<br><br></div>
