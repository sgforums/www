              <p><strong>Aston Villa midfielder Stiliyan Petrov believes Chelsea are no longer the special team they once were under Jose Mourinho.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Third-placed Villa meet the fourth-placed Blues in the Midlands on
              Saturday in a crucial fixture that will determine which of the sides
              can still harbor realisitic hopes of catching Manchester United at the
              top of the table.<br> <br> And the Bulgarian international, whose Villa side are unbeaten in 13
              league games despite failing to win their last two cup encounters,
              believes the Blues are a shadow of the side that dominated English
              football for two seasons during the Portuguese manager's tenure.</p>
              <p>“When Jose Mourinho was here, they had a special team and they had
              more belief in themselves," he said. "They are definitely not the team
              they used to be under Jose Mourinho.<br> <br> “A lot of changes have happened there but they will still be strong,
              they have players to win games. We will try to give them as much
              respect as we can but we will try to win as well.”<br> <br> Martin O'Neill's side have not lost to Chelsea at Villa Park since
              1999, winning three and drawing six of their last nine Premier League
              meetings.</p>
              <p>But Petrov says Villa must still be wary of their opponents, with
              the Londoners desperate to impress temporary coach Guus Hiddink, who
              will be taking charge of the club for the first time at the weekend.</p>
              <p>“Every new manager wants to start with a win, so we are expecting a
              hard game," he said. "They’ll try to show that they can still be at the
              top but we’ll try to show them that what we have achieved so far is not
              just because of luck.”</p>
              <p>The Villans have come a long way since their last encounter with
              Chelsea, where they were comfortably beaten 2-0 at Stamford Bridge
              earlier in October, recently setting a club record of seven consecutive
              away wins in the league to make them genuine contenders for Champions
              League qualification.</p>
              <p>And Petrov says Saturday's re-match will prove a useful comparison
              to how much Villa have improved since their 2-0 defeat to the Blues
              earlier in the campaign.</p>
              <p>“That is the game in which we were really outplayed," he said.
              "They were quicker, faster and stronger than us and it is up to us to
              see if we have taken anything from that game.<br> <br> "We will find out if we have learnt from our mistakes, find out if we
              are we going to be the same. We have a lot of points to prove, we are
              not in our situation through luck but through hard work and good play.</p>
              <p>“I don't think we're in the title race because other teams have been
              there for a long time and know what it needs to be champions, we're
              just trying to break between them and show them that, in years to come,
              we can build up something and maybe one year we can challenge.”</p>
