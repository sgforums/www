              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Feeling the squeeze: Senior players are upset at Fabio Capello's decision to reinstate John Terry</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-weight: normal;">Fabio Capello will gather his players at the luxury hotel in </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-weight: normal;">Watford</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-weight: normal;"> where the </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-weight: normal;">England</span><span> squad convene on Monday night and tell them that John Terry is to be restored as captain until the end of his managerial reign in 2012. But it will be a pointless exercise.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">The damage has already been done to team morale and nothing Capello can say seems likely to restore the faith of his squad, some of whom are rapidly losing their last vestiges of respect for the manager. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">The overwhelming feeling of certain players, other than incredulity, appears to be weariness. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">Weariness at the endless saga of the captaincy, which Capello has turned into a cheap melodrama, and weariness of Capello himself. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">As professionals, the players will turn up this week, train and play as well as they can against </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">Wales</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; "> on Saturday. But for many, the joy of representing </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">England</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">, in short supply anyway throughout Capello’s reign, has now almost entirely disappeared.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">Publicly, some will mouth platitudes about it being the ‘manager’s decision’ and how they are supportive. Privately, some are aghast. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">‘Why did he need to do this now?’ said one </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">England</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; "> player last week, echoing the thoughts of the football nation. There was simply no clamour or need to restore Terry and the players are as bewildered as the public. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">It is little more than a year since Terry was summoned to Wembley Stadium and stripped of the captaincy in the wake of allegations of an affair — denied by both parties — with the former fiancée of his one-time friend and </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">England</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; "> team-mate, </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">Wayne</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; "> </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">Bridge</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">Perhaps more pertinently, it is just over eight months since the humiliation of </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">Bloemfontein</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">, where Terry played so badly in the 4-1 defeat against </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">Germany</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; "> that some, including those close to Capello, questioned whether he should ever represent </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">England</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; "> again.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">But Capello said last week: ‘I have decided that John Terry, after one year of punishment, will be the permanent captain. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">‘He made mistakes but it is normal for people to make mistakes. He understood the mistake and he learns from his mistakes. He will be a very important captain for us.’</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">Many footballers would question that analysis.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">One Chelsea player — not an England international — once launched a tirade at Terry after the entire squad had been called to a meeting at which it was made clear that owner Roman Abramovich was furious with the bad behaviour of his players. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">The dressing-down came shortly after it was revealed that associates of Terry had been using the access he granted them to charge guests to visit the club’s training ground. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; "><span style="font-size: small;">When Terry later attempted to address the team, the player in question pointed out that he had just been lectured like a child as a result of Terry’s poor judgment and the<br>captain was in no position to speak. </span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">Capello, asked last week if he felt the </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">England</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; "> players would be happy to see Terry restored as captain, said: ‘I think so. They respect John Terry as a leader, absolutely.’</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">That may be the case for some; for many, it manifestly is not. And either Capello does not know it or he does not care. With 15 months to go to Euro 2012, little hope of winning that tournament and an outside chance of being beaten to top spot in the qualifying group by Montenegro, Capello is now stirring up the tensions in the squad that were evident in South Africa. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">Rio Ferdinand’s principal complaint is said to be not the captaincy decision itself, but the manner in which it was reached. Attempting to test public opinion, the issue was first raised in a newspaper eight days ago. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">Initially, it was claimed no final decision had been made and the manager wanted to see how the players reacted. There was no need to tell Ferdinand, because he was still the captain. In fact, that is what Ferdinand was told when he contacted Franco Baldini, Capello’s assistant, last week. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">Angry at discovering the newspaper reports had substance, Ferdinand texted Baldini<br>last Sunday, saying he knew Capello was the source of the stories and demanding to know why he had not at least been told first. Yet Baldini telephoned Ferdinand and assured him he was still captain.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;  ">Less than 24 hours later, that was thrown into doubt again. At a lunch with journalists on Monday, Capello used the word ‘permanent’ to describe Terry’s potential captaincy, prompting further speculation. The official line remained that no decision had been made.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; "></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;  ">Ferdinand, assuming he was about to be sacked but having received no explanation for that, was bewildered. </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; "></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;  ">When Capello announced that he would seek out Ferdinand during United’s Champions League match with Marseille, Ferdinand ensured that he was not in his usual seat in the Old Trafford directors’ box, where Capello and Baldini would be. Instead, Ferdinand watched from Wayne Rooney’s executive box. </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; "> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">Capello has conceded that he has bungled the announcement of the reappointment. The move was intended to be announced as a temporary measure for the </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">Wales</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; "> game and was in response to the farce of recent matches, when the armband has been passed to almost anyone but Terry. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">However, Capello’s bumbling English means he has been bounced into making a permanent decision now, ahead of the game. <br><br></span></span>
              </p><p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">The Italian said: ‘I said in the press conference after the lunch on Monday that I hadn’t decided and I wanted to speak with the players. But after the word permanent, it changes everything.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">‘I used the word permanent, (but) I was really focused on the Welsh game and I had thought a lot about this game and the captaincy. I decided John Terry would be the captain for this game because after the game in </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">Copenhagen</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; "> against </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">Denmark</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">, the way in which the armband was moved around was upsetting for him. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">‘After this game I thought about what we really needed to do. I knew that </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">Rio</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; "> and Steven Gerrard, the vice-captain, were injured. I said my decision would be the day before the game because I wanted to speak with the players but the word permanent decided everything.’ </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">Capello appears to be under the impression that all will be well when he meets Ferdinand to explain. Again, he is either uninformed or not bothered. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">‘I tried to meet him at the Marseille game,’ said Capello. ‘He preferred not to meet us. I hope I will meet him in the future to speak with him personally, not by phone. I spoke with Steven Gerrard and it is no problem for him. Another thing that was important for me is that the game against </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">Wales</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; "> will be a really tough game. The atmosphere, everything, will be incredible, and we need a captain with a big personality, a leader. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">John, when he played without the armband, was every time a leader on the pitch, a leader in the dressing room. He was really good every time.’</span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Undermined: Frank Lampard</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-weight: normal; ">Not against </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-weight: normal; ">Germany</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-weight: normal; "> in </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-weight: normal; ">Bloemfontein</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-weight: normal; ">, he wasn’t. And in talking up Terry, Capello has undermined Gerrard and Frank Lampard, who now find their leadership credentials trashed; Lampard because he is not trusted to captain the team in Wales even though he is fit, and Gerrard because, unlike Ferdinand, he is not a long-term injury worry and yet he is deemed less worthy than Terry to wear the armband. </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; "></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">All this comes less than a year since Capello said Terry would never be captain again under his management. ‘Yes, yes, but I think one year’s punishment is enough,’ said Capello. <br><br></span></span>
              </p><p><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">His players may well conclude that anything he says is driven by expediency rather than the need for consistency. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">Not to be forgotten is Terry’s performance at the World Cup finals, where, at an infamous Press conference after the dire 0-0 draw against </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">Algeria</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">, he announced that he was speaking on behalf of the players and would be having words with Capello that night about what was going wrong. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">He never did because Capello was happy to humiliate him, crushing the rebellion at source when it became clear that Terry had misjudged the team’s mood. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">But Capello now says that he saw leadership qualities even in Terry’s attempted coup. ‘He is a leader but sometimes the leader can make mistakes,’ said Capello. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">The Italian continues to labour under the impression that the </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; ">England</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; "> captaincy is a huge issue in this country. </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;  "></span></p>
