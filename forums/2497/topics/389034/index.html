              <h2>Internazionale v AC Milan: Preview</h2>
              <p>AC Milan defender Gianluca Zambrotta has warned his team-mates they must maintain their concentration to the very end of the game when they face city and title rivals Inter Milan on Sunday.</p>
              <p>The Rossoneri are on top form at the moment having won their last three games and stand one place and six points behind Inter with a game in hand.</p>
              <p>However, Jose Mourinho's team head Serie A and have yet to be beaten at home with eight wins and two draws from their 10 league games at the San Siro.</p>
              <p>Their last outing saw Inter recover from two goals down to draw 2-2 at Bari while their last home game produced a thrilling 4-3 victory over Siena despite the Nerazzurri trailing 3-2 with two minutes to go.</p>
              <p>Wesley Sneijder and Walter Samuel turned a potential shock defeat to the league's bottom team into victory.</p>
              <p>Although Zambrotta has been ruled out by injury, he has underlined the importance of keeping focused until the game has finished.</p>
              <p>He told the the Milan Channel: "Inter are a team that has recovered games in the 90th minute on more than one occasion and even managed to win.</p>
              <p>"Inter never give up, without forgetting they have players who can win the match at any moment.''</p>
              <p>As well as Zambrotta, Milan forward Alexandre Pato will miss the derby after failing to shake off a thigh problem.</p>
              <p>However, the 32-year-old is hopeful his fellow defender Alessandro Nesta will have recovered in time and will also choose to return to the national side ahead of the World Cup in South Africa.</p>
              <p>"Alessandro is having a great season, he's in splendid form. Let's hope we have him back for the derby,'' Zambrotta added.</p>
              <p>"The important thing is that Alessandro continues to play the way he's doing now until the end of the league.</p>
              <p>"Then it will depend on coach Marcello Lippi although I think he has left the door open for his return.''</p>
              <p>As for his own recovery from his calf problem, the Italy full-back continued: "I am recovering.</p>
              <p>"This week I'm working in the gym and doing physiotherapy. I hope to be available for the Coppa Italia match against Udinese.</p>
              <p>"On Sunday I won't take part against Inter, but the team is doing well without me.</p>
              <p>"I wouldn't want to alter the balance of a team which is doing very well.</p>
              <p>"It's always disappointing to miss matches like the derby but the positive note is that the team is going through a good moment of form.</p>
              <p>"Milan are in the best possible condition to face the league leaders.''</p>
              <p>His words were echoed by forward Ronaldinho who has struck seven goals in three games including a hat-trick in last weekend's 4-0 win over Siena.</p>
              <p>"I feel loved and respected,'' said Ronaldinho. "This is a special moment in my career and I want to continue in this path.</p>
              <p>"We know we have to work hard to win the scudetto.</p>
              <p>"We have maximum respect for Inter as they have one of the strongest sides and best coaches in the world.''</p>
              <p>Inter boss Mourinho concedes this is not the best time to face Leonardo's side.</p>
              <p>The Portuguese said: "I would have preferred to have played the derby some other time.</p>
              <p>"I have Samuel Eto'o playing at the Africa Cup of nations and four players out injured.''</p>
              <p>Mourinho will be hoping to have midfield trio Thiago Motta, Sulley Muntari and Dejan Stankovic available.</p>

              <p><strong>Inter Milan and coach Jose Mourinho could face disciplinary charges as they were today summoned by the Italian football association following comments made after Sunday's derby against AC Milan.</strong></p>
              <p>The Nerazzurri beat their city rivals 2-0 to open up a nine-point gap at the top of the table, but ended the match with just nine men after Wesley Sneijder and Lucio were both dismissed.</p>
              <p>Mourinho and chief executive Ernesto Paolillo both complained about decisions made and went even further, suggesting there was a conspiracy among football authorities to reignite the race for the Serie A title.</p>
              <p>The pair have been summoned "for having expressed judgements and remarks which are considered injurious to people and bodies working in the federation, damaging directly or indirectly the federal institution's prestige and credibility, and they have doubted the integrity of the championship."</p>
              <p>Sneijder has been handed a two-match ban, while Lucio will miss Inter's next game.</p>
              <p>"Between the changes to the fixture list and this match, I have seen one too many signals I didn't like," said Paolillo after the game.</p>
              <p>Mourinho, as well as crowing that his team could have won the match with seven men, added: "Everything was done to try to prevent Inter from winning, but my squad is strong and we will win the Scudetto.</p>
              <p>"But I will leave it at that. This is your country and your league. I am just a foreigner working here."</p>
              <p>Marco Materazzi has been handed a yellow card for donning a mask of Italy president and AC Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi as the Inter defender celebrated his side's victory.</p>
