            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Albert Luque, who has disappointed at Tyneside since making a rather high profile 14 million euro move, could get a fresh chance to impress new boss Sam Allardyce.</strong><br><br>Big Sam prides himself on turning players around, and is ready to take on the challenge of doing the same with players who have been allowed to "get lost" by previous managers.<br><br>Luque was one of the most promising winger-forwards in Spain when he moved from Deportivo, but has had a disastrous two seasons in England, never looking settled.<br><br>"I feel far too many players have got lost at this football club and it is my responsibility to make sure that does not happen to any current member of the staff or any new player I might bring in," said Allardyce.<br><br>"One of the reasons I was successful at Bolton Wanderers was transforming a foreign player out of whatever country he had come from, into a Premiership player.<br><br>"That's because we found out what problems he had as early as we possibly could.<br><br>"I don't want to be too critical of what has happened here in the past, but in my opinion, there has not been enough focus on what is happening in a player's life away from the training ground and the club.<br><br>"Has he got the right lifestyle? Is he living in the right place for him and his family? In fact, it's not just the player but his wife and family."<br><br>"But once that is sorted out, you get the best out of player and this is something I have got to try to work out with Albert Luque.<br><br>"He might be too far gone, who knows? But we might still be able to resurrect his career here. We will see."</div>
