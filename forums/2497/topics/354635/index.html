              <p><strong>The international break appears to have taken a real toll on Arsenal
              with Arsene Wenger revealing that Robin van Persie, Eduardo, Samir
              Nasri and Abou Diaby are all doubtful for Tuesday’s Champions League
              quarter final, first leg tie against Villarreal.</strong></p>
              <p>The quartet will all miss Saturday’s Premier League game against
              Manchester City, with Van Persie injuring his groin with Holland,
              Eduardo picking up a groin problem on duty with Croatia and Diaby
              (thigh) and Nasri (flu) both laid low after joining up with France.</p>
              <p>Although key trio Cesc Fabregas, Emmanuel Adebayor and Theo Walcott
              will all return to Wenger’s squad in time for the City game, the latest
              injury news is a setback for Wenger as he seeks to hold onto fourth
              place and progress in Europe.</p>
              <p>Creative midfielder Nasri could return in time for Tuesday’s first
              leg in Spain but the three other injured players are more of a concern.</p>
              <p>“We lost a few players during the international break, especially
              Eduardo, Van Persie and Diaby,” said Wenger. “They will all be out for
              tomorrow’s game. <br> <br>“Nasri came back with the flu, he is in bed
              and is not available for the game. He has a small chance of feeling
              better for Sunday, so maybe he should be available for the Tuesday
              game. <br> <br>“Van Persie, Diaby and Eduardo we believe have a little, little, little chance but they could all be short for Tuesday.”</p>
              <p>Wenger has long been a critic of international football – once
              famously likening national coaches to joyriders – but expects the busy
              calendar to be slightly tweaked at the behest of his club colleagues.</p>
              <p>“There is not a lot of room [in the fixture list],” said Wenger.
              “But the one thing we ask for many times is to play the second game on
              Tuesday because the players all looked to be bored from Saturday to
              Wednesday.</p>
              <p>“It would give a fair amount of recovery time between Tuesday and Saturday and that would be much better.</p>
              <p>“I believe the principle has been accepted many times but for this
              qualifier they had not enough time to manage to do it. Maybe for the
              next time there is a qualifier it will be done.”</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Wenger also neglected to give an update on the
              contractual situation of Van Persie who currently in talks over an
              extended deal at Emirates Stadium.</p>
              <p>“I think when he has signed the contract we will tell you, don’t
              worry. There is no news whether he is close or not close, you either
              sign or don’t sign, the rest is just speculation.”</p>
