              <h1>Deco Frowns On Robinho's City Move</h1>
              <h2>New Chelsea midfielder Deco has publicly questioned Robinho's decision to move to Manchester City instead of the London side. The ex-Real madrid man, says Deco, is capable of achieving more than City can offer...</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/32901_news.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Football 365 quoted the Portuguese playmaker as saying, "To leave Madrid to go to Chelsea is okay, but I have my doubts with respect to City. "I don't know, we will have to ask Robinho what happened. It's not normal either to change Real for City only for the money. Robinho has the standing to play in a team who aspire to titles."<br></strong><br>Clearly, then, Deco feels that he made the right move himself to title-chasing Chelsea. "I've started off on the right foot, I've great team-mates at Chelsea. We've only drawn against Juande Ramos' Tottenham, who made life difficult for us," he said.<br><br>"How is it different from the Primera here? It basically differs that in the Premier League there are no small opponents, everyone fights to the death. "When we play at home we still have a bit of space, but away you are under constant pressure from your opponent. In every area of play there is a battle. It's fun." <br><br>In closing Deco stated once again that he was enjoying his time in London and as such he didn't rue passing up the chance to join José Mourinho at Inter. "Chelsea's offer was more interesting in all aspects than that of Internazionale, I liked more the plans of Felipe Scolari and I cannot complain, to play next to Lampard, Essien, Ballack, Joe Cole, Drogba, Terry and Co is a pleasure," he said.<br><br>"We are going to make life difficult for Inter and for everyone, we aspire to win the Champions League that the club were so close to last year, losing on penalties." <br></p>

              <h1>Robinho: I'll Show Chelsea What I'm Worth</h1>
              <h2>New Manchester City signing Robinho has criticised summer suitors Chelsea ahead of their clash next weekend...</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/35063_news.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Such was the air of apparent inevitability surrounding Robinho's proposed transfer from Real Madrid to Chelsea that the London club, in a moment of pure lunacy, began selling Robinho replica shirts online. As fate would have it, this shameless stunt proved to be the final nail in chief executive Peter Kenyon's pursuit of the Brazilian superstar and, going into transfer deadline day, the saga was thought to be over.</strong><br><br>The player remained desperate to engineer an exit from the Santiago Bernabéu - where he had burned all bridges - but the club maintained that, in light of their failure to secure the signing of an adequate replacement, the 24-year-old would remain with them.<br><br>The twist came when Abu Dhabi United Group - a consortium headed by Dr. Sulaiman Al-Fahim - announced their takeover of Manchester City, formerly owned by Dr. Thaksin Shinawatra. The former Thai Prime Minister's misery was at an end. While he remains chairman of the club, he is now backed by billions of dollars courtesy of the United Arab Emirates' sovereign wealth fund, thought to be 10 times in excess of Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich.<br><br>The Citizens were linked with a plethora of big names on deadline day - which was when the takeover was announced - and in the end met Madrid's lofty asking price for Robinho. The club saw it in their best interests to offload the player for their own good, and the added bonus of not seeing him go to a Champions League rival whose continued approach for the forward had angered the Spanish champions.<br><br>Amid much criticism, Robinho accepted the move - thought to be as a means to an end and little more - and has since vocalised his optimism that the club can climb into the top four and beyond. Once he returns from international duty with Brazil next week, the former Santos man will make his debut against Chelsea.<br><br>The Blues have remained adamant that while they are upset to have not landed Robinho, they were not outbid, and simply refused to meet Real's valuation of the samba star. He begs to differ. "It is Real's fault that I did not sign for Chelsea but it is also Chelsea'a fault," he told <em>The People</em>. "I don't think they managed it very well. They waited until the last minute and it turned out badly for them."<br><br>It did not take long for the Brazilian to embarrass himself, as in one of his first interviews as a Man City player he accidentally referred to them as Chelsea. He has himself admitted that he was looking forward to linking up with Chelsea coach and countryman Luiz Felipe Scolari - who requested just he and Deco upon appointment at Stamford Bridge - but ultimately, Robinho just wants to be where he is loved. "My head was at Chelsea but now that is forgotten," he insists. "I know Scolari is upset with me but these things happen.<br><br>"When I play against them I will show that they were wrong not to raise their offer. City presented the offer five hours before the deadline and until then I had not been thinking about them at all."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/44539000/jpg/_44539807_micah_richards_226x282.jpg" border="0" alt="Micah Richards" width="226" height="282"></p>
              <p><br><br>Micah Richards, now a team-mate of Robinho, admitted his disbelief at the signing and the fantasy football world of which City are now a part. "I was glued to the TV last Monday listening to all these bids we were making for world-class players," the defender told the <em>Sunday Mirror</em>. "In the end I fell asleep and just after midnight my best mate rang me and said, 'We've signed Robinho.' I thought I was still dreaming and said, 'Yeah, whatever.' But then I turned the TV back on and there it was. I mean, he's the kind of player you would usually only pick for City if you were playing a computer game."<br><br>Richards, rated as one of the best young defenders in England, has been linked with his favourite club, Arsenal, as well as City's rivals Manchester United. However, following the takeover - City's second in as many years and with what appears to be more stability than Dr. Shinawatra - it is expected that the youngster will stick it out with the Citizens as they attempt to fulfil Dr. Al-Fahim's lofty visions of greatness. "Hopefully it is a sign of things to come and City will be winning trophies and playing in the Champions League every year," said a hopeful Richards. "If the things the new owner has said are true, this is City's chance to grab football by the scruff of the neck - and I can't wait."</p>

              <p><br>Well... That could be because LA Galaxy didn't come in for him? Or maybe they couldn't afford his demanded salary after tax when he has not much or no marketing value at all?</p>
              <p>For what its worth, going to Inter under Mourinho would be a more genuine call if money wasn't his main objective... Jose is rebuilding a new squad that could even win the Champions League not just Serie A... He would be going to a team that could be bound for greatness instead he joint a ready made side with more money on offer...</p>
              <p>If we compare Jose and Scolari in terms of club football, Scolari don't even come close. And if we take away that one month world cup title... What else has Big Phil have on his CV?</p>
              <p>What I am saying is, there is nothing wrong with going for the money... just don't condemn a fellow player when he wasn't in his shoes... He wasn't aware what went on with Real... Hell, why don't he condemn Scolari? Scolari has openly admitted he took the Chelsea job cos of the money...</p>

              yeah I know, what I meant was that it's not really the prestige of the club but the prestige the club gets for winning the trophies in that year. That's the prestige for the players and what they want.
