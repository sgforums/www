              <p class="storycopy"> </p>
              <p class="storycopy">The 60-year-old Kop legend, who has transformed the club’s fortunes since replacing the sacked Roy Hodgson in January, had asked American owners John W Henry and Tom Werner for a four-year deal.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Henry and Werner were reluctant to look beyond two years but have promised a review if progress continues to be made under Dalglish.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Sunday Express Sport can reveal that Steve Clarke, who was brought in as a coach to work alongside Dalglish by Damien Comolli, Liverpool’s director of football strategy, is on a three-and-a-half-year contract.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">It is understood that Dalglish wants a lucrative financial package to compensate for a lack of long-term security. Those negotiations are still going on.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Anfield commercial director Ian Ayre has been the conduit between the owners and Dalglish, travelling to the USA last week.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Dalglish has told the Liverpool board he must have a hefty transfer kitty available this summer to strengthen his inherited squad. Henry and Werner displayed their commitment to the club in the January transfer window, splashing the £50 million they received from Chelsea for Fernando Torres on Ajax’s Luis Suarez and Newcastle’s Andy Carroll.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">They have told Dalglish they will repeat their transfer largesse in the summer – Comolli is already working on a number of big-name targets.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">The owners are delighted with the progress under Dalglish, culminating in last Sunday’s 3-1 victory over Manchester United.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">While Dalglish hoped to be rewarded with a four-year contract, he is ready to say yes to a two-year deal, providing the figures add up – both personally and in the transfer market.</p>

              <p>I think he has surprised many with the good run of results. The win over man u must have hastened the owners to secure his signature heh. Come to think of it....he must have learnt a lot from his dull-glish days. The matches played showed in no way his style is dull.</p>
              <p>Taking over halfway thru the season and starting it are two very different matters. Let's see :) Anyway, I have always thought that the current crop of pool players are quite good. Wonder why they languish....all it takes is some self confidence sometimes.</p>

              <p><br>I don't think so... I always maintain Pool have a good squad but lack a... not good but great manager... Jose would be excellent for the job. Cos he would know how to get the under-performing stars giving 110% which I think they are not even giving 100% at the moment or the past 2 yrs...</p>
              <p>FSG has spent only $2m?</p>
              <p>How about the $35m and almost $23m for Carroll and Suarez? Sure they sold Torres but you don't count it this way cos they could have sold and not buy as well as in the case of United with Ronaldo... And even if you add it, it's still more than $2m.</p>
              <p>If City decide for continuity with Mancini, who I think hasn't been bad... Jose is left with Pool the only option... And he may take it if left with only one choice in England.</p>

              <p>It is not finalised unless Kenny signed on the dotted line.</p>
              <p>It is hard to say whether Jose want to join Liverpool as he may take it as a challenge to win the BPL title and with steve clarke in Liverpool.</p>
              <p>As for Kenny, he will need more funds to buy players to challenge for the medals as the squad is not good enough.</p>

              <p><br>I see your point... Indeed, with his egoistic character, taking Pool to their first league title in over 20 yrs would be a big big plus on his CV. I can just imagine the grin on his face if he manage it... lol.</p>
              <p>And true too with Steve Clarke there... I think this Damien Comolli seems to know what he is doing... Getting a good assistant in is just as important given Dalglish has been out of the game for so long... A lot of new technic from dietetic to style of play has changed since he last manage...</p>
              <p>I don't think Henry bothers with the day to day running when he will mostly be half-way across the other side of the world.</p>
              <p>Not every owner is Roman, who stays and goes to match regularly... and will naturally form an opinion of his own in time to come. Henry like the Glazers, probably don't understand much about the game... They are just in for the profits...</p>

              <p>FSG has spent only $2m?</p>
              <p>How about the $35m and almost $23m for Carroll and Suarez? Sure they sold Torres but you don't count it this way cos they could have sold and not buy as well as in the case of United with Ronaldo... And even if you add it, it's still more than $2m.</p>
              <p>If City decide for continuity with Mancini, who I think hasn't been bad... Jose is left with Pool the only option... And he may take it if left with only one choice in England.</p>

              <p>You gotta look at the bigger picture. He wanted to sign Fernando Llorente in the summer but was not approved by the board. Yes, he was allowed to sign Adebayor on loan but after that? Will he be facing the same problem again having to beg the board to sign a player after that? On loan again? This is only one of the reason why he wanted to quit, the others being Pepe's contract.</p>
              <p>Having said that, almost every managers facing the injury problem and he has one of the best team in the world!

              <p><br>Again another weird way of counting or looking at it... Ok, you take Babel into consideration, fair enough...

              <p>Like i have said earlier, United sold Ronaldo for $80m, do you see them spending that sum straightaway?</p>
              <p>Or better still. Arsenal have made more money selling players (Adebayor and Toure) than they spent on players 2 yrs ago... Same as United of course... Does it mean they must used it on players? Not necessarily I belief as we have seen.</p>
              <p>The way you seem to look at it is... Money coming in isn't money, only money going out is consider money... But thats wrong.</p>
              <p>Are we to say Kenny Dalglish spent only $2m or $58m?</p>
              <p>Newcastle sold Carroll for $35m but didn't even spend a pound on a single player coming in... Like I point out earlier, the owner could have simply sold and not buy as well cos it's the player who wanted to leave and not the other way around.

              <p>The main reason he wanted Llorente is cos of the long term injury to Higuain for the 2nd half of this season. But it's not as simple cos Athletic wasn't keen to sell in the first place...</p>
              <p>There are a long list of clubs very keen on him and prior to Carroll arriving at Anfield, Liverpool also had a bid rejected for him as he claim.</p>
              <p><span>And mind you, Adebayor isn't your average striker he on $160k per week... And I think we are talking about this season and the impact of it right now and not after that. Cos Higuain will be back by then. But actually, on loan is a better option as it let them see whether he is good for them and can adapt to the Spanish league or not rather than buying then realize he can't fit in...</span></p>
              <p><span>Mourinho may not be happy at Real Madrid, but the same may be said Real are not happy with him too? Whatever reasons, no one really knows except themselves.</span></p>
              <p><span>And as to your question. Well, as long as Ferguson is around, there is no need for him at United... Should the day come when Fergie retires. He would be one of the top choices if not the top one. That's my take on it. </span></p>

              <p>That is why so many ManU fans want the Glazers out? So many Newcastle fans want Mike Ashley out? The team needs injection of players, the depth is not there to challenge for the top 4, not to mention the title...not even comparable with what Spurs has. Liverpool can't go anywhere if they keep replacing a player with a player, they need to expand the team.</p>
              <p>The good thing is that they wiped out all the debts so far.</p>
              <p>But I will reserve my judgement until summer. I've been quite happy with the owner so far.</p>
              <p>But I stand to my opinion that Mourinho will not survive at Liverpool.</p>

              <p>And I don't think that many United fans have a real bad opinion of the Glazers... Sure, there are a few cos they are upset of the debts situation... Then there are those started by the Red Knights who themselves have other motive rather than the good of the club.</p>
              <p>But there are a lot who don't really mind either like myself... I still belief the Glazers are the best owners for United at the time they took over given United's condition then... And they have preceded over a time where the club have been very successful.</p>

              <p>I agreed on the point of Liverpool lacking in depth.</p>
              <p>They have only one good team and if any of them is injured, there are no able replacement.</p>
              <p>Whether Jose is able to join is dependent on whether Ah Ken want to stay on for the next season.</p>
              <p>I am not sure on whether he want to stay around for long as he have stressed that he is the caretaker manager.</p>
              <p>So, if Henry is able to clinch Jose's signature, he may choose to stay as Football director to develop the youth team.</p>
              <p>Jose would join a club with cash and players.</p>

              <p>As I recall a report that under Rafa, Pool had the biggest squad, something like 69 players to call upon...</p>
              <p>And I don't think that many United fans have a real bad opinion of the Glazers... Sure, there are a few cos they are upset of the debts situation... Then there are those started by the Red Knights who themselves have other motive rather than the good of the club.</p>
              <p>But there are a lot who don't really mind either like myself... I still belief the Glazers are the best owners for United at the time they took over given United's condition then... And they have preceded over a time where the club have been very successful.</p>

              <p>Yes, Rafa may have bought a lot of players during his tenure with Liverpool but how many of them actually broke into the first team or good enough to provide cover for a first time player when they are injured? Rafa bought alot of dead wood players...both "supposed to be" first team player and youth. The only good youth player is only Martin Kelly and he was not a right back but CB.</p>
              <p>Liverpool has a good first team player but the issue will be when 3 of the first team players got injured?</p>

              <p><br>I don't think they all were poor, it's just that Rafa didn't have the faith in them that's why they have not made the grade and improve from there with more experience gain from actual playing...</p>
              <p>Rafa have not even gone for a season and a few youngsters have made the team regularly or irregularly. Nevertheless, they have played in a few games now...</p>
              <p>Personally, I think Pool have a handful of interesting good youngsters like <span style="color: #000000;">Jay Spearing, Jonjo Shelvey, Danny Wilson and Martin Kelly</span> but I have not seen most or have any impression of them until this season... I don't think they are all new at the club, I suspect they might have been there for sometime already... Only not fully utilized.</p>
              <p>Indeed Kelly is a very good right back. And I once said he is the best player to come out since Gerrard... And thats like about 10 yrs in between. A pity he is in the defensive position who normally don't get the limelight as to a striker or a midfielder. He has become a regular in the team now but it's all thanks to Hodgson who was daring to replace one of their record signing Glen Johnson in the first place that gave him his chance... Dalglish has since brought on Wilson now and Spearing, played bit part here and there under Rafa but not given enough opportunities to shine I think... and Shelvey, new to the club... Looks very promising for the future...</p>
              <p>The only youth player I can recall Rafa gave much opportunity to is <span style="color: #000000;">David Ngog... True?</span></p>
              <p>So it's not just that they don't have an able back-up but it need time to build up and under Rafa, they didn't take the opportunity to do so even though they had a good 5, 6 yrs...</p>
              <p>The likes of Arsenal's and United's youngsters wasn't built over night, they took a few year given opportunities playing bit parts over the season before they came good... Pool will need to catch up in this area which i think they are seriously doing right now rather than the past 5 yrs which have been a waste.</p>
              <p>The appointment of Damien Comolli may actually be the best thing the new owner has done... Time will tell...</p>
