              <p><strong>Tottenham boss Juande Ramos has reportedly emerged as the favourite to sign £11million-rated Giovani dos Santos from Barcelona this summer. The 19-year-old is currently on the books of Spanish giants Barca and is widely regarded as one of the hottest properties in European football.</strong></p>
              <p>He has been forced to wait his turn at the Nou Camp, but has been tipped for the top since bursting on to the scene at the U17 World Cup back in 2005. The Catalan club had hoped to see the youngster become the natural heir to Ronaldinho, though he is yet to dominate the senior game in the same manner as he did at youth level.</p>
              <p>Dos Santos made 28 Primera Liga appearances for Barca last season, and scored a hat-trick on the last day of the season during a 5-3 victory at Murcia. He has five full caps for Mexico despite qualifying to play for Brazil through his father, himself a former footballer, Zizinho.</p>
              <p>His failure to hold down a regular first-team spot under Frank Rijkaard during the 2007/08 season alerted the attention of a host of Europe's top clubs, with Manchester City early contenders for his signature. However, should the talented teenager decide to leave Spain this summer it would appear that White Hart Lane is now his most likely destination, with Spurs expected to shell out around £11million in order to get their man.</p>

              <p><em>Barcelona’s wonderkid Giovani Dos Santos.</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>TOTTENHAM have agreed a £12million deal for Barcelona’s wonderkid Giovani Dos Santos. Spurs beat Chelsea, Manchester City and Inter Milan to the Mexican winger and are also on the brink of signing defender Richard Dunne from City for £5m.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Giovani, 19, was swayed after meeting White Hart Lane chiefs in London back in January. Inter and City were last night desperately trying to persuade agent Pini Zahavi to get the player to change his mind.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Spurs’ swoop has stunned Chelsea, who made two failed raids for Giovani after tracking his development for four years. Barca offered Gio the chance to move on loan but he has grown disillusioned with the Nou Camp.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Meanwhile, Dunne has held advanced talks with Spurs and will complete a switch after his medical. Aston Villa and Portsmouth were also interested in the City skipper, 28.</p>

              <p>If he really does make the move, it will represent a real coup for Spurs... I must say i am very impress with what Spurs have been doing right now under Ramos... First Luka Modric, now Santos... and this doesn't take into account the arrival of Hutton and Woodgate in mid-season... If they add another good keeper and a top striker and also Dunne, I do seriously belief they will challenge for the top spot next season...</p>
              <p>It seems that 4th spot for next season won't be so easy...</p>

              I hope he don't end up like other promising youngster to have their careers blighted in spurs.
              
              Gareth Bale, Etherington, Simon Davies, Aaron Lennon...how many of them whose career has taken off?  And now add on the new Croatian guy - Moaric or something...
              
              They are better off to Arsenal or Man U.
