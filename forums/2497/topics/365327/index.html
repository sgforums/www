              <p><strong>Hull boss Phil Brown has
              revealed the club will speak to Michael Owen in the next few days to
              convince him to move to the KC Stadium. </strong></p>
              <p>The 29-year-old Newcastle striker is set to leave St James’ Park
              this summer and has confirmed that he wants to play in The Premier
              League.</p>
              <p>However, although reports suggest he would be reluctant to join The
              Tigers, Brown is convinced they can put forward a good case.</p>
              <p>"We will be speaking to Michael's representatives within the week," he told the Hull Daily Mail.</p>
              <p>"I would think he would have a number of offers and we'll have to be
              competitive, but I wouldn't sit down with him if I thought I was
              wasting my time.</p>
              <p>“Anything is possible in football.</p>
              <p>"I don't think Michael will go for the best financial offer. I don't
              think it's about that for him at this stage of his career – he'll want
              the best offer for his future.</p>
              <p>"He needs to spend a high percentage of next season's games at the highest possible level and that's where we can come in."</p>

              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Stoke City manager Tony Pulis has revealed he would be interested in signing Michael Owen if a deal is 'viable'. </strong></p>
              <p>Owen's contract at Newcastle United expires at the end
              of the month and the striker is to leave St James' Park in the hope of
              securing a deal with a Premier League club.</p>
              <p>The England
              international's representatives have sent a dossier to several clubs,
              with Aston Villa and Everton among those to be linked with a bid.</p>
              <p>Hull
              City boss Phil Brown has confirmed he would relish the chance to speak
              to Owen in an attempt to persuade the 29-year-old to move to the KC
              Stadium.</p>
              <p>And Brown's Potters counterpart Pulis has expressed his
              interest in Owen, believing the former Liverpool star would be a 'great
              signing'.</p>
              <h4>Never say never</h4>
              <p>"You never say never in
              football, so of course I'd be interested in throwing my hat into the
              ring if it was ever viable," Pulis told <em>The Sentinel</em>.</p>
              <p>"I'm not sure whether Michael would want to come here right now, but that situation could always change for him.</p>
              <p>"He would be a great signing for this football club and he can rest assured our fans would treat him as one of their own.</p>
              <p>"I
              imagine there will be bigger clubs taking an interest in his
              availability for the moment, and I can't say I've received a copy of
              his dossier, but that doesn't mean he will end up signing for them
              necessarily.</p>
              <p>"So it could be a deal that comes on to our radar in
              time and one we'd be silly to turn our back on if we could get
              something sorted with his people."</p>
