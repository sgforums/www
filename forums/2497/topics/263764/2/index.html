"Each encounter is a separate entity.<br><br>"We are going to continue in the same way."<br><br>Colombia coach Jorge Luis Pinto has the difficult task of raising his troops and, in a time-honoured tradition, has used a boxing metaphor to do just that.<br><br>"The football player knows when there is a chance to change. We are going away to recover like the boxer who is struck and fell, but rose and could win."<br><br>It seems likely that Macnelly Torres will be promoted from the bench in place of Alvaro Dominguez, with Gabriel Luiz Rey also in contention after a substitute appearance against Paraguay.<br><br>Colombia may be praying for a major upset, but Argentina will be expecting a knockout.</div>
