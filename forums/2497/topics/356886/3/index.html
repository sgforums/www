              <p>Yeah , most of us were very proud of Liverpool , whether or not the 18th title was there to shout about ..... just because MU were current King of EPL , doesn't mean u the fans can curse and swear at rivals .... we don't do that during the 80's , 90's til now , it's not our Singapore style at least .</p>
              <p>U encounter Liverpool fans curse and swear at you when u were a kid supporting MU ?</p>
              <p>We don't give a damn to the 18th title if we were not provoke .</p>
              <p>That's the only real fact that MU has to respect .</p>
              <p>Some apparently just cannot accept facts .</p>
              <p>As i've said b4 , til the day when Mu were equal to the 18th , u will then see how the fans react , now still too early to say , cos MU haven't hit that . </p>

              <p>if we remain consistent for the last 19 years , with the 37th title , where will MU be ? Where will u be ? Will u be still supporting MU ?</p>
              <p>U might just be like me .... or one of us .</p>
              <p>Come on , grow up , have some respect to whom u support and who other support .</p>
              <p>If u guys think by abusing rival fans like what that chap did , was a proud thing to do , we Liverpool fans will be happy u supported MU instead of Liverpool .</p>
              <p>We will be sad , very sad if one of us did that of stuff towards rival fans .</p>
              <p>As i've said before , just a few in Singapore , most like my MU friends , they don't do that sort of naive stuffs .</p>
              <p>Liverpool fans around Singapore , quite similiarly , were those quiet type in Sgforums , seldom going to other forums and pick fights .</p>
              <p>We don't do that .</p>

              <p>For all you know, other than supporting different football clubs, maybe that other person is similar to you in all other aspects. Attended the same school and same faculty as you, watches the same shows and anime as you, drives the same car as you, maybe even supports opposition political party like you do.</p>
              <p>In fact, maybe the person may not like the same club as you but likes the same national team as you? So what gives?</p>
