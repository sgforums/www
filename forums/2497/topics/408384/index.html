              <p><strong>Werder Bremen have thrown Real Madrid's bid for Mesut Ozil into disarray by doubling the asking price for their in-demand playmaker to £25million.</strong></p>
              <p>The Bundesliga giants are understood to be angry that Real apparently briefed the Madrid press that a deal was imminent, despite rival interest from <span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span><span style="color: #000000;">, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span><span style="color: #000000;">, </span>Barcelona and Inter Milan.</p>
              <p>However, Ozil's dad has upped the pressure by telling Turkish newspaper that his son will go to the Bernabeu either this summer - or as a free agent when his current contract expires next summer.</p>
              <p>'We promised that if Bremen keep Mesut for now, next year year he will join a free,' Mustafa Ozil told Hurriyet. 'Mesut and I stayed at the chalet of (Real president) Florentino Perez in Madrid, he invited us there and everything was resolved quickly. We were impressed by his willingness to help my child play for his club.</p>
              <p>'Our word is sacred. My son has always said that the only club he wanted to go to was Real Madrid.'</p>
              <p>Bremen had hoped to tie the 21-year-old to a new contract and are playing hardball in negotiations by threatening to play Ozil in Wednesday's Champions League qualifier against Sampdoria unless a suitable offer is received. That would prevent him playing for others in European competitions this winter.</p>

              <p><strong>Bremen rejected an initial bid of under £10m from Real Madrid, but Spanish press reported on Monday that an £11.5m fee was all but agreed for the German World Cup star.</strong></p>
              <p>Werder Bremen general manager Klaus Allofs said: 'I am not aware of a new bid, that is not something I am able to confirm.</p>
              <p>'I am, however, guessing that there might be news on that. I am prepared to receive a new bid.</p>
              <p>'The facts are pretty clear. If a club is looking to sign Mesut to play UEFA Champions League, then that club needs to make a decision before Wednesday.</p>
              <p>'If Mesut Ozil is a player of Werder Bremen on Wednesday, we are going to play him against Sampdoria.</p>
              <p>'It would be up to Real Madrid to show up with the right answer to this all.'</p>

              <span><strong>Real Madrid midfielder Rafael van der Vaart could be forced to exit the club after the signing of Mesut Oezil from Werder Bremen wen through this afternoon, according to Spanish-daily <em>AS</em>.</strong><br><br>It is suggested that Real Madrid could be faced with the problem of having too many squad players competing for the attacking midfield role, as they now have five playmakers in Van der Vaart, Esteban Granero, Sergio Canales, the injured Kaka, and now new signing Oezil.<br><br>The report states that Van der Vaart is worried about his future and is reluctant to leave Madrid. 'VDV' was seen talking to head coach Jose Mourinho for about five minutes during training yesterday.<br><br>The Dutch playmaker faced a similar situation last season when Real Madid signed Kaka. Van der Vaart was stripped off his squad number and not called up for pre-season friendlies, but was ultimately reinstated by former coach Manuel Pellegrini.<br><br><em>AS</em> believe that van der Vaart still has a good image in the Bundesliga due to his successful stint at Hamburg, and should have no problem in finding a new club should he be forced to leave.<br></span></div>

              <p><strong>Jose Mourinho has backed Mesut Ozil to be a key player for Real Madrid for a decade. The Germany midfielder has completed his move to the Bernabeu from Werder Bremen for a fee believed to be in the region of £12.4million.</strong>  </p>
              <p>'He's a player who can play for Real Madrid for 10 years,' Madrid boss Mourinho told Marca after his side drew 1-1 with Standard Liege in a pre-season friendly.   </p>
              <p>'His contract was running out so we could get him at a lot less than his actual market value. 'With Kaka's injury, Ozil and Sergio (Canales) are two players who can give us a lot.'</p>
              <p>The arrival of 21-year-old Ozil, who will be officially unveiled at a press conference on Wednesday, has sparked another round of speculation surrounding the future of Rafael van der Vaart.  </p>
              <p>The Holland midfielder scored Madrid's goal against Liege, but did not celebrate - a fact some took to mean he was on his way out of the club.</p>
              <p>But Mourinho said: 'For us it was just a training match. The result was not very important. I don't give any importance to the fact that Van der Vaart did not celebrate his goal. I didn't (celebrate) either. It was a friendly. </p>
              <p>'For me, Van der Vaart is still as important as before the Ozil transfer. As always, I will listen to the wishes of the players.'</p>
              <p>Mourinho declared himself happy with his business in the transfer market this summer.</p>

              <p><strong>It has been a lower-key recruitment drive than last year for Madrid, with Ozil very much the headline name on a list which also includes Canales, Sami Khedira, Ricardo Carvalho, Pedro Leon and Angel Di Maria.</strong>  </p>
              <p>'In a market that is affected by the bad economic situation, without making a signing like Kaka or Cristiano (Ronaldo), the club has invested enough,' he said.  </p>
              <p>One player seemingly not making the move to Madrid this summer is Romelu Lukaku, the 17-year-old Anderlecht striker who has caught Mourinho's attention.</p>
              <p>'His father is very intelligent and will not let his son go now,' said Mourinho. 'We will see next season.'</p>
