              <p><em>Ramos was on a £4.2m a year contract.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">JUANDE RAMOS believes he was sacked after some of his players stuck the knife in. The Spaniard insists at least three of his underperforming ‘stars’ said he had lost the dressing room before his Tottenham exit on Saturday night.</h2>
              <p class="article">Ramos also claimed he had <strong>NO</strong> say whatsoever in player transfers at White Hart Lane. And the former Sevilla coach says the club failed to get him three key summer signings he identified.</p>
              <p class="article">But incredibly Ramos is in line for an immediate return to management — at under-fire Spanish outfit Atletico Madrid. Ramos — who was replaced by Harry Redknapp — is poised to take command at the La Liga club.</p>
              <p class="article">For legal reasons, Ramos has been advised not to speak about his sacking until after a settlement is agreed. The Spaniard was one of the Premier League’s best-paid bosses on £4.2million a year at Spurs. And it is believed he will walk away with £7m.</p>
              <p class="article">A close friend of the coach revealed what has been going on at White Hart Lane during the last year. They said: “Juande wasn’t shocked by Tottenham’s decision to fire him but he was surprised by the timing. “He believes some of the players turned against him and that someone then spoke to the board which accelerated his sacking. That has left him feeling very betrayed. “He accepts responsibility for what has gone wrong on his part but hoped the players would accept some blame too.”</p>
              <p class="article">Ramos returned to Spain yesterday with his wife. He left behind a picture of a club run by Sporting Director Damien Comolli, who was booted out with Ramos and assistant Gus Poyet.</p>
              <p class="article">His pal told SunSport: “Juande did not have any say in the transfers of players in or out. “His impression was that Comolli and the chairman made all of the decisions and he was left to get on with what he was given. “Comolli did not come across as someone who had any great knowledge of players and Juande looked on him as a dimwit.</p>
              <p class="article">“Spurs were given three players who Juande believed were key to rebuilding. “They were keeper Andres Palop, midfielder David Albelda and winger Diego Capel. But they bought players who were identified by Comolli.”</p>
