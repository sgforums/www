We are well aware that we have something very valuable on our hands. Liverpool is not our club, it's your club. The supporters' club. It's always been that way and it will always be that way.'<br><br>'This dispute wasn't supposed to happen, but it has happened and now the focus has to be on finding a common platform to continue our co-operation.<br><br>'Rafa is the one we want as a manager and we have faith in him. I've been married more than 40 years and have first hand knowledge about how to solve an argument. We concentrated on getting an overview of the situation, and I felt we accomplished that.'</div>
