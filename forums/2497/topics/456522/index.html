              </h3>
              <h3 class="padding-bottom-7">ARSENE WENGER has taken another swipe at mega-rich rivals Manchester City and Chelsea.</h3>
              <p>The Arsenal boss insists his club are still not in the same League financially as their two Premier League rivals despite massive earnings from matchday income at the Emirates.</p>
              <p>Wenger is confident of completing a £16million deal for Malaga’s Santi Cazorla which would bring Arsenal’s summer spending up to £39m.</p>
              <p>The Frenchman said: “We consider ourselves in a privileged position because we have a massive income.</p>
              <p>“But overall we are not mega-rich because we do not have unlimited resources.</p>
              <p>“A club can buy players like PSG has done or Manchester City or Chelsea, with unlimited resources, but overall football suffers.</p>
              <p>“Look at the activity on the transfer market since the start of the summer.</p>
              <p>“PSG are ambitious and they have resources and that’s it. We talk always about the same things.</p>
              <p>“I don’t think anything is new in that domain.</p>
              <p>“Europe at the moment is like the Titanic but we live in football like nothing matters.</p>
              <p>“More than ever we have to run our club in a strict way because it looks like everybody suffers in Europe.</p>
              <p>“I would be surprised if football is not touched by it at some stage.</p>
              <p>“If you look at debt in football across Europe at the moment it is quite massive and we have to be responsible.</p>
              <p>“We have to be ambitious but also make sure we are not getting in trouble financially.</p>
              <p>“It is difficult for us because the wages in some other clubs are very high.</p>
              <p>“But of course our players quite rightly compare themselves to the players of the other clubs.”</p>
              <p>Asked whether Chelsea’s Champions League win would change anything in England, Wenger said: “I don’t see what it could change.</p>
              <p>“Maybe it will wake up the appetite of Abramovich again. I’m proud when any Premier League club wins the Champions League.</p>
              <p>“It shows how competitive the Premier League is because Chelsea finished fifth in the Premier League and that is the real quality of a team.</p>
              <p>“More than the Champions League it is about where you finish in the league.</p>
              <p>“That just shows how good the Premier League is.”</p>
              <p>Wenger is looking to stage talks this week with both Robin Van Persie and Theo Walcott over their futures.</p>

              <p><strong>Brendan Rodgers is continuing his overhaul of Liverpool by taking Nuri Sahin on a season-long loan from Real Madrid.</strong></p>
              <p>The agreement with the Spanish champions Real over the midfielder's move to Anfield includes an option for a permanent deal, and he is expected to be unveiled on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Sahin, 23, is a German-born Turkey international who can play in midfield or defence.</p>
              <p>He impressed with Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga, but has failed to make an impact since his move to the Bernabeu last summer.</p>
              </div>
              <p>While the Reds boss has completed one significant loan deal, to add to his purchases of Roma striker Fabio Borini and Swansea midfielder Joe Allen, another has collapsed.</p>
              <p>Barcelona starlet Cristian Tello has insisted he will stay at the Nou Camp until at least January.</p>
              <p>The highly-rated forward was also wanted by Rodgers on a one-year loan, but he has opted to stay with Barca in an attempt to force his way into the side.</p>
              <p>Tello, 21, has confirmed he will sit tight for at least one more transfer window.</p>

              <p>The Turkish Real Madrid midfielder was due to complete a one-year loan to Anfield deal yesterday.</p>

              <p><span><strong>Arsenal will confirm the loan signing of Real Madrid midfielder Nuri Sahin in the next 24 hours.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The Turkey international has been on manager Arsene Wenger's radar all summer but the Frenchman ramped up his interest after Alex Song made it clear he wanted to join Barcelona.</span></p>
              <p><span>Liverpool were also interested in the 23-year-old but have lost out to the Gunners.</span> </p>
              <p><span>German-born Sahin made 11 appearances for Real last season but has failed to hold down a first team place since joining the Spanish giants from Borussia Dortmund on a six-year contract in May 2011.</span></p>
              <p><span>Madrid hoped Sahin would move to Anfield because they would receive a larger loan fee but they will bow their player's wish to go to The Emirates.</span></p>
              <p><span>Arsenal also hope that winger Theo Walcott will sign a new contract next month. His current deal is up at the end of the season but negotiations are progressing.</span></p>
              <p><span>The club feel that the new signings, Lukas Podolski, Santi Cazorla and Olivier Giroud, will persuade him to stay, despite the loss of Robin van Persie.</span></p>
              <p><span>Arsenal could yet bring in another defensive midfielder and though their interest in Rennes' Yann M'Vila has waned through the summer, they would bid if the French club will accept £8m.</span></p>

              <p><span>The player's agent, Reza Fazeli, travelled to meet the Anfield club’s hierarchy and iron out the details of the deal.</span></p>
              <p><span>On Monday it looked as if a deal had been done to take the player from the Bernabeu to Arsenal but Madrid changed the course of events when it told the playmaker that the Gunners were unwilling to accept a loan deal and were pushing for a permanent transfer. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers revealed Andy Carroll missed Thursday night's 1-0 win over Hearts in the Europa League with a hamstring problem, while confirming he is edging closer to signing Nuri Sahin.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span>Sahin is expected to complete a season-long loan move to Liverpool on Friday after Arsenal pulled out of the running for Real Madrid's Turkey midfielder, 23. </span><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Arsenal felt they made a significant breakthrough on Tuesday and looked set to complete a deal. However, it is understood they were not prepared to match Liverpool's offer to pay 70 per cent of his wages of £120,000 a week. </span></p>
              </div>
              <p><span>Brendan Rodgers will guarantee him a place in the starting line-up and Sahin looks to approve a switch to Anfield on Tuesday, leading his representative to undertake his whirlwind trip to complete the deal.</span></p>
