              <p>i believe despite the fact that liverpool havent really that successful on the trophy front for so many years and their supporters are still there cheering the team on every weekend speaks a lot abt the support for the team. Glory hunters? i dont think so.</p>
              <p>when mourinho took over at chelsea at won titles, suddenly chelsea "fans" wearing chelsea jerseys start popping out everywhere, something which i think havent really been the case before.</p>
              <p>jus compare 2 very contrasting defeats for Liverpool and Man Utd last season. when liverpool were losing 1-3 to chelsea at anfield in the CL QF 1st leg, "You'll Never Walk Alone" could still b heard loud n clear at Anfield. the support for the team in a defeat was tremendous. i dont even wan to talk abt istanbul. then think about Man Utd's 1-4 defeat to Liverpool at old trafford. Check out the number of empty seats ard the stadium when Aurelio made it 3-1 to liverpool.</p>
              <p>something to ponder upon. jus my personal comments.</p>

              <p>i do not need to justify my loyalty to liverpool. and FYI, i supported them not because they were winning ( UCL etc in the recent years) or for their history. i supported them because of the culture and the love in liverpool.</p>
              <p>P.S. i dont want to get tangled with some liv man u love/hate game. to those who likes to criticise other teams etc just because you're better, that'll only shows how narrow-minded and ungracious you are.=)..well, i wouldnt care much about such people.</p>

              <p>very well said. its the culture of liverpool that attracted me as well. trophy or no trophy it doesnt matter. like what i mentioned in my earlier post. which supporters will sing their club anthems when the team is 1-3 down at home?</p>

              <p><br>why do many singaporeans have an unexplainable fanaticism with football clubs halfway across the world?</p>
              <p>its even more illogical if the reasons are 'my father supported it' or 'my uncle gave me a XXX jersey when i was very young and made me like the team' or 'they are a very good team, keep winning trophies.'</p>
              <p>like the guy on the ST long ago last year who said he 'loves liverpool more than his wife.' that is so sad.. i also saw pool fans openly smashing glasses in a pub when pool was losing to man utd.</p>
              <p>i think the govt encourages this 'friendly rivalry' because it gives singaporeans some group to 'vent' their frustrations at and keeps them happy</p>

              <p>and i dont think its solely because of the last reason u support pool. if so it simply means u support owen and you would have switched allegiance to his current club man utd.</p>
              <p>so it looks like it was just several insignificant factors that has made you a lifelong pool fan. how interesting. maybe if, just if beckham or somebody had caught your eye back then who knows maybe you would be a man utd supporter now instead.</p>
              <p>when i was very young i liked man utd because of cantona. but not anymore now i dont really support any team, just watch it to see nice football play.</p>
              <p>nowadays it seems that players go to where the money is, or if they think it will be better for themselves.</p>
              <p>the players in the club now come and go very freely, like tevez, owens, etc etc. even players you think are very loyal to their clubs might move if the situation is favourable. terry, gerrard, fabregas, rooney.</p>
              <p>so whats in a club? its just a name now. maybe 10 years down the road some clubs players would have switched with another clubs players. ie. look at owen now in man utd. maybe next time ronaldo (or rooney go spain and back) return back to epl and play for pool or spurs or something. haha!</p>

              <p>Illogical it may be, but it's my choice right? I old was I back then? 10 or 9? You expect me to be logical then? What's more, my choice to continue supporting them isn't based on this anymore, which makes your point irrelevant.</p>

              <p>i believe despite the fact that liverpool havent really that successful on the trophy front for so many years and their supporters are still there cheering the team on every weekend speaks a lot abt the support for the team. Glory hunters? i dont think so.</p>
              <p>when mourinho took over at chelsea at won titles, suddenly chelsea "fans" wearing chelsea jerseys start popping out everywhere, something which i think havent really been the case before.</p>
              <p>jus compare 2 very contrasting defeats for Liverpool and Man Utd last season. when liverpool were losing 1-3 to chelsea at anfield in the CL QF 1st leg, "You'll Never Walk Alone" could still b heard loud n clear at Anfield. the support for the team in a defeat was tremendous. i dont even wan to talk abt istanbul. then think about Man Utd's 1-4 defeat to Liverpool at old trafford. Check out the number of empty seats ard the stadium when Aurelio made it 3-1 to liverpool.</p>
              <p>something to ponder upon. jus my personal comments.</p>
