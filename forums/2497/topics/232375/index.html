Benitez was stunned by the decision after Liverpool offered Â£25,000 a week, although the deal would have been reviewed once he was established.<br><br>Neill indicated he was keen on a "dream" switch to Liverpool, and insisted then that he would ignore overtures from the likes of Tottenham and Newcastle.<br><br>Benitez, who will now approach Valencia to take Roberto Ayala on loan, said: "If he thinks about the move too long, then maybe that tells us that he is not the sort of player we want."<br><br>However, Neill, 28, could be left high and dry by his decision. Blackburn had agreed to swap Neill with Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock. With Liverpool almost certain to withdraw their offer of Warnock, it leaves Neill sweating on his future.<br><br>West Ham's spending was set to continue last night with Spurs defender Calum Davenport poised to move in a Â£3m deal.<br><br></div>

But clubs usually would have to sell their players with high salaries cos very few players would accept a pay cut.<br><br>Like Leeds for example, they are still paying part of the salaries of their ex-players cos they wouldn't take a pay cut... The sold Harry Kewell cheaply at $5m only when Duff when for 17m... These two valued were about the same at that time, maybe $12m. But Leeds needed to cut their monthly salary payout so had to agree to sell and also to make up the difference to the player's new salary to that of his drawing at Leeds until the end of his contract with them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Neill spurns Liverpool to join Hammers<br><br>Lucas Neill has agreed to join West Ham, spurning Liverpool because they could not guarantee first team football.<br><br>The Australia international has confirmed he will move from Blackburn in an interview with Sydney's Sunday Telegraph.<br><br>The report claims the transfer is worth Â£1.5million while Neill will earn Â£60,000 a week with the Hammers, twice the salary on offer at Liverpool.<br><br>Neill said: 'It wasn't about cash - that didn't come into it. It was about being wanted. West Ham were knocking down the door to get me whereas Liverpool made a take or leave it offer and didn't even come in for me until 15 days after the transfer window opened.<br><br>'People who have raised their eyebrows at me for making this decision are in for a surprise because West ham have a shopping list of players which almost blew me away.<br><br>'People have said I put money before medals and how could I make a sideways move like this and not go to a club like Liverpool, who are always in the hunt for trophies and so much prestige.<br><br>'It was an extremely hard decision but I know it's the right one. West Ham moved heaven and earth to sign me while Liverpool gave me the impression that I might not even get a game if I went there.<br><br>'I supported them as a kid and I know people are going to give me stick for not choosing them.'<br><br>Neill was persuaded to join West Ham by chairman Eggert Magnusson.<br><br>He added: 'It took me all of two minutes to be convinced I wasn't making a mistake when Mr Magnusson told me about his plans for the club.<br><br>'What he said almost knocked me off me feet.<br><br>'He told me I'm the first of many (new signings) earmarked for the club.<br><br>'I can be part of something big here. West Ham are very well supported. They just happen to be at the wrong end of the table at the moment but I hope to play my part in helping remedy that.<br><br>'They were two minutes away from winning the FA Cup final last season and have not suddenly become a bad team.'<br><br>Neill claims he has a get-out clause built into his deal should the Hammers be relegated and admits: 'It's a calculated gamble. It won't be a glamorous three months but once we secure safety people won't question my motives any more.<br><br>'I believe I will have the last laugh. People will soon be talking about West Ham in a very different way.'</div>
