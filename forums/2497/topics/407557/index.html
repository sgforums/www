              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>What if Fandi Ahmad let his talented footballing children choose to play for South Africa instead of Singapore?</strong></p>
              <p>Should Singaporean forgive their "favourite footballing son" if he allows his eldest kids — Irfan and Ikhsan, who are 13 and 11 respectively – to turn their back on Singapore and play for their mother’s country of birth, South Africa, in future. </p>
              <p>And some even say the government should exempt them from serving NS cos it will kill their sporting career. So Fandi’s sons don't need to serve National Service just develop as professional footballers?</p>
              <p>The current debate came to light after Irfan and Ikhsan made a huge impression while playing for Arsenal Soccer School Indonesia during the International Soccer Festival taking place in Surrey on the outskirts of London.</p>
              <p>Both boys, who were previously on trial with AC Milan and Valencia, are reportedly courted by EPL giants such as Arsenal and Chelsea but they cannot sign schoolboy forms — the first step towards becoming a professional footballer in England — until they turn 14.</p>
              <p>But while it seems only a matter of time before Fandi’s boys sign on as football apprentices (Arsenal reportedly have first right of refusal), the larger question — if they do turn professional – is which country they would choose to play for?</p>
              <p>While Singapore would be the obvious option, the boys’ mother, Wendy Jacobs, is from South Africa, making them available to play for the recent 2010 World Cup hosts when the time comes.</p>
              <p>Speaking to<em> The New Paper</em> from London, Fandi, 48, said as much.</p>
              <p>“Well, I don’t know, really,” he said. “Right now, it’s a bit too far to think about that.”</p>
              <p>The former Lions skipper admitted that National Service — the mandatory 24-month national call-up period that all Singaporean males must serve — is a major issue.</p>
              <p>“NS is a problem, although I don’t want to say too much because it is a sensitive issue. When I was 16, Ajax offered to sign me but I had to tell them to wait two years (for me to complete my NS).”</p>
              <p>The other obvious question is – would the boys even want to play for Singapore?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>it's not about abandoning sg, if the 2 years of ns would ruin any chance they have, then go pursue the career in europe then. for the amount of money sg gladly gives to ft sports folks, might as well offer something to fandi's boys in lieu of ns...the govt in the early days used to offer men other civilian bonded positions in place of ns...the same can be done here too....</p>
              <p>in the same position, i would also consider encouraging my own offspring their careers outside of the country too.</p>

              <p>I think you can't put it that way. There are so many talents that Singapore have failed to keep. Not to mention only about the sports arena, even in the arts industry, the Government has failed us too. </p>
              <p>We do not have the necessary infrastructure to hold a proper soccer game. And because of country pride, we ruin this 2 kids a great future that they could have enjoyed, who is at fault? </p>
              <p>If the government is willing to budget more into the sports scene by training athletes the right way, and maybe adjusting the NS according to individual abilities, I believe it could have been better. And also, the income to these people are very important. If they can produce results, I think they should be better paid than the <strong>M</strong>an-in-<strong>P</strong>ower -.- </p>

              <p>well, it would be sad for the kids to play for another country.</p>
              <p>but football has many components, one is player, one is coach, and etc etc. so maybe, the kids can develop into something, and then come back and contribute to sgp in another way.</p>

              <p>Well, unless they decide not to be a singaporean then they can forgo the NS. Otherwise, why should the gov make special arrangements just for them? Just because they happen to be "potential" footballers?</p>
              <p>There are many talented young men who have to put aside 2 yrs of their time to do NS... potential doctors, potential lawyers, potential state leaders etc... So what's the difference? Everyone recite the pledge, so it doesn't really mean a thing?</p>
              <p>Or have it become like the animal farm where "All animals are equal" are no longer the way of life here and the pigs ("potential" footballers) are above the state laws and special arrangements must be made for them?</p>
              <p>Fandi himself have enjoyed a great career and he is living the good life today all with the very help from Sg and it's people. So if he allows his kids to abandon Sg the moment he thinks going to SA will give them a better chance... Then I think it's a big mistake. Cos SA were only at the WC cos they were the host... If they had to go through a proper qualifier, the chances of them is just as slim... And there could be thousands or tens of thousands of young potential in SA trying to make it to Europe but how many really makes it?</p>
              <p>If anyone has proven anything, it's Fandi himself who have went through the process and maximize his potential to the maximum and took himself to Europe from right here in Sg... So if the kids does abandon sg in the near future, the gov should seriously look into their actions... I belief the present law doesn't allow sg citizens to have dual citizenship.</p>

              <p>Yes, present law does not recognize dual citizenship.  And, unless the boys have already left SG <strong>before  </strong>getting their pink IC (which I think the elder one already has), then they must serve NS before talking about giving up SG Citizenship.  The govenment view the fact that once you collected your pink IC (at 12, if I remember correctly), then you would have enjoyed economic benefit.  Hence, it's compulsory to serve NS before even entertaining thoughts of migrating to another country.</p>
              <p>Now, if the boy (the younger one) had left Singapore before collecting his pink IC, then he can continue to remain oversea and just apply for deferment when called up for NS.  This part I'm sure I am correct.  But, at what age can he renounce SG citizenship and am able to return to Singapore without fear of being charged for AWOL, this I'm not sure.</p>
              <p>I'm not a lawyer and the above 2 paragraphs should be viewed, at most, for entertainment purposes.</p>

              <p>There are indeed talented young mans out there. But these people are the cream of the crop, whom by profession, if missed the golden opportunity will lose out later in life. If we were to compare to other jobs like bankers, doctors and lawyers, these people are pretty much loaded in the brain area. Whereas a professional footballer cannot be compared likewise as their career will decline with age. </p>
              <p>Therefore, it would be good if they can make the most out of their youth and physical ability during this age. If age does not matter, then NS would have done away with the age criteria too. When there's a time for exception, do make it. Rules are made by man, it's flexible. </p>

              <p>Whatever reasons anyone wants to give, it's very important to remember that it still doesn't justify any special treatment should be render to such cases... Only genuine medical cases should be exempted.</p>
              <p>Again I like to say from the animal farm story, where all animals are supposed to be equal correct? Or in this case, all young sg men should be equal too or shouldn't they?

Cos once there is a line, then there will be people who will start to think of ways to get to the other side of that line...</p>
              <p>Can some very rich families pre-arrange for some small or medium European clubs to sign their sons as "potential footballers" or some other sports in future so as to get them exempted? And how would this make those who need to serve feel? Second class citizens? Or underprivileged citizens?</p>
              <p>Remember when some animals started to agree that the pigs deserved special treatment from the rest? What happen next? Things started to change... Special food items were reserved for them alone, they didn't need to work as much, and they eventually elevated themselves to positions of power...</p>
              <p>The thing here is very simple, serve their 22 months then pursuit their football career like their father who didn't do too badly i would say... Rules are indeed made by man, and the flexibility should still be reserved for medical conditions only and not frivolously.</p>
