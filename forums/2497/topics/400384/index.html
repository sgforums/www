              <p class="art-txt-first"><strong>Steven Gerrard has inadvertently fuelled talk 
              that he might leave Liverpool by confirming he will consider his future 
              after the World Cup.</strong></p>
              <p>By insisting that all of his attention is focused on 
              England rather than on the latest transfer gossip, Gerrard was unable to
               offer the categorical assurance that he would be remaining at Anfield.</p>
              <p>Instead, Gerrard acknowledged that he will have a decision to 
              make once he returns to England from South Africa - an admission that is
               bound to intensify the speculation that he has become disillusioned 
              with life at Anfield.</p>
              <p>"I'm not really interested at the moment in what's going on at 
              Liverpool. Hopefully things might happen while I'm away this summer. 
              There might be players coming in to help strengthen the team, we'll have
               to wait and see, but I won't consider my future or think about what is 
              going to happen to me until after the World Cup. My focus has got to be 
              on England now," Gerrard told The Observer.</p>
              <p>The Liverpool captain is rumoured to be Real Madrid's number one 
              transfer target this summer with Jose Mourinho expected to bid for the 
              midfielder once his own transfer to the Bernabeu is confirmed. Gerrard 
              has been pursued by Mourinho in the past, most notably four years ago 
              when the then-Chelsea boss almost prised him out of Anfield, but Gerrard
               is determined not to be distracted by transfer talk at what is likely 
              to be his final World Cup.</p>
              <p>"I fell into the trap four years ago - in the last World Cup, 
              where I was driving myself mad thinking about my future. I won't be 
              making that mistake again. I feel as if I am experienced enough now to 
              park issues like that.</p>
              <p>"I hope I have learned from what happened in Germany four years 
              ago. You do have quite a lot of time on your hands in World Cups and I 
              used to go back to my room and read the papers and go on the internet, 
              and then I would speak to people at home who were telling me that there 
              was stuff going on.</p>
              <p>"People around me are under strict instructions not to be talking
               about my club future or any sort of speculation. That's not important 
              now. What is important is that I have a good World Cup with the team. 
              Agents, friends and family have been told not to mention club stuff to 
              me."</p>
