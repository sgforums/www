              *FABIO CAPELLO and Carlo Ancelotti's personal feud erupted last night.*
                  
              England boss Capello reacted furiously after being branded 'surly' by the new Chelsea chief in his autobiography - as SunSport exclusively revealed yesterday. 
                  
              The Three Lions boss stormed: "I don't recognise myself in the description that has been given." We told you how Ancelotti has never forgiven Capello for the way he treated him as a player at AC Milan - and accused him of rowing with players and almost coming to blows with Ruud Gullit. 
                  
              But Capello hit back and hinted Ancelotti spends too much time trying to be matey with players and reporters. He said: "Sometimes I fight with one player. Not a lot, one. 
                  
              "Usually I speak with the players but I never went to dinner with them. "I never went to dinner with the journalists. I prefer to go with my wife or with friends. 
                  
              "I think the rules of the club are 'I'm a manager, you are a player'. I respect the players and I ask respect from them. Not more than this. 
                  
              "If you want to be a friend of the players, you be. Ancelotti won with his style. I won with ours." 
                  
              In his autobiography, Ancelotti said of Capello: "He was surly . . . in life, we can't like everyone we meet. I and Fabio have different characters." 
                  
              Capello will have other things on his mind today, though, as England bid for a sixth straight win in the World Cup qualifiers. 
                  
              He added: "Everyone must play to their best. No excuses that we are tired, we want to go on holiday."
