              <p><strong>Joe Cole fears a complete breakdown in his relationship with Roman Abramovich 
              will result in the midfielder leaving </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><strong>Chelsea</strong></a><strong> at the end of the season.</strong></p>
              <p>Sources at Stamford Bridge claim Cole and his representatives infuriated the 
              Russian with their hardline stance in contract negotiations which saw the player 
              threaten to leave if Abramovich did not meet the 28-year-old’s wage demands.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">The tactic appears to have backfired, not least because the Chelsea owner 
              does not consider Cole to be worth his salary demands which are in excess of 
              £100,000 a week — especially as he has failed to regularly start in Carlo 
              Ancelotti’s side since returning in September from a nine-month spell on the 
              sidelines with a serious knee injury.</div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><br></div>
              <div class="thinCenter">Cole has no desire to leave Stamford Bridge after seven largely successful 
              years at the club. But the negotiations stalled over the England winger’s 
              demands and there seems little chance of them being revived.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would say quite worth it if other clubs take him even on a $120k per week salary cos they won't need to pay a transfer fee on him and even at $120k, his one year also around $6m only... Joe Cole beside being a good creative winger, he is also English so probably have a transfer fee of about $12m to $15m. He would actually be free for about 2 and a half yrs... lol.

              <p><strong>Chelsea</strong><strong> remain committed 
                  to extending Joe Cole's stay at the club beyond the expiration of his current 
                  deal next summer, though the negotiations over a new contract remain at an 
                  impasse.</strong></p>
              <p>Talks between club and player have stalled over the midfielder's wage demands 
                  as he seeks to raise his salary from £80,000-a-week and into the bracket of 
                  higher earners at Stamford Bridge. Cole's inability to retain a regular place in 
                  Carlo Ancelotti's starting line-up has undermined his negotiating position, with 
                  the England coach Fabio Capello having admitted last week that he did not appear 
                  to be "the same player" since returning from serious knee ligament damage in 
                  September.</p>
              <p>The 28-year-old is expected to feature in Sunday's FA Cup quarter-final 
                  against Stoke City, with Chelsea's assistant manager Ray Wilkins insistent that 
                  Cole has just suffered a temporary dip in form and could even yet force his way 
                  back into Capello's plans ahead of the World Cup finals. "We are desperate to 
                  keep Joe," said Wilkins. "I know the club are and we as a management group feel 
                  the same. He is a very valuable asset to us. Joe himself is upbeat about his 
                  future here. He loves Chelsea and wants to stay. It is a contractual situation 
                  that he and the club, I am sure, will sort out. We sincerely hope he will be 
                  here next season.</p>
              <p>"I would not have thought his form has been affected by the contract 
                  situation. I just think he has had a long lay-off, something like 10 months, and 
                  it is never easy to come back. Your form does drop, and Joe has just had that 
                  dip. He has got to get a little bit more consistency back and then there will 
                  not be a problem with him. But, as Fabio said, he has not been too impressed 
                  with Joe's form over the last couple of months. That's why he wasn't involved 
                  against Egypt but, if he performs to the ability we know Joe has, then Fabio 
                  will take him."</p>
