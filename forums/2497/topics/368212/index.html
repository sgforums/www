              <p>He's become something of a fixture in the Hong Kong Soccer Sevens, but Mike Riley's connection to the annual tournament started in unlikely circumstances three years ago during a stopover on his way to Australia.</p>
              <p>Taking a couple of days break in the former British territory before flying to Melbourne to officiate the Australia vs. Greece 2006 World Cup warm-up game, the Premier League referee was spotted sitting in the stands at the Hong Kong Football Club.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He'd seen the event advertised and turned up at the ground, paying his own admission at the gate. But instead of blending in with the fans, the unmistakable Riley was quickly identified and recruited to help out in Premier League-mad Hong Kong. He was invited to the tournament awards' dinner, presenting the prize for the best referee.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The following year, Riley was back, conducting coaching sessions with the local referees' association and controlling the Hong Kong FA Cup final. He stayed on to play a significant role in the 2007 Soccer Sevens, helping keep on-field emotions in check during highly-competitive Masters' matches featuring former international and ex-Premiership stars.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the last two years - 2008 and 2009 - Riley's travel costs were covered by a local legal firm with a partner who is an amateur referee and a secretary of Hong Kong Football Club.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As well as officiating matches each May during the three-day tournament - now officially known as the HKFC IP Global International Soccer Sevens - Riley mentors local referees and makes public and corporate appearances. "An Evening With Mike Riley", organised by sports PR company Two Up Front, saw the Yorkshireman conduct a lengthy Q and A with a captivated audience.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And last year, Riley fulfilled a lifetime career ambition when he was in the middle for Hong Kong's mini-version of the Old Firm Derby - Celtic vs. Rangers - in the main tournament.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Born in Leeds in December 1964, Riley became a national Football League referee in 1994 and earned his FIFA status five years later. He's refereed three big English finals - including the 2002 FA Cup final between Arsenal and Chelsea - and controlled two games at Euro 2004 in Portugal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Riley has seen his fair share of controversy during his long career, sometimes in games involving Manchester United. Arsenal's record 49-match unbeaten streak was broken in 2004 after Riley awarded a highly-disputed penalty to Wayne Rooney after the striker went down after minimal contact from Gunners' defender Sol Campbell.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In April, Everton manager David Moyes questioned Riley's appointment to their FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United because of press reports that Riley was a lifelong Red Devils' supporter. In the final match of the 2002-2003 season, a penalty awarded to Man United against Everton effectively cost Moyes' side a place in the Uefa Cup and the Scotsman called for an FA investigation into Riley's links to Old Trafford.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even in the 2007 Hong Kong FA Cup final, he raised some eyebrows by awarding three penalties - two of them to South China - as they beat Happy Valley 3-1 to win a treble of domestic trophies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After his most recent trip to Hong Kong, a relaxed Riley, known for his sharp sense of humour on-and-off the field, sat down with <strong>ESPN Soccernet</strong> to reflect on his Asian adventures - and to look ahead to the new English Premier League season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Q: Mike, how does refereeing in Hong Kong, including controlling the Hong Kong FA Cup final, compare to the FA and Carling Cup finals? <br>A:</strong> In refereeing any major final what strikes you as a referee is the sense of occasion and the importance of the game for the players and spectators of both teams. My FA Cup and Carling Cup Finals were both played in front of 80,000 spectators in the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. However, walking out into the Hong Kong Stadium with its magnificent backdrop of skyscrapers and to the noise generated by the spectators in the main stand was every bit as exciting. It was also the first match I have ever refereed in monsoon conditions, with the last 25 minutes played out in torrential rain. It was a credit to the skill of the players that the entertainment and quality of the match that it continued in spite of the conditions. And for a Yorkshireman to say that he's never been wetter gives some indication of just how much it rained!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Q: Looking ahead to the new Premier League season, is it becoming easier or harder for referees? <br>A: </strong>Every season poses new challenges for referees and players alike. The speed and intensity of the game increases as teams strive to give their best. As referees we train hard to be able to meet the physical demands these improvements place upon us. We also devote a considerable amount of time and resources to analysing our performances, with a view to improving as officials in every match that we participate in. So yes, the challenges increase season by season but so too does the thrill of participating in one of the best competitions in the world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Q: How has the FA's Respect Program affected the relationship between referees and players? <br>A: </strong>In my view, the Respect Program has benefitted the game enormously. Both players and referees have responded positively and responsibly. The pre-match discussion with team captains and their willingness to assist in managing their players during the game has enabled referees to manage the game more effectively and has contributed to a more entertaining spectacle.</p>
              <p><strong>Q: You turn 45 in December. How difficult is it to keep passing the referee fitness tests? <br>A:</strong> Fortunately, as a Select Group referee, I have the support of a sports scientist who provides training plans to make sure that I am always match fit - and, therefore, able to pass the fitness tests. As refereeing is my main job I also have the time necessary to devote to proper training. On average I will train for 2 hours per day, 5 days a week, assuming that I have one match at the weekend. All of our training is recorded on heart rate monitors and is analysed weekly by our sports scientist.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Interestingly, using the Prozone system, our physical performance during each match is also analysed. Within two days of a game I receive a report detailing how much distance I covered in a game, broken down in to sprinting, high intensity running, jogging and walking. The number of sprints and running speed are also listed. This information informs the training plan for the following weeks and is designed to make sure that we take to the field as prepared as possible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Q: You've been involved in some humorous incidents over the years. Tell us about the time you showed a red card to the Reading mascot? <br>A: </strong>Fortunately, there are many humorous and enjoyable incidents in football. On this occasion the mascot, who was dressed in the Reading strip, was dancing on the touchline adjacent to the Reading penalty area. The job of an Assistant Referee is difficult enough and I was concerned that, in glancing up as Reading attacked, he may mistake the colours for those of a Reading player and flag for offside. Trying to be helpful I asked for the mascot to be moved away from the penalty area. I probably did a great disservice to my Assistant as everyone then thought he couldn't tell the difference between an eight foot mascot and a player!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Q: The ambition of players to win silverware and titles, but what is the ultimate goal for a referee? <br>A: </strong>The ultimate goal for a referee in England is probably to referee the FA Cup Final. The system in England means that you are only ever invited to referee this match once and competition for the appointment is strong. I was fortunate to take charge of the 2002 final between Arsenal and Chelsea, notable for two magnificent goals. It is also the one occasion where your family and friends are part of the occasion, making the event more memorable.</p>
