              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Inter Milan</span></abbr> coach <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Jose Mourinho</span></abbr> has declared he wants to return to the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premiership</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Mourinho, who had three full seasons at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> after making Porto champions of Europe as well as his native Portugal, is in his second season with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Inter Milan</span></abbr> and on top of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Serie A</span></abbr>, having already celebrated one national title in Italy, his fifth over seven seasons in three countries.</p>
              <p>“I want to build something,” he told <em>The Times</em>.</p>
              <p>"Clearly it is unrealistic to expect to stay at a club as long as Sir
              Alex, but I am ready for the next phase of my career,” he said. “I want
              to work with a different perspective.</p>
              <p>“At Porto, my objective was to win to earn the right to go abroad. At <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>, my ambition was to create a bit of history [the club had not won the title for half a century]. But I always knew <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> lacked the normal English culture of stability.</p>
              <p>“I was never under any illusions. I understood the personality
              of Roman and the culture of the people around him [Mourinho carefully
              exempted Peter Kenyon, the outgoing chief executive, from this] and
              knew it was not a job for ten years.</p>
              <p>“My role was to give this man what he wanted — victory —
              knowing that, sooner or later, my time would finish, because there were
              too many things going on around me.</p>
              <p>“In Italy, I was coming to the motherland of tactics, the
              country of catenaccio and defensive football. The objective was to win
              not only in a third different league but a place where they say foreign
              coaches have had little success. But the time will come for stability.</p>
              <p>“I love Inter and would love to build for the future here. In
              fact, I am doing it now, because I am not a selfish coach and I’m
              thinking about the future in terms of youth development and the age
              structure of my first team — but Italy is not the country for this.
              England is the country. And my football is English football.”</p>

              <p><strong>JOSE MOURINHO has targeted Manchester United as the ideal venue for a return to English football, and is optimistic that Sir Alex Ferguson will recommend him as his successor when he retires. Mourinho is in his second season at Internazionale, but does not see his long-term future in Italy, where the sport’s hierarchy has proved unreceptive to methods that have brought him five league titles in the past seven seasons.</strong></p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Mourinho recently signalled his intention to return to English football given the right opportunity, stating that the Premier League is the place best suited to his style. “I am thinking about the future in terms of youth development and the age structure of my first team,” he said of his work with Inter, “but Italy is not the country for this. England is the country. And my football is English football.”</p>
              <p>His prime target is the United job. Mourinho developed a strong personal relationship with Ferguson and has been given reason to believe the Scot will play a significant role in appointing his successor. While Ferguson, 67, has set no firm date for his departure, there have been indications that he will go after winning one more European Cup. He has said he will not be doing the job at the age of 70.</p>
              <p>However, Mourinho sought to reassure Inter yesterday that he was staying, without actually denying the words quoted were his. “I am very sorry a sincere tribute to Sir Alex Ferguson has been used in bits in a media outlet and in a different way from which my input was requested and above all with totally different aims,” Mourinho told Inter’s website. “As you can read from a correct translation of some of my quotes, I explained I love Inter, I am happy at Inter and that I am building for Inter. This is the reality and will be so until the end of my contract.” His contract runs until 2012.</p>
              <p>Mourinho’s interest in taking over United has affected his thinking on managing Manchester’s other club. He was asked twice last season if he would be prepared to replace Mark Hughes as the Manchester City manager, but declined both times.</p>
