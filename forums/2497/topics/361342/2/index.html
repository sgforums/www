              Newcastle will offload a lot of players and players rushing for the exit as well. You will see an exodus of players and also bidding from other clubs for their star players.
              
              but newcastle really have themselves to blame. the owner lar. itchy backside go hire technical director, dennis wise to oversee players bought and sold. no wonder keegan is so pissed to have quitted. after keegan left, they shd have appointed experienced coaches like venables, souness or peter reid to take charge till end of the season as short term and if they did well, give them the job at end of season. but who did the owner appoint after keegan left? a heart attack kinnear and later the inexperienced alan shearer?

              Yes, Shearer has not even managed a club, and has no experience in managing players and tactics. rather than relying on fail safe coach who has the experience or know-how on relegation battlers, he appointed a novice in alan shearer tp rescue them in their last 8 games. They blew their chance when they fail to beat fulham last week at home. an experienced manager like souness, or venables or peter reid would have gotten at least 10 points from last 8 games and newcastle would have been safe from relegation.
              
              this owner and his advisors decision making is so fark up. should let football people manage the decisions, not those arm chair owner and his lackeys.

              <p><strong>The 26-year-old, an unused substitute in Newcastle's defeat to
              Aston Villa, told TyC Sports cable channel: "Right now, the main thing

              <p>I blame solely on Keegan &amp; Shearer. Supposedly the messiah for the Magpies. Keegan walked out of the club just because he can't get the players he wanted. Yeah, so what if he got what he wanted, can he do anything good with them? Remember Fulham, Man City?</p>
              <p>If he loved the club so much, he should have stayed on, instead of cashing out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Shearer is an ego-istic bloke who agreed to manage Newcastle thinking he can be a Messiah and hero, but he failed because he failed to motivate his players to his will because he was a bane in the dressing in during his time as a newcastle captain.</p>
              <p>The magpies played without heart and Shearer blamed his "dressing room" as a result. This showed he failed to control his players.</p>
              <p>Shearer isn't well liked by the players anyway because of his arrogance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To think the vocal british magpies fans still think of Keegan and Shearer as messiahs, shows their pea-brain thinking.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a Newcastle supporter and for the good of the club, get rid of Shearer and don't ever bring back Keegan or Shepard, don't live in past glories and don't think that having a 55K capacity stadium means it's an entitlement to the EPL.</p>
              <p> </p>
