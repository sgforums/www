            <div class='col-md body'><strong>FORGET the staggering prices quoted for second-rate footballers - there are still bargain transfers out there. With the mid-season transfer window slammed shut, many managers are already preparing for next season Â– in or out of the Premiership.</strong><br><br>Aside from Chelsea, every club has to work within strict budgets - and all find nothing more satisfying than the arrival of a big name on a free transfer. So whether it is an overseas star, a reliable Premiership goalscorer or a promising lower league star, clubs will fight it out for the players coming to the of their contracts.<br><br>Here we have complied the Bosman XI - the best players soon to be available on free transfers at home and abroad.<br><br><strong>Jens Lehmann</strong><br>The Arsenal goalkeeper is in the autumn of his career and may fancy one last challenge away from the Gunners. Lehmann will turn 38 in November and Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is refusing to offer his No1 anything other than a one-year deal. The Germany international is keen to secure a two-year contract and could end his time at the Emirates Stadium come June. Bargain rating: 8/10<br><br><strong>Mark Delaney</strong><br>The Aston Villa defender has been plagued with injuries in the past two seasons. Delaney will miss the rest of the season and is understood to have played his last game in the claret shirt. But if the Welshman can prove the doubters wrong and return to full fitness, there will be a queue of clubs ready to sign him. 6/10<br><br><strong>Alessandro Nesta</strong><br>The elegant Italian international has put a host of top European sides on red alert with his contract nearing its completion. Nesta has been one of the continentÂ’s most impressive defenders in recent years and won the Champions League with AC Milan. The Italian giants desperately do no want to lose him for nothing Â– but that decision is seemingly out of their hands. 10/10<br><br><strong>Tal Ben Haim</strong><br>BoltonÂ’s towering Israeli defender is desperate to join one of the Premiership big boys. Ben Haim, 24, believes he is capable of playing at the very top and has welcomed ChelseaÂ’s recent interest in him. Bolton boss Sam Allardyce is accustomed to finding bargain buys himself Â– but this is one free transfer he doesnÂ’t want to happen. 9/10<br><br><strong>Sylvain Distin</strong><br>The French star has rejected a new contract at Manchester City in favour of a final bumper deal in his career. Distin turns 30 this year and wants one last shot at silverware Â– something he feels is not possible at Eastlands. The defender is understood to want to stay in England Â– expect a rush of Premiership clubs to fight for his signature. 8/10<br><br><strong>Steve Sidwell</strong><br>ReadingÂ’s influential midfielder has played a game of cat and mouse with the club in the past 12 months. Sidwell, aware that a host of Premiership clubs are ready to tempt him away from the Madejski Stadium, is leaving his options open until the last minute. ReadingÂ’s impressive debut season in the top-flight has altered the ex-Arsenal playerÂ’s views on leaving Â– but he knows the dangers of staying with the club in the hazardous second year in the Premiership. 9/10<br><br><strong>Zoltan Gera</strong><br>The Hungarian midfielder is set to leave West Brom Â– whether or not they are promoted to the Premiership. Gera showed admirable loyalty to the Baggies by staying with them after last seasonÂ’s relegation. But the dangerous forward knows a host of top-flight clubs will be waiting with big offers as the season climaxes. 8/10<br><br><strong>Aldo Duscher</strong><br>The Argentina international - famous for breaking David Beckham's foot - is refusing to agree a new deal at Deportivo La Coruna. Duscher has fallen out with the Spanish sideÂ’s coach and fancies a move to another country. Lyon are attempting to bring him to France, but it is understood Manchester United are also monitoring the situation. 9/10<br><br><strong>Matt Jarvis</strong><br>The Gillingham winger is regarded as one of the most exciting young attackers in EnglandÂ’s lower leagues. Still only 20, Jarvis has already attracted interest from the Premiership and that is where his future lies. Born in Middlesbrough, the affable youngster may consider a move back to the north-west with Newcastle and Boro both monitoring his progress. 7/10<br><br><strong>Mark Viduka</strong><br>The Aussie hitman has retained his admirers despite a difficult three years at Middlesbrough. Viduka, 31, has struggled with injuries and form on Teeside but plenty of clubs are eyeing his situation. The ex-Leeds ace believes he can still play for a top-six club and will hold out for one last big Premiership pay-day - at the Riverside or elsewhere. 7/10<br><br><strong>Kanu</strong><br>The Nigerian forward has been a revelation since arriving at Portsmouth in the summer. Released by West Brom, Kanu earned a surprise return to the Premiership and has yet to let anyone down. The Pompey ace has publicly discussed his options Â– including a return to Dutch giants Ajax Â– as he attempts to secure a long-term deal by the end of the season. 8/10<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Substitutes:</strong></span><br><br><strong>Dida</strong><br>AC MilanÂ’s Brazilian keeper may be 33 but a number of clubs Â– including Arsenal - believe he has another two years at the top. 7/10<br><br><strong>Kris Commons</strong><br>The lively Nottingham Forest midfielder has impressed in League One and is now ready for the big time. 7/10<br><br><strong>Trevor Sinclair</strong><br>The Manchester City winger has struggled with injuries this season but can still be a matchwinner on his day. 5/10<br><br><strong>Robbie Fowler</strong><br>LiverpoolÂ’s veteran striker is set to be booted out of Anfield for a second time Â– but his goals could be valuable to another Premiership side. 6/10<br><br><strong>Teddy Sheringham</strong><br>The West Ham forward turns 41 in April but he continues to excel at the highest level and could suit one of the promoted sides. 6/10<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>And if youÂ’re really desperateÂ…</strong></span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><strong>Titus Bramble and Craig Moore</strong><br>The error-prone Newcastle defensive duo could be short on offers when their contracts conclude. Bramble has endured five nightmare seasons at St JamesÂ’ Park and the Geordie fans have had enough of his mistakes. Moore has only been at Newcastle for two years but is also regarded as a liability on the terraces. 1/10<br><br></div>
