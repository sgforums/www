              <p><strong>Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez has issued something of an ultimatum
              over his long-running contract saga, stating his desire to be offered a
              “medium or long-term project” which he hopes to sign within the next
              fortnight.</strong></p>
              <p>The Spaniard’s future at Anfield has been under intense scrutiny for
              some time now, and with little over a year remaining on his current
              deal at the club speculation has started to mount over a possible exit.</p>
              <p>Real Madrid have been mooted as a potential destination for the
              former Valencia boss, although he has rubbished claims he could be set
              to join the side over whom he masterminded a 4-0 Champions League
              trumping of on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>However, rumours of his unhappiness at the current state of affairs over his contract situation have refused to dissipate.</p>
              <p>Now the 48-year-old has urged the boardroom to offer him what he
              wants, and has stated his desire to continue the job he has undertaken
              on Merseyside.</p>
              <p>"I must decide on my future in the next two weeks and I want a
              medium or long-term project," Benitez was quoted as saying by The Sun.</p>
              <p>"I don't want to be working from day to day always hanging on the
              latest result. I will work where I feel I can develop a project."</p>
              <p>Benitez continued: "People who claim that I'm going to take over at
              Real Madrid are doing the wrong thing in spreading that idea.</p>
              <p>"I have a contract with Liverpool, I owe Liverpool - I'm only thinking of them.</p>
              <p>"Real Madrid are a great club but I'm at another wonderful club - one which motivates me.</p>
              <p>"What I want is hard to find in Spain. Long-term projects do not exist, not like they do in England."</p>

              <p>I think Ah Ben want to achieve the certainty of winning the EPL title within these two weeks.</p>
              <p>The american owners know that the fans want the EPL title.</p>
              <p>If Ah Ben can deliver, then Ah Ben will get his end of bargain for full control.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben have conquered Spain so I dun think he want to go back to achieve something he can take easily.</p>
              <p>Seeing how pathetic his nemesis have become in this week at Old Trafford, Ah Ben would be stupid NOT to stay in Liverpool and the best league in the europe.</p>
              <p>So, he is just stalling to see the outcome and to confirm whether he can stay on.</p>
