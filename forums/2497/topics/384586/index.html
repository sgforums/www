              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword">
              </span></p><p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Steve Savidan - Binman</strong><br><br>The
              journeyman forward took an unconventional route to the top via stints
              in several pubs as a barman and topping up his income as a binman while
              playing in the lower reaches of French football. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Proved that
              determination can overcome adversity by rescuing his career inspiring
              Valenciennes to successive promotions and even earning a cap for
              France. Was all set to complete the dream with a fairytale move to
              glitzy Monaco last summer before his medical revealed a heart defect
              and Savidan was forced to retire aged just 31. </span></p>
              <div><span style="font-size: small;"><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/40028_hp.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><em>Savidan: Bin there, done that<br></em></span></div>
              <span style="font-size: small;"><strong> </strong></span>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><br>Mat Mitchel King - Body Double</strong><br><br>Strutted
              the catwalk as a model for Armani and was employed as Rio Ferdinand's
              official body double for a Nike campaign before signing pro forms with
              Crewe Alexandra in the summer. Quipped that he costs far less than Rio,
              and he may well be drafted in to cover him again at United given the
              club's recent injury crisis. <br></span><span style="font-size: small;"><br><strong>Roar Strand - Chimney Sweep</strong><br><br>The Ryan Giggs of Norway, Strand has clocked up an astonishing 15 league titles with Rosenborg in his trophy-laden career. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Similar to the Welshman,
              Strand performed at his best under a strict disciplinarian - Nils Arne
              Eggen - who demanded his players to either study or have a second job
              away from the game. While many favored the classroom, the midfielder
              went down, quite literally, a different route and worked as a chimney
              sweep. <br><br><strong>Julio Cruz - Gardener</strong><br><br>El Jardinero earned his green fingered nickname for working as a groundskeeper at his local football club in Argentina. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">According to legend, he
              was asked by the Banfield coach to deputize for an injured player and
              made such an impression that he was promptly offered a contract. The
              whereabouts of his lawnmower remain unknown but it has been linked to a
              recent fight with David Beckham. <br></span></p>

              <span style="font-size: small;">
              <p><br><strong>Chris Waddle - Sausage Maker</strong><br><br>The Geordie dribbler
              was a sizzler before turning pro, working in a sausage factory to make
              ends... ahem, 'meat'. Was a headline dream in the 80's for writers who
              predictably branded any good performances as 'Sizzling' and a shocker
              as... wait for it... a 'Banger.'</p>
              <p>Waddle rather spoiled things when he revealed years later that he
              was responsible for the seasoning and not the little piggies in the
              factory. Ah come on Chris, never let the truth get in the way of a good
              story!</p>
              <p>His England team-mate Stuart Pearce, meanwhile, trained as an
              electrician and used the Nottingham Forest program to advertise his
              services.</p>
              </span>
              <div><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/48607_hp.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><em>Waddle: Singer, sausage seasoner, dribbler, genius</em><br></div>
              <span style="font-size: small;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><br><strong>Jose Mourinho - Teacher/Translator</strong><br><br>After
              failing to make it as a player, Mourinho enrolled in business school
              but dropped out after one day to study sports science instead. He
              became a physical education teacher and coached youth teams at several
              schools in Lisbon before he landed the job as Bobby Robson's translator
              at Sporting Lisbon in 1992. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The 'Special One' didn't
              just have a talent for interpreting and impressed the veteran coach
              with his knowledge and tactical insight. When Robson moved to Barcelona
              in 1996, Mourinho picked up Catalan and heard his mentor was for the
              chop after being encouraged by Bobby to tell him everything that was
              being said on the record and off by the Barca hierarchy. </span></p>
              <div><span style="font-size: small;"><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/35459_hp.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><em>Jose: I understand everything<br></em></span></div>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><br></span><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson - Apprentice Tool-Maker/Chef</strong><br><br>Fergie's
              famous no nonsense approach to superstars stems from his own working
              class background in the harsh shipyards of Scotland.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Long before alice bands
              were even invented, the amateur player was an apprentice tool-maker in
              his native Govan where he slogged away for five years before eventually
              turning pro aged 23. As an apprentice, Ferguson showed some of the
              leadership skills when he became a trade union shop-steward and
              organized an unofficial walk-out for his colleagues over a pay dispute. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Decades later, the canny
              Scot would get his friend George Graham to fax over his lucrative
              Arsenal contract so Ferguson could embarrass the Old Trafford
              paymasters over his paltry salary which was then miles shy of his top
              players. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Fiery chef Gordon Ramsay
              may have had some competition in the culinary/shouting department if
              Ferguson had pursued his cooking career when he was 30. He donned an
              apron and worked the stove for 18-months in a restaurant close to
              Hampden Park before deciding to concentrate solely on his football
              career. </span></p>
              <div><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/47918_hp.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><em>Fergie: Anyone for pasta?<br></em></div>
              <p><br><strong>Moreno Torricelli - Factory Carpenter</strong><br><br>Opportunity
              knocked for the factory carpenter when he stood out for amateur side
              Caratese in a pre-season friendly against Juventus in the summer of
              1992.</p>
              <p>The Bianconeri's then-coach Giovanni Trapattoni loved his endeavour
              and shelled out 20 million lira to bring him to Turin. A year later he
              was playing alongside Roberto Baggio when the Old Lady thumped Borussia
              Dortmund to win the UEFA Cup. Not a frequent goalscorer with Juve as he
              was more fond of the woodwork. <br><br><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Peter Schmeichel - Cleaner/Carpet Fitter etc</strong><br><br>Turned
              his hand to a variety of tasks including working for 12-months as a
              cleaner in a retirement home before he hit the big time. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The goalkeeper was also
              an apprentice carpet fitter, sold advertising for a newspaper and ran a
              charity shop for the World Wildlife Fund before joining Manchester
              United in 1991. Now fronts 'Dirty Jobs' on the Discovery Channel. </span></p>

              <strong><br>Grafite - Bin Liner Salesman</strong><br><br>Wolfsburg's powerhouse went door to door in his native Sao Paulo selling bin-liners to support his family. <br>In
              a recent interview he said it wasn't an unusual job for the time and
              that the experience had taught him a lot of positive things. Certainly
              did as he reduced Bayern Munich's defense to rubbish last season with a
              superb individual <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8eLSpDa_1E">goal</a>. <br><br>
