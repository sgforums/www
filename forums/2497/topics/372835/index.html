              <p>Ahead of tomorrow's clash, Whelan said: "I don't think United will win
              the title this season. I think there will be a few surprises, with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> possibly finishing in the top three, and if I had to pick one I would say <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>"I thought United looked iffy against Birmingham City and Burnley were
              up for it at Turf Moor, as United will be when they come here. They
              won't want to get beat twice in a row. But they are missing some big
              players at the moment and if their two central defenders are out again
              then we will have a hell of a chance."</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Wigan</span></abbr> Athletic chairman Dave Whelan has questioned the long-term interest of the owners of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> in the club.</p>
              <p>"You can understand the enthusiasm that the Arabs have for the game
              because it is such a fabulous sport and it is so big worldwide. You can
              understand their excitement and why they are throwing money at it," the
              <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Wigan</span></abbr> owner told the <em>Guardian</em>.</p>
              <p>"But that money makes every single <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> club think: 'They could come in for one of our players,' and, instead
              of being realistic, clubs are asking £10m for £2m or £3m players. That
              is purely because of the Arabs coming in and throwing money at it. And
              it can't last.</p>
              <p>"Once the Arabs have been in and lost a lot of money and
              haven't won the title or the FA Cup, or not got into Europe, are they
              going to keep pouring money in? Their enthusiasm will wane unless City
              get fabulous success. You've got to say that the Arab money is good for
              the league but it has sent every transfer barmy this summer."</p>

              <p><br>don't think he needs to try or make himself sound like anything we do not already know.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>this is my beef with him. he will jump onto any thread with a modicum of bad news for Man Utd and gloat/boast/rub it in/laugh/poke fun (choose one/all). and he will say its because someone did it eons ago that he is doing it now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thing is, i do not see any regulars do it now anymore. maybe we would need to wait 11 years for him to see that "oh 11 years ago they did not take a dig at me so maybe i will not go poke fun at them today"</p>

              <p>Almost every season, Man Utd starts slow and people write them off...Well, we know what happens most of the time that happens.They have lost star players before but remains a strong force come end of the season.</p>
              <p>Anyway, to say Liverpool will win the title is a bit of a wishful thinking bearing in mind the season is long and they are pretty much lacking in depth.Injuries to Gerrard or Torres will stifle their title challenge.</p>
              <p>Chelsea have a very strong chance compared to last season as they have mostly the same squad, thus continuity and experience.They are my pick to push Man Utd all the way.</p>
              <p>Arsenal are pretty much the same as every season, inconsistent and lacking in depth. they normally start strongly but seems to fade come mid-season.</p>
              <p>Spurs have a stronger squad this season but i wouldn't put too muich hope in them, Just ask any Spurs fans what happens when they put high hopes on their team only to be disappointed time and again.</p>
              <p>Man City have a strong squad but i think over the course of a long season, we will see some dressing room squabbles and unhappiness and this will throw them a bit off course.</p>
              <p>So my predictions:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Manchester United</li>
              <li>Chelsea</li>
              <li>Liverpool</li>
              <li>Tottenham Hotspurs</li>
              <li>Arsenal<br></li>
              <li>Manchester City</li>
              </ol>
              <p>followed by the rest....</p>
              <p> </p>
