              <p>on a personal note, im backing stevie to leave his boyhood club, although, he's the soul of the team.</p>
              <p>he's a world class player, he deserve medals, he had almost everything already, except for the bpl title.</p>
              <p>to be complete as a footballer, he need that medal desperately, and i dont think he can win it with liverpool.</p>

              <p>My view is, Pool should learn from Wenger and know when to cash in on your ageing assets before they become worthless... No player is bigger than the club as we always hear...</p>
              <p>I think Wenger was smart to cash in on players like Marc Overmars, Patrick Vieira and Henry... And Pool would do well if they cash in should a $15-$20m offer comes along... </p>

              <p>No one is indispensable to a huge club... The same was thought of about Cantona, Henry, Keane, Ronaldo as well... But time passed and the club move on.</p>
              <p>The same will be apply to Gerrard, Terry, Fabregas, Rio and Giggs...</p>
              <p>If Pool are smart, they should cash in on Gerrard now cos he looks like he don't have many top level matches in him left... At most, give him 2 more years...</p>

              <p>Well... when Patrick Vieira left, Fabregas came on...</p>
              <p>Henry gone to Barce, Robin Van Persie appear...</p>
              <p>When Adebayor was sold, Nicklas Bendtner rise...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">And when Kolo Toure left for more money, a better </span>Vermaelen took over...</p>
              <p>And very soon, Aaron Ramsey will replace Fabregas once he leave...</p>
              <p>Life goes on... Pool will forget Gerrard too...</p>
              <p>Anyway, if Gerrard stays, in the near future Pool fans may even start to ask why is he still playing when his form start to go downhill... I think it's better for him to leave them good memories of himself than his last years... When poeple will forget how good he was once and only remember him as a rubbish players in his older days...</p>
              <p>Like Cantona, who call it quits at Gerrard's current age after winning the title cos he didn't want to be remembered as a has been to the United fans... United fans will forever fondly remember him as the King cos he step out at the peak of his game just before his age caught up with him... Unlike Keane, and Neville today... As most United fans have forgotten how good they were once and only find him a liability to them today when they lose... lol...</p>
              <p>Sadly, the same will happen to Gerrard if he stays...</p>

              <p>For his sake, he should probably have left for a certain Barcelona, Real Madrid or even Chelsea.</p>
              <p>But for Liverpool's sake, he sacrificed himself and stayed, thankfully. We'd be further down in the league if not for this fella.</p>
              <p>Quite sad to see his greatness not realised, no thanks to the lack of great players in the club currently.</p>

              <p>Henry was wanted by Chelsea a year ago before he got transfer to Barca for 16 Million Pounds. Chelsea offer 50 Million</p>
              <p>Flamani left on a free</p>
              <p>Merida left on a free</p>
              <p>Viera was sold for only like 9 million i think</p>
              <p>Adebayor is good business though. Toure too</p>
              <p>The highest offer he ever got for a player is probably just 25 Million for Ade right?</p>

              <p>Oh... I don't recalled Chelsea offering $50m for him though but the very least he sold an ageing Henry for $5m more than what he paid for him after having used him for a few years... and I doubt Wenger would want to sell to a fellow London / premier league club and a challenger to them for the title as well...</p>
              <p>On Flamani and Merida leaving on a free (though I belief they will get something for Merida) I am not sure also how it got to that stage... Cos on both occasion, Wenger claims they have agreed to sign verbally but ended up leaving on the cheap...</p>
              <p>I thought Viera deal was good business... Cos he was getting old and Fab was coming up and ready to take over... And in order to keep him, they must let him play. </p>
              <p>And in terms or $, I belief its true, $25m was the highest... But some players sold was not of his choice... Just that the players wanted to leave... It terms of value, I would say Anelka was the highest cos it happens at a time when $20m was a lot... compare to today...  </p>
