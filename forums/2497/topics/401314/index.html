              <h2>JEROME BOATENG `SET FOR CITY MOVE</h2>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Germany defender Jerome Boateng has confirmed he will sign for 
              Manchester City before departing for the World Cup in South Africa.</p>
              <p>A £10.46million (12.5million euro) move has appeared on the cards
               for several weeks now, and the 21-year-old told Bild magazine it will 
              be wrapped up in the coming days.</p>
              <p>"I am going to sign on (for City) before leaving for the World 
              Cup and the deal will be completed," he said.</p>
              <p>"It has been decided that I am moving there."</p>
              <p>Boateng confirmed City manager Roberto Mancini had visited him in
               Hamburg and talked him into the move.</p>
              <p>"He came with two representatives to Hamburg and we chatted for 
              one or two hours," said Boateng.</p>
              <p>"He convinced me to make the transfer. He believes that I will 
              definitely need a few months to get settled in once in England, but that
               he sees so much potential in me that he will improve me.</p>
              <p>"Even if many people say that I am going to struggle to make the 
              breakthrough, I am confident that I will.</p>
              <p>"I am not afraid of anybody."</p>
              <p>Boateng is keen to leave Germany, where he says his family is 
              being hounded by the media after his half-brother Kevin-Prince's foul on
               Michael Ballack in the FA Cup final ruled the Germany captain out of 
              the World Cup.</p>
              <p>Jerome could come up against his sibling in Germany's final group
               game against Ghana since Kevin-Prince recently switched allegiances, 
              which was permissible due to a parental link with the African nation.</p>
              <p>That game is already taking on a new significance due to 
              Kevin-Prince's tackle on the Chelsea midfielder, but Boateng does not 
              like the way the media have been shadowing his family members wherever 
              they go.</p>
              <p>"It disturbs me the way our family name is being dragged around 
              in public and my family is not being left in peace," he said.</p>
              <p>"It is not on that my big brother George suddenly has cameras on 
              his doorstep and he is being forced to stay indoors.</p>
              <p>"This has overstepped the mark. It has been ridiculous."</p>
              <p>Boateng has been on international duty with Germany in their 
              training camps in Sicilia and Sudtirol and will only get to spend a few 
              days at home from Friday before jetting out to South Africa, but the 
              reports he has received each time he has called home have disturbed him.</p>
              <p>He even called the police to ask them to remove photographers and
               reporters from his family home, but the answer he received shocked him 
              even further.</p>
              <p>"They said I have just got to live with that, being a Boateng," 
              he reported.</p>
              <p>"That has gone too far. That is not on. What is the world coming 
              to when my family cannot go out for a coffee or my brother cannot play 
              with his children in the garden peacefully?"</p>
              <p></p>
