Before signing for the Reds this summer, though, potential suitors were always turned away, and the player's revealed today that Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal were among those told to look elsewhere...<br><br>Fernando Torres revealed today  that, had things gone differently, he may now be wearing a different Premier League shirt.<br><br>The Liverpool ace turned down offers from Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal in seasons past before finally moving away from Atletico Madrid to pastures new.<br><br>"Offers came in from Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United, but at the time I preferred to stay with Atletico," he told LiverpoolFC.tv.<br><br>The striker, who made his first team debut at 17 before becoming Atleti captain at 19, has no regrets about his decision.<br><br>"I've improved a great deal as a player since joining Liverpool, my movement improving with the time I've spent here," he added.<br><br>El NiÃ±o had never played a European match before facing Toulouse with Liverpool, having endured the barren years with Atletico that saw the rojiblancos miss out on continental competition throughout his entire tenure.<br><br>Of course, they qualified for the UEFA Cup via the Intertoto this season, but Torres left the club before he could take part.<br><br>Presumably, though, the mouth-watering prospect of Champions League football with Liverpool will prove a more than adequate consolation.<br><br>"Everybody wants to play in Europe and be named amongst the greats," he said.<br><br>"That's why I came here: for the challenge, not the money. I want the chance to win things and believe that I can do that with Liverpool.<br><br>"The chance to play in the Champions League and with great players is what matters. I aim to contribute goals."<br><br>Torres has scored three times in five Premiership appearances for the Anfield side since his 30 million euro transfer this summer.<br></div>

It's hard to say if he would have had the same bright start at any of the other clubs mentioned.</div>
