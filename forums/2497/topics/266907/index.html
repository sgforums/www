'My team is a good tactical team but we cannot play in those conditions.'<br><br>Khalef's goal combined with Thailand's fickle weather to ruin the hosts' hopes of a better start.<br><br>The expansive Rajamangala stadium was less than half full after the city was drenched by a tropical storm that caused flash flooding in the surrounding suburbs and kept thousands of potential spectators away.<br><br>The pitch had been badly soaked, preventing both teams from developing any fluency and they resorted to long-range shots on goal to try and break the deadlock in the second half.<br><br>'It was difficult, the state of the pitch made it hard to control the ball and we lost it in midfield a lot,' Charnwit Polcheewin said.<br><br>Iraq had the better of the first half but went behind early to a hotly disputed penalty converted by Sutee Suksomkit.<br><br>Thailand's chief playmaker Datsakorn Thonglao caught the Iraq defence napping in the sixth minute when he flicked the ball to his teammate Kiatisuk Senamuang who fell in the penalty box after making light contact with Ali Rehema.<br><br>Referee Kwon Jong-chul waved away the Iraqi protests before Sutee stepped up to the spot and coolly slotted home.<br><br>Iraq were unlucky not to draw level when midfielder Salih Al Sadwn executed a brilliant bicycle kick that Kosin Hathairattanakool tipped onto the bar.<br><br>Kosin pulled off another diving save from Sadwn but was powerless to stop the Iraqis from equalising in the 31st minute when Khalef climbed above two defenders to connect with a Sadwn free-kick and head the ball into the back of the net.<br><br>Neither side could break through in the second half as the conditions began to make the pitch even more slippery as they settled for a point each.<br><br>'We did not want to play a long-ball game, but football is like this sometimes,' Vieira said of Iraq's tactics and the rain.<br><br>Australia and Oman, who are also in Group A, play their opening match at the same ground on Sunday.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Match Summary THA IRA<br>90' Datsakorn Thonglao is awarded a yellow card for unsportsmanlike behaviour  1 1<br>72' Suree Sukka is awarded a yellow card for unsportsmanlike behaviour  1 1<br>59' Nirut Surasiang is awarded a yellow card for unsportsmanlike behaviour  1 1<br>51' Haythem Khadim Taher is awarded a yellow card for unsportsmanlike behaviour  1 1<br>32' Younis Khalef scores a goal  1 1<br>23' Kosin Hathairattanakool is awarded a yellow card for unsportsmanlike behaviour  1 0<br>6' Sutee Suksomkit takes a penalty kick goal  1 0<br>Match Information<br>Stadium: Rajamangala Stadium<br>Attendance:<br>Match Time: 13:35 UK<br>Referee: Jong-chul Kwon<br><br>Teams<br>Thailand                                  Iraq<br>18 Kosin Hathairattanakool    N Sabri 22<br>4 Jetsada Jitsawad                 B Abbas 3<br>6 Nataporn Phanrit                 H Abdul Amir 14<br>5 Niweat Siriwong                  Jasem Mohamed Gholam 2<br>2 Suree Sukka                        Ali Rehema 15<br>9 Therdsak Chaiman              Nashat Akram 5<br>10 Tawan Sripan                    Mahdi Ajeel Karim 18<br>12 Nirut Surasiang                 H Khadim Taher 19<br>7 Datsakorn Thonglao           Hawar Tahir Mulla Mohammed 11<br>13 Kiatisuk Senamuang         Salih Salih Sadir 6<br>17 Sutee Suksomkit              Younis Khalef 10<br>Substitutes<br>1 Weera Koedpudsa             Ahmed Ali 1<br>22 Narit Taweekul                 Mohammed Kassid 23<br>3 Patiparn Phetphun            Nabeel Abbas 20<br>24 Apichet Puttan                 Haidar Abdul Razzaq 12<br>16 Kiatprawut Saiwaew       Khaldon Ibrahim 4<br>28 Natthaphomg Samana     Ali Abbas 7<br>20 Hadthporn Suwan           Ahmed Abid Ali 8<br>19 Pichitpong Choeichew     Muhamed Karrar 13<br>21 Teerasil Dangda              Q Munir 24<br>8 Suchao Nutnum                Ahmed Manajid 16<br>23 Pipat Thonkanya             Mohammad Nasir 9<br>14 Teerathep Winothai        L Saleh 17<br>Substitutions<br>S Nutnum for T Chaiman (72)<br>Q Munir for S Sadir (66)<br><br>T Winothai for K Senamuang (72)<br>M Karrar for N Akram (90)<br><br>T Dangda for S Suksomkit (86)<br><br>Yellow Cards<br>Kosin Hathairattanakool (23)<br>Haythem Khadim Taher (51)<br><br>Nirut Surasiang (59)<br><br>Suree Sukka (72)<br><br>Datsakorn Thonglao (90)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Japan 1-1 Qatar: Late equaliser denies holders<br><br>HANOI, July 9 (Reuters) - Uruguay-born Sebastian Quintana fired a dramatic late equaliser to earn Qatar a 1-1 draw against holders Japan in their Asian Cup opener on Monday.<br><br>Naohiro Takahara's close-range strike after 61 minutes had looked good enough for Japan until Quintana's deflected free kick flew into the top corner in the 88th minute.<br><br>'We were careless!' Japan coach Ivica Osim fumed after his side's failure to kill off the game. 'This result could make it difficult for us. The players have got to learn to turn style into substance.'<br><br>Eintracht Frankfurt striker Takahara clinically tucked in Yasuyuki Konno's flicked cross with a left-foot volley for his 20th goal in 48 internationals.<br><br>But Japan were undone after Yuki Abe's clumsy foul on Quintana, who blasted the subsequent free kick past Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi from 25 metres with the help of a deflection.<br><br>Japan, bidding for a third straight Asian Cup title, trail Vietnam in Group B after the co-hosts' 2-0 win over United Arab Emirates at the weekend.<br><br>Even a red card shown in stoppage time to Hussain Yaser failed to dampen the joy of Qatar coach Dzemaludin Musovic, who was also ordered down the tunnel for protesting the decision.<br><br>'Of course Japan won't be happy with the result,' said Musovic, who was assistant to Osim when he led Yugoslavia to the quarter-finals of the 1990 World Cup.<br><br>'But we deserved to take a point and I think we can be a danger to any team in the tournament now.'<br><br>Yaser will be banned for Qatar's game against Vietnam on Thursday while Musovic could also face sanction pending an AFC disciplinary meeting.<br><br>Japan playmaker Shunsuke Nakamura said Qatar's last-gasp equaliser had shocked the holders, who never really hit their stride in Hanoi's clinging humidity.<br><br>'We were in control and then it was just a sense of 'ugh!' when they scored,' Nakamura told Reuters.<br><br>'We need to learn to finish the game off with a second goal.'<br><br>The Celtic midfielder added: 'Abe feels gutted right now after the foul but we'll bounce back.'<br><br>Japan face UAE in their second game on Friday.<br></div>

Italy started the World Cup badly and they ended up winning it so it's not the team that starts fast, it's the team that's there at the final,' Neill told reporters after a training session on Tuesday.<br><br>'We'll correct the mistakes we made the other day and focus on this game and look for a draw or a win in the next game and hopefully move on.'<br><br>Neill admitted the Socceroos had been lucky to get a point out of their match with Oman but that the result had only strengthened their resolve to raise their game.<br><br>'It was a great slap in the face for us because I think a lot of people back home thought we were going to walk it,' he said.<br><br>'We got out of jail but the most important thing is that we learn from it.'<br><br>Australia's biggest concern is how to cope with the heat and humidity of southeast Asia. The players all struggled against Oman on Sunday and were given a day off training on Monday to recover.<br><br>They were back on the practice pitch on Tuesday but trained in the morning when the temperatures are not as high as they will be when they play their next game against Iraq on Friday.<br><br>'This is our most important game. If we get a win, it definitely puts pressure on the other teams and more importantly puts one foot in the next round,' Neill said.<br><br>'We're not going to be able to go 1-0 down too often and come back, so we've got to make sure we score the first goal, and perhaps take the tactics that Oman did and just sit back and make the other team break us down.'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Viduka hails tactical switch</strong></span><br>Mark Viduka believes Australia improved in their opening AFC Asian Cup Group A clash with Oman when the veteran striker was joined in attack by Socceroos legend John Aloisi.<br><br>The pre-tournament favourites looked on course for a shock defeat to the Gulf side, who led through a Badar Mubarak goal before substitute Tim Cahill rescued his side with a later equalizer.<br><br>Australia will once again face Middle Eastern opponents when they tackle Iraq in their second game on Friday in Group A, which sees all four sideÂ’s level on one point from the opening round of fixtures after Iraq shared a 1-1 draw with Thailand.<br>Against Oman, the 31-year-old Viduka was ploughing a lone furrow up front throughout the first half with Harry Kewell, returning from a long-term injury, playing in a supporting role.<br><br>Consequently chances were few and things only really improved when Aloisi was brought on at the break to partner the Newcastle man in attack.<br><br>"I think we all looked very comfortable when we put two strikers up front, I thought we attacked a lot better than we did in the first half," said Viduka.<br><br>"We changed formation and went 4-4-2 with John (Aloisi) up beside me, which made it easier as it gave the midfielders an extra man to pick out.<br><br>"We certainly didnÂ’t want to start in that manner, with that result. But maybe we needed it to remind us that it is not that easy.<br>"It could have gone very badly for us, Schwarz (Mark Schwarzer) made some unbelievable saves and kept us in the game."<br>VidukaÂ’s team-mate Vince Grella believes the hot and humid conditions took their toll on the players against Oman, but is confident Australia can improve against Iraq.<br><br>The Torino man struggled along with many of his team-mates in the sticky Bangkok climate and will likely have to face similar conditions on Friday, with Australia tackling Jorvan VieiraÂ’s side at the same time as they did Oman.<br><br>"We will try to freshen up the legs and look for a better performance. Australia can only improve in the next game," he said.<br><br>"I think it is a problem with the physical condition, but they are hard conditions to play in. Until you are on the pitch and feel it, it is hard to explain.<br><br>"It is not excuse each player knows what they have done good and what they havenÂ’t done as good and we need honesty and we will be okay."<br></div>

And then we tried to anticipate clearly with the ability of Indonesian players.'<br><br>The home team had struck first in the 14th minute after midfielder Utina threaded a defence-splitting pass through to Budi Sudarsono, who chested the ball beyond the goalkeeper and slotted home from inside the penalty area.<br><br>The visitors then drew level in the 27th minute after a cross from the right ricocheted off several players before Sayed Mahmood Jalal tapped in from close range.<br><br>Late into the second half Bahrain hit the crossbar and their coach Milan Macala said his team had not won because they had missed a number of decent opportunities.<br><br>'That is the reason we lost the game', Macala told gathered reporters and also complained about the quality of the training pitch his team had to use.<br><br>The win marks revenge for Indonesia, who were beaten 3-1 by Bahrain in the 2004 Asian Cup in China.<br><br>Kolev played down injury concerns over captain Ponaryo Astaman, who limped off in the second half, saying the problem was an old one and hopefully after treatment he would be fit.<br><br>South Korea and Saudi Arabia are the other teams in the group.
