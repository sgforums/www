              <p><span style="color: #333399;">Worrying: Steven Gerrard reportedly had his car smashed up</span></p>
              <p class="story"> </p>
              <p class="story"><strong>Steven Gerrard's father has revealed how a gangster threatened to shoot the Liverpool and England midfielder but was frightened off by a 'fixer' asked to deal with the problem. In a letter read to the jury at Lincoln Crown Court, Paul Gerrard said the gangster - reportedly known as 'The Psycho' - threatened to shoot his son in the legs and tried to extort money from him. It is alledged the Liverpool player's car was also smashed up and he was chased home from training.</strong></p>
              <p class="story">However, the threats reportedly stopped when Gerrard's father was introduced to 'underworld fixer' John Kinsella, who is said to have put the frighteners on the gangster and his associates. The letter written by Gerrard's father read: "I would like to say that in 2001 my son Steven was being terrorised by a notorious Liverpool gangster known as 'The Psycho' who was threatening to maim my son by shooting him in the legs.</p>
              <p class="story">"Also he was trying to extort a large amount of money from Steven. We immediately contacted the police and asked for protection. "This went on for a long time, during which Steven's car was smashed up and the gangster chased him while he was driving home from training. "This was one of the worst times of our lives. It was really having a bad effect on his career. Liverpool FC provided security for Steven, but the threats still kept coming.</p>
              <p class="story">"We were introduced by a friend to John Kinsella. I told him about the ongoing threats and violence. John then reassured me and my family he would resolve our nightmare. "From that point until this day we have never had any more problems from the Liverpool underworld. Steven and I have total respect for John for what he did for us." The evidence came about as Kinsella and three other men appeared in court accused of taking part in a £41,000 robbery, a charge Kinsella has denied.</p>
              <p class="story"><span style="color: #000000;">According to the Sun,</span> Kinsella said he was in the area as an 'enforcer', using the Gerrard incident as an example, and said: "He was demanding money and threatening to shoot Steven in the legs. "He ambushed him outside his apartment in Southport. Steven was given armed police protection because they feared for his safety that much. "I took steps. I told him to stop it. He followed my advice."</p>
