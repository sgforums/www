            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Tottenham striker Darren Bent has brushed off criticism of his Â£16.5million price tag - and feels Barcelona got Thierry Henry 'on the cheap'.</strong><br><br>Bent's move from Charlton was confirmed on Friday for a fee that eclipses by Â£500,000 that for Arsenal legend Henry's switch to Barca.<br><br>Despite his potential, the 23-year-old has yet to establish himself in the England team - but Bent is not concerned by figures.<br><br><strong>He told BBC Radio Five Live: "To be fair I think Barca got Thierry on the cheap as I'd have put him in the Â£30million bracket, so it's surprising he went for so little money.</strong><br><br>"It's nothing to do with me. Charlton put the price tag on my head, I'm just grateful that Spurs took it.<br><br>"I was disappointed to leave Charlton - I had a great time there but I wish them all the best."<br><br>Bent decided to leave the Addicks following their relegation from the Premier League - but he is joining a club where competition among forwards is already great.<br><br>Dimitar Berbatov, Robbie Keane and Jermain Defoe give the club a wealth of striking talent and Bent expects a tough fight for his place.<br><br>He added: "They have several internationals there already, and as long as I can go there and fight the cause and help Tottenham get into the top bracket then I'll be delighted.<br><br>"I think it's a bit unfair to talk about me and Berbatov because Robbie and Jermain were both fantastic last season.<br><br>"It's going to be difficult and I don't expect to walk into the team but I know the challenge and if I'm firing, Berbatov's firing and Robbie's firing and Jermain's firing, that can only be good for Tottenham."<br><br>Bent, who turned down West Ham, is particularly excited about the challenge of playing for a club capable of pushing for a top-four place and competing in Europe.<br><br>He said: "They are a massive club and in the last two years they have been brilliant.<br><br>"They have finished fifth and then fifth, hopefully this year we can do the same or if not we can break into the top four.<br><br>"That's what I'm there to do and hopefully that's what will happen. I'm there to improve and hopefully I can improve with Tottenham."<br><br>On his decision to reject the Hammers, he added: "It does become difficult but money isn't everything.<br><br>"You've got to be focused, you've got to be a strong character and know what you want and I want to play at the top level. I want play in Europe. And for me that was Tottenham."</div>
