            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: darkblue;">Premier League has risen well above Serie A in Italy and La Liga in Spain over the past decade to become the richest league across Europe.</span> </span><br><br>The extraordinary globalisation of the Premier League could make English football the first world sport to earn more money from their supporters abroad than at home. An estimated worldwide audience of one billion watched Manchester United play Arsenal on Saturday and, if growth rates continue, the revenue from overseas broadcast rights will eventually exceed those paid by companies for the domestic rights.</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/graphics/2007/11/06/sfnfro106.jpg"><br><span class="small">Truly global: an estimated worldwide audience of one billion watched Arsenal host Manchester United </span><br><br>And a new study, soon to be published by Deloitte, will show that the Premier League have risen well above Serie A in Italy and La Liga in Spain over the past decade to become the richest league across Europe by Â€1 billion (Â£0.7 billion).<br><br>"The Premier League has just accelerated from every other league in the world," said Dan Jones, a partner in the sports business group at Deloitte. "I can think of no other example of the overseas rights overtaking the domestic rights. I don't think it is inevitable but I have heard people in the industry predict that the next time around [in 2010] the overseas rights will match those domestically. You only have to look at the world population to see the potential for growth."<br><br>Premier League games are broadcast to 600 million homes in 202 countries across Europe, Asia, Australasia, Oceania, Africa, the Americas and the Middle East. And, after doubling the value of those rights this year to Â£625 million, there is a feeling they could eventually be worth more than the Â£1.7 billion currently being paid for the domestic rights by Sky and Setanta.<br><br>The vast potential only underlines the likelihood of more foreign ownership of Premier League clubs and of kick-off times eventually being changed to suit fans abroad. The huge audience for Saturday's lunchtime match was boosted by it being screened during the evening across the Far East.<br><br>The broadcaster for much of the Asian market is ESPN Star Sports, the media giant jointly owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Walt Disney. Between now and Christmas, Liverpool and Arsenal will play just one match each at 3pm on a Saturday, while Chelsea and Manchester United will play at the traditional time twice apiece. The recent NFL game at Wembley has also opened eyes to the idea of playing domestic matches in different countries.<br><br>The Premier League are well aware of the interest abroad, but reject any suggestion that the game could get taken away from the traditional supporter. "It is the whole package which is popular," a spokesman said, "the quality on the pitch, state-of-the-art stadiums as well as the fact that so many nations are represented by the players. But it is also important to remember that one of the biggest selling points of the league is full stadiums and the passionate support of fans in England. That remains the cornerstone of the league."<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Double your money<br>The global rise of the Premier League Overseas rights  </strong> </span><br><br>2001-2004 .............
