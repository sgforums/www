              <p class="first"><strong>Below-par Manchester United fell to a first league 
              defeat of the season as bottom-of-the-table Wolves proved they are not 
              certainties for relegation.</strong></p>
              <p>United led after three minutes as Nani drilled home inside the near post after turning George Elokobi inside-out.</p>
              <p>But Elokobi headed in soon after with United's defence sleeping, Matt Jarvis executing a short-corner routine.</p>
              <p>Kevin Doyle then glanced in just before the break, after which the visitors failed to carve out any clear chances.</p>
              <p>Not
               only will Wolves' hopes of avoiding relegation soar with a fine win 
              that puts them only two points behind 17th-placed Wigan with a game in 
              hand, but United's Premier League title rivals will be seriously buoyed 
              now that their daunting 29-match unbeaten run is over.</p>
              <p>Manager 
              Sir Alex Ferguson looked puzzled with his United team as they failed to 
              usurp the record of his 1999 Treble winners with a display that 
              deteriorated rapidly after Nani's early opener.</p>
              <p>Though Wolves 
              remain bottom by virtue of an inferior goal difference to Birmingham and
               West Ham, they have now beaten five of the top seven - United, 
              Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool and Sunderland - this season.</p>
              <p>United appeared to pay the price for the absence of 
                  
                       
                      
                      
                          
                          <a class="inlineText" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/9388794.stm">in-form England captain Rio Ferdinand, whose calf injury suffered in the warm-up</a> meant Jonny Evans was pressed into action.</p>
              <p>Instant drama ensued as Wolves appealed for a penalty as Brazilian 
              right-back Rafael swept away any danger from Jarvis with his upper body 
              after 40 seconds.</p>
              <p>But United took the lead soon after as Nani showcased the superior side to his inconsistent game.</p>
              <p>Breaking
               into the right side of Wolves' penalty area, he played with Elokobi 
              over and over while ignoring both Dimitar Berbatov and Wayne Rooney as 
              they lurked in the centre with arms aloft.</p>
              <p>In a flash of movement
               he then sent Elokobi the wrong way before cutting inside to power a 
              ruthless left-footed shot past Wayne Hennessey at the Welshman's near 
              post.</p>
              <p>The visitors could have added an instant second, but Rooney
               screwed an ugly attempt high into Hennessey's arms after Berbatov 
              cleverly found the unmarked England striker.</p>
              <p>Yet United may have 
              paid the price for overconfidence as they completely lost their 
              concentration after 10 minutes to let Wolves back in.</p>
              <p>As Jarvis took a quick corner Rafael jogged into his penalty area with his back to the ball and United utterly disorganised.</p>
              <p>And
               when it was quickly returned to Jarvis, with United failing to mark 
              properly, his clean cross was met with a full-blooded header by former 
              Colchester defender Elokobi, who had to stretch his neck back to add 
              power.</p>
              <p>Rooney then just failed to find Berbatov as the strong wind took his searching long pass out of his strike partner's stride.</p>
              <p>Berbatov,
               who has scored 13 goals in his past nine Premier League appearances, 
              then brilliantly found space in the box with a series of flicks but his 
              weak shot caused Hennessey no trouble.</p>
              <p>But, after Nani went close
               with a 28th-minute free kick, Wolves dug deep into their resources to 
              turn the tide as they began to control the rest of the half.</p>
              <p>Impressive
               debutant Jamie O'Hara, on loan from Tottenham, nearly squeezed the ball
               home at the near post but alert 40-year-old goalkeeper Edwin van der 
              Sar improvised to kick the ball away for a corner.</p>
              <p>Nenad Milijas 
              almost put Wolves ahead when his 37th-minute free-kick from 20 yards 
              nearly crept inside stranded Van der Sar's far post, but the wicked 
              deflection off Nemanja Vidic's head took it just wide.</p>
              <p>But his free-kick three minutes later, from wide on the right, proved a crucial assist.</p>
              <p>Wolves
               team-mates Kevin Doyle and Elokobi both battled to get a headed touch 
              as the ball flew into the net, although Doyle insisted his was the last 
              as they celebrated in front of the joyous home fans at Molineux.</p>
              <p>United
               did have a chance just before the break but, with Ferguson fuming on 
              the sidelines, Nani headed Rafael's right-wing cross over the bar.</p>
              <p>Midfield veteran Paul Scholes replaced the ineffective Michael Carrick for the second half.</p>
              <p>But,
               for once, his enduring class failed to instigate a real sense of 
              urgency for United, although he did come close to connecting with an 
              early low cross.</p>
              <p>Wolves, however, looked just as likely to extend their lead as United wasted the ball when well-placed in advanced areas.</p>
              <p>Jarvis was a constant threat, and jinked well inside Rafael in the penalty area to work a smart pull-back for O'Hara.</p>
              <p>But the midfielder needed more power behind his side-footer as Vidic cleared the danger.</p>
              <p>Rafael
               then needed medical attention as he suffered an alarming-looking 
              dislocated finger, although he was able to continue after it was reset.</p>
              <p>Chris Smalling came on for injured Evans, before Mexican forward Javier Hernandez replaced Berbatov.</p>
              <p>But Hernandez - United's late saviour on many occasions this season - could not work his magic as a substitute once more.</p>
              <p>After
               O'Hara was replaced by Kevin Foley, seemingly to protect him from 
              receiving a second yellow card, Nani then showed his more frustrating 
              side as he shot wildly into the crowd with a host of team-mates well 
              placed.</p>
              <p>And United's desperation became clear when Scholes was 
              booked for handling - rather than heading - a late attempt to steer a 
              cross past Hennessey, although the keeper made sure of the save anyway 
              as Wolves sealed the three points despite five minutes of added time.</p>

              <p>I think Man U away form last season was better lol because they got many wins, compared to this season, only 3.... The rest are either fighting, scrappy or undeserved (in which conceded their lead 1st) draws.</p>
              <p>So, when was their Man U last BPL away defeat? And when was last Man U away win with more than 2 or 3 goal margin? This BPL season don't have at all, all lucky wins (if not, then draw) Their season 3 goal margin win was against a Turkish team in UCL.</p>

              <p>In a way, the lost couldn't have come at a better time... lol.</p>
              <p>I know, it's always better to win but if you got to lose, this week was the best timing in a way. I bet Mancini didn't want United to lose last night, probably a draw would be better so that it would have made his motivational speech a lot more easier for next week...</p>
              <p>Beat Man Utd, be the first team to beat them and we will always be remembered... And you can bet their players would probably have an extra determination on the pitch too wanting to be the first club to beat their local rival... But now, that extra motivation is no more, it would be just another derby match as usual...</p>
              <p>And for the United players... They will be hoping to make up for the lost as the usually do at the expense of City... So they will be more on their toes rather than taking things easy...</p>
              <p>Like I said, it couldn't have come at a better time... Better Wolves than City right?... lol.</p>

              <p>I feel OM can also be a threat too given they won the title in the 09/10 season.</p>
              <p>Heck, I wonder what is the EPL's standard up to these days? I'm interested to watch other leagues like LFP or the Lega Calcio to be honest and I seriously wonder they really kelong or what this kind of team also can lose.</p>
              <p> In the LFP I believe teams would have took advantage of complacency of other teams and man u would have lost to be honest.</p>
              <p>EPL you can aimai also nevermind you still can win but in Liga BBVA when teams like Barcelona can sense you aimai they eat you up.</p>

              <p>Liga only got Messi &amp; Ronaldo to hold their teams. If there is no Ronaldo, I think Barcelona will always win unless Msssi goes other clubs.</p>
              <p>Well, OM will take on Man U in last 16 tie. Lets see how manu perform in away from home for 1st leg tie. OM had beaten 2nd string Chelsea earlier on.</p>

              <p>Doubt so. They always perform their best in UCL (except the poor defending against Munchen last seaosn which led to elimination in quarter-finals). So far, they had only drawn 2 times, the rest all wins.</p>

              <p>He was impressive at Portsmouth last season and now at Wolves, he is impressive again!</p>
              <p>Some team should seriously buy him for their midfield... honestly I dont think Spurs can give him any slot in the starting lineup... so why he should seriously find a club to find first team football.</p>
              <p>Maybe Villa should have a look at him... maybe can pair him up with the maokun guy...</p>
