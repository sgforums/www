            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/07_02/TevezLonLite1807_228x305.jpg"><br><br><strong>Carlos Tevez's protracted transfer to Manchester United took yet another dramatic twist last night when Kia Joorabchian issued a High Court writ against West Ham. The Iranian businessman, who maintains he owns the 'economic rights' to the player, initiated legal proceedings in an attempt to force through Tevez's Â£30million move to Old Trafford. </strong><br><br>The move came after another chaotic day in the long-running saga which began with a recommendation from FIFA that the matter be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, something West Ham agreed to Â— but Joorabchian did not.<br><br>Instead, he issued a writ against West Ham for breach of contract and damages, fearing that should he agree to take the dispute to CAS, the matter would not be settled by the close of the transfer window on August 31. He is also unwilling for the evidence to be heard behind closed doors, which would have been the outcome if the case had gone to Lausanne, as he is keen to prove he has nothing to hide.<br><br>Joorabchian's grievance is over West Ham's decision to tear up their contract with his companies, MSI and Just Sports Inc, for Tevez after the Premier League fined the club Â£5.5million for breaching rules regarding third party ownership of players. Doing so allowed West Ham, who retain Tevez's registration, to continue playing the Argentina forward for the remaining three games of last season Â— with his goalscoring contribution proving vital to their Premier League survival.<br><br>Lawyer Graham Shear, representing MSI and Just Sports Inc, said in a statement: "I can confirm that the companies have today begun High Court proceedings against West Ham. "This afternoon, a High Court writ was served on the football club's solicitors. The companies seek the court's intervention to compel West Ham to release the registration of Carlos Tevez in accordance with contracts entered into between the parties. "We are asking the court to intervene, so that Carlos Tevez can be registered to play with Manchester United, as soon as possible."<br><br>Should the High Court find in favour of Joorabchian, it could open the door for Sheffield United Â— relegated while West Ham survived Â— to pursue a compensation claim of their own. Having been thwarted in their attempts to be reinstated to the Premier League, the Yorkshire club will doubtless be very interested observers of the High Court case Â— especially if it rules that the contract between West Ham and Joorabchian effectively remained intact as Tevez played on for the crucial final three games of the season.<br><br>That the saga is set to go before a judge has much to do with the Premier League's insistence that West Ham, not Joorabchian, must be seen to be the financial beneficiaries of Tevez's transfer.<br></div>
