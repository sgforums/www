              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">SOL CAMPBELL has bitten back at Newcastle fans who branded him a 'fat belly'.</h2>
              <p>The ex-England defender, 35, blamed Toon's training kit for making him look tubby.</p>
              <p>Campbell, signed on a free from Arsenal this summer, was slated by Magpies fans over an unflattering training ground photograph.</p>
              <p>Supporters labelled him the 'Hog on the Tyne' and fear he will be a fat lot of good.</p>
              <p>But Campbell said: "I'm a naturally big guy. I can't rush my conditioning, otherwise trying too much too quickly could result in injuries.</p>
              <p>"It's pathetic. I'd been training for three days, just three days! I am three weeks behind everyone in pre-season. Don't they know I have just got married and been on honeymoon?</p>
              <p>"I accept the picture wasn't flattering and I do need to catch up on my level of fitness.</p>
              <p>"But the training kit was not very flattering and showed up all sorts."</p>
              <p>After signing a one-year deal worth £30,000 a week, Campbell hopes to make his first Toon appearance in Saturday's friendly at Rangers.</p>
              <p>And boss Chris Hughton has refused to rule him out of the trip to Manchester United to open the season on August 16.</p>
              <p>But the former Spurs star is not so confident.</p>
              <p>He said: "The season starts in just two weeks and I really need three to four weeks to get back to peak fitness.</p>
              <p>"My message to all the knockers is I am knuckling down and want to play with a great club. Then you can judge me."</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #888888;"><em>Hatem Ben Arfa</em></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Marseille's French international attacking midfielder Hatem Ben Arfa is set to move to Premier League side Newcastle after agreement was reached between the clubs with a view to a one-year paying loan, club sources told AFP on Monday.</strong></p>
              <p>The two clubs have agreed a loan deal for a season worth 1.2 million euros with the option to buy.</p>
              <p>Newcastle bosses will now begin discussions with the player and his representatives over the personal details of his contract.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old - capped seven times - had been targeted by German club Hoffenheim and Russian outfit Rubin Kazan, but the Franco-Tunisian player preferred to try his luck in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>It will be his third club in three years after Lyon - where he won four league titles - and Marseille, who won the French championship last season.</p>

              <p>Boss Chris Hughton wants the winger to bolster his side for Toon's first season back in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>But the French giants are unwilling to sell and a season-long loan deal appears unlikely.</p>
              <p>Marseille club president Jean-Claude Dassier said: "Hatem is part of our squad and will remain so.</p>
              <p>"There is no serious and solid offer from Newcastle at the moment."</p>

              <p>A source said: "Marseille were playing games after saying he could go. He is desperate to play in the Premier League."</p>

              <p>The Algerian, 23, who joins in a £1.3million deal, played every minute of his country's three World Cup games this summer.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">NEWCASTLE are ready to sell defender Steven Taylor after he rejected their latest contract offer.</h2>
              <p>The 24-year-old has been transfer-listed with the two sides well apart on the financial aspects of the deal.</p>
              <p>A spokesman for the Magpies said: "We can confirm that Steven Taylor is on the transfer list."</p>
              <p>Taylor's current terms expire at the end of the season when he would be able to leave the club on a free transfer.</p>
              <p>As a result, Newcastle have reluctantly decided they may have to cash in on him now.</p>
              <p>However, a statement released on behalf of Taylor and his agent Paul Stretford revealed that the player, who was stunned by the club's move, is keen to resolve the situation.</p>
              <p>The statement read: "Figures released to the media do not accurately reflect the position of either Steven or his agent.</p>
              <p>"Both remain happy to continue negotiations over a new and extended Newcastle United contract.</p>
              <p>"Steven was disappointed and surprised to hear through third parties that the club had decided to transfer list him.</p>
              <p>"He has always given 100 per cent to the club and will continue to do so given the opportunity."</p>
              <p>He said: "To be given a chance to compete against some fantastic sides for a team like Fulham is something I've always dreamed of doing."</p>
              <p>Halliche has picked up 20 caps since his debut against Senegal in May 2008 but has spent most of his two-year spell at Benfica out on loan.</p>
              <p>His arrival will help plug the gap left in defence by Philippe Senderos, who has been ruled out for six months with an Achilles injury.</p>
              <p>Cottagers boss Mark Hughes has already signed £5m Belgian striker Moussa Dembele.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">NEWCASTLE last night transfer-listed Steven Taylor after growing tired of his wage demands.</h2>
              <p>The Tyneside club claim the defender, out of contract next summer, has refused owner Mike Ashley's offer of a four-year deal worth £40,000 a week as he holds out for upwards of £65,000.</p>
              <p>The Toon are desperate to keep the local lad. But they have been angered by Taylor and agent Paul Stretford's stance and reluctantly decided to get rid.</p>
              <p>Ashley hopes to net at least £5million for the 24-year-old centre-half.</p>
              <p>A Toon source said: "Mike believes he has made Steven a very good offer but there has to come a time when enough is enough.</p>
              <p>"The way the club is being run now, the days of paying players massive wages are over. It's not the way it works now."</p>
              <p>However, a spokesman for Taylor insisted: "Figures released to the media do not accurately reflect the position of either Steven or his agent.</p>
              <p>"Both remain happy to continue negotiations over a new and extended contract.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">NEWCASTLE boss Chris Hughton is closing in on a deal for Tottenham striker Robbie Keane.</h2>
              <p>Keane, 30, is a favourite of the ex-Spurs No 2 and White Hart Lane sources were last night claiming the club were finally ready to let the Irishman go.</p>
              <p>The source said: "Spurs would hope for at least £6million and it will be no surprise if the deal was done before deadline day."</p>
              <p>And Hughton is set to tie up one striker deal this morning with Hatem Ben Arfa expected at St James' Park to thrash out terms over a year-long loan from Marseille.</p>
              <p>The Magpies will have an option to buy the France winger, 23, for around £6million next summer.</p>
              <p>Marseille president Jean-Claude Dassier said: "They offered to raise the price for the option to buy if Hatem plays 25 matches."</p>
              <p>The Toon are also in talks with Manchester City over a loan switch for Belgian defender Dedryck Boyata, 19.</p>
              <p>Boyata has made three appearances for City prior to this season.</p>
