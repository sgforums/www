              <p class="font-null">Still swallowing the hurt from Manchester 
              United's elimination by Bayern Munich, Sir <strong>Alex Ferguson was asked if he
               had considered employing Owen Hargreaves against his former club.</strong> <strong>The 
              manager appeared momentarily lost. "Who?"</strong> he replied before explaining 
              with the patience of an exasperated schoolmaster that Hargreaves had not
               been included in the club's Champions League squad when it was 
              announced more than two months ago.</p>
              <p class="font-null">It is increasingly likely that, however keen 
              England might be to take perhaps their most versatile midfielder to 
              South Africa, their single outstanding player of the last World Cup will
               take no part in this one.</p>
              <p class="font-null">A bout of tendonitis 
              that the world's most famous sports surgeon, Richard Steadman, said was 
              the worst he had come across in 35 years means Hargreaves has not played
               competitively for his country in nearly two years. Unless he plays some
               part in the remains of Manchester United's league campaign, Capello 
              will not even consider Hargreaves for his provisional World Cup squad he
               is due to name on 17 May. With just two friendlies before England 
              travel to their base camp near Rustenburg, there is little room for 
              experiment and Ferguson's words were not encouraging.</p>
              <p class="font-null">"It is difficult to say when Owen will be back; he 
              is training well and I had him in the squad for the Chelsea game," he 
              said. "His training performances have been fine but I think at the 
              moment midfield is not an issue for us because we have plenty of 
              alternatives."</p>
              <p class="font-null">England may have fewer options 
              and Hargreaves has just a couple of reserve-team games to his credit. 
              When he was recovering from a broken leg at Bayern, Hargreaves let out 
              his frustration by jumping in his Porsche and driving almost non-stop 
              from Munich to Barcelona. There have been fewer such outlets this time 
              around. After his first taste of reserve-team football at Altrincham, he
               sanguinely described his time in Manchester as "disappointing" and that
               "in a perfect world I would like to play a part in the World Cup".</p>
              <p class="font-null">It is unlikely to be a perfect world and at 29 
              Hargreaves is in danger of being overtaken by a crop of younger 
              midfielders at Old Trafford. The need for goals from midfield is acute. 
              Between them, United's 10 midfielders have scored 20 times and it was a 
              miss at Blackburn by the most successful, Antonio Valencia – who has 
              found the net five times but not at all since December – which Ferguson 
              saw as the pivotal moment of a match that might damn the club's Premier 
              League aspirations.</p>
              <p class="font-null">Curiously, the unit has been
               more prolific in the Champions League where all three of the goals 
              United scored against Bayern in an extraordinary first half came in the 
              contrasting shapes of Darron Gibson and Nani.</p>
              <p class="font-null">And
               it is for this reason that the 22-year-old from Londonderry is so 
              prized by Ferguson. "You saw Gibson's performance against Bayern 
              Munich," he said. "That was his sixth goal of the season [in all 
              competitions] and you cannot dismiss that. It is the kind of 
              contribution we used to get from Paul Scholes. He used to get me 12 to 
              14 goals from midfield all the time and we haven't had a player like 
              that in a while." In fact, the last time Scholes reached double figures 
              was in 2004-05.</p>
              <p class="font-null">"Who is to say if Gibson had 
              been playing all the time where he would be in terms of goals?" Ferguson
               added. "But he is getting recognition now and even the players are 
              commenting on how much he has improved."</p>
              <p class="font-null">Whatever
               their success in chasing a fourth successive title, a feat that Rio 
              Ferdinand said would confirm this Manchester United side as the best 
              English football has ever produced, it is clear that there will be a 
              changing of the guard at Old Trafford come the summer. Whether through 
              instinct – "developing young players is what we are good at" he said 
              recently – or the circumstances of the Glazer regime, Ferguson's 
              attention seems increasingly taken by younger players, especially in the
               shape of his newest signings, Javier Hernandez and Chris Smalling.</p>
              <p class="font-null">On Friday he talked with real enthusiasm about how 
              the teenage Federico Macheda had scored against Chelsea, moving from one
               side of the box to the other and finding the net through pure instinct.
               It was not the voice of a man preparing to ride away into the sunset 
              like John Wayne, one of his favourite actors. About Dimitar Berbatov, 
              who might be the last £30m signing he ever makes, Ferguson was more 
              reticent.</p>
              <p class="font-null">Ferdinand has warned 
              Manchester City that they will always be under pressure until they start
               winning trophies. The England captain, who is still a doubt for 
              Saturday's encounter at Eastlands, although Ryan Giggs expects to 
              recover from a hamstring injury in time, said: "They have got the 
              capacity to be genuine title contenders because they have got so much 
              money and they are targeting the big players. But the first trophy is 
              always the hardest one to win and, until they do that, there will be a 
              lot of pressure on them.</p>
              <p class="font-null">"They reached the 
              Carling Cup semi-final this season but came up against us and they were 
              knocked out of the FA Cup by Stoke, so there is still a bit of work to 
              do. I think that, if they finish in a Champions League spot this season,
               for them that will feel as good as winning a trophy."</p>
