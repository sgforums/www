              <p><strong>Yossi Benayoun has admitted Chelsea's season will be over if they crash out of the Champions League at Manchester United on Tuesday night. </strong></p>
              <p>But the Israel midfielder also claimed completing an historic comeback at Old Trafford would inspire the Blues to go all the way to Wembley.</p>
              <p>Chelsea must overturn Wednesday night's 1-0 quarter-final first-leg defeat to keep alive their last remaining realistic hope of silverware this season.</p>
              <p>History is against them, with United never having lost a European tie after winning the first leg away from home.</p>
              <p>On top of that, only two teams have ever won a Champions League tie having lost the first leg at home.</p>
              <p>With Chelsea 11 points behind United in the Barclays Premier League - but five clear of fifth-placed Tottenham - Benayoun acknowledged their entire campaign rested on Tuesday night's match.</p>
              <p>"Everyone knows - the manager, the players - that we are playing to save our season," he said.</p>
              <p>"It's most likely from here we will finish in the top three or four and be in the Champions League next season. That's almost done.</p>
              <p>"The only thing left is to try to win a trophy and the only trophy we can win is the Champions League. We have to do our best and give everything.</p>
              <p>"If we win this game, it will change everything.</p>
              <p>"I'm sure that, if we beat United, we will go to the end and win the trophy. It is our final on Tuesday."</p>
              <p>He added: "I think we have the belief we can do it despite losing 1-0 at home. We can win there.</p>
              <p>"We know we have to do everything because, if not, it will be our last game in the Champions League.</p>
              <p>"We have to give everything and try our best. Let's hope it will be enough."</p>
              <p>Saturday's Barclays Premier League win over Wigan saw Benayoun come off the bench to make his first Chelsea appearance for more than six months following a serious Achilles injury.</p>
              <p>"When I went on, after a few minutes I found it hard to breathe," the 30-year-old said.</p>
              <p>"I sprinted up and back and just thought, 'Oh my God!'.</p>
              <p>"So I needed a few minutes to recover but that's normal after seven months out."</p>
              <p>Benayoun, who moved to Stamford Bridge from Liverpool last summer, added: "I had a big injury and, since the day I got injured, I've concentrated on getting myself built up and back again.</p>
              <p>"I worked hard and did everything. I'd never been in they gym before I came to Chelsea and I think I've spent the last four months in there working on my own.</p>
              <p>"I might even have got a little bit bigger!</p>
              <p>"I know I'm not ready for 90 minutes but I was happy to play 45."</p>
              <p>That does not mean the Israel captain would not jump at the chance to start against United.</p>
              <p>"I'd be happy if I played five minutes," said Benayoun, who could yet prove the man to get the best out of former Liverpool team-mate Fernando Torres.</p>
              <p>"If the manager asked me to start, I would give everything for as long as I lasted."</p>

              <p><strong>Carlo Ancelotti's mighty gamble on £50million man Fernando Torres backfired as Chelsea crashed out of the Champions League with a 2-1 defeat at Manchester United to place a massive question mark over his future as Blues boss. </strong></p>
              <p>As Sir Alex Ferguson has noted, Roman Abramovich is obsessed by winning this competition.</p>
              <p>As the Russian was in the directors' box, looking down as United emerged triumphant, Javier Hernandez and Park Ji-sung finding the net either side of half-time, it can only be concluded he is not a happy man.</p>
              <p>And with Ancelotti insisting he is under no pressure to play Torres, who began the game but was replaced at half-time by Didier Drogba, the only conclusion to be reached is that he will carry the can for what was so obviously a gross selection error.</p>
              <p>While Torres has now failed to score in 11 Chelsea games, Drogba continues to look a threat. He was the man who briefly threatened to derail United after Ramires was sent off.</p>
              <p>It was a false dawn. Chelsea are staring down the barrel of a trophyless season and Ancelotti will be in the firing line if Abramovich decides to pull the trigger.</p>

              <p><strong>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson insisted the pressure of Fernando Torres's £50m price tag forced manager Carlo Ancelotti to play his misfiring striker as 10-man Chelsea were dumped out of the Champions League at Old Trafford. </strong></p>
              <p>Goals from Javier Hernandez and Park Ji-sung gave Manchester United a 2-1 victory on the night and a comfortable 3-1 aggregate triumph to take them into the semi-finals of Europe's top club competition.</p>
              <p>Didier Drogba netted a second-half equaliser to give Chelsea a glimmer of hope in front of watching owner Roman Abramovich after Ramires had been sent off for a second bookable offence, but the tie hinged on the form of Torres.</p>
              <p>The striker, who had not scored in 817 minutes and 13 matches for club and country before tonight, was substituted at half-time after a torrid 45 minutes which prompted Ancelotti to admit his gamble had failed.</p>
              <p>Asked if he had made a mistake playing Torres instead of Drogba, Ancelotti said: "Maybe. Could be. I told you a lot of times this season I wanted to start with Fernando for this kind of game, these type of tactics.</p>
              <p>"Didier played well in the second half. I wanted to put more pressure up front because we needed to score. Didier was fresh and he could use his power up front. This was the reason I took out Fernando."</p>
              <p>Ferguson, however, believed including Torres had everything to do with money.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: "A lot of people thought Drogba would play. I thought having signed Torres for the money they did they had to play him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>" I wasn't 100 per cent sure but I couldn't see how they could leave Torres out."</p>
              <p>Ferguson, however, supported Chelsea's decision to sign the former Liverpool striker.</p>
              <p>"They had the opportunity to sign Torres and I don't think anyone would have turned it down," Ferguson said. "Everyone said at the time it was fantastic business. You can't criticise him (Ancelotti) for that, it was a good signing. It isn't working at the moment but he is a young man and there are other seasons ahead.</p>
              <p>"Torres has played against us quite a few times and he had a little goal spell at Old Trafford and got a goal at Anfield but we've actually done all right against him.</p>
              <p>"It's made out that he's tortured us. He's a good player but with (Nemanja) Vidic's experience and (Rio) Ferdinand's experience they should be able to handle the best players in the world. They are in that sphere of being top players themselves."</p>
              <p>Ferguson had special praise for 37-year-old Ryan Giggs who had a hand in both United goals, after having made the winner for Wayne Rooney at Stamford Bridge last week.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: "He's incredible, a unique person and player. It's a great contribution and his experience and composure were vital.</p>
              <p>"He's lucky with his physique, he's never carried weight and has got fantastic balance. He looks after himself. He has to, to play at 37 it must be a great sacrifice to do that."</p>
              <p>Carlo Ancelotti, meanwhile, says Chelsea now need to make sure they qualify for next season's Champions League.</p>
              <p>He said: "We are out of the Champions League and this is not good for us. But we have to look forward. We have games to play and to win if possible because obviously we want to play the Champions League next season."</p>
              <p>Ancelotti also blamed midfielder Ramires for an unnecessary red card.</p>
              <p>He added: "He had a yellow card already so it was not good for him. He should have stayed more calm to avoid this."</p>
              <p>On his own future Ancelotti said: "I'm not concerned. I have to work and try to do my best. It is not my decision to stay or not to stay here."</p>

              <p>What's wrong with torres, he doesn't look as sharp and he seems to be lacking confidence. Lost pace? I don't think so.</p>
              <p>Drogba on the other hand seemed like two players on their own last night. Steady turn, good with both feet and still packs power in his shots. Should never drop drogba at all. It might have been different.</p>

              <p>Actually it's also unfair to say that cos Drogba came on fresh when the rest on the field were a little tired already... Had he started the match, maybe he would be ineffective as well?</p>
              <p>Torres seem to need time to get going and the new team mates and their style isn't working yet. And perhaps the weight of his price tag is an added pressure, so much is expected from him from so many... At Liverpool, he just played and nothing is expected... The pressure at Chelsea to deliver is far greater than the easy life he experienced at Pool... So there is a big change for him here and he will need to get use to it asap...</p>
              <p>I still belief Torres will come good, it's just a matter of time... But the Chelsea squad is in serious need of an overhaul if they are going to be a force to be reckon with next season... Lampard is over the hill for a full season player, Malouda also seems not so good anymore, not sure how old is he but he looks like average only these days... And Terry... This guy is a liability to carry along cos he is slow, in movement and reaction. The only thing he is good with is his mouth... Chelsea continue to carry him along will prove to be a problem especially when he gets older by the season... And <span lang="EN-GB">Paulo Ferreria... Not even sure why he is still there and being played... lol.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">One of the concerns I had before last night's match was </span><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB">Benayoun... I must admit, I was a little worried he would start cos he is a tricky player, his movement is something Chelsea don't have in their other players and would be effective against United's defence especially against O'Shea when Rafael is out injured... His understanding with Torres is also another threat. That's why when I didn't see his name on the list, I was rather pleased... </span></span></p>

              <p>Hmm well, drogba's start or not and his performance is anybody's guess. But just look at that guy, at 33 he still has the touch, strength and power shots. His presence changed the game. He's the next African guy that really stood out after george weah.</p>
              <p>Torres is a world class proven striker but you can see he's lost quite a lot of confidence. He doesn't smile on the pitch these days. Maybe he will be something like a sheva or forlan in the EPL, they just never came good. Still early days and his humongus price tag surely justifies him a place next season.</p>

              <p>Well... It's always easy to say on hindsight but then again, a week younger Drogba started in the first leg and disappointed and was subsequently sub out too...

              <p>As we all accept, Torres is a world class striker. So it's just waiting to happen any min that's all... To be fair to him, had it not been for Vds's brilliant saved using every milli-meter of his tall frame to deny Torres's header, he might have turned out to be the hero...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>maybe he will make good next season, forget this season. players who transferred in mid season, usually do not perform well when they join a new club. probably give Torres 6 months settling period and you will see a refreshed Torres a new player at the start of next season, esp when he is able to rest when there is no EURO competition in 2011.</p></div>

              <p>Don't forget, his contract is 4, 5 yrs long... I also hope he doesn't do well honestly... lol.</p>
              <p>But i belief he is too much of a quality not to do ok at Chelsea in the next few seasons... And there is no better person to compare him to than Berbatov...</p>
              <p>Remember when he first came to United, quite a lot of people said he was poor but I have all along said he did ok and will eventually come good for United which he has prove this season... Top scorer still not good enough meh?</p>

              <p>Call me superstutitious but white strikers don't do well at chelsea? hehe. Anyway, like you said still a long way to go. He has next season to prove himself.</p>
              <p>Berba was already good before he came to man u, wonder where those doubts surfaced from lol. He has had his share of mediocre moments but I was never in doubt about his intrinsic ability. That control of the ball and technique, I would say he's arguably no.1 in EPL for a number of years already.</p>

              <p>it's true..because if you place zidane in any major competition, club or country....he's always decisive. He alone makes the damn difference. Messi...for barca quite often but country.....not always. And his skill and control...people talk about messi....but zidane's feel about the ball is just god's gift. I often see messi get chopped down by defenders but zidane, that rarely happens. He's able to pluck the ball away in the face of a sliding tackle and he still stays on his feet lol.</p>
