              <p>i'm not contradicting,.. i just hate reading all your craps about other manager who always comes second to ManU... and when Jose win against your beloved ManU...you condamn him... you know yourself better.. i dislike Jose just as tonnes of others out there but i'll proud of him being able to rival just about everyone of the mangers in EPL... put it this way.. even SAF under estimated him... and its Jose who bring the standard of EPL to a certain extend.. those days before he came you dun need as much points to win the league... well but as usual.. you'll probably check the wiki, youtube or whatever in the net before replaying.. without the net i would gather you can't prove much as a diehard ManU fan....</p>

              <p><br>Not contradicting? Firstly, may I ask how would you rate Arvam Grant as a manager? Well if your previous posts are anything to go by, I think we already know the answer don't we?</p>
              <p>So, you then bunch him together with Hiddink with this statement of yours "Grant &amp; this current one"... How is it not contradicting when you start shooting your mouth off that I wasn't giving Hiddink enough credit by comparing him with Scolari then you go and put him together with Grant?  I bet you wasn't aware the earlier post i made did you...  I am just glad I made that post earlier as it justifies my position clearly...</p>
              <p>Let me tell you this, there is perfectly nothing wrong to compare Scolari with Hiddink... Cos without comparison, we won't know the qualities... Just like 6 months earlier, everyone was saying how great Scolari was, World cup winner and all that... But only with comparison, can we tell who is more suitable for the job don't we?</p>
              <p>I didn't praised Hiddink just because his and Grant's Chelsea lost to United as you claim... I praised him because when he took over, he made many positive changes to them... He was strict, players respected him, demanded every players attend training on time, wore suits and tie when they went out and represented the club. They became much fitter on the pitch as well... These are positive things that can be seen... When he took over, they were in 5th place even behind Aston Villa and Arsenal... And I mentioned had he got the full 9 months, who knows what they could achieved...</p>
              <p>I don't think i left any ambiguity with regards to my thoughts of Hiddink as a Chelsea manager... Cos I mentioned it even before you started shooting off in your first post here... But honestly, I really want to hear yours as... you seems contradicting with him... One moment you seem to think he is good then the next, place him along with Grant (Who we all know how you think of him).</p>
              <p>Ok, So you admit you were one of those who also dislike Jose just as tonnes of others out there... I ask you how many non Chelsea fan didn't felt that way then? Many disliked him then cos of his arrogance and not only because he won titles... I think you are greatly mistaken... His lack of respect for others, managers and players was the main reason fans didn't like him then... He attack Rafa, insulted Wenger... We can still remember all this happening don't we? In his 3rd year when he didn't win the title, did fans suddenly grew to love him? No. So was I any different? No, I was just, how you called it... One of them in that tonnes you mentioned...</p>
              <p>Also, I am not sure if you are aware but its still happening right now only this time its in Italy... Various Italian clubs fans dislike him now cos of his arrogance and lack of respect for their clubs... Has he brought the standard of Italian football up? Well, I don't think he has... So whether he brought the standard of EPL up or not, its irrelevant... Co it has no direct bearing on the question of various club fans disliking him right...</p>
              <p>Lastly, how should I say this in a nice way... Err... Whether I am a "die-hard" man utd fan or a "fair-weather" man utd fan or just a simple man utd fan... Its really none of your business or concern is it? Correct? I am glad we got this clear up... Anymore saving grace?</p>
