              <h1>Guus given rapturous Chelsea send-off.</h1>
              <p><img src="http://fourfourtwo.com/contentimages/news/Hiddink_Fans.jpg" alt="" width="286" height="161"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>LONDON - Guus Hiddink,
                      who will leave Chelsea at the end of the month after taking over as the
                      club's interim manager in February, was given a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">standing ovation</span> by
                      fans after the last home match of the season on Sunday.</strong></p>
              <p>The 62-year-old Dutchman
                      revitalised Chelsea's campaign after it began to falter under previous
                      coach Luiz Felipe Scolari and will take charge of the side for the last
                      time in the FA Cup final against Everton at Wembley Stadium on May 30.</p>
              <p>He will then resume coaching
                      the Russia national team, despite making a huge impact at Stamford
                      Bridge and becoming popular with fans - <em>many of whom had banners
                      pleading with him to stay on Sunday</em>.</p>
              <p>Chelsea beat Blackburn Rovers
                      2-0 and will almost certainly finish third after ending their Premier
                      League campaign at Sunderland next weekend.</p>
              <p>After the match Hiddink went on
                      to the pitch and told the fans: "<strong>To all of you, for the support you
                      have given me and to the team, thank you very much. The season is not
                      over yet</strong>."</p>
              <p>He was applauded by the club's
                      Russian billionaire owner Roman Abramovich and in scenes rarely
                      witnessed in football, was given a <em>guard of honour</em> by his squad on the
                      pitch.</p>
              <p>He also embraced Roy Bentley,
                      celebrating his 85th birthday, who led Chelsea to their first League
                      title in 1955 and he got into the party atmosphere by dancing and
                      jogging on the pitch.</p>
              <p>"That was surprising for me
                      because I have only been here for a short period, but on the other
                      hand, worked with a lot of joy with these players," Hiddink told Sky
                      Sports News.</p>
              <p>"This was not just a job. I
                      came here in February to get the team out of the position they were in
                      at that moment, and the players responded."</p>
              <p>In 21 matches since Hiddink's
                      arrival, Chelsea lost only once, and narrowly went out of the Champions
                      League when they lost to Barcelona on the away goals rule after a 1-1
                      draw at Stamford Bridge in the second leg of their semi-final.</p>

              <p>Well, Pool came close this time and with Carlo Ancelotti taking over at Chelsea next season <span style="color: #810081;"><span style="color: #000000;">I belief they will fare better than Chelsea again... If Guus stays back, it would be a different story...</span></span></p>
              <p>Liverpool did good this season but we can argue that Chelsea were much poorer this season cos of the Scolari moment... Had Guus started from the beginning, who knows what could happen... Chelsea might have won the title or even 2nd place and Pool back to 3rd as usual...</p>
              <p>Their difference isn't a lot... just 3 points... Chelsea lost to Liverpool 2x in the league while they were still under Scolari. Hiddink himself had 2 meetings with Pool in the CL, and came out with a win and a draw... or 4 points, not too bad I would say...</p>
              <p>The way I look at is, Scolari played 5 times against the other big 3 and got only 1 point... Hiddink only played once against the big 3 in the league and got 3 points... A lot of difference here already...</p>
              <p>So I feel perhaps too much is made of Pool's perceived improvements... There are improvements but I still feel its too over rated by Rafa...</p>

              <p>You seem very contradicting leh... First you pick on my first post assuming that I didn't give enough credit to Guus Hiddink by comparing him to Scolari... Then now you used "Grant &amp; this current one" ... I can only assume your "this current one" refers Hiddink correct? Cos he is the current one presently...</p>
              <p>I guess you were not aware that I posted a piece on Hiddink just hours before you pick on my first post here right... Well, I made it very clear what I though of it and honestly believed Chelsea stand a better chance had Hiddink started the season with them rather than Scolari...</p>
              <p>Nothing wrong right? You found this offensive? But I belief most would agree given that Scolari had 6 month in charge and Hiddink 3 only... The difference wasn't much... Just winning their games between each other would have made the difference... So I guess now that I have pointed out an early posting i made, its saving grace time for a load of nonsense strewed is it? ... What Jose got to do with it, "prising your rival's manager"?... I don't even know why I would want to do that...</p>
              <p>On Jose, I don't think it was just me here correct? Lets be honest... Tell me if you cannot find others who didn't dislike his style of arrogance... Of course Jose has gone for sometimes now and a lot of us have forgotten it already including myself who now thinks of him in a better light... But a lot of others here be it Pool or Gunners or United fans, they all didn't like him at that point in time mainly b'cos of his arrogance... and not because he won stuff or won United... Yourself included if you can recalled your own postings...</p>
              <p>Jose was a unique character, in his short time he has not only manage to make many here dislike him, many in England at that time and even Europe... And even his own boss... Now that he is gone, we and they do miss him, cos he was always a good story for the Press... </p>
              <p>Presently, he has gone to Italy, he has also manage to do it over there... I don't know if you have read or follow the reports coming out from Italy but fellow managers over there have said he is disrespectful as a manager and arrogant... Even the professional Italian players, the usually mild mannered Paolo Maldini and Del Piero have come out to speak up against his belittlement of them or their clubs... And thats what Jose brings so don't single it out on me alone! Cos for every one of me alone, there are ten or hundreds who felt that way too during that time... Just go Youtube and you can still find many unpleasant Jose clips created by various clubs fans...</p>

              <p>Actually it would be really quite tough for Guus to even contend for 3rd place...  He was originally hired to ensure Chelsea can qualify for Champions League football next season.</p>
              <p>Don't forget:</p>
              <p>1. Guus is new to English Football</p>
              <p>2. He's only given 3 months to do it</p>
              <p>3. Don't think he has managed any of the current Chelsea players before (except maybe Alex)</p>
              <p>4. Some of the Chelsea players have big egos and not easy to handle (eg. Drogba, Ballack)</p>
              <p>5. At that point when he took over,  there weren't a lot of unity and spirit. Morale was low.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So for me, securing 3rd place from where he took over is already a big achievement. He's contending among English League old timer managers like Wenger, Ferguson and Benitez.</p>
