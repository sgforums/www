              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Plenty to shout about: Atletico Madrid striker Sergio Aguero could be on his way to Chelsea in a record £50m deal</em></p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1228784" rel="1228784|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1228784/Chelsea-sight-record-50m-deal-Atletico-Madrid-star-Sergio-Aguero.html"></a></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Chelsea are closing in on a deal for Sergio Aguero from Atletico Madrid which could be worth £50million - and make the Argentina striker the highest-paid player in the Barclays Premier League.</strong></p>
              <p>Aguero’s pay demands mean he is likely to earn more than Manchester City’s Emmanuel Adebayor, who is believed to be on a £170,000-a-week deal at Eastlands.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Blues boss Carlo Ancelotti is set to launch a spending spree in the January transfer window after the Court of Arbitration for Sport suspended the club’s controversial transfer ban imposed by FIFA.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Chelsea were suspended from signing players for two transfer windows in September after being found guilty of inducing Gael Kakuta - then a 15-year-old with Lens - to break his contract with the French club two years ago.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti has been tracking Aguero for some time but was understood to be put off initially by Atletico’s astronomical price tag.</p>
              <p>The Italian coach was also concerned by the player’s lack of maturity at just 21, while at one stage Chelsea were also not prepared to meet his excessive wage demands.</p>
              <p>However, after seeing Aguero score two stunning goals against Chelsea in the 2-2 draw away at Atletico in the Champions League earlier this month - and with the transfer ban lifted, if only temporarily - Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has changed his stance.</p>
              <p>The club have already had a £31m bid for Aguero turned down last summer but are now prepared to increase their offer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/11/18/article-0-071271BB000005DC-853_468x286.jpg" alt="Sergio Aguero" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Aguero volleys home a stunning goal against Chelsea in the Champions League recently</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>The Argentina forward has a £53m buy-out clause in his contract but Chelsea believe they can land Aguero for less as he would be ineligible to play for them in the Champions League.</strong></p>
              <p>Ancelotti is convinced Aguero can form a potent partnership alongside Didier Drogba, which would mean Nicolas Anelka being relegated to third-striker status.</p>
              <p>Aguero is just the type of player who fits the bill for Ancelloti as he mounts a challenge for Premier League honours.</p>
              <p>Averaging a goal every three games, Aguero appears to have welcomed Chelsea’s interest and said recently: ‘It’s nice people say I could play in a team like Chelsea. They are one of the best in the world. I like it (Chelsea’s interest) and it makes me happy.’</p>
              <p>When Ancelotti was asked about Aguero after the draw in Spain, the Chelsea boss said: ‘I like him. I think Aguero can play with Drogba for sure.’</p>

              <p>they follow the appeal process lar. unless CAS changed its appeal process ie even when appealing, the original decision is still upheld even when pending. the law is the law, which is dead really, going by the book.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chelsea"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span></strong></a><strong><span style="color: #000000;">'s pursuit of </span></strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/atleticomadrid"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Atlético Madrid</span></strong></a><strong><span style="color: #000000;">'s Sergio Agüero is being driven by the club's director of football, Frank Arnesen, in what represents the first major test of his ability to operate in the transfer market since he assumed responsibility for senior player recruitment following the departure of the club's chief executive, Peter Kenyon, last month.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Although Atlético have in place a €60m (around £57m) buy-out clause in Agüero's contract it is understood that they may well accept around £40m for the 21-year-old. That amount would represent a £7.5m increase on the British record £32.5m Manchester City paid to Real Madrid for Robinho last season.</p>
              <p>Although Arnesen will be under instructions from Chelsea's owner, Roman Abramovich, to try and close the deal for less than £40m, Madrid will tell the Dane that this sum represents the minimum they would accept.</p>
              <p>The pressure on Arnesen, who joined Chelsea from Tottenham in 2005, to secure Agüero's signing in the January window will be increased due to the transfer embargo which was applied by Fifa over the Gaël Kakuta affair before being paused, pending appeal, by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.</p>
              <p>The ban could well be upheld in March when the case will be decided. If so that could prevent Chelsea from making any new signings for the following two windows, meaning Carlo Ancelotti would be unable to add to his squad until the summer of 2011.</p>
              <p>Agüero's prospective move from Atlético is complicated by the Spanish club's challenging internal politics, which are dominated by Enrique Cerezo, the president, and general manager, Miguel Angel Gil Marín.</p>
              <p>Cerezo, who despite being president owns less of Atlético than Gil Marín, wants to keep Agüero. Gil Marín, meanwhile, believes the club should cash in on their prime asset. Yet while Gil Marín's greater shareholding means he has the prospective veto over any decision, it is Cerezo who invests the greater finance.</p>
              <p>Agüero has also been told by Diego Maradona, his national team coach and father-in-law, to leave the club to enhance his prospects of becoming first-choice for Argentina at next summer's World Cup.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien is one of three Ghana players who will be "investigated" by the national association for failing to travel with the national team for a friendly against Angola.</p>
              <p>A statement by the Ghana FA general secretary Kofi Nsiah said: "Unfortunately three players – Michael Essien, Sulley Muntari and Asamoah Gyan – did not travel with the team to Angola on Monday night for the Angola friendly. The players stayed out without the permission of the head coach, Milovan Rajevac. The FA views this act with great concern and will investigate the matter further to inform its next course of action. The FA will take action after concluding investigations following the failure of above mentioned players to secure the consent of the head coach."</p>
