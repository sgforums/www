              <div class="topPhotoCaption"><strong>Joker Jimmy Bullard performed a repeat of Phil Brown's controversial half-time team-talk - but after rescuing a point for Hull on their return to Manchester City.</strong></div>
              <div class="topPhotoCaption">  </div>
              <div class="topPhotoCaption">Brown's amazing decision has been cited by many as the moment the Tigers fortunes began to nosedive last season. Yet Bullard could not stop himself having a laugh at his manager's expense after his 81st minute equaliser from a spot-kick Mark Hughes is sure to feel aggrieved by.</div>
              <div class="topPhotoCaption">  </div>
              <div class="topPhotoCaption">From virtually the exact spot where Brown delivered his address, the former Wigan star pointed to all his team-mates in turn to give the gleeful Hull fans a repeat performance.</div>
              <div class="topPhotoCaption">  </div>
              <div class="topPhotoCaption">As well as maintaining Hull's recent revival, it condemned City to a seventh successive Premier League draw. Yet again the Blues tossed away a winning position and, in front of chairman Khaldoon al-Mubarak, the hosts were booed off amid growing concern at what is becoming a mid-table position despite a summer outlay of £120 million by the City manager.</div>
              <div class="topPhotoCaption">  </div>
              <div class="topPhotoCaption">Hughes' post-match analysis will centre around referee Lee Probert, who left Kolo Toure still shaking his head after the final whistle after spotting what could have been a foul by the African on Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink or a handball by Joleon Lescott, both of which would have been pretty harsh.</div>
              <div class="topPhotoCaption">  </div>
              <div class="topPhotoCaption">Not even the return of Robinho could trigger a victory, although admittedly City were in front when the Brazilian departed 15 minutes from the end of his comeback game. </div>

              <p><strong>Brown applauds jester Bullard</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hull boss Phil Brown hailed Jimmy Bullard's replica reading of the riot act as a moment of comic timing. </p>
              <p>"It was a fantastic celebration,'' said Brown. "Great comedy is about timing. You could not have had a celebration like that, after a goal, unless it was at Eastlands and was in the goal in front of the Hull fan. </p>
              <p>"The whole thing was timed to perfection. I had no idea it was going to happen. I was trying to arrange a five-man midfield at the time so I didn't see it. But my analysis guy showed me it on the laptop when we got into the changing room. I couldn't deliver my address because I was laughing so much.  </p>
              <p>"I have had nothing but support from the changing room. A change of chairman always causes problems in terms of which direction the club is going in and what is round the corner.  </p>
              <p>"Change in football causes anxiety. But the response of the players is why I am still sat here as Hull City manager.''  </p>
              <p>Mark Hughes said of the penalty: "My initial reaction was that it was for handball against Joleon Lescott but it certainly wasn't because it didn't touch him, other than just grazing the top of his thigh. Now the referee is saying he gave it for the challenge in the box.  </p>
              <p>"I would debate that as well. It was just a coming together. In my opinion the penalty should not have been given.  </p>
              <p>"There is pressure to get results, any manager will tell you that. But we are still in the mix at the top end of the league. At times we look what we are, a team that has come together very quickly. At others we look strong and established.  </p>
              <p>"There is a process to go through and I believe the owners understand that concept as well. What we have to do is keep picking up points. We are doing that and it is only a matter of time before we start winning again.''</p>
