It was definitely business."<br><br>The news will stun Gunners chairman Peter Hill-Wood and the board of directors, who are desperate for Wenger to sign a new contract after they savagely booted Dein out of the club in April.<br><br>Dein was dumped because of his support for American billionaire Stan Kroenke's takeover plans-and his departure has sparked intense speculation over Wenger's future.<br><br>Our eyewitness added: "Wenger arrived at the restaurant at 7.30pm and asked for a table for two in the back corner.<br><br>"Within 15 minutes Dein joined him. Wenger didn't get up. Dein smiled but was not over-friendly and sat opposite the Frenchman.<br><br>"The conversation was intense, Dein mentioned ex-skipper Thierry Henry a couple of times and I heard words like Â‘plans' and Â‘the way forward'."<br><br>It's the first time Wenger has been seen with Dein since the former vice-chairman's acrimonious departure from the Emirates Stadium on April 18.<br><br>It ended Dein's 24-year association with the Gunners. But since then the 64-year-old has been linked in a dramatic return as part of a possible takeover bid from either Kroenke or Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone.<br><br>Former FA vice-chairman Dein has turned down THREE offers from other Premiership clubs in the hope of a triumphant return to Arsenal.<br><br>Wenger and Dein both had coffee before leaving the restaurant together at 9.30pm.<br><br>When our photographer wished Dein good luck for next season, he replied: "Thank you, we're going to need it!"<br><br>Arsenal director and biggest shareholder Danny Fiszman added: "Arsene is totally free to meet who he wants. I am not saying anything more."<br><br>Dein persuaded Wenger to join Arsenal from Japanese club Grampus Eight in 1996.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Wenger dampens Kroenke theory<br><br>Arsene Wenger maintains his close friendship with David Dein plays no part in the role he holds as manager at Arsenal.</strong><br><br>Arsene Wenger maintains his close friendship with David Dein plays no part in the role he holds as manager at Arsenal.<br><br>The Gunners boss found himself fielding questions about off-the-field matters following this afternoon's conclusion of the Emirates Cup, which finished with a 2-1 win over Inter Milan for the hosts to claim the trophy.<br><br>Wenger was photographed with former Arsenal vice-chairman Dein - who left the club last season following "irreconcilable differences" with the board - after the pair had dinner together in London last week"<br><br>The Frenchman, however, insisted it was "simply" a meeting between two friends and that topics exchanged certainly did not include a potential buy-out of the club by American shareholder Stan Kroenke.<br><br>"The story is as simple as ever," Wenger insisted.<br><br>"I've been friends with David Dein before I was at Arsenal. I was friends with him during his stay here and I'm still friends since he's departed. It's as simple as that.<br><br>"I said the other day, I know I have a responsibility here and I want to stand up for it.<br><br>"My friendship with David is something different.<br><br>"For a long period it was mixed with the life of the club, but it is no longer mixed with that."<br><br>Wenger maintained: "We didn't discuss the future at Arsenal.<br><br>"He still asked me how it was going at Arsenal, how is the team going? I have no influence in the shareholders.<br><br>"I've never been a shareholder. I'm an employee who is responsible for the technical side of the club."</div>
