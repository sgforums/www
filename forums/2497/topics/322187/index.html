              <p><em>"It doesn't help," was the verdict from Wenger on Scolari's announcement.</em></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Arsène Wenger has given Luiz Felipe Scolari a cautious welcome to the Premier League, although he pulled no punches on the new Chelsea manager's decision to announce his departure from the Portugal team midway through Euro 2008. "It doesn't help," was the verdict from Wenger, who also insisted that Arsenal would be good enough to compete for the title next season "no matter who the players are".</strong></p>
              <p>With the Arsenal manager set to return next week from his busman's holiday at Euro 2008 to sort out the uncertain futures of Emmanuel Adebayor and Alexander Hleb, among others, he was bullish about the club's future. They do not face Chelsea until November and Wenger said that he had had a good relationship with Scolari. However, his comparison of the Brazilian's situation with that of Jacques Santini four years ago will not be judged the most flattering.</p>
              <p>While manager of France, Santini announced before Euro 2004 that he would be leaving to take charge of Tottenham after the tournament. France were eliminated in the first knockout round and Santini lasted at Spurs only until that November. "It [the announcement] is difficult to measure but what is for sure is that it doesn't give something to the team, it only takes it away," Wenger said. "It doesn't help.</p>
              <p>"We had that situation with Jacques Santini saying to Tottenham [he would join after Euro 2004]. The speculation was there. Then it starts, 'Who will be the next manager?' in the newspapers. And when it starts in the newspapers it starts in the players' camp. I like Scolari as a person and as a coach. He can bring something to the Premier League. You never know what will happen, but he is a quality man and manager.</p>
              <p>"The system he plays looks similar to the 4-5-1/ 4-3-3 system that Chelsea play. Whether it is down to the fact that they have similar strikers, I don't know. There will be a change, because every manager brings his own personality and he will buy players, but the system won't change."</p>
