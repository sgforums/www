              <p><strong>Guus surprised by Blues adoration</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/02/17/article-0-038D513A000005DC-522_468x511.jpg" alt="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/02/17/article-0-038D513A000005DC-522_468x511.jpg"></p>
              <p>Guus Hiddink admitted he was surprised by the outpouring of affection
              from the Chelsea fans after his final match in charge at Stamford
              Bridge ended with a 2-0 win over Blackburn.</p>
              <p>The Dutchman - who took temporary charge in February and steered the Blues back
              into the top three, into the FA Cup final as well as within touching distance of
              the Champions League final - is set to return to his full-time post with the
              Russian national team at the end of the season.</p>
              <p>That, though, did not stop his name being chanted by the Chelsea faithful this
              afternoon, and Hiddink was given a guard of honour by the players following
              their post-match lap of appreciation.</p>
              <p>"It was a nice way to say goodbye with a victory,'' said
              Hiddink. "It was nice appreciation from the crowd, and to be honest, I
              did not expect this when I am here for a relatively short period to do
              my job. So this reaction of the crowd was surprising for me, and I
              would like to thank them.</p>
              <p>"I expected it to be respectful from the heart, but not more.
              That is why I was positively surprised by the reaction of the people,
              so thanks. We enjoyed the atmosphere, but the season is not over for me
              and the team. We would love to finish it off with the FA Cup.''</p>
              <p>Hiddink is set to return to his Russian "adventure'' following the FA Cup
              final, determined to honour in full the contract with the national federation.</p>
              <p>However, the Dutchman - who took Holland, South Korea and most recently
              Australia to the latter stages of the World Cup - admitted it was only natural
              to wonder if he was making the right decision to leave Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>"I have many second thoughts. Sometimes third thoughts. You
              cannot avoid them,'' he said. "You do not have a button to turn them
              off, but that is how it is. When I have to leave and I see the reaction
              of the players and how they have worked, I feel a kind of sadness. That
              is for sure, but that is the reality.''</p>
              <p>Hiddink added: "Russia is a country that needs to be developed.
              I have given my commitment to them, with pleasure, and I have to fulfil
              that - but that does not mean that it is difficult to leave this
              atmosphere.''</p>
              <p>Hiddink accepted whoever comes in - with AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti
              reported to be the top target - must look to refresh the Chelsea squad to keep
              them competitive.</p>
              <p>"When you want to compete, you have to renew your squad almost
              every year,'' he said. "For the FA Cup, Carling Cup, Premier League and
              Champions League, you need a
              squad of real depth in quality. If you want to compete for first
              position, you need to be able to use a lot of players. You have to
              analyse the squad. The players who are now 'ageing', around 30, they
              need also to be rested every now and then.''</p>
              <p>Hiddink, 62, refused to be drawn on his own future past 2010.
              "I am not the youngest any more. Sometimes you must know when to
              stop,'' he said, "but as long as I feel energetic that I can deliver
              and as long as I receive the energy from the group and the players,
              then I can continue.</p>
              <p>"One year ago, I would not have thought that I would have managed Chelsea, so
              I cannot predict what happens after the Russia adventure.''</p>
              <p>Blackburn, meanwhile, have a completely different objective to
              Chelsea, having secured their top-flight status a couple of weeks ago
              under Sam Allardyce. "A club like ours tries its very best and, if we
              can get in the top half and beat the big boys now and again, that is
              where we lie,'' he said.</p>
              <p>As to whether anyone could crack the top four, Allardyce
              reflected: "Aston Villa have had a good go by spending considerable
              amounts of money and nearly got there. Everton are always around there
              and Manchester City, if they spend the billions they have got, will get
              there eventually if they are not too impatient. But the top four do
              lose games to the lesser sides, and that makes the Premier League so
              exciting.''</p>
