They have gone on a long time.<br><br>"Now the season has started, I have told the club I do not really want to get involved in negotiations which are not going to end well while I am playing football, because this is a big season for me and for the club.<br><br>"My intention is to stay. I have got two years left on my contract.<br><br>"I want to stay for the rest of my career. It is as simple as that.<br><br>"I hope it gets sorted and that it gets sorted soon, at the end of the season, or the next time [we talk] - and the club know that.<br><br>"The club know my intentions, and it is certainly not a money issue.<br><br>"Some figures get banded about, inflated figures, maybe that is done on purpose - but a lot of that is not true.<br><br>"Certainly the issues I have got with the club are not to do with money.<br><br>"This is going to be my last contract, which will finish my career, so I want to get it right."<br><br>Lampard - who has often been linked with a move to Barcelona - believes it is better to delay discussions, rather than risk him losing focus for the new campaign.<br><br>The England midfielder continued: "That is why I said to the club I did not want to keep talking backwards and forwards now, because at the end of last season, it was on my mind and it does not help.<br><br>"That is not an excuse, but it does not help.<br><br>"I did not enjoy that."<br><br>Lampard maintained: "All I want to get clear out there that my intention is to stay. I want to stay, and I love the club.<br><br>"Hopefully I will stay for the rest of my career."</div>

Lampard is frustrated because talks have dragged on through the summer without agreement. Now he has ordered his advisers to end negotiations so the issue does not distract him from his football. </strong><br><br>Lampard said: "I have always expressed my desire to stay at the club but we've had problems with the negotiations. They've gone on for quite a long time and now the season is starting I've told the club I don't want to get involved in negotiations that are not going to end well while I'm playing. 'I had that towards the end of last season and I didn't enjoy it."<br><br>With John Terry injured, Lampard is set to captain Chelsea as they open their season at home to Birmingham on Sunday. "People have talked about inflated figures but money is not an issue," said Lampard.<br><br>"This is my last contract, my biggest contract and I want to get it right. I want to stay at Chelsea for the rest of my career and I hope it gets sorted out at the end of the season."<br><br>Terry became Britain's highest paid footballer this summer when he signed a five-year deal worth Â£135,000 a week. Lampard, currently on Â£105,000 a week, would argue he deserves at least the same because of the role he has played lifting Chelsea to the top of the English game.<br><br></div>
