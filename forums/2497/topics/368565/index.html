              <h1>A subdued Beckham returns, hatchets buried</h1>
              <p>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., July 16 (Reuters) - Maybe it was the
              heat, or the global commute or the rust from weeks without the
              intense effort of European soccer, but it turned out to be a
              quiet return for the marquee player of U.S. soccer, David
              Beckham.</p>
              <p>The England international was booed by the crowd with every
              touch of the ball but said, after playing a minor role in the
              L.A. Galaxy's convincing win over Major League Soccer's worst
              team, he was pleased to be back with his team mates.</p>
              <p>Beckham spent the off-season with AC Milan in Italy and his
              extended loan spell there led Landon Donovan, the Galaxy
              captain, to publicly question Beckham's commitment to the LA
              team.</p>
              <p>"It's to be expected. Sometimes it's nice to get the boos.
              It gives you inspiration, especially when we play like we did,"
              said Beckham.</p>
              <p>Beckham and Donovan later buried the hatchet in a meeting
              brokered by their manager, former U.S. national team coach
              Bruce Arena.</p>
              <p>In the aftermath of a thumping 3-1 win over the New York
              Red Bulls, off-field differences were put aside.</p>
              <p>"Given all the circumstances and issues, I think he had a
              great game," said Arena.</p>
              <p>Donovan said the chemistry between the two on the right
              side of midfield was "fantastic".</p>
              <p>'GREAT ATTITUDE'</p>
              <p>Donovan was by far the better player on the night, scoring
              one goal and setting up another in the Galaxy victory.</p>
              <p>Beckham appeared a step behind and lacked his trademark
              deft passing. He was substituted in the 70th minute on a night
              the temperature read 86 degrees at kickoff.</p>
              <p>Arena praised Beckham's attitude and said he played longer
              than expected.</p>
              <p>"At halftime, I said 60 minutes, and he told me: '65, 70,'"
              Arena said.</p>
              <p>"He's got a great attitude and stepped right in ... There
              was never a doubt in our mind that these guys would work
              together. We expect him to be like all the other guys, and
              that's what he wants."</p>
              <p>The allure of the league's highest-paid player may have
              worn off on the fans -- only 23,238 attended Thursday's match,
              half the number that took in the match last year and a third of
              the fans that showed up for Beckham's debut the year before.</p>
              <p>"I don't know. The first year was impressive, but we are in
              a recession, maybe that's part of it," Beckham said.</p>
              <p>Beckham has said he expected to find another loan deal when
              the current MLS season ends, with the goal of staying in
              England manager Fabio Capello's plan for the 2010 World Cup in
              South Africa.</p>
