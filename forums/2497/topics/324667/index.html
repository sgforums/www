              <p>Kaka has set his heart on a shock transfer to Chelsea, according to his
              advisor.</p>
              <p>A report this morning claims the FIFA World Player of the Year was the subject
              of discussions between the Barclays Premier League club and the Brazilian's
              current employers, AC Milan, this week.</p>
              <p>The Italians secured the signing of the 26-year-old's international team-mate
              Ronaldinho on Wednesday despite their well-publicised financial difficulties,
              and Kaka's personal assistant Diogo Kotscho is adamant all parties involved now
              want the deal to go through.</p>
              <p>If it did, Kaka would be reunited with Blues manager Luiz Felipe Scolari who
              handed him a Brazil debut in 2002 at the age of 20, and then included him in the
              squad that went on to win the World Cup that year.</p>
              <p>'Real Madrid offered 90 million euros (£71million) last summer and Milan did
              not even think about the bid,' Kotscho told The Guardian.</p>
              <p>'This time is different. This is the first time we feel that a deal will
              definitely happen.</p>
              <p>'Because of the situation Milan are in at the moment, the deal is good for all
              parties involved.</p>
              <p>'The move would represent a significant increase in Kaka's salary, on top of
              the 10% transfer fee that goes straight to the player anyway - some 15 million
              euros (£12million).</p>
              <p>'Chelsea are the club to be at right now. They are building a team to win
              everything.'</p>
              <p>Any deal for arguably the planet's best player seems certain to break the world
              record transfer fee of £46million set when Real Madrid signed Zinedine Zidane
              from Juventus in 2001.</p>

              <p><strong>Kaka is not fo sales<br></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>AC Milan insist Kaka is not for sale despite reports linking the Brazilian with
              a move to Chelsea this summer.</p>
              <p>The Serie A side released a statement in response to comments from Kaka's
              personal assistant Diogo Kotscho, who claimed the player had set his heart on
              move to Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>'Real Madrid offered 90 million euros (£71million) last summer and Milan did
              not even think about the bid,' Kotscho told The Guardian.</p>
              <p>'This time is different. This is the first time we feel that a deal will
              definitely happen.</p>
              <p>'Because of the situation Milan are in at the moment, the deal is good for all
              parties involved.</p>
              <p>'The move would represent a significant increase in Kaka's salary, on top of
              the 10% transfer fee that goes straight to the player anyway - some 15 million
              euros (£12million).</p>
              <p>'This is the first time we feel that a deal will definitely happen,' Kotscho
              was quoted as saying. 'Chelsea are the club to be at right now. They are
              building a team to win everything.'</p>
              <p>But although Milan vice president Adriano Galliani revealed earlier this year
              the Premier League side had made an astronomical bid to sign the 26-year-old,
              the Rossoneri have again ruled out selling their most prized asset.</p>
              <p>An Milan statement on Saturday read: 'Regarding the comments, Milan director
              of communications Vittorio Mentana reiterates that Kaka is absolutely not for
              sale.'</p>
              <p>The Brazil international is under contract with the Italian giants until June
              2013.</p>
