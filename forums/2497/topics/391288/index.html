              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ROBERTO MANCINI has been involved in an astonishing bust-up with Craig Bellamy.</h2>
              <p class="article">It ended with Manchester City's boss screaming at the player: Get out - and don't come back for <strong>THREE MONTHS</strong>. </p>
              <p class="article">Mancini exploded after Bellamy refused a request to train on Thursday with one of the manager's Italian staff.</p>
              <p class="article">The £14million striker was ordered into Mancini's office, where the pair had a heated exchange. A stunned insider said: "The manager was yelling 'Why are you always questioning me? Why won't you do as you are told? Why are you always questioning everything at training and in games?'.</p>
              <p class="article">"Bellamy argued back that he only wanted what was best for the club. "But Mancini snapped 'I want you to leave now. And do not come back for three months'."</p>
              <p class="article">Bellamy had just completed a one-on-one training session on Wednesday with a member of City's sports science department, when he was approached by Mancini's Italian trainer.</p>
              <p class="article">He told the Welsh international to report to him on Thursday for more training, which Bellamy refused to accept. He insisted only he and the sports science staff knew how to handle his injured right knee.</p>
              <p class="article">After the bust-up, Bellamy stormed away and was immediately contacted by City chief executive Garry Cook and the club's football administrator Brian Marwood.</p>
              <p class="article">They advised him to return to training on Thursday. But Bellamy refused, insisting he would go back only when Mancini invited him to.</p>
              <p class="article">Bellamy had a meeting with Marwood last night. He was again advised to return to training today and apologise to Mancini.</p>
              <p class="article">While Bellamy is expected back at training, he will refuse to apologise, telling Marwood he has no reason to say sorry.</p>
              <p class="article">Bellamy joined City in January 2009 and is a huge fans' favourite for his wholehearted displays. The bust-up is the worst possible preparation for City's Eastlands showdown with Liverpool on Sunday, as both clubs battle for a Champions League place.</p>
              <p class="article">Marwood and Cook are desperate for Bellamy to play because top scorer Carlos Tevez is in Argentina following the premature birth of his child.</p>

              <p><br>I think it's the first one directly with Mancini... The other time was not happy with the board sacking Hughes all of a sudden. But even then, it wasn't a bust-up, just a show of unhappiness that's all.</p>
              <p>Looks like City lost him and Tevez for the match against Pool now...</p>

              <h1>Mancini: Bell bust-up talk is bunkum</h1>
              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Roberto Mancini has denied talk of a major
              bust-up with Manchester City striker Craig Bellamy, who could face
              Liverpool on Sunday.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT"></span></p><blockquote>
              <p>According to the report, Mancini screamed at

              one of the manager's Italian staff.</p>
              <p>The Italian apparently then told him not to come back from three months.</p>

              <p><br><br>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez admits he will be happy his team do not have to face striker Carlos Tevez at Eastlands on Sunday, but is still wary of Manchester City's quality.</strong></p>
              <p>The Argentina international, who Liverpool tried to sign in the summer, is currently in his homeland on compassionate leave after his wife gave birth prematurely. And while he will not feature in a clash which could have a major bearing on who finishes fourth in the Premier League, Benitez is aware there are many other players who can hurt his side.</p>
              <p>"Clearly he is a good player who is doing well," said the Spaniard of the 19-goal striker. "But they have other good strikers, so I think they have enough quality in the squad and can replace Tevez with another good player.</p>
              <p>"If Tevez is not there and they miss him we will be pleased, but I will say again, they have quality."</p>
              <p>Tevez's international team-mate Javier Mascherano knows exactly what the striker offers but expects City to be able to cope without him. "He is a really good player but Manchester City have a lot of really good players so if he doesn't play, they will use a player who will try to do the same as him," said the Argentina captain.</p>
              <p>"They are a top side with some really good players. I think it will be a really important game and will be a good game to watch."</p>
              <p>Benitez has tried to play down the significance of the match, with City currently occupying the final Champions League spot one point ahead of Liverpool and with a match in hand.</p>
              <p>He believes there is plenty of time remaining in the season for things to change significantly - especially with Tottenham and Aston Villa also challenging.</p>
              <p>"It will be an important game for both teams and we will try to win," he said. "If you cannot, it is better not to lose, but the main thing for us is to try to win. "We will try to attack and we know we will have to score goals if we want to win. "They are an attacking team and we will have to attack too, so I think it will be open."</p>
              <p>Mascherano also believes that one match will not decide the Champions League fate of either side. "We are one point behind them and some teams are very close to us so it's important to get the three points," said the midfielder.</p>
              <p>"I think it's an important game but if any team lost, nothing will happen. "There are still a lot of games to play so it will be an important game but it will decide nothing."</p>
              <p>The side will have been lifted by last night's 1-0 victory over Unirea Urziceni, having seen their seven-match unbeaten Barclays Premier League run ended by Arsenal last week.</p>
              <p>Vice-captain Jamie Carragher singled out the impact of substitutes Ryan Babel and Daniel Pacheco, with the former crossing for his team-mate to head across goal for David Ngog to score with nine minutes to go.</p>
              <p>"Ryan and Dani did very well when they came on and made a big contribution for the goal," said the defender. "They gave us a bit of a lift and more energy and that's what we needed. They made the difference.</p>
              <p>"It would have been nice to get a few more but hopefully we can get an away goal and finish the game off next week."</p>
              <p>Highly-rated reserve team striker Pacheco was making only his third appearance for the senior side, but the young Spaniard hopes to be able to play a bigger part in the remainder of the season.</p>
              <p>"I was very happy to get involved with the game and help the team out and I think everyone was quite happy at the end," said the 19-year-old.</p>
              <p>"It is always a good thing when the manager is talking about you but I know I have to keep working, keep listening and doing my best for the reserves.</p>
              <p>"I've got to keep my feet on the floor. I hope I will get more chances in the future and do the same again.</p>
              <p>"We can now think about Manchester City. If I get a chance again, I hope I will take it but we will see what happens."</p>

              <p class="small bold">MANCINI ... facing revolt</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">THE chairman of Manchester City has stepped in to try to stop a player revolt. Khaldoon al Mubarak rang one of the club's top stars from his Abu Dhabi home to plead for the squad to give Roberto Mancini more time.</h2>
              <p class="article">He knows the players are unhappy with the Italian manager's training and tactics but is desperate to stick with him after getting rid of Mark Hughes.</p>
              <p class="article">As SunSport revealed yesterday, Mancini had a bust-up with Craig Bellamy on Wednesday at City's training ground and told him to stay away from there for three months.</p>
              <p class="article">Chief executive Garry Cook and football administrator Brian Marwood both had to ring the Wales ace and contact Mancini so Bellamy could return.</p>
              <p class="article">It means Mancini has had to back down. But this is only the latest in a series of problems that have beset Mancini's reign since he took over from Hughes.</p>
              <p class="article">Marwood once had to act when a player was ranting about the training just ahead of a Khaldoon visit to the training camp. Frantic Marwood had to make a call to the player's agent to get him to ring the player involved and calm him down in case the chairman witnessed the chaos.</p>
              <p class="article">Mancini yesterday confirmed SunSport's revelations of an argument with Bellamy over his troublesome right knee. Bellamy had insisted he stayed training one-on-one with a member of the sports science department, instead of with the Italian training staff as Mancini wanted.</p>
              <p class="article">Asked if he had an argument with Bellamy, Mancini said: "Yes we did. I spoke to him in my office. We solved this face to face."</p>
              <p class="article">Asked what the row was about, Mancini added: "His knee. He worked in one mode, I preferred another. Only this. "It's just one problem a manager can have."</p>
              <p class="article">Bellamy was adamant he would not apologise and it is understood an uneasy peace has broken out between the two ahead of tomorrow's all-important game against Liverpool.</p>
              <p class="article">Yet Bellamy is not the only unhappy player in the squad. A number dislike the length and form of training, claiming it leaves them tired for match day.</p>
              <p class="article">They feel this has led to the number of injuries the squad has suffered. The players are also bemused by Mancini's tactics and the changes he makes during games.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;"> </h2>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ARGIE ace Javier Mascherano last night put the boot in on Manchester City's millionaires by roaring: "You can buy players but you can't buy history."</h2>
              <p class="article">And in a double put-down to the game's big spenders, the Liverpool tough guy insisted he would never head for Eastlands - however much cash they threw at him.</p>
              <p class="article">Mascherano reckons that while City are streets ahead of the Kop kings when it comes to spending power, they will never have the passion and pride there is at Anfield.</p>
              <p class="article">The Argentina skipper, 25, insisted: "City have bought some very good players and they have a very good team, but I will say one thing - you can buy players, but you cannot buy history.</p>
              <p class="article">"I certainly don't want to play for City. You can buy stars, you can spend a lot of money to be in the top four, more than us I know, but you can't buy what we have at Anfield.</p>
              <p class="article">"Here we play with the history of the club behind us. We don't have their money but we are proud to play for Liverpool. I know that they have the money and they are building a good side but I am still so proud to play for Liverpool."</p>
              <p class="article">The Reds go to Eastlands tomorrow knowing defeat would leave City four points to the good with a game in hand, in the battle for fourth place and that crucial, final Champions League slot.</p>
              <p class="article">Missing out on a seat at Europe's top table would be a nightmare for everyone at Anfield, as City aim to establish themselves as regulars among the game's big guns.</p>
              <p class="article">Yet Mascherano reckons Liverpool's knowledge of handling the burden of expectation can give his side a crucial edge. He said: "It is normal for Liverpool to play under pressure all the time, but maybe not for City.</p>
              <p class="article">"And although they have spent a lot of money to reach the top four, and have some good players, so do we. "I think City respect Liverpool because of our history. We will fight until the end."</p>
              <p class="article">The Reds will have to do battle at Eastlands still missing the crocked Fernando Torres - although City are likely to be without a star of their own in Carlos Tevez.</p>
              <p class="article">The Argentine striker, a close pal of Mascherano, has flown back home after complications in the recent premature birth of his daughter.</p>
              <p class="article">Mascherano, who spent six months alongside Tevez at West Ham, has put professional rivalries to one side in several calls to his pal this week, to offer his support.</p>
              <p class="article">He insisted: "We know it will be good for us if Carlito cannot play because we know how good he is. "I have spoken to him this week but not about football, but because I was worried as the baby was born early.</p>
              <p class="article">"I still don't know whether he will stay in Argentina or come back and play. The main thing for me, the only thing, is that he is happy and the baby is well. If he plays, he plays, but the family is the main thing."</p>
              <p class="article">While Mascherano is thinking about Tevez's welfare, Kop boss Rafa Benitez has his sights on City opposite number Roberto Mancini for different reasons.</p>
              <p class="article">The Liverpool boss has spent months fending off speculation about his future, after a nightmare first half of the campaign. But Benitez turned the heat on Mancini by claiming their fourth-place rivals should be under the spotlight, given all the cash they have splashed in the past 12 months.</p>
              <p class="article">The Kop gaffer insisted: "We are in the position where it depends on us. If we succeed, they will have problems, so we have to do our job.</p>
              <p class="article">"So we know how important it is to win. If we manage it, then it'll be more difficult for them and they will be the ones under more pressure, that's for sure.</p>
              <p class="article">"I know everybody is expecting us to be in the top four - but I have the belief and confidence that we can be there.</p>
              <p class="article">"It's true, our experience of having been there already could be important. It depends on the players and if they can manage things well.</p>
              <p class="article">"But over the last four or five years we've done well in various competitions so this can hopefully help us. We have managed the pressure well.</p>
              <p class="article">"Ourselves and City, as well as Tottenham and Aston Villa, are in a position where we have to keep going until the end.</p>
              <p class="article">"Perhaps one game can be a big difference, so it's important to manage the pressure and maybe our experience can help.</p>
              <p class="article">"Perhaps City fans are expecting the team to do better now and they will have a little bit of pressure - and maybe it will be more difficult for them.</p>
              <p class="article">"But the most important thing for us is not to concentrate on City, but on us. We need to be in a good position and have the chance to invest in the future."</p>

              <p>i really dont know why the man city players are giving mancini so much problems.. he's only been at the club for 2 months and they're starting to question him?</p>
              <p>is it because of a lack of cv, or their loyalty to mark hughes.. cause no matter what, mancini has a better cv compared to hughes, maybe its his lack of the english language and his man management..</p>
