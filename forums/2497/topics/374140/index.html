              </span></p><p>Dutch international Ryan
              Babel has admitted that playing more minutes for Liverpool is a
              necessity if he is to secure a place in Holland’s squad for the 2010
              World Cup and made clear that he is currently unhappy with his limited
              outings so far this term having only started against Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
              <p>The 22-year-old, who moved to Anfield in 2007 having seemed destined to
              join Arsenal, also revealed that he wouldn’t turn down a chance to
              return to former club Ajax if they offered him a loan move in January.</p>
              <p>"There have been a lot of things promised, but they haven't been followed up," Babel told <em>De Telegraaf</em>.</p>
              <p>"I would get to play for more minutes and have more chances, but after the first defeat, I only lost my place.</p>
              <p>"I think half a season at Ajax with a view to the World Cup wouldn't be a bad idea. I can add something to the Ajax squad.</p>
              <p>"Loaning me out was not an option (in the summer). Now we have agreed to review the situation in January.</p>
              <p>"I see the current situation as a signal that I really have to get playing."</p>
