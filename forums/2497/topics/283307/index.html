At times I thought it was fair, but at others I thought they were looking for a scapegoat, and that was me.<br><br>"I was big enough to take it, but I was glad to move and now I am playing every week, whereas at Newcastle I was in for a few games and then out for a few.<br><br>"Playing week in week out is something every footballer needs for consistency, and I think my performances are reflected in that.<br><br>"Against Liverpool, that was one of my best since I joined Wigan, but then as a team we were outstanding.<br><br>"We've done well all season, and against Liverpool we showed the spirit we have in the team because to match them was fantastic. We deserved a point at least.<br><br>"As long as we continue to play the way we did on Saturday, then we will win more games than we lose."</div>
