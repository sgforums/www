              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Pet sounds: Chelsea boss Carlo Ancelotti has played down his reference to 'pet' John Terry made on late night Italian TV show 'Chiambretti Night'</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Maybe it was the exotic atmosphere, maybe a word that didn't translate so well but </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span><strong> captain John Terry will have to live down his manager Carlo Ancelotti calling him his 'pet' on a late night Italian TV satire show.</strong></p>
              <p>Ancelotti, pictured looking a little mesmerised by a shapely lap dancer - Jose  Mouirinho and Fabio Capello have had similar treatment in the past - did his best to put the record straight by proclaiming that the England captain could go on playing till he's 40, like AC Milan's Paolo Maldini did.</p>
              <p>Chelsea boss Ancelotti, obviously at a loose end during the international break after going home to appear on <span style="font-style: italic;">Chiambretti Night</span>, seemed a little flustered that anybody could misunderstand his feelings.</p>
              <p>'I don't know what ''pet'' means,' insisted the former Milan coach. 'I have a lot of respect for John Terry. For all players who have worked with me in the  last year with great professionalism.'</p>
              <p>He repeated: 'I don't know what ''pet'' means. The programme made a comparison  with (Pippo) Inzaghi. Terry and Inzaghi. 'I have respect for them all - for Terry, Inzaghi, Gattuso... all the players who work with enthusiasm.'</p>
              <p>Of course, Maldini, Inzaghi and Gattuso were all special to Ancelotti in his time with AC Milan and now Terry bears comparisons during the Italian's new career with Chelsea.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Teacher's pet: Ancelotti feels Terry can play on at the top until he is 40 - much like Milan legend Paolo Maldini</em></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p>But try telling that to JT's team-mates! Though Terry appears a much more physical player than Maldini, and so risks  more injuries, Ancelotti is sure he can join Paolo by playing until he hits 40.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti added: 'The careers of Maldini and John Terry are very close in  comparison. Not just in terms of their playing but in terms of their  professionalism.</p>
              <p>Terrry can do this. He has no physical problems and a lot of passion. and this  is the most important thing to continue to 39 or 40.'</p>
              <p>Ancelotti is calling for the same defensive discipline Premier League leaders Chelsea showed in the win over <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool </span></a>- one of five clean sheets in their  last six games - for the early Saturday lunchtime clash at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/aston-villa.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Aston Villa</span></a>.</p>
              <p>He said: 'If we play like we did against Liverpool, we can win. Play like we did at Wigan (losing 3-1), we'll have a problem.'</p>
