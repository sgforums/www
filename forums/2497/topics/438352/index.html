              <p>Gian Piero Gasperini has been sacked as manager of Inter Milan following a disappointing start to the 2011-12 season.</p>
              <p>Gasperini only took over at Inter in June this year, having previously impressed at former club Genoa, but he endured a tough beginning to life at the San Siro, losing 2-1 to bitter rivals AC Milan in the Super Cup.</p>
              <p>A 4-3 loss to Palermo in their opening game of the Serie A season then followed before a shock 1-0 slump at home to Trabzonspor in the Champions League ramped up the pressure on Gasperini.</p>
              <p>Last weekend, Inter played out a goalless draw with Roma before Tuesday night's unexpected 3-1 defeat at Novara proved the final nail in the coffin for Gasperini as president Massimo Moratti refused to assure the head coach of his position.</p>
              <p>Inter have now removed Gasperini from his position, with speculation already mounting that former Chelsea and Roma head coach Claudio Ranieri could be appointed as his replacement while Carlo Ancelotti has also been mentioned.</p>
              <p>A statement from Inter read: "Inter announces that today's training session has been carried out by Daniele Bernazzani and Giuseppe Baresi.</p>
              <p>"The club wishes to thank Gian Piero Gasperini for the effort shown during his tenure and manifests its true disappointment for the interruption of the relationship with the coach.''</p>
              <p>Reacting to his departure, Gasperini told the club's official website: "In the end, the results are the ones that determine everything. I am very disappointed. It's a pity that our relationship had to be interrupted.''</p>

              <p><strong>Claudio Ranieri has been confirmed as the new coach of </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Internazionale" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/internazionale"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Internazionale</strong></span></a><strong> and has vowed to "wake up the team".</strong></p>
              <p>The former Valencia, Chelsea and Roma manager has signed a contract to June 2013 to replace Gian Piero Gasperini, who was sacked on Wednesday after three months in charge.</p>
              <p>Ranieri told Domenica Sportiva: "Inter are a great team. They have had a bad start to the season and I will have to talk to the team to understand why that was.</p>
              <p>"I will have to bring enthusiasm and a change of gear in order to wake up the team. I cannot promise that we will win this or that but I believe this team has a lot to give and we must prove it."</p>
              <p>Tuesday's humiliating 3-1 defeat at newly promoted Novara – Inter's fourth defeat in five games – proved to be Gasperini's final act in charge. But Ranieri praised Gasperini's efforts despite his short tenure at the club.</p>
              <p>"Gasperini wanted to bring his ideas and make them work at all costs but he didn't manage to do it," the 59-year-old said. "I will try to make this team play as it knows how, with all of its strength.</p>
              <p>"Gasperini didn't make a mistake and we have to say well done because he tried everything to make his ideas work."</p>
              <p>Ranieri's first game in charge will be at Bologna on Saturday before a trip to Russia to face CSKA Moscow in the Champions League.</p>
              <p>A statement from Inter said: "All of Inter has the pleasure of welcoming Claudio Ranieri and his staff. Ranieri will guide today's training session and will be unveiled tomorrow to the press."</p>
              <p>Ranieri had been out of a job since leaving Roma in February.</p>
