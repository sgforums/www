But he pointed to a purple patch 12 months ago when Liverpool reaped close to maximum points from a dozen games and said: "That's what we're going to need if we're to make the miracle happen."<br><br>Eight wins in their past nine league matches have moved the Reds to within 11 points of leaders United. England midfielder Gerrard said: "Our current form is championship-winning form.<br><br>"It's just about that level of consistency, and we've got to be even more consistent. "This time last year we went on a fantastic run of 10 or 11 wins from 12 games and that's the type of run we're going to need to go on from now until the end of the season. "We've got to concentrate on winning and hopefully that will put a bit of pressure on Chelsea and Manchester United.<br><br>"If they do slip up, it will only be little slips. They are not going to lose three or four games. But we have to be ready to capitalise on any little slip-ups they make." Liverpool can close the gap on second-placed Chelsea - who they beat 2-0 10 days ago - to two points if they win at West Ham tonight. "If we keep playing the way we're playing and Chelsea slip up, I think we can catch them," added Gerrard.<br><br>"Hopefully that will be sooner rather than later and then we can set our targets on Manchester United. "But there's no use going to West Ham and drawing or losing. We must be up for it just as much as we were for Chelsea. That fantastic win will be pointless if we don't build on it."<br><br></div>

He can see it all from hoisting the trophy aloft in front of a delirious Anfield to the victory parade on an open-top bus through the packed streets of Liverpool. He can even imagine the looks of joy on the fans' faces as they celebrate the end of Liverpool's long wait to reclaim the title.<br><br>As a die-hard Red, Gerrard knows how much winning the championship means to Liverpool supporters and that drives him every time he runs out for a Premiership game. The midfield star will forever cherish the memories of Liverpool's triumphant return after their Champions League success and he feels bringing the title back home could be 10 times better.<br><br>"I can imagine it all," said the Reds skipper. "I can picture Anfield now and I can imagine the feeling I would get if I got to lift the Premier League trophy there because this is the one the fans want. "And I can imagine the parade through Liverpool and everyone going absolutely wild. I dream of lifting that Premier League trophy and I dream of seeing the expressions on the fans' faces. "It could be 10 times better than when we won the European Cup because of what it would mean to the fans.<br><br>Gerrard, 26, was a couple of weeks short of his 10th birthday - and dreaming of being John Barnes and Peter Beardsley - when Liverpool last got hold of the title back in 1990. He never imagined on that May evening when he played with his mates in his Reds jersey that all these years later, Liverpool would still be waiting to celebrate another championship success.<br><br>"It's been too long," he said. "As a Liverpool fan and a Liverpool player, it's been too long. "The gap has been embarrassing from a Liverpool point of view, but we feel we are slowly changing things."</div>
