              <p>Clint Dempsey capped a storming Fulham recovery from 2-0 down as Mark Hughes' shell-shocked Manchester City were forced to settle for their third straight Premier League draw.</p>
              <p>Hughes' men were cruising home when Martin Petrov fired home their second on the hour, seven minutes after Joleon Lescott had knocked home the opener.</p>
              <p>But eight minutes later the visitors were back on level terms when first Damien Duff and then Dempsey fired past Shay Given to lend another twist to an action-packed game.</p>
              <p>It could have been worse for City as Bobby Zamora brought a late save out of Given as memories inevitably flicked back to Fulham's `great escape' from relegation with a 3-2 win at Eastlands in 2008.</p>

              <p>Arsenal threw away the chance of a fifth straight Premier League win as West Ham battled back to earn a 2-2 draw at Upton Park.</p>
              <p>The Gunners had looked in complete control following first-half goals from Robin van Persie and William Gallas. However, Carlton Cole pulled a goal back before substitute Alessandro Diamanti netted a late penalty.</p>
              <p>West Ham finished with 10 men when Scott Parker was shown a second yellow card, but were not to be denied a much-needed positive result.</p>
              <p>Vito Mannone - again preferred in goal to Manuel Almunia - needed treatment after being clattered by James Tomkins when coming to collect a corner.</p>
              <p>Arsenal felt they had a strong shout for a penalty when, on 11 minutes, Van Persie's strike appeared to hit Matthew Upson, the former Gunners defender, on the arm, but referee Chris Foy thought otherwise.</p>
              <p>However, a spot-kick was given with 10 minutes left when Song tripped Cole.</p>
              <p>After Mannone had been booked for not going back on his line, Diamanti levelled to send Upton Park into delirium.</p>
              <p>West Ham were reduced to 10 men when Parker, already booked, was shown a second yellow card for deliberately falling on the ball as Fabregas charged clear.</p>
              <p>Diaby was substituted for Eduardo as Wenger went for the win.</p>
              <p>However, the Hammers were not to be denied during four minutes of stoppage time, when Green somehow kept out van Persie's header.</p>

              <li id="quotes"><strong><strong>Hughes attacks defensive lapses</strong></strong>
              <p> </p>
              Manchester City boss Mark Hughes pointed the finger of blame at his defenders after Fulham stormed back to snatch a point at Eastlands. Hughes said: ''We were 2-0 to the good and we should have seen the game out but unfortunately we allowed them back in the game and given them a lift. </li>
              <p> ''Then it was how we dealt with balls into the box and a guy in Dempsey who is acknowledged as good in the air - and we haven't dealt with it. We've been caught out a couple of times this season and it seems to be prevalent this year, not just with us but with quite a few of the teams around us. We started really well in terms of our defensive work but we have conceded goals and we are working hard on that. There are always elements of our game we need to focus on.''  </p>
              <p>Meanwhile Hughes paid tribute to Fulham for a second impressive performance at Eastlands this season following City's extra-time win in the Carling Cup in September. Hughes added: ''Credit to them because probably the two games we've had the most difficulty with this season here have been against Fulham. They get organised and make it difficult.''  </p>
              <p>Fulham boss Hodgson was full of praise for striker Bobby Zamora despite a glaring 47th minute miss the manager described as ''horrific''. Hodgson said: ''It was an horrific miss and it was a pity because he played so well.  </p>
              <p>''Unfortunately people who watch on the TV will see the miss and they won't see the 96 minutes and 45 seconds in which he was absolutely magnificent. Really it should have been seen as the crowning moment of a great performance but instead it is going to be seen as a glaring miss and a blot on his copybook which is sad for him. But if you want a good example of the character and resilience of this team and its' ability to bounce back, Bobby's performance in the last 30 minutes shows that.''  </p>
              <p>Hodgson said he thought a draw was a fair result but had issues with the set-piece that led to City's opening goal after the referee over-ruled the linesman to award a corner. Hodgson said: ''I'm aggrieved by the corner kick. It was a clear offside which was seen by the linesman then over-ruled and that has cost us a goal.''</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong><strong>Wenger rues 'missed opportunity'</strong></strong></li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Arsene Wenger lamented the way Arsenal failed to hold off the late challenge of a battling West Ham side after letting their lead slip and accepted it was a ''major missed opportunity''. </p>
              <p> The Arsenal manager said: ''We were in control, but as long as you do not score the third goal, you know the game is not won. In fairness, West Ham continued to fight until the last minute and we conceded from two set pieces, which were generous ones. I do not think that either should have been given, but we cannot influence the decision of the referee.  </p>
              <p>''The crowd got behind the referee's decision and then it is always difficult away from home. We are an intelligent team and an intelligent team makes the maximum result with the game they produce. That is what we did not do. We complicated our game a little bit and had five or six chances in the second half, but we missed the final ball. That is what we have to learn.''  </p>
              <p>After Liverpool inflicted holders Manchester United's second loss of the season, Wenger reflected on two points dropped for his third-placed team. ''It is very frustrating,'' he added.''It is, of course, a major missed opportunity. In our job, you don't have this luxury. You need to get points when you deserve to get points and sometimes when you don't deserve to get the points. Today we never got them when we deserved them - and that means we have not made the maximum of what we should have done. But we have to keep the positives as we played well and are a strong team.  </p>
              <p>''We want to learn to finish these games off which is basically the most important lesson of the day. We have a great chance [for the title] this year, but you cannot repeat this kind of performance we had today and not come out with three points.''  </p>
              <p>West Ham manager Gianfranco Zola praised the fighting spirit of his team. Zola said: ''It is not a victory, but it sounds like it with the crows, and that is what I was looking for. No matter what, the spirit has to be there all the time. That is something we can not do without.  </p>
              <p>"Last week [at Stoke] I saw something, a change and it is very important and today I have seen something more. It was very difficult to come back from that situation, but we did it and I am very pleased and proud of them. I am more focused on the point and to give a signal we are there and we are fighting.''  </p>
              <p>While the Hammers - who have not won in the league since the opening day - remain in the bottom three, the Italian coach feels he has enough to be positive for the challenges ahead.  </p>
              <p>''Today was difficult and we did it and that means we can do it all the time,'' he said. ''With that spirit and with the qualities we have in the team, I think we can do better things starting today.''  </p>
              <p>Zola added: ''This team has got quality. We just need a bit more confidence. Now, every time we make a mistake they score. That does not help. We need to fight, fight, fight.''  </p>
