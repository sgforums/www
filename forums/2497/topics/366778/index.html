              <h1>Beckham's new underwear photos</h1>
              <h2>David Beckham shows remarkable ball control in new Armani underwear photos</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00044/becks516b_44717a.jpg" alt="David Beckham's new Armani pants photos" width="516" height="751"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>David Beckham's ball control isn't in doubt, especially now he's released shocking new photos for his Armani pants campaign.</h3>
              <p>In the outrageous photos, 34 year old Becks poses in just black pants, with greased hair with a side parting, clutching a huge length of rope.</p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>Crowds flocked to Selfridges in London today to see the unveiling of a mammoth sized poster of the England star. The crowd roared with delight and wolf-whistled, and one girl was actually sick with excitement.</strong></p>
              <p>Beckham seemed bemused by screaming fans. He said: "I don't mind having the photograph taken but it's a little bit embarrassing when it's unveiled."</p>
              <p>His wife, Victoria Beckham, was inside the store, personal shopping.</p>
              <p>Giorgio Armani said, "David has a great sense of style and is an inspiring role model - this is what makes him the perfect partner for Emporio Armani underwear. I am very excited that David Beckham's new campaign image was unveiled exclusively in his home country and where better than at such an iconic retail destination as Selfridges."</p>
              <p>The image was shot by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott renowned fashion photographers who are also responsible for the images of Victoria Beckham for Armani.</p>
              <p>The company has seen a 150% rise in the sale of their pants - as seen on Beckham - since the three-year deal, rumoured to be worth £10m launched in 2007.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <h3>Hair we go again.. Posh and Becks are back with the latest snaps from their Armani campaign - and this time Victoria is sporting a Lara Croft-style plait.</h3>
              <p>Victoria's severe crop of recent months is gone in favour of a fake ponytail as she drapes herself over David's oiled chest in the steamy new pants ad shots.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="inline-image-516"><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00047/posh1_47431a.jpg" alt=""></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>As well as the return of the rope that featured in the solo pictures of David released last month, it looks like Victoria's former 34DD bust is back too.</strong></p>
              <p>Posh reportedly had a breast reduction operation back down to 34B in May - soon after these images were taken. And there's no denying the chemistry between the two is still HOT as they approach their tenth wedding anniversary.</p>
              <p>But be careful where you study the new snaps. A bloke in Dubai has just been locked up for a MONTH for wearing the sexy 'Protect The Skin You're In' T-shirt.</p>
              <p>Raffi Nernekian was jailed for offending public decency and will be deported after serving his sentence despite having lived in Dubai for five years.</p>
              <p>Goodness knows what would have happened if they'd seen him wearing <em>those</em> pants!</p>
