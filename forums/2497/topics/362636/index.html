              <p>City began what promises to be a sensational summer of big spending with the £12m capture of Gareth Barry from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/aston-villa.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aston Villa</span></span></a> on Tuesday and they have now turned their attention to Cameroon centre forward Eto’o, along with Carlos Tevez and a number of other big-name stars.</p>
              <p>Scorer of the first goal in the Barcelona’ s 2-0 Champions League final triumph over  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Manchester United</span></span></a> in Rome last week, 28-year-old Eto’o is widely recognised as one of the world’s great goal scorers.</p>
              <p>City sources have indicated that Eto’o has been won over by their vision of the future, not to mention some astronomical wages, and that he is willing to move to Eastlands. Barcelona have also stated privately that they are willing to sell. </p>
              <p>The Spanish champions’ president, Joan Laporta, last night stressed that Eto’o had a contract with Barcelona, but he admitted: ‘The market is very dynamic and there could be surprises. He’s a wanted man and we know he’ll receive offers.’</p>

              <p><strong>During a meeting in Abu Dhabi with Manchester City's owners in February, Mark Hughes expressed some concern that he had not been able to bring in January transfer targets Scott Parker and Kolo Toure.</strong></p>
              <p>The reply from City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak was unequivocal. 'Don't worry, Mark. I don't think we're going to get relegated this season, are we?' he said smiling.</p>
              <p>'And in the summer we will start to spend some serious money.'</p>
              <p>A genuine move to put his manager's mind at rest? Or an attempt to fob him off before bringing in another coach at the end of the season?</p>
              <p>Hectic behind-the-scenes activity at Eastlands this week would appear to confirm that Khaldoon' s intentions were indeed honourable.</p>
              <p>First, Gareth Barry. Next Carlos Tevez. And then Samuel Eto'o. And Joleon Lescott. And Xabi Alonso. And others.</p>
              <p>Having prevaricated over the exact scale of their spending this summer, City's Arab owners have decided it is now kitchen-sink time. The richest club in the world will spend big this summer - and quickly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/06/03/article-0-052F90E2000005DC-492_306x423.jpg" alt="Gareth Barry" width="306" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Impressive: City beat Liverpool to the signature of Gareth Barry</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>If Barry's £12million capture from Aston Villa this week was impressive in the manner in which it blew a hole through Liverpool's plans, traditionally a bigger club, then what owner Sheik Mansour, chairman Khaldoon and manager Hughes also have planned could change the face of the Barclays Premier League in one summer.</strong></p>
              <p>And of all the above players, it is the proposed capture of Eto'o that would be the most remarkable. Signing Robinho from Real Madrid last August was one thing. The player had become unhappy in Spain.</p>
              <p>But to take Eto'o from Barcelona just two weeks after the 28-year-old Cameroon centre forward scored one of the goals that won the Champions League would be quite another.</p>
              <p>Eto'o is, by all accounts, tempted to leave the Spanish treble winners for a club that finished 10th in the Premier League last season. As astonishing as it sounds, Eto'o has verbally agreed to join City, while Barcelona have indicated they will do business for a fee upwards of £20m.</p>
              <p>Eto'o, Tevez, Robinho. To harness all three would be a statement of intent. Suffice to say, Valeri Bojinov, Felipe Caicedo and Benjani would struggle to get in the team. Hughes was given the go-ahead to pursue the players he wants at another meeting in Abu Dhabi last week and the way that he wishes his squad to develop is now clear.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/06/03/article-0-0530115B000005DC-426_468x482.jpg" alt="Head boys: Lionel Messi watches Carlos Tevez" width="468" height="482">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Head boys: Lionel Messi watches Carlos Tevez during a training session in Buenos Aires</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Having endured a difficult first year trying to bring some reluctant players and staff around to his own way of thinking, the City manager intends to jettison those he cannot convert and bring in those looking to buy in to a long-term philosophy.</strong></p>
              <p>The £25m-rated Tevez has indicated to City he is keen to leave behind what he sees as an ego-driven dressing room at neighbouring Manchester United and apply his selfless, energetic style to a team who appreciate or 'need' him a little more.</p>
              <p>At only 25, Tevez is the perfect age for Hughes, a coach who wants most of his first team be three or four years either side of that. Everton's £15m defender Lescott is 26, for example, Barry and Eto'o are 28 while Alonso and long-term target David Villa, of Valencia, are 27. City's interest in midfielder Alonso may surprise many, given the signing of Barry. But City's pursuit of the £20m Spaniard is ongoing, even if they do not anticipate Liverpool selling him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/06/03/article-1190649-0533A6AD000005DC-595_306x520.jpg" alt="hughes dream team" width="306" height="520"></div>
              <p><strong>All in all, we can expect City's work in the transfer market to be quick, dramatic and clinical. Hughes wants his new-look team to be together by the time City leave on a tour of South Africa in mid-July.</strong></p>
              <p>He has also indicated privately that he anticipates to be under enormous pressure next season. A source commented: 'If we lose the very first game then the whole thing will get ramped up again.'</p>
              <p>With this in mind, Hughes wants his squad to be built by him and in his own image by the time the season starts. He knows a slow start could cost him a job he would ideally like to keep for the next decade. We can, therefore, expect a number of players to leave between now and August - perhaps as many as a dozen.</p>
              <p>Some out-of-contract players have already departed but Hughes is determined to ditch the Brazilian Elano, who might possibly head for Italy, while the club will look to loan out striker Jo again - in all likelihood he will go to Spain - and will not stand in the way of captain Richard Dunne if Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp hardens up his interest after trying to take the player to Portsmouth last summer.</p>
              <p>As for Robinho, Hughes tolerated his off-field baggage and his woeful away form last season but, as revealed by Sportsmail in February, would consider selling him if a reasonable offer came in. This, too, has been run past chairman Khaldoon.</p>
              <p>Hughes wants players who care and who are scared of being dropped if they do not perform. All of a sudden, missing out on Parker in January no longer looks so important.</p>

              <p>The reply from City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak was unequivocal. 'Don't worry, Mark. I don't think we're going to get relegated this season, are we?' he said smiling.</p>

              <p>Samuel Eto'o is ready to quit Treble winners Barcelona for mega rich Manchester City.</p>
              <p>The <em>Daily Mail</em> says Eto'o is, by all accounts, tempted
              to leave the Spanish treble winners for a club that finished 10th in
              the Premier League last season.</p>
              <p>As astonishing as it sounds, Eto'o has verbally agreed to join
              City, while Barcelona have indicated they will do business for a fee
              upwards of £20m.</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p>Manchester City have been working for some time on a deal for Barcelona star Samuel Eto'o, it has been revealed.</p>
              <p><em>The Times</em> says Garry Cook, the chief executive, has spent
              several weeks putting together a package that he hopes will persuade
              Eto'o, the Barcelona striker, to move to the City of Manchester
              Stadium.</p>
              <p>With City willing to offer a fee in the region of £25 million
              for Eto'o, Barcelona would prefer to cash in now rather than lose him
              for nothing when his contract expires at the end of next season.</p>
              <p>Joan Laporta, the Barcelona president, appeared to hint
              yesterday that Eto'o could leave Spain this summer, although the
              Cameroon striker, 28, must decide if he is willing to forgo the
              Champions League for a season at least and accept the riches on offer
              at City.</p>
              <p>“The football market is very dynamic and there might be a surprise because he [Eto'o] is a much-coveted player,” Laporta said.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mark Hughes shouldn't be judge yet... Cos he hasn't been given enough time to prove himself... These last few years, he has taken Blackburn to the top 7 or 8 even when he didn't have any money to spend... And last year, the Arab owners came in a little too late to have any real impact... One Ronbinho doesn't make the team... This year we may see a different City altogether... and a more successful Hughes.</div>
