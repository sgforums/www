Drogba added he is "depressed, devastated and deeply unhappy" at Mourinho's departure and his future is still in grave doubt even after his talks with Grant.<br><br>The Ivory Coast striker has not played since aggravating his long-standing knee injury in the defeat at Aston Villa at the start of September, which began the slide leading to the final breach between Mourinho and Roman Abramovich.<br><br>Drogba had decided that he would not rush himself back to the training ground and risk making the injury even worse, instead demanding he was given enough time to heal properly.<br><br>But the Daily Mirror reports that Grant, aware that his new side are missing their strike leader so badly, made a personal plea to Drogba to show loyalty to the club and give him the backing he needs.<br><br>An insider told the newspaper: "Avram realised that he needed to make Didier believe in what he is trying to do at the club now Mourinho has gone.<br><br>"He feels that after the talks they are both of the same mind now and that Didier is keen to get back onto the pitch and show how much he has been missed."<br><br>If Grant's belief is correct, it will be a massive boost for the Israeli and the Blues, now down in sixth after suffering their worst start to a Premier League season since 2000-01, when Luca Vialli was sacked and replaced by Claudio Ranieri.<br><br>But the Israeli's view of the conversation seems to be overly optimistic, with Drogba still angry at the club and increasingly concerned about the condition of his knee.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Drogba keen to stay at Chelsea</strong><br><br>Jose Mourinho brought the Ivorian to Stamford Bridge for a club record Â£24million deal in 2004 and had a close relationship with him, leading to speculation Drogba could follow his old boss out of the club after the Portuguese coach's departure last week.<br><br>This was fuelled by the fact that Drogba had told friends he could leave Stamford Bridge too, but now the dust has settled he has vowed to continue playing at the club, where he is contracted until 2010.<br><br>He told The Sun: "I am not considering quitting Chelsea, I have a contract which I will follow through. I feel other players will feel the same way too.<br><br>"I will decide on my next step of action when the time is right and I get an offer.<br><br>"As footballers, we obey our contract and concentrate on building our career."<br><br>He added: "All of us will miss Mourinho."</div>
