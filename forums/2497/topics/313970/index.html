              <p class="story"><strong>Jonathan Woodgate</strong> <br>Before signing for Tottenham in January, Woodgate checked with Arsenal to see if Arsene Wenger wanted to follow up his long-standing admiration with a firm bid. The cultured central defender clearly fancied a move to the Emirates.</p>
              <p class="story">The only trouble was, Wenger had other ideas. Either the Frenchman didn't really rate Woodgate or he believed his squad contained enough quality centre-halves already. That didn't look the case at Anfield on Tuesday, Phillippe Senderos proving once again that he doesn't quite measure up at the top level.</p>
              <p class="story"> </p>
              <p class="story"> </p>
              <p class="story"><strong></strong></p>
              <p class="story"><strong>Igor Akineev</strong> <br>It would be unfair to point the finger at Arsenal's goalkeeper when trying to work out where things have gone wrong. Almunia, after all, has proved fairly steady since taking the gloves off Jens Lehmann. That's not to say that he inspires and reassures his defenders or that he will win you 10 points over the course of a season to turn challengers into champions. Akineev's displays for CSKA Moscow were good enough to attract Wenger's attention last year and have secured his status, at 22, as Russia's number one.</p>

              <p class="story"><strong>Franck Ribery</strong> <br>It didn't need a man-of-the-match performance against England the other week to tell us that Ribery, once of Marseille and at Bayern Munich since last summer, is a bit special.</p>
              <p class="story">Hindsight is a wonderful thing and but for Tomas Rosicky's injury problems we might not be talking about Arsenal's need for an intelligent wide man with pace and a goalscoring threat. Ribery gives you that and he would have offered so much more class and composure than, say, the temperamental outpourings of Emmanuel Eboue.</p>

              <p><br>Precisely he is French somemore and Wenger knows him too... So he got a better chance of getting him than any other clubs... like ah ben with Torres kind of thing. Ribery is a seasoned and experience player that could guild the younger players went going forward...</p>
              <p>To be fair, with his talent... $17m isn't a big amount... I was hoping to watch him in the epl after the way he played during the WC and i think wenger was the only one that could persuade him to come over... He going to Bayern was quite a waste considering they don't have CL football this whole season... and German league... boring...</p>

              <p>anyway, I think Gunners or Wenger will realise that they need to boost the numbers so with the EURO, good time to scout and buy.</p>
