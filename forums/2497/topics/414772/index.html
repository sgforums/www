              <h1>Henry: Unhappy players can quit Reds</h1>
              <p><strong><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/10/10/402x210/FernandoTorres_2519445.jpg" alt="" width="402" height="210"></strong></p>
              <p class="art-txt-first"><strong>John W Henry concedes no player will be kept at
               Liverpool against their will - but is surprised at how contracts matter
               so little in England.</strong></p>
              <p>There has been speculation this week over the futures
               of the Reds' star men Fernando Torres, Jose Reina and Dirk Kuyt, with 
              reports suggesting the trio could leave the club in either January or at
               the end of the season.</p>
              <p>And while Reds owner Henry concedes he wouldn't want to keep hold
               of an unhappy player, he is surprised at contracts in the Premier 
              League are barely worth the paper they are written on.</p>
              <p>"It is a completely different system here to what we are used 
              to," he said. "If a player has a contract in the United States they 
              fulfil the contract. Over here, it seems players have much more say-so 
              about where they are.</p>
              <p>"Frankly, we don't want a player at the club who doesn't want to 
              be at the club. It's really up to us to provide the kind of leadership, 
              on and off the field, that any player at the club or who is coming to 
              the club wants to be here."</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, he said of the key trio: "I was upset about the 
              assertion that they were leaving. There was one day when I read reports 
              that we were not going to be involved in the transfer window because we 
              do not have the funds. The next day I read that Torres and Reina were 
              leaving.</p>
              <p>"I have spoken with a number of our top players and was really 
              heartened by the response. I was heartened by the intelligence of these 
              players, who understand more about Liverpool than we do. They were good 
              discussions."</p>

              <p>I guess it is very hard for Ah Roy to command the squad if some of the players are not happy about his tactics.</p>
              <p>As for players who want to leave, it is no point to retain the players against their wish or else they will boycott a match.</p>
              <p>So, it will take a longer time to re-build Liverpool.</p>
