              <h1>Why Emmanuel Eboue should never play for Arsenal again. By John Cross</h1>
              <p></p>
              <p class="up"><img src="http://images.mirror.co.uk/upl/m4/dec2008/7/0/201D7F77-E94C-8E35-13E0A54FCBDE47A4.jpg" border="0" alt="Emmanuel Eboue " width="450" height="275"></p>
              <p class="up"> </p>
              <p><strong>Emmanuel Eboue should never play for Arsenal again. His sending-off at Tottenham on Sunday that cost Arsenal any chance of winning the game came from two stupid yellow cards and was the latest in a long, long line of mistakes.</strong></p>
              <p>I'm not talking about being booed by the Arsenal fans. David Hytner did a great and moving interview with him in the Guardian about how hurt he was when they turned on him as he was substituted despite being a sub against Wigan a couple of months ago.</p>
              <p>No. The fans don't like him because he dives, is not particularly good and his style on the pitch leaves them wondering whether he cares enough. His interview in the Guardian shows he cares.</p>
              <p>But, sadly, he hasn't learnt. Oh, no. His first yellow card was for dissent, chatting back to referee Mike Dean. Arsene Wenger was sitting right in front of the press box and was shouting at Eboue to get away. But he didn't.</p>
              <p>He should have been on his guard. But after being decked by Luka Modric, he swung out a retaliatory foot and tripped the Tottenham midfielder. Eboue knew what he had done. He even cheekily went to Mike Dean to plead for leniency for Modric. Then looked shocked when he got another yellow card. Wenger didn't see it. Surprise, surprise.</p>
              <p>But, amazingly, Eboue apologised for his sending off which ultimately meant Arsenal's ten men could never win. But just look at his apology.</p>
              <p>"I am sorry. This game was very, very important for us. We must always win when we play against Tottenham and give our best for the fans. "I am so disappointed to get the red card but I say thank you to my friends [team-mates] who gave everything. We drew and we are happy. It is a good point for us after playing so long with 11 v 10.</p>
              <p>"For the first yellow card I did not say anything bad. I was in front of the ball and I was talking with Almunia [following a foul]. After that I said [to the referee] you have to whistle before and he said OK. I came back to take my place and then he called me and gave me a yellow card. I don't really understand why.</p>
              <p>"For the second one, I touched him. I put my leg up because [Modric] had touched me before in front of the referee and he did not say anything. He kicked me when I tried to go forward and I put my leg up. The second card is normal, I accept it.</p>
              <p>"But for me the referee was not good today. It was a goal [in the first half]. I don't know why he did not give it. The referee said I touched Woodgate but I did not.<br>"I know have to control myself [on the pitch] but I did not want to let Tottenham win. I just wanted to give my best."</p>
              <p>You know, when I was a kid and I'd done something wrong (nearly every day!) I'd apologise to my Dad. So often, in fact, that he'd say: "I'm not accepting it until you mean it."</p>
              <p>Do we really think Eboue means it? No.</p>
              <p>Eboue needs a fresh start.</p>
              <p>And hopefully it will come this summer.</p>

              <p>true true, but if the manager says "i did not see him fouling"... what else you expect the player to react? U "got" the manager's backing leh...</p>
              <p>but in all, if in MU, I guess he is already at home, either with a cut to his eye or nursing his behind liao.. hence, magnifying the importance of good, old, mr SAF.</p>

              <p>Actually being an arsenal fan, I am not particularly impressed with Eboue's performances. He started out as a right back, and he impressed me then with his speed and enthusiasm. During the champions league final against barca, he did say something that hopefully he can keep ronaldhino quiet with his speed. But ever since that season, eboue's conversion from right back to midfielder has failed miserably.</p>
              <p>In midfield, he no longer displays the speed that he possesses. In midfield all I see are his dives, his mis-passes and his lousy shooting skills. Wenger gave him alot of chances, instead of playing pple like Vela, or ramsey, wenger stucked with him. Allowing him to play on the right and centre. But Eboue has never impressed in any of these chances.</p>
              <p>Another habit of his that I dont like is that, whenever an arsenal player is fouled, he would rush over and starting ranting at the referee or the opposition players. He would act like he is the club senior or leader and try to reason things out with the ref. NO!!! you dont do that, you will get a yellow card because you are not a captain, and definitely no a leader in the team.</p>
              <p>The second habit of his that i do not like is that whenever he dives, or is being tripped, he would turn to the referee and whenever the referee waves play on.... focus on eboue's face, you will see the "sian" face, the dejected face, the painful face, the watever you called F**king black face. I hate it, come on obviously you dived and you give that kind of face. Its a disgrace to arsenal.</p>
              <p>Time and time again, eboue has cause arsenal. He cannot pass well, his passes do not carry enough weight, he can dribble that well, he loses possession easily, he cant defend as well now, he cant shoots. Oh my god!!!!!</p>
              <p>I really hope wenger will sell him asap in the summer, we dont need him now... sell away these useless players and give the youngsters a chance. Not sell away players like flamini, gilberto and diarra (whom are the players that we missed most), and give the youngsters a chance. Damn it, wenger, sometimes you need to wake up soon. SELL SELL SELL.... Eboue, Diaby and Adebayor!!!... you will regret not selling these jokers!!!!!!!!!</p>

              <p><strong>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has criticised Emmanuel Eboue for his sending off in the north London derby against Tottenham on Sunday.</strong></p>
              <p>Eboue, 25, was dismissed for two yellow cards in the first half and Wenger says he must learn to keep his cool.</p>
              <p>"He didn't sense how far you can go," said Wenger. "When he got the first card it was unfortunate, but the second one, you cannot complain about that."</p>
              <p>Referee Mike Dean showed Eboue a second yellow after he kicked Luka Modric. &lt;!-- E SF --&gt;</p>
              <p>The dismissal meant Arsenal had to play for just under an hour with 10 men at White Hart Lane, though they defended manfully to earn a 0-0 draw.</p>
              <p>Wenger added: "During the game he had problems in dealing with his frustrations. We want to play a part in helping him to deal with that.</p>
              <p>"The other players want to help their partners to deal with frustrations, but you are also responsible for the way in which you deal with it."</p>
              <p>Eboue has had a troubled season, struggling for form and even being booed by his own fans when he came off the bench but was then substituted in Arsenal's 1-0 win over Wigan on 6 December.</p>
              <p>He is suspended for the Gunners' FA Cup fourth round replay at home to Cardiff on Monday.</p>

              <p>Actually being an arsenal fan, I am not particularly impressed
              with Eboue's performances. He started out as a right back, and he
              impressed me then with his speed and enthusiasm. During the
              champions league final against barca, he did say something that
              hopefully he can keep ronaldhino quiet with his speed. But ever
              since that season, eboue's conversion from right back to midfielder
              has failed miserably.</p>
              <p>In midfield, he no longer displays the speed that he possesses.
              In midfield all I see are his dives, his mis-passes and his lousy
              shooting skills. Wenger gave him alot of chances, instead of
              playing pple like Vela, or ramsey, wenger stucked with him.
              Allowing him to play on the right and centre. But Eboue has never
              impressed in any of these chances.</p>
              <p>Another habit of his that I dont like is that, whenever an
              arsenal player is fouled, he would rush over and starting ranting
              at the referee or the opposition players. He would act like he is
              the club senior or leader and try to reason things out with the
              ref. NO!!! you dont do that, you will get a yellow card because you
              are not a captain, and definitely no a leader in the team.</p>
              <p>The second habit of his that i do not like is that whenever he
              dives, or is being tripped, he would turn to the referee and
              whenever the referee waves play on.... focus on eboue's face, you
              will see the "sian" face, the dejected face, the painful face, the
              watever you called F**king black face. I hate it, come on obviously
              you dived and you give that kind of face. Its a disgrace to
              arsenal.</p>
              <p>Time and time again, eboue has cause arsenal. He cannot pass
              well, his passes do not carry enough weight, he can dribble that
              well, he loses possession easily, he cant defend as well now, he
              cant shoots. Oh my god!!!!!</p>
              <p>I really hope wenger will sell him asap in the summer, we dont
              need him now... sell away these useless players and give the
              youngsters a chance. Not sell away players like flamini, gilberto
              and diarra (whom are the players that we missed most), and give the
              youngsters a chance. Damn it, wenger, sometimes you need to wake up
              soon. SELL SELL SELL.... Eboue, Diaby and Adebayor!!!... you will
              regret not selling these jokers!!!!!!!!!</p>

              <p><br>Since he likes to talk so much and stand up for his fellow players, why don't Wenger make him the captain? Afterall, they don't have one at the moment...</p>
              <p>The part that I really like and found it really funny was, he went to Mike Dean to plead for leniency for Modric... lol</p>
              <p>At that point I thought, hey that was a nice gesture from him... Then the referee shown him the 2nd yellow and a red he look shock! I also wonder for what... Then they showed his retaliation towards Modric then I knew why...</p>
              <p>After that, they show his "nice gesture" towards Modric again in a replay... At that point I just can't help laughing at his acting... lol </p>
