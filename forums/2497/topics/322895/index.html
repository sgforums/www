              <p><strong>Newcastle have made their first signing of the summer with the surprise capture of Jonas Gutierrez from Mallorca.</strong></p>
              <p>Nicknamed “Spiderman” after he pulled out the webbed mask for his
                  goal celebrations, Gutierrez has agreed a five-year deal with The
                  Magpies.</p>
              <p>Primarily a wide attacker, Gutierrez is positionally perfect for the
                  4-3-3 formation that Kevin Keegan employed last season, although the
                  Argentinean can also slot into a 4-4-2.</p>
              <p>"Jonas is a wonderful signing for us,” Keegan told the club’s official website.</p>
              <p>"I know a lot of other clubs have been interested in him. He'll be a terrific addition to the squad.</p>
              <p>"He's an exciting player and I'm sure our fans will enjoy watching him."</p>
              <p>Gutierrez moves for an undisclosed fee in what is a complex transfer,
                  which sees half of the money that Mallorca receive go to former club
                  Newells Old Boys. The Argentina international featured in his country’s
                  last game, a 0-0 draw against Brazil, and he is desperate to show what
                  he can do in England.</p>
              <p>Jonas said: "I cannot tell you how excited I am to be joining Newcastle United.</p>
              <p>"The Premier League is a great place to play and I cannot wait
                  to meet my new team-mates and prove myself to the Newcastle United fans."</p>

              <h1>Spiderman's Toon Move In Jeopardy</h1>
              <h2>Kevin Keegan's first major signing of the summer is in danger of
              getting caught up in a hopeless tangle with the news that Real Mallorca
              are ready to take legal action against Jonas 'Spiderman' Gutierrez.</h2>
              <p>The Argentine winger signed a five-year deal with Newcastle earlier in
              the week, but only after using FIFA’s controversial <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>article 17 rule</strong></span></span>,
              which allows players who are over 25 to buy out their contract if they
              have been with the same club for three or more years.  <br><br>Mallorca's
              statements on the matter were stern to vague, and their case appears to
              be based on the fact that Gutierrez isn't actually 25 until this
              Saturday.<br><br>"We are unhappy with the attitude of Jonas Gutierrez
              and we will pursue this as a complaint," fumed Mallorca sports director
              Nando Pons<br><br>"We have claimed €12m (£9.5m) for the unilateral
              termination of the contract 'without just cause'. Mallorca will defend
              their interests.''<br><br>"This case has only just begun," warned club
              president Vicente Grande. "We will not be quiet and nobody is going to
              take us for fools. We at least want the €10m that Portsmouth offered us
              in the winter."</p>
