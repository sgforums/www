              <h1>Luiz Felipe Plans Luis Fabiano Capture</h1>
              <h2>Chelsea boss Luiz Felipe Scolari is looking to strengthen his attacking artillery following the injury to key striker Didier Drogba in midweek.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/34917_news.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The Côte d’Ivoire hotshot suffered a knee injury during Wednesday’s 0-0 draw at Cluj in the Champions League and the club have confirmed that he will be out for about six weeks.</strong></p>
              <p>While in theory he is expected to be back before the winter transfer market, there is a possibility that he could take longer to return to full match fitness and sharpness and even then, there is a likelihood of a relapse.</p>
              <p>With Nicolas Anelka in less than impressive form and not particularly too happy with his squad status, manager Scolari may be considering the option of bringing in another top class striker in the January trade period to boost his frontline.</p>
              <p>According to <em>The Times</em>, Sevilla’s Brazilian hitman Luis Fabiano is reportedly at the top of Big Phil’s Christmas shopping list and the Stamford Bridge bosses are expected to free up the necessary funds for the move, especially after missing out on Robinho in the summer.</p>
              <p>Luis Fabiano has a contract that runs until 2011 and his buy-out clause, as quoted by Spanish sports daily <em>As</em>, is set at a meagre €30 million (â‚¤24m) but the player himself reserves the right to 10% of the transfer fee. Money may not be an obstacle for Chelsea but they will have to negotiate with one of the most stubborn and inflexible club presidents when it comes to selling players, José María del Nido.</p>
              <p>The 27 year old striker joined Sevilla in 2005 after a dismal one-year spell at Porto and he has since netted 57 goals in 120 appearances in all competition for the Andalucian outfit.</p>

              <p><br>I think no one would be really interested on this fellow lah... Not that he is not a good player, but the jury is still out whether he can make it in the premiership... Fergie was interested on him as a cheap alternative earlier on and an $8m sum was mentioned but even then, he didn't go for him... Now that he has just signed a new contract, they have put in a buy out clause and are asking for $24m... This is a bit crazy...</p>
              <p>What Chelsea really need is a Premiership ready striker cos they don't have the extra time for him to get used to the premiership and ready... They need him to start hitting the ground running and know what to expect... Maybe players like Santa Cruz, Alves or Zaki... Then again, its so much like Chelsea... When there is a problem, buy your way out of it...</p>
