              <p>Real Madrid have put aside £60 million for a new bid for Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
              <p><em>Cadena Ser</em> says Real have the loan through Banco Santander
              and though the cash won't cover the entire deal, it will go a long way
              to bringing Ronaldo to Madrid in the summer.</p>
              <p>While Ramon Calderon is no longer with Real, his successor,
              Vicente Boluda, is in charge of plans for a new bid for Ronaldo and
              part of his remit is to find unity amongst Real's presidential
              candidates to begin negotiations with United before the summer
              election.</p>
              <p>Madrid sources insist Ronaldo was on his way to Real last
              summer, only for fears of a public backlash from United fans preventing
              the move from going through.</p>

              <p class="article">The Spanish giants are desperate to land the Portuguese international after tracking him for over two years.</p>
              <p class="article">His value has rocketed after he smashed 42 goals last season to help United clinch the Premier League and Champions League trophies. And he was crowned World Player of the Year in December following his spectacular displays for the Red Devils.</p>
              <p class="article">New reports in the Spanish media claim Madrid's latest bid will shatter the £46million fee Real Madrid paid Juventus for French legend Zinedine Zidane in 2001.</p>
              <p class="article">Bernabeu chiefs are understood to have brokered a deal with top bank Santander to loan them £60million to help finance their raid. But it is understood the overall offer for the 24-year-old will top that figure after United turned down Madrid’s £75million approach for the winger last summer.</p>
              <p class="article">Madrid insiders insist Ronaldo came close to joining the club last summer, only for the deal to fall through after he had a late change of heart and decided to remain at Old Trafford.</p>

              <h1>Next Real Madrid President Will Have Cristiano Ronaldo Option - Report</h1>
              <h2>Cristiano Ronaldo's future is set to be the subject of another long-running saga this summer as Real Madrid are reported to have a deal in place that means the next president can sign him.</h2>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Real Madrid's next president will have the option to sign Cristiano Ronaldo in July after the current chief pushed through an agreement that will put everything in place for the transfer, according to a report.</strong><br><br>Vicente Boluda, who will step down as interim president at the end of this season, has decided to press ahead with the deal and has signed all the necessary paperwork for Los Merengues to borrow around €70 million of the €100m transfer fee.<br><br><em>AS </em>state that Ronaldo and his agent have also put pen-to-paper on a contract that would see Madrid receive a hefty compensation fee should the Portuguese star back out of a summer move.<br><br>One hitch still remains. <em>AS </em>has revealed that Sir Alex Ferguson's wrath is still likely to have an influence on any proposed move, and the Scot could well block the transfer.<br><br>Ronaldo's story filled newspapers in Spain and England last summer and look set to do so again this year, with <em>AS </em>already at the forefront of the rumours once more.<br><br>According to the paper, the Portuguese international would earn an annual salary of €12m, his agent would pocket a fee of €8m for brokering the deal, and the transfer fee would be around €100m.<br><br>If agreed, the move could leave the new president with a huge financial problem on his hands as the Spanish giants already said to be around €300 million in debt.</p>

              <p>well, let's be fair, scoring 42 goals is a special year, not many wingers can do that.. his form is good barring he started from a foot injury.</p>
              <p>also,which team won't improve with Ronaldo?</p>
              <p>lastly, it is always Real Madrid's policy to tap up players whenever they deem fit due to presidency campaigns, but UEFA and FIFA seemingly can't do nothing about it cause RM is still the most successfully club in the world.</p>
