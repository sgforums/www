              <p>Then people still have the cheek to say the La Liga is a two club monopoly.<br>EPL has 4 to 5 clubs "challenging as a smoke screen of competitiveness" in the end.. A two club monopoly league as well.<br><br>2004–05 Chelsea</p>

Laughable. And dont get started with this season, with shock results like Wolves beat Chelsea, blah blah.. In the end Man Utd will win the title..Same goes for La Liga..either Real or Barca..

              <p>The difference is in the details... There is hardly any easy matches even for the top sides... While over in LaLiga, I think it's fair enough to say Real and Barce would usually win without breaking too much sweat... The lookout usually is for the result... By how many goals margin that is...</p>
              <p>If we are to look at the table of both sides, we will know that the win percentage for Barce is like almost 90%, while ove at the EPL, it's lesser by 1/3.</p>
              <p>The winners ultimately may have been the same this last few years but the process is definitely a vast difference especially the last year and the current one... And this is where the real interest lies... It's not just the first place that intrigue people, it's also the 2nd, 3rd and definitely the 4th too... And apart from all this if it's not enough, the fight for survival from the bottom 6 or 8 over the season is just as competitive and appealing to many.</p>
              <p>If we are to look at last season's table, the 3rd place side in La Liga finished 28 points behind the winner. While the 4th... 36.</p>
              <p>Over at the EPL, the 3rd only 11 points off, 4th... 16. Compare 16 to 36... Do you see the difference in competitiveness?</p>
              <p>This is the overall competitiveness of the league do you get it? And not just who wins... It's how they win it that matters too... </p>
              <p>And I see you have made up your mind about who is going to win this season's La Liga as well... Actually, I think most of us can and have too... I can probably make up my mind for the next five years as well... or maybe even 10yrs. It's either Barce or Real simple as that... But can you honestly put your hand up and say City, Arsenal or Spurs can't win the EPL in the next 2 to 5 years? or perhaps even next year? I don't think you can if you are being honest...</p>
              <p>Just 2 yrs ago, many pundits honestly believed Pool's time have come after finishing 2nd and only 4 points behind but who could have thought they ended up 7th right?</p>
              <p>So on competitiveness, it's definitely there... It's not just at the top, but it's everywhere... And I don't think we need a professor to tell us this when we all have eyes to see for ourselves right?</p>

              <p>Actually most of the leagues are either dominated by one club or
              two. If you like the BPL only, good for you. End of story. No need

              <p>why u say that when chelsea no hope of winning this season already?</p>
              <p>man city is a credible title challenger this season and in the future to come. last season their defence was poor that's why they lost many games to poor goals.</p>
              <p>this season their defence is much stronger. they seem to be emulating man utd style of play. 4-5-1 and one target man up front.</p>
