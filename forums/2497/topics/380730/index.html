              <p>Mark Hughes suggested recently that he might not need to do much
              transfer business in January. He will likely need to revise that
              assessment now.</p>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p>After
              such a bright start to the new era of being the wealthiest club on the
              planet, Manchester City have stalled with just one win in their last
              six games. The chill wind of winter is closing in on Hughes, who
              started the match in his best suit and ended up covering up in a City
              tracksuit top.</p>
              <p>With arms folded on the bench for most of the
              match, Hughes looked far from happy. He perhaps thought he had the
              basis of a squad that would make an impact, but City have lost the
              impetus of a bright start which promised so much, and where even a tilt
              at the title seemed a possibility. Now he urgently needs to get them
              back on track.</p>
              <p>Hughes has been trying to play it cool about
              City's transfer window intentions in January, but there is no
              disguising that the Middle East owners are going to have to dig deep to
              maintain their challenge.</p>
              <p>Robinho is Hughes' trump card, one he
              can cash in, or swap, and despite numerous denials about selling the
              brilliant Brazilian, there is little doubt that a parting of ways is a
              certainty. It's just a question of when because the if is no longer in
              question.</p>
              <p>Sooner, rather than later, is the word and, with
              Barcelona still anxious to recruit the former Real Madrid star, Hughes
              has the upper hand in demanding the players he would want from Camp Nou
              in part exchange.</p>
              <p>Hughes would like Thierry Henry, but the former
              Arsenal legend is more likely to move onto the States, as he has made
              it clear it would be tough to play for any other Premier League side
              after Arsenal. The Welshman would need to be at his most persuasive to
              change Henry's mindset.</p>
              <p>But if Hughes does give up on Robinho, as expected, then City need a <em>fantastista</em>,
              someone to pop up with a piece of magic. Roque Santa Cruz still looked
              short of sharpness after a long injury against Birmingham, and City
              missed Emmanuel Adebayor. City have so many options in attack, yet drew
              a blank. That must be frustrating for Hughes, who also had to shore up
              a leaking defence and, though he succeeded there, the department where
              City are supposedly strongest let him down.</p>
              <p>Fortunately for City,
              recent failures at Anfield ensure that a place in the top four can
              still be achieved, but that is this club's minimum requirement. Make no
              mistake: City want to be champions and, with Chelsea and Manchester
              United locked in conflict on Sunday, there is an opening to close the
              gap at the top.</p>
              <p>But City failed to make an impact at Birmingham
              and Hughes had to thank goalkeeper Shay Given for a penalty save
              against James McFadden to save them from defeat. Most highly successful
              teams require a top quality keeper. City have that in Given. Despite
              huge investment in the defence, two holding midfield players are still
              required to protect it.</p>
              <p>Birmingham are also under new owners with
              promises of £40 million investment in new players in January. Normally
              a quiet time for the big spenders, January might well be far more
              interesting than usual.</p>
              <p>Rafael Benitez is under most pressure to
              drop out of the 'big four', with City still favourites to take over
              their coveted status as one of the Champions League elite, but
              Birmingham have their own Benitez. Another Benitez who is going through
              a lean patch, he still hasn't scored for his new club this season.</p>
              <p>Of
              course, Christian Benitez has managed to change his name: the moniker
              that appears on the back of his Birmingham shirt is 'Chucho'. Perhaps
              Liverpool's Benitez should change his too. I am sure there are plenty
              of ideas for Rafa's new nickname.</p>
