              WENGER has launched an amazing attack on Spanish football and warned Cesc 
              Fabregas joining Barcelona or Real Madrid would be a step down in his career.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Arsenal boss attempted to ward off interest from the 
              European heavyweights after both clubs made it clear they are keen on signing 
              Fabregas.</p>
              <p class="article">Wenger's comments come after Gunners chairman Peter Hill-Wood 
              claimed earlier this week that informal talks between the Londoners and Barca 
              had already taken place.</p>
              <p class="article">
              </p><p class="article">The Frenchman said: "We have not been in touch with Barcelona. "We have an official dinner before every European Cup game and 
              of course there is a lot of talk but there is no official meeting about Cesc.</p>
              <p class="article">"There is no secret meeting because we do not want to sell our 
              players and anyway I cannot see anybody who has a competitive edge going to 
              Spain.</p>
              <p class="article">"They have two good teams, I confess that. But the third-placed 
              team [Valencia] is 24 points behind.</p>
              <p class="article">"This weekend the players planned to go on strike because they 
              are not paid. "It is a league that is in complete disarray. I don't know why 
              you want absolutely the best players who play in England to go to Spain. If you 
              are really competitive, you stay in England.</p>
              <p class="article">"That is where the competition is and that is where the best 
              players want to be. I have so many calls from Spanish players who want to join 
              us and want to come here.</p>
              <p class="article">"We want to keep this team together and improve from season to 
              season. I believe we have made a big step forward considering last season and we 
              want to do that again next season."</p>
              <p class="article">Fabregas' contract at the Emirates runs until 2014 and Wenger 
              is angered by the constant speculation surrounding his captain.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: "Nobody puts a gun to your head when you sign a 
              contract. We have more players who want to join us than players who want to 
              leave us.</p>
              <p class="article">"It should be absolutely logical to you that a player who is 
              paid as he is paid respects his contract. I respect my contract because I have 
              loyalty to the players, so why should the players not respect theirs?</p>
              <p class="article">"We have gone for a policy of development of the team over a 
              longer period.</p>
              <p class="article">"We have stood up for these young players so it is down to them 
              to pay us back, stay together and show that we can be successful together."</p>
