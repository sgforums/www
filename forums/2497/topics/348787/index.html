              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">ANDREY ARSHAVIN can become the Diego Maradona of the Premier League according 
              to Arsene Wenger.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article">Arsenal’s boss will unleash his Russian superstar for the first time today 
              against Sunderland as the Gunners look to close the gap on the top four.</p>
              <p class="article">And he is convinced that Arshavin — his recent £15million signing from Zenit 
              St Petersburg — has all the qualities needed to become an Emirates legend.</p>
              <p class="article">At just under 5ft 6in, Arshavin will be one of the smallest players in the top 
              flight.</p>
              <p class="article">Wenger said: “Yes, he is quite small. It is amazing that in football people 
              are always concerned about size but one of the best players in the world was 
              Maradona, who was the same size as Arshavin.</p>
              <p class="article">“Maradona was 168cms while I think Arshavin is 167 — so it is not a handicap.”</p>
              <p class="article">Wenger is more concerned about Arshavin’s ability to adapt to the English game 
              after just one competitive match in the last three months.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: “There has always been a question-mark about whether Russian players 
              can make it over here or not.</p>
              <p class="article">“There is always a culture shock involved. It’s not like he is coming here 
              from Wales!</p>
              <p class="article">“You can never be 100 per cent sure about any purchase. Some Russian players 
              are not exportable, but that is down to their personality. Arshavin has 
              personality, vision and class. And when a player is intelligent and mentally 
              strong he can become even stronger when he goes abroad.</p>
              <p class="article">“I believe Arshavin has what is needed because it was his decision to move and 
              have a new experience abroad.</p>
              <p class="article">“His biggest problem is that he is not completely match fit at the moment. So 
              we must give him time to adjust.”</p>
              <p class="article">Arshavin, 27, is likely to start on the left side of midfield at home to 
              Sunderland today and Wenger believes his presence will give Arsenal the 
              cutting edge and creativity which they have lacked far too often this 
              season.</p>
              <p class="article"><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00737/Diego_Maradona_737990a.jpg" alt="" width="380" height="529"></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The Gunners boss added: “What I like about Arshavin is that he is calm in his 
              final ball. Whenever a player can pass people in the final third they have 
              something special.</p>
              <p class="article">“We have always played with two creative players on the flanks, players like 
              Robert Pires and Freddie Ljungberg who are very important for our 
              efficiency.</p>
              <p class="article">“We are always looking at players who can introduce something special into our 
              team — and I think Arshavin can do that.”</p>
              <p class="article">Fellow striker Robin van Persie claims Arshavin has already made his mark at 
              the club.</p>
              <p class="article">The Dutchman said: “He has trained a number of times and believe me he is 
              really good. But I knew that from the European Championship quarter-final 
              match when he was unstoppable.</p>
              <p class="article">“The memories of that defeat are still painful but if I could have chosen one 
              player out of the Russian team for Arsenal, then it would have been 
              Arshavin. He is class during the training sessions at Arsenal.</p>
              <p class="article">“You see it immediately, how he controls the ball, always makes the right 
              choice and the intelligent way he finds space or is always in a playable 
              position.</p>
              <p class="article">“He is the ideal age and experience to bring good things for Arsenal. I’m very 
              happy that he’s here.”</p>
              <p class="article">Arshavin is ineligible for Tuesday’s Champions League clash with Roma after 
              playing in the competition for Zenit last year.</p>
              <p class="article">Wenger also has to cope without striker Eduardo, who pulled a hamstring after 
              his two-goal return to action against Cardiff on Monday, while Emmanuel 
              Adebayor is still ruled out by a hamstring injury.</p>
              <p class="article">But Emmanuel Eboue is available for selection today after completing a 
              one-match ban.</p>
              <p class="article">Fifth-placed Arsenal trail Chelsea by five points and third-placed Villa by 
              seven and Wenger says it is essential for his team to take advantage of the 
              two sides above them cutting each other’s throats when they meet today.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “We know somebody above will drop points today so we must make sure 
              we beat Sunderland and close the gap.</p>
              <p class="article">“I still believe we will finish in the top four but the only chance we have to 
              do that is to be as perfect as possible. If the others are perfect as well, 
              then well done to them.”</p>

              <p>Robin van Persie is prepared to sign a new contract with Arsenal - if they can prove their long-term ambition to the Dutchman.</p>
              <p>The Dutch striker, 25, has been offered a £70,000-a-week double-your-money deal to stay at the Emirates.</p>
              <p>Van Persie, who has 15 months left on his current contract, told <em>The Sun</em>: “Financially the last offer made by the club is fine but that isn’t everything for me.</p>
              <p>“It’s about my ambitions and how they can be fulfilled in the coming
              years. The club and I want the same and it is our intention we achieve
              that.</p>
              <p>“Arsenal have promised me they will do everything possible to
              make that extra step to a level where we win prizes on a regular basis.</p>
              <p>“In the last four years I’ve had only one prize, the FA Cup, and that’s not enough.</p>
              <p>“I want to achieve more and I feel I can play an important role in bringing Arsenal to a higher level.”</p>
