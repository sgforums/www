              <p>Martin O'Neill has resigned as manager of Aston Villa just five days before the start of the Premier League season.</p>
              <p>There had been speculation over his future at Villa Park with the

               League rivals.</p>
              <p>O'Neill was close to leaving Villa at the end of last season but opted to stay after talks with owner Randy Lerner.</p>
              <p>Kevin McDonald has been named the club's caretaker manager.</p>

              <p><strong>Martin O'Neill has resigned as manager of Aston Villa just five days before the start of the Premier League season.</strong> </p>
              <div>There had been speculation over his future at Villa Park with the impending sale of James Milner and interest in Ashley Young from Premier League rivals.</div>
              <p>O'Neill was close to leaving Villa at the end of last season but opted to stay after talks with owner Randy Lerner.</p>
              <p>"Aston Villa can confirm that Martin O'Neill has resigned as manager of the football club with immediate effect,'' the club said in a statement. "Kevin MacDonald, reserve team manager, has assumed the role of caretaker manager and will prepare the team for the opening Premier League game of the season against West Ham on Saturday at Villa Park.''</p>
              <p>Martin O'Neill added: "I have enjoyed my time at Aston Villa immensely. It's obviously a wrench to be leaving such a magnificent club. I would like to pay tribute to the Villa players, my coaching staff and the Villa supporters for all the support and encouragement they have given both the club and me personally during my time as manager.</p>
              <p>"I wish them all the best for the future. I will obviously be assisting the club in the immediate short-term with regard to the handover of my duties."</p>
              <p>O'Neill took charge of Villa almost four years to the day, replacing fellow Irishman David O'Leary at the helm. After finishing 11th in his first season in charge, Villa then sixth in each of the following three seasons.</p>
              <p>But O'Neil's tenure at Villa Park was tainted by poor performances in the second half of the season, which cost them the chance of Champions League football.</p>
              <p>O'Neill, who enjoyed successful spells in charge of Leicester City and Celtic before moving to the Midlands, is thought to have grown frustrated with a lack of funds to push the club on to the next level. That was not helped by the sale of Gareth Barry to Manchester City last summer, and James Milner is almost certain to walk the same path.</p>

              <p>All these years of hard work wasted because of yet another greedy American owner (Lerner) whose interest is definitely not in the club's progress in terms of football results, but rather, can the club generate enough income for him to breakeven and make money.</p>
              <p>Let's hope it's not a mass exodus of Villa players.</p>

              <p>Villa self destruct...Honestly I think you can see players like Abonlahor, Ashely Young and Downing leaving soon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway this is also 1 of the reason why the Manager was unhappy with MON.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p> “There were four players on the bench earning £40,000-a-week – Steve Sidwell, Habib Beye, Luke Young and Nicky Shorey,” explained the second source. “Lerner gave O’Neill the money to buy players but felt he didn’t use them. Over the last two seasons, it came to March and they were twice within a short distance of the top four but the manager didn’t freshen things up.”<br><br>Although there is no indication that Lerner wants to sell the club, sources close to the American say he wants to rein in his spending for 12-18 months.<br><br>Since O’Neill took over at Villa in 2006, the Midlands club have the third biggest net spend on transfers – averaging £16.5m per season – behind only Manchester City and Tottenham.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">MARTIN O'NEILL quit Aston Villa last night, after Brad Friedel became the latest big name to head for the exit door.</h2>
              <p>Croatian boss Slaven Bilic is the top tip to replace him, along with USA World Cup chief Bob Bradley.</p>
              <p>O'Neill was already frustrated by the imminent sale of James Milner to Manchester City. He was willing to accept that only if he could spend the fee on new quality players. But cash-strapped owner Randy Lerner insisted it must help balance the books.</p>
              <p>Fearing Ashley Young would be sold too, O'Neill was close to calling it quits. He finally snapped yesterday, though, when keeper Friedel announced he wanted to join Fulham.</p>
              <p>An insider said: "That was the final straw for Martin. "He'd worked so hard to get a top-six place and reach Wembley. "Now his side was being allowed to disintegrate before his eyes.</p>
              <p>"He was left with no alternative but to call it a day after four successful years in charge." Relations between 58-year-old Irishman O'Neill and American Lerner were amicable until last January. Then they fell out over the club's transfer kitty.</p>
              <p>They were talking again this summer but things blew up yesterday, after a meeting with Lerner's right-hand man Paul Faulkner.</p>
              <p>O'Neill was told he would not have as much to spend as he wanted, even after the Milner sale to City later this week which could see Stephen Ireland join Villa plus a cash adjustment of up to £18m.</p>
              <p>He was also ordered to raise money by selling Steve Sidwell, Luke Young, Curtis Davies, Habib Beye, Nicky Shorey and Nigel Reo-Coker.</p>

              <p>Timing not belly good but as Villa fan since 1976, I don't mind see him go.</p>
              <p>The football is boring, he threw away the Europa cup, team always panchet second half of season, loves Heskey, plays players out of position, holds a long grudge.</p>
              <p>Consistently finishing 6th is not an achievement. Considering his total player net spending, he should achieve more.</p>
              <p>Villa got good defenders and some speedy forwards. The team just needs a creative player or two to orchestrate, read game well and provide telling passes. And who did MON buy? His idiot clueless lackey Stiliyan Petrov from Celtic.</p>

              <p>this is really really not good for Aston Villa..</p>

              <p>Look at the players he bought... Ashley Young, James Milner... These players are worth a lot more than when he bought them... and then there is Gabriel Agbonlahor. He promoted him from the youth side and started his development when he came to Villa...</p>
              <p>How about the likes of <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/5527/james-collins"><span style="color: #000000;">James Collins</span></a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8210/richard-dunne"><span style="color: #000000;">Richard Dunne</span></a>... He lost 2 of his centre-backs and had to scout for cheaper options which he did to great effect... Getting Collins from the lower league cheaply and Dunne from City at a bargain who proved to be better than the $20m man who replaced him at City. Then there is still <span style="color: #000000;">Stephen Warnock and Brad Friedel not to forget...</span></p>
              <p>On the likes of Steve Sidwell, Habib Beye, Luke Young... They all were on high salaries from their previous clubs... They were not going to take a pay cut just to come to Villa. But their transfer fees were low cos their clubs had to cut cost... One from Chelsea, the other 2 from relegation sides Newcastle and Boro.</p>
              <p>On Nigel Reo-Coker, it's just unfortunate he became injury prone... But he was a good enough player that even Fergie and Wenger had an interest in...</p>
              <p>People should be thankful that Villa could even finish 6th on a consistant bases these last 3 seasons on the premier league table... Cos before O'Neill took over, they finished 16th, just two places above the relegation zone under previous manager <span style="color: #000000;">David O'Leary...</span></p>
              <p>But the most likely of event now is, Villa won't do better or even match their last 3 seasons for this coming new season.</p>

              <p><br>You may be confused... My reply was in respond to the post before yours... And I am not sure who you are referring is praising O'Neill. At that point of posting, the only one I praised was Rafa for being smarter in getting his compensation, thats all.</p>

              <p>Anyway, I never really fancy Villa even after all these years don't know why... Maybe I just didn't like their name... Sounds like a condo and not like a football club... lol.</p>
