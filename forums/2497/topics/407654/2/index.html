              <p>Funnily, I like Villa for its name.</p>
              <p>Names like "Liverpool" very funny to me.</p>
              <p>Brings to mind a pool of kway chap.</p>
              <p>Good Old Days of Villa need not be 6th position.</p>
              <p>They were champions of Europe once, when that competition was only open to actual league champions of all the countries in Europe.. No room for 2nd 3rd or 4th finishers or backdoor cup entry crap just to make more money for the organizers. Anyway how can you call yourself European champion when you did not even win your own country's league? </p>
              <p>Only Nottingham Forest and two other English teams whose names I forgot have achieved this feat.</p>
              <p>So don't say we should settle for 6th hor especially if your bandwagon is Chelsea, Arsenal, Spurs, Man City or etc..</p>

              <p>All these years of hard work wasted because of yet another
              greedy American owner (Lerner) whose interest is definitely not in
              the club's progress in terms of football results, but rather, can
              the club generate enough income for him to breakeven and make
              money.</p>
              <p>Let's hope it's not a mass exodus of Villa players.</p>

              <p>where did you get the idea lerner is greedy?? if he was greedy, he would never let a charity adorn the club's shirts instead of getting sponsorship money...and he never raised ticket prices which some new owners did as the the first thing when they came in</p>
              <p>he just didn't want villa to end up like portsmouth...</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">UNITED STATES World Cup coach Bob Bradley has emerged as an early favourite to take over from Martin O'Neill at Aston Villa.</h2>
              <p>The American connection with club owner Jay Lerner makes Bradley an obvious choice for the punters, and the coach made his mark in South Africa by winning England's qualifying group before seeing his team go out to Ghana.</p>
              <p>But there are some heavyweight candidates in the background, and Bradley dropped back in the betting as the odds shortened on former Charlton and West Ham boss Alan Curbishley.</p>
              <p>Curbs was quoted on Skybet at 5-1, with Slaven Bilic at 6-1 and, inevitably, Sven Goran Eriksson at 8-1 along with his old England sidekick Steve McLaren, now coaching Wolfsburg in Germany.</p>
              <p>Jurgen Klinsmann is another name in the frame, along with sacked West Ham manager Gianfranco Zola. Further out are Gerrard Houllier, Terry Venables and Stoke boss Tony Pulis.</p>
              <p>Intriguingly, two unsettled Championship managers get a mention - Forest's Billy Davies and Dave Jones of Cardiff City, both of whom guided their clubs to the play-offs last season.</p>

              <p>Timing not belly good but as Villa fan since 1976, I don't
              mind see him go.</p>
              <p>The football is boring, he threw away the Europa cup, team
              always panchet second half of season, loves Heskey, plays
              players out of position, holds a long grudge.</p>
              <p>Consistently finishing 6th is not an achievement. Considering
              his total player net spending, he should achieve more.</p>
              <p>Villa got good defenders and some speedy forwards. The team just
              needs a creative player or two to orchestrate, read game well and
              provide telling passes. And who did MON buy? His idiot clueless
              lackey Stiliyan Petrov from Celtic.</p>
              <p>Goodbye and good luck to him.</p>

              <p>consistently finishing 6th with more points every season and two cup finals last season is still some achievement...i dun think you can expect more from mon when u consider the fact that man city and spurs spent more than us and well we finished just behind them</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>speaking of who coming in, i wouldn't mind alan curbs....bags of experience, willing to bring in flair players(behrami, faubert, jensen,bellamy) and seem to bring in the good english strikers(ashton, bent,  cole)</p>

              <p>Villa's wage bill is actually higher than Spurs.</p>
              <p>The media loves MON and forgot that he did not just sign Milner, Dunne, Collins, Young and Warnock.</p>
              <p>Its not only Randy who noticed quite a lot of money was spent on players who just warm the bench.</p>
              <p>All in all he MON did not do much better than DOL whose highest finish was also 6th.</p>
              <p>Every one of MON's teams play dull hoofball ala Leicester circa late nineties</p>
