              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/102337/Edin-Dzeko"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Edin Dzeko</span></a> claimed he was excited about playing with <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/72490/Carlos-T%C3%A9vez"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Carlos Tevez</span></a> after he sealed a lucrative move to Manchester City on Friday evening.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto">Dzeko, who has scored 10 goals for a struggling Wolfsburg side this season, joins City in what is believed to be a £27 million deal, bolstering an attack that already features Tevez and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/100681/Mario-Balotelli"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Mario Balotelli</span></a>.</div>
              <p>City have handed the Bosnia international the No. 10 jersey previously worn by Robinho, and Dzeko has signed a four-and-a-half year deal. His debut is expected to come at home to Wolves next weekend.</p>
              <p>"It has been a long time that I have been linked with the club going back to last summer but Wolfsburg did not want to sell me until today," Dzeko said on City's official website. "There was too much speculation in the papers but my head is always clear. I was always attracted most to joining City.</p>
              <p>"They have been playing well this season. I have watched them a lot on television. Now the speculation is over and I just want to do my best."</p>
              <p>The 2008-09 German Footballer of the Year acknowledges the fact that he is joining a club awash with money, but he insists it is the chance to play with top players, not the financial incentive, that attracts him to Eastlands.</p>
              <p>"Everybody speaks about City having lots of money but it is not about that. It is about ambition and I have spoken to coach [Roberto] Mancini and he told me 'this is the best club for you'," Dzeko explained. "City are playing for first place in the Premier League and that is what I want. I am excited to play alongside players such as Tevez and [Yaya] Toure who I have only seen on the television and to be in the same team as players I have played against such as [Jerome] Boateng and [Vincent] Kompany.</p>
              <p>"They will help me achieve my goal to be better in the future. I want to show the fans why the club paid the money for me. Everyone expects goals and I want to score them but most of all I want to contribute to a successful team. I don't want to talk about my skill - that is for other people to judge. However, I know my quality and when I am fit I am not afraid of a challenge."</p>
              <p>Boateng has had previous clashes with Dzeko during his time at Hamburg, and he promised City fans that they have every right to get excited by the club's ninth acquisition under Mancini.</p>
              <p>"Dzeko has everything," Boateng said. "He can shoot right, left and can head the ball too. He is a very strong striker. He is a quality player. Against Hamburg he always played well and seemed to score, it was always a big challenge. He can hold the ball well and he knows how to move with his body. He has a good eye for the goal."</p>
