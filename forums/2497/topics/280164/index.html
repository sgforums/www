            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://muymerengue.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/galacticos-x1.jpg"><br><br>Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon touched on many contentious issues last night at a meeting of Madrid shareholders, but focused mainly on the new era of the club under Bernd Schuster.<br><br>First of all, he looked back to the unceremonious sacking of Fabio Capello in summer, defending his decision to can the man who brought the Liga title back to the capital.<br><br>"It was a risk. In no way was this a frivolous or capricious decision," he told the assembled crowd.<br><br>"We madridistas must of course be thankful to him for taking us towards the path of success. But having passed these initial hurdles, we now need to win with a beautiful game.<br><br>"That was the reason for the change. As for Fabio Capello, I wish him nothing but the best.<br><br>"But I reaffirm that we have done well to contract Schuster. It's not a change of trainer, but a change of sporting project. We've made a real revolution.<br><br>"The squad has changed in attitude and age. We've now formed one of Europe's best squads, and not a mere amalgamation of names."<br><br>Indeed, Calderon is particularly proud of the big-name signings brought in after a summer of incalculable expenditure.<br><br>"We've signed very well," he began. "All those that at first criticised are now full of flowing praise.<br><br>"Some say that we've not made galactico signings and, yes, that's the truth. But we no longer have a galactico mindset - no more can some players do certain things while others cannot.<br><br>"That broke the spirit of the group and caused fights. We haven't just spent; we have invested."<br><br>Indeed, so taken is Calderon with the new spirit of the squad, that he has urged national team boss Luis Aragones to grab a piece of the action by re-selecting Raul and Guti.<br><br>"Last year, only four of our players were regularly called by their international squads. Now, it's 17 of 25, although two that deserved to be were not," he blared.<br><br>"I extend my affection to Guti and Raul, who I hope play in the European Championships."<br><br>After giving his praises to the victorious Real Madrid basketball team, Calderon closed by saying that his team would, as always, play with the aim of winning all three titles this season.</div>
