            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p143/zococl/wenger2.jpg"><br><br><strong>Manager Arsene Wenger has admitted he feels "a bit lost" as he bids to prevent Arsenal's poor form in cup competitions derailing their season. Wenger has endured one of the most difficult spells in his decade-long reign at the club, with the Gunners losing in three cup competitions in the space of a fortnight </strong><br><br>Their poor run started with defeat in the Carling Cup final against Chelsea and continued as they were dumped out of the FA Cup by Blackburn and beaten by PSV Eindhoven in the last 16 of the Champions League.<br><br>Those results have been compounded by a host of injury problems - with captain Thierry Henry the biggest loss after being ruled out for the rest of the season - and the suspensions given to Emmanuel Adebayor, Emmanuel Eboue and Kolo Toure in the aftermath of the Carling Cup clash against Jose Mourinho's side.<br><br>Wenger said: "Recently we've hit the wall a little bit. "Not spectacularly but enough that we are not able to push on like on Wednesday night (against PSV). "On Wednesday we looked for something special but it didn't come because at the moment it is not in the team.<br><br>"It's the first time it has happened and I'm a little bit lost at the moment. "I'm always planning for the next game but at the moment it is a shock to the system as a club because it's the first time, but I am very busy planning for the Premier League."<br><br>The Frenchman is disappointed by the unavailability of key men as he bids to get his side back on track but has backed the Gunners, who face Aston Villa in the league on Wednesday, to hit form soon. "After such a disappointment it's difficult to pick yourself up again, but on the other hand I know how proud they are and how much they want to show that they have quality and finish as close as possible to Manchester United and Chelsea.<br><br>"We could have Mathieu Flamini and Justin Hoyte back (for the Villa match) and Tomas Rosicky will be a little bit short. "But we lose Gael Clichy, who is suspended and injured, and we lose Kolo, Adebayor and Eboue who are suspended again.<br><br>"We also miss Thierry, Robin van Persie...the list is so long I must take care not to forget anyone. "But it would be a disaster for us if this disappointment in the Champions League caused us to take our foot off the pedal. It is a big test of our mental strength to show we're on the up and nobody can stop us."<br><br>And Wenger believes his Arsenal, buoyed by the efforts of the squad's young players who starred in the Carling Cup run, will only go from strength to strength. "I think 95% of things are good in our team but at the top level it is the 5% that makes the difference," he told Arsenal TV Online.<br><br>"As hard as it is to take, I feel there's a lot of positives and although we have to correct (some aspects) we can keep the basis of a strong team. "This team is growing and becoming stronger and stronger."<br></div>

Before Anelka, there was Bergkamp. Before Bergkamp, there was Ian Wright. etc. But after Henry? Who can replace him? Adebayor? Baptista?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I think it's time to let Walcott and Aliadiere to mature under Henry. Adebayor seems to be picking up a thing or two from Henry. Ade has been drifting wide and cutting in to take his shot, just like wad Henry would do. However, he is still learning from the class act.<br><br>Arsenal buys players at low price, some are even free, train them into World Class players. However, they do not cash in on that. Players either leave on free transfer or Bosman ruling because of Wenger's policy to offer onyl a year contract to players over 30.<br><br>Henry should stay becos he is influential and he is the man to pull the entire team out of the pit.<br><br>Cheers.<br>CK</div>

Instead they offered him a better deal to stay. But who knows, now that he is contracted to them after re-signing a new deal... they may cash in on him still.<br><br>But i feel the problem with arsenal is they lack experience players... They have a record for cashing in on players reaching 30... Players who can still contribute to the team. Leaving them with very few experience players who are vital when the going gets tough.<br><br>Good young players are great to watch but when it comes to the difficult period or pressure moments... They don't bring it.<br><br>Getting rid of Sol Cambell, Lauren and Pires was a mistake. Cambell and Lauren are still doing a great job for Portsmouth, the lost of Pires seem to have an effect on Henry too.<br><br>I am guessing that they are also planning to get rid of Lehmann and Ljungberg very soon.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>the reason they are cashing in on players reaching 30 cos the need the money since most of their funds were used to build the emirates.<br><br>but wenger should learn from big sam. furthermore players above 30 dont ask for   bombastic wages, unless you are becks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> , and they also dont mind sitting on the bench and coming on as a sub most of the time.<br><br>these players can control the game and calm the nerves of the young players. especially in the last 10 mins of a game when the are leading by a single goal.</div>
