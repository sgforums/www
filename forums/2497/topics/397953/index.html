              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ROBERTO MANCINI has told Carlos Tevez he should leave Manchester City if he is unhappy. The Argentinian hitman has earned himself cult status with the Eastlands faithful in his 28-goal debut season. But Tevez, 26, admitted in a recent interview he was unimpressed with the strict training regime introduced under Italian boss Mancini.</h2>
              <p class="article">That alerted top European clubs like Real Madrid and led to reports the striker could leave if City fail to secure Champions League football next term.</p>
              <p class="article">Mancini does not feel there is a major problem but told Tevez to shoot the Blues into the top four - and then come and talk to him about his future.</p>
              <p class="article">Mancini said: "If a top player is not happy to stay here, it's better to go to another team. "This is the same for Tevez, for Manu Adebayor, for me, everyone. It is important that, when a manager or player works in a team, he must be happy to work in this team.</p>
              <p class="article">"It's not good for the club, squad or the player if he is not happy. "I don't know if Tevez is unhappy but he must be content because we have to play three important games.</p>
              <p class="article">"I think he's happy as he's worked very well the last two weeks. I hope he can score three or four goals in the next three games and then we can decide if he has a problem."</p>
              <p class="article">Craig Bellamy is another City star who has been reported to be eyeing the Eastlands exit door this summer. Mancini added: "If a player is not happy, it's better to change squads. That goes for England or Italy."</p>
              <p class="article">The former Inter Milan chief was surprised by Tevez's complaints about the double training sessions he introduced following his arrival in December. Mancini spoke to the ex-Manchester United star about his outburst and says they have now cleared the air.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "I don't know if he has a problem but he works very well now. What we said is private. "We trained twice in the same day only four times in five months. Two of those times Tevez was in Argentina, one time he didn't train.</p>
              <p class="article">"When we don't have a midweek game, I train two times on Tuesday because it's the only way I know. "When I speak to a player I don't need an apology. I know players very well and I know this situation."</p>
              <p class="article">If the top European clubs do come calling, Mancini will advise Tevez to stay - as winning with City would be so much more special.</p>
              <p class="article">The Italian said: "Does he need Champions League football? Probably. All the players want to play in the Champions League.</p>
              <p class="article">"But when you work with the manager or the club to build, the important thing is you win with a club that never wins for a long time.</p>
              <p class="article">"Real Madrid and Barcelona win every year. I prefer to win with City than Real because there the manager and players are always winning. Changing the history of this club is another thing."</p>

              <p>Wat city needs is a top class coach. Mancini is only considered average like Benitez. They need a mourinho, Wenger, ferguson, capello hiddink, ancelotti, del bosque, guardiola kind of coach.</p>
              <p>And they should not use money to lure players, this will corrupt the players' motivation to play soccer since they are now so fucking rich that they can get away with anything they do and fuck all the girls that they want.</p>
              <p>For example, just look at adebayor, with his rich salary, just look at his recent fucking idiotic looking hairstyle against arsenal. Even my house mop looks nicer.</p>

              <p><br>Mancini not bad la. City is really better under him. Win more draw less.</p>
              <p>But he shall stop acting like big boss. End of the day all his player don't click with him and cannot get into 4th. Off he will still go.</p>
