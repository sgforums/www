United had two good chances in the first half but Wayne Rooney's shot was blocked and John O'Shea hit the bar. Lille grew in confidence but failed to capitalise as Jean Makoun wasted a header from six yards and Peter Odemwingie's header rattled the post.<br><br>Larsson sealed victory in the 72nd minute when he headed home Cristiano Ronaldo's cross from the left. The Old Trafford crowd did their best to rouse United but they had to wait 15 minutes for the home side to hit their stride and conjure two excellent chances in quick succession.<br><br>Scholes, playing his 100th European match, sailed the ball in to a waiting Rooney in the box but his right-footed volley was blocked by Mathieu Chalme. Michael Carrick took the resulting corner and O'Shea rose for the ball only to see his header clatter the bar while Lille keeper Tony Sylva was all at sea.<br><br>A jittery Lille defence cleared their lines and soon afterwards created their best chance to peg back United. Ludovic Obraniak delivered a pinpoint free-kick to Makoun and he should have done better from six yards, but instead opted to tamely head to Edwin Van der Sar.<br><br>United's frustration grew as Lille began to work their way back into the game.<br>Rooney found himself forced back to help out in defence far too often while at the other end Ronaldo was booked for diving in the box, although there was some contact from Chalme.<br><br>It was Ronaldo's injection of pace which turned the match on its head after 72 minutes. Racing up the left wing, he fed the ball to Larsson, who was unmarked in the box, and the Swede stretched to head beyond Syla.<br><br>Three minutes later, Alan Smith came on for Larsson, who after giving United the perfect farewell gift left to huge applause. United's triumph was marred slightly as Mikael Silvestre left the field on a stretcher with a suspected dislocated shoulder in the dying minutes of the match after falling awkardly.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Man Utd: Van der Sar, Neville, Ferdinand, Vidic, Silvestre, Carrick, Scholes, O'Shea, Ronaldo (Richardson 82), Rooney (Park 82), Larsson (Smith 74).<br>Subs Not Used: Kuszczak, Heinze, Brown, Giggs.<br><br>Booked: Ronaldo, Richardson.<br><br>Goals: Larsson 72.<br><br>Lille: Sylva, Chalme, Tavlaridis, Plestan, Tafforeau, Makoun, Dumont (Fauvergue 74), Keita, Obraniak, Michel Bastos (Debuchy 46), Odemwingie (Mirallas 74).<br>Subs Not Used: Malicki, Youla, Franquart, Lichtsteiner.<br><br>Booked: Makoun, Chalme, Tafforeau, Plestan.<br><br>Att: 75,182<br><br>Ref: Luis Medina Cantalejo (Sevilla).<br><br></div>

Bayern stormed back from a 3-2 defeat in Spain to beat Real 2-1 on the night and qualify on the away goals rule after a 4-4 aggregate, while United beat Lille 1-0 at Old Trafford for a 2-0 aggregate win, ending an acrimonious knockout round tie.<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42653000/jpg/_42653941_horror416.jpg"><br><span class="small">PSV players look on in dismay as Alex's unlucky deflection makes it 1-1 on aggregate and throws the Gunners a lifeline</span><br><br>PSV drew 1-1 at Arsenal, their defender Alex scoring an own goal and then the vital late equaliser to secure a 2-1 win over the two legs and deny England the chance of becoming the first country to put four clubs into the last eight.<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42654000/jpg/_42654035_kakaaet416.jpg"><br><span class="small">Kaka eventually opens the scoring in the first few minutes of extra time, slipping the ball under Celtic keeper Artur Boruc</span><br><br>Milan needed extra time to get past Celtic as their Brazilian playmaker Kaka scored a fine winner in the 93rd minute after the teams had been goalless for 180 minutes.<br><br>Bayern, United, Milan and PSV will join 2005 winners Liverpool, Chelsea, AS Roma and Valencia, who all qualified on Tuesday, in the quarter-final and semi-final draw on Friday. Both last year's finalists are out, however, as runners-up Arsenal join Barcelona, knocked out by Liverpool, on the sidelines.<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42653000/jpg/_42653771_bayern416.jpg"><br><span class="small">Bayern Munich 2-1 Real Madrid (agg 4-4): Roy Makaay raises Bayern's hopes with a goal within 10 seconds</span><br><br>Bayern's triumph was a classic encounter between two European heavyweights and the tone was set when Dutch striker Roy Makaay put the Germans ahead after 10 seconds - the fastest goal in Champions League history. Bayern created and missed a host of chances before Lucio headed the second in the 66th minute but a penalty converted by Real's Dutch forward Ruud van Nistelrooy made for a pulsating finish, marred by two red cards.<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42654000/jpg/_42654059_diarra416.jpg"><br><br>Bayern's Mark van Bommel and Real's Mahamadou Diarra were dismissed after receiving second yellow cards as they jostled before Nistelrooy took the spot kick.The result extended nine-times champions Real's appalling record in Germany, where they have now won only one of 21 European matches.<br><br><strong>LARSSON STRIKES</strong><br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42653000/jpg/_42653985_larssen300.jpg"><br><br>Manchester United's Swedish on-loan striker Henrik Larsson, playing his last competitive home game for them before returning to his native Helsingborg, headed their winner 18 minutes from the end of a dour game. United will certainly be glad to see the back of a tie that was dogged by animosity since their controversial winner against Lille in Lens two weeks ago.<br><br>The French team's players appeared to walk off the pitch in protest at Ryan Giggs's quickly-taken free kick and their club appealed unsuccessfully to UEFA while United were unhappy with the way their fans were treated. The two managers have exchanged barbs, with United's Alex Ferguson accusing Lille of adding to an already inflammatory situation with their behaviour since the game in France.<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42653000/jpg/_42653999_alexheader416.jpg"><br><br>Brazilian defender Alex was villain-turned-hero for PSV, deflecting in a 58th minute own goal but then rising superbly to head the equaliser in the 83rd minute to put the Dutch through. Arsenal's exit capped a calamitous 10 days which saw them lose a stormy League Cup final to Chelsea and then get dumped out of the FA Cup by Blackburn Rovers.<br><br>The draw for the quarter-and semi-finals will be held on Friday in Athens, which is also hosting the final on May 23.<br></div>
