Following further tests, however, it has been decided that he needs a new personal fitness schedule to overcome the strain. "He won't be fit for a while," said coach Ronald Koeman.

RosickÃ½, who like Henry will not face Reading FC in the Premiership on Saturday, will also sit out the decider against the Dutch Eredivisie leaders with a groin injury. Midfielders Mathieu Flamini (foot) and Abou Diaby (ankle), defender Justin Hoyte (hamstring) and forward Robin van Persie (foot) are also unavailable for Saturday's game.<br><br><strong>Three suspended</strong><br>Togolese striker Emmanuel Adebayor and Ivorian defenders Kolo TourÃ© and the injured Emmanuel EbouÃ© (ankle) were suspended for the Reading game following the fracas in Sunday's League Cup final defeat by Chelsea FC, but can play in the UEFA Champions League, if fit.<br><br></div>

Beckham sustained a knee injury during the second half of the Primera Liga clash with Getafe, and he will undergo tests on Monday to determine the extent of the problem. </strong><br><br>Capello has already ruled the former England captain out of this week's Champions League second leg against Bayern Munich, while the midfielder must also be a doubt for next weekend's league showdown at Barcelona.<br><br>Beckham is not the only injury headache for Capello though, with former Premiership pair Jose Antonio Reyes and Ruud van Nistelrooy suffering knocks along with Gonzalo Higuain. Former Arsenal forward Reyes was stretchered off after suffering a knee injury in the first half, while ex-Manchester United player Van Nistelrooy and his fellow striker Higuain both have bruised thighs.<br><br>When asked about the injuries to Reyes and Beckham, Capello said: "Neither of them will play in Germany. One of the injuries is serious and the other could be something important. "We will have to see tomorrow."<br><br>The initial diagnosis is that Beckham has suffered an injury to the internal lateral ligament in his right knee, while Reyes has the same problem but in his left knee.<br><br>Beckham sustained his injury midway through the second half, after attempting a cross and then running into the advertising hoardings behind the goal.<br><br>He stayed on the pitch for a while seemingly in a bid to run the injury off but, with no apparent improvement, he was substituted with Antonio Cassano taking his place.<br><br>Beckham, who was back in the Madrid starting line-up after being suspended for last weekend's derby at Atletico Madrid, had earlier hit the Getafe crossbar with a 25-yard thunderbolt in the first half.<br><br>The former England captain was also involved in the build-up to Madrid's equaliser just before half-time, which led to Ruud van Nistelrooy slotting home from the penalty spot to earn his side a 1-1 draw.<br><br>Despite only picking up a point from the match, Capello was pleased with his team's overall performance.<br></div>

Saha will have a scan after picking up an injury, while Rooney is cleared to play despite cutting his leg in a clash with Liverpool's Jamie Carragher. But manager Sir Alex Ferguson said: "Wayne is fine now and will be fit for selection. We have a couple of doubts."<br><br>Patrice Evra is a doubt while Darren Fletcher has an ankle injury. Fletcher could miss the rest of the season following a scan on the injury he picked up against Reading in the FA Cup. "The news wasn't good. He'll be out for two months. It's a blow for the lad," said Sir Alex Ferguson.<br><br>The United boss said it was not clear what the injury to Saha was. "We are not 100% sure what the problem is," said the United boss. "We have sent him for a scan to try to find out but he will not be fit for Lille."<br><br>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is also sidelined as United look to protect a 1-0 lead. He is out for three weeks following knee surgery. It seems Ferguson has little option but to partner Rooney with Henrik Larsson in attack in the last-16 encounter at Old Trafford.<br><br>Rooney will be looking for his first goal in the Champions League since he scored a hat-trick on his debut against Fenerbahce in September 2004.<br></div>

News that a knee ligament injury would keep the midfielder out of Wednesday's return in Munich is a weight off the coach's mind.<br><br>"Beckham's injury is a big blow to them," Hitzfeld told a news conference on the eve of the return at the Allianz Arena. "He's a player who can decide a game by himself with his delivery from set-pieces.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">PREVIEW- WED Mar 7 UEFA Champions League</span><br><br>Queiroz wants United to keep cool</strong><br><br>Manchester United and Lille renew Champions League hostilities at Old Trafford on Wednesday, two weeks after a stormy first leg of their first knockout round tie sparked protests, insults and UEFA charges. United grabbed a fortunate 1-0 victory in Lens' Felix-Bollaert Stadium, Lille's home for Champions League matches, with a quickly-taken Ryan Giggs free kick that caused uproar amongst Lille players who briefly walked off in protest.<br><br>Lille, who subsequently appealed unsuccessfully to UEFA to have the goal ruled out, have since been charged with improper conduct and also find themselves in hot water over crowd disturbances during the game. The northern French club are still seething, with goalkeeper Tony Sylva accusing Giggs on Tuesday of "anti-sporting behaviour" and they will provide feisty resistance to a United side who lead the Premier League by nine points.<br><br>United's preparations have been hit by injuries to striker Louis Saha and midfielder Darren Fletcher, both of whom are ruled out of the return. Paul Scholes and Patrice Evra are struggling to be fit. The good news for the Reds is that England striker Wayne Rooney, who hobbled off in the 1-0 victory over Liverpool on Saturday, has been declared fit.<br><br>United have never lost to a French club at home and are strong favourites to progress, although assistant manager Carlos Queiroz has called for calm heads in what is likely to be crackling atmosphere. "We are in front so we need a cool approach to the game," he told United's Web site (www.manutd.com). "We've got to control the game from the very first minute.<br><br>"We must make our Theatre of Dreams a nightmare for them." Lille will be bolstered by the return of winger Kader Keita who was suspended for the first leg.<br><br>Elsewhere on Wednesday, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, who between them have won Europe's glittering club prize 13 times, will slug it out in the Allianz Arena. Real, who will be without the rejuvenated David Beckham and Jose Antonio Reyes because of injury, edged the home leg 3-2 but Bayern have run into a rich vein of form at just the right time.<br><br>Italian six-times winners AC Milan have also seen the light after a difficult season, winning eight of their last 10 Serie A games, and will be favourites to finish the job against Celtic after the first leg in Glasgow ended 0-0.<br><br>Arsenal's entire season will be on the line when they attempt to overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit against PSV Eindhoven at the Emirates Stadium. The Dutch smothered Arsenal's attacking flair two weeks ago and Gunners boss Arsene Wenger will be tempted to play talismanic striker Thierry Henry from the start of what could be a fraught evening after declaring him recovered from injury.<br><br>"I feel 1-0 is a tricky score. It is difficult psychologically more than footballistically," Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger told the club's Web site. "But obviously we will have to strike the right balance and try and get one back as quickly as possible."<br></div>
