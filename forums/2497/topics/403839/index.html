              (front) and his UEFA counterpart Michel Platini be heading for an about

              </div>
              <p>FIFA president Sepp Blatter has apologised to England 
              over Frank Lampard's disallowed 'goal' and revealed they will again look
               at goal-line technology.</p>
              <p>Lampard's effort during England's 4-1 
              defeat to Germany was ruled out even though the ball clearly crossed the
               line and has led to renewed calls for the introduction of technology.</p>
              <p>Blatter
               told a media briefing in Johannesburg: 'It is obvious that after the 
              experience so far in this World Cup it would be a nonsense to not reopen
               the file of technology at the business meeting of the International FA 
              Board in July.</p>
              <p>'Personally I deplore it when you see evident 
              referee mistakes but it's not the end of a competition or the end of 
              football, this can happen.</p>
              <p>'The only thing I can do is yesterday I
               have spoken to the two federations [England and Mexico] directly 
              concerned by referees mistakes. I have expressed to them apologies and I
               understand they are not happy and that people are criticising.</p>
              <p>'We
               will naturally take on board the discussion on technology and 
              have first opportunity in July at the business meeting.'</p>

              <p>Sunday night's match between Argentina and Mexico had also thrown up
              a controversial incident, with Carlos Tevez scoring the opening goal
              from a blatantly offside position.</p>
              <p>FIFA had blocked any further 
              experiments with technology at a
              meeting of the International FA Board, the game's rule-making body, in
              March.</p>
              <p>Blatter added: 'It happened in 1966 and then 44 years later
               - though 
              it was not quite the same.</p>
              <p>'I apologised to England and 
              Mexico. The English said 'thank you and accepted that you can win [some]
              and you lose [some], and the Mexicans bowed their head and accepted 
              it.'</p>

              <p>South African police have arrested a British 
              journalist for helping a fan gain access to the England dressing room 
              after a World Cup soccer match.</p>
              <p>Sunday Mirror reporter Simon 
              Wright was arrested in Cape Town on Monday after closed circuit 
              television footage indicated<br>he helped Pavlos Joseph get into the 
              dressing room after their draw with Algeria.</p>
              <p>'The police have 
              reason to believe this incident was orchestrated,' said , national 
              police commissioner Bheki Cele. 'The police believe the motive was to 
              put the World Cup security in a bad light and possibly to profit from 
              it.'</p>

              <p>The FIFA president added that the IFAB would only look 
              again at goal-line technology and not video replays.</p>
              <p>Blatter 
              said: 'The only principle we are going to bring back for discussion is 
              goal-line technology.</p>
              <p>'Football is a game that never stops and the
               moment there was a discussion if the ball was in or out, or there was a
               goal-scoring opportunity, do we give a possibility to a team to call 
              for replays once or twice like in tennis?</p>
              <p>'For situations like the
               Mexico game you don't need technology.'</p>
              <p>Blatter
              added that FIFA would launch a new drive to improve refereeing 
              standards at the top level later this year.</p>
              <p>'We will come out 
              with a new model in November on how to improve high level referees,' he 
              added. 'We will start with a new concept of how to improve match 
              control. I cannot disclose more of what we are doing but something has 
              to be changed.'</p>
