            <div class='col-md body'>West Ham chairman Eggert Magnusson has expressed his wish to keep Alan Curbishley at the club despite talk of the boss being under pressure.<br><br>Click here<br>The Icelandic businessman has called on Hammers fans to get behind Curbishley and has given his '100% backing' to the manager.<br><br>West Ham have won just once in 10 Premiership games since Alan Pardew was sacked but Magnusson has been infuriated by reports he has given successor Curbishley three matches to get the club back on the winning track.<br><br>Magnusson said: 'Alan will take us through this difficult stage. Talk of a three-game deadline is nonsense, I hope that Alan is here for the long-term.<br><br>'To put the record straight, Alan has my 100 per cent backing. He has had it since day one and he has it going forward. He is the right man for this job.'<br><br>Magnusson insists his ties to Curbishley have been strengthened by working together during the transfer window.<br><br>He added: 'It was a learning experience for me, and I feel it made our ties that much stronger. I have experienced that life is not always easy, there are always difficulties to overcome, but the only way to get past them is to fight to turn them into advantages.<br><br>'That is how I have directed my life and that is what we will do at West Ham United.'<br><br>Magnusson, who celebrated his 60th birthday yesterday, also praised the Hammers fans.<br><br>He said: 'I have nothing but praise for our supporters. They are fantastic. The only thing I would ask is that you now stand firmly behind the players and management and give them 110% encouragement in the games that we must win in order to be where we are going to be next season... in the Premier League.'<br><br>~~tink epl nx victim tio sack is "HE"..</div>
