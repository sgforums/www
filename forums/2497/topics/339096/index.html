              <h1>Xabi Alonso Finally Commits Future To Liverpool</h1>
              <h2>The Spanish playmaker has reached a moment of clarity and has revealed he has no plans to leave Anfield...</h2>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>As Liverpool battled Aston Villa to try and prise away skipper Gareth Barry by any means necessary, Xabi Alonso was left to feel very much like Robinho was by Real Madrid as they chased Cristiano Ronaldo all summer long.</strong><br><br><em>Los Blancos'</em> neglect of their own has cost them dearly. The Brazilian left the Spanish champions and is now realising his full potential in a more prominent role in a Manchester City side that will have unlimited resources with which to strengthen the squad to launch an assault on the Champions League qualification spots and announce themselves on the world stage.<br><br>Liverpool got a little luckier. Xabi Alonso was certainly eager to leave and on several occasions, albeit subtly, talked up the interest from Italian giants Juventus. However, as the Reds failed in their bid to buy Barry, Xabi showed a little more faith than Robinho did at Madrid and, instead of forcing his way out to make a point, stuck with the club and has since had a promising return to form this season.<br><br>A much more at-ease Alonso spoke exclusively to <em>Setanta Sports</em> and revealed he had yet more good news for Reds fans. "At some stage my future was not clear, I was wondering what was going to happen because there were propositions, but I prefer to move on," he said.<br><br>"Of course the fans’ backing was a massive boost because they let me know they wanted me to stay. "Of course I can see myself here for more years to come. "I have a lot of very good examples to follow – I am very close friends with Sami Hyypia, he is a foreigner having a great career at Liverpool, and Didi Haman became important as a Liverpool player as well."<br><br>The Euro 2008 winner underlined his belief in this current squad and their ability to win Liverpool's first league title in almost two decades. "The team is in a good shape, is being consistent, which is what we wanted, but we have a lot of things to do still," he continued.<br><br>Is this Liverpool's best chance at league glory since Alonso has been at the club? "Yes absolutely," was his defiant answer. "We have never been closer to the top at this stage of the season, this is probably the best Premier League start I’ve ever had at Liverpool, but you have to be conscious and think about West Ham."<br><br>Alonso signed for Liverpool from Real Sociedad in 2004, as one of Rafa Benitez's first new recruits upon his appointment as Reds manager.</p>
