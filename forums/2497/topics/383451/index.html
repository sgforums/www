              <p><strong>The figures, published for the first time after the League struck a deal with the Football Association over the regulation of agents, reveal that Manchester City were the biggest spenders, paying out almost £13 million to middlemen during their £173 million transfer spree in 2009.</strong></p>
              <p>Chelsea were ranked second, spending £9.6 million despite relatively modest spending in 2009. The bulk of the fees are understood to relate to fees payable on contract renegotiations and Liverpool, who, despite their financial problems, spent £6,657,305.</p>
              <p>Of greater surprise is that Manchester United spent a relatively modest £1,517,393. Burnley, the Barclays Premier League new boys, are bottom of the table with agents’ fees of £468,398.</p>
              <p>Liverpool were third, spending £6.6 million, with Tottenham fourth, spending just over £6 million. Burnley spent the least of any Premier League club, paying slightly more than £468,000 to agents. However, the figures for them, Birmingham and Wolves include fees paid before they were promoted from the Championship.</p>
              <p>The £70,692,513 overall spend covers the period from Oct 1, 2008, to Sept 30, 2009, and includes the 2009 January and summer transfer windows.</p>
              <p>The figures include all money paid to agents during that period, and cover payments paid to clubs for the acquisition and sale of players, the renegotiation of contracts, fees paid to agents to arrange the disposal of players, as well payments made by clubs to agents on behalf of players. It also includes instalment payments made during the year on previous transactions, but future fees committed to in the last year are not included.</p>
              <p>The scale of the spending, which covers 803 transactions and represents around 3.5 per cent of total Premier League turnover of around £2 billion, is likely to reawaken debate over the role and cost of agents in the game.</p>
              <p>The Premier League has previously resisted publishing any details of its club’s spending on agents, but agreed to reveal the figures as a result of negotiations with the Football Association over the regulation of agents.</p>
              <p>The £70,692,513 total represents slightly more than 10 per cent of the clubs’ total spending on player purchases of £682.3 million in the January and summer windows, and around six per cent of total transfer turnover during the period of nearly £1.3 billion.</p>
              <p>The identity of the biggest spenders comes as no surprise. Manchester City’s fees to agents, which cover 35 transactions at an average of £360,000.</p>

              <p><strong>Mark Hughes has defended the vast sums of money </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester City</strong></span><strong> have spent on agents over the past 12 months.</strong>  </p>
              <p>Figures released by the Premier League placed City top of the table for payments to the much-derided middle men.  </p>
              <p>Their spree of almost £13million made up a substantial portion of the overall outlay of over £70m by England's top flight.  </p>
              <p>The position was expected given the number of players who have both arrived at, and left, Eastlands in the past year.  And Hughes admitted the outcome was predictable. </p>
              <p>'If you do a lot of deals - and overall something like 35 were included - given the expenditure and the turnover of players involved, you would expect a figure like that,' said the Welshman.  </p>
              <p>'There is a role that has to be met and, at the moment, agents fill it. Do they provide value for money? You have to base every deal on its merits. </p>
              <p>'Sometimes you feel the agent has really done his job, on others you feel he is getting money for nothing.  </p>
              <p>'At times they can muddy the waters. Some deals can seem quite straightforward and then they become complicated at the end. 'On other occasions the deal goes through very quickly.'</p>
              <p>Agents have tended to be viewed as a necessary evil, especially in situations like Carlos Tevez, whose third party ownership by Kia Joorabchian caused so much controversy following his arrival in England.  </p>
              <p>It is still not exactly clear how much City paid Joorabchian to gain the player's registration but there is no doubt the deal would not have been possible without Joorabchian's involvement.  </p>
              <p>Hughes is taking action to ensure City do not rely on the use of agents quite as much. </p>
              <p>Part of his root-and-branch reform of the Blues included a complete revamp of the scouting department which, eventually, he expects to pay significant dividends. </p>
              <p>'Agents want to work with us - I wonder why,' he pondered. 'We do a lot of the work that in the past agents have been able to bring to a club in terms of recommending players.  </p>
              <p>'Some agents will tell you they have the best player in the world. Now we can make that judgment ourselves because we have seen him 10 times. That has not always been the case.  </p>
              <p>'Without doubt I would say we are in a better place than we were 12 months ago.'</p>
