              <p><strong>The linesman who allowed Robin van Persie’s offside goal against Chelsea to stand has been left off the list for the next round of matches.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>John Stokes, </strong>who failed to raise his flag against Van Persie for Arsenal’s equaliser in
              their 2-1 win at Stamford Bridge on Sunday<strong>, will not be on duty at a Premier League or
              Football League game at the weekend.</strong></p>
              <p>Luiz Felipe Scolari was furious and demanded an apology from the officials after watching Chelsea’s defeat, claiming Stokes’s mistake had 'killed' his team.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/12/02/article-0-02A6269E000005DC-853_468x286.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="286"><br><br>Van Persie looked a yard offside when the ball was played to him on the edge of the Chelsea box, but he was allowed to continue and score. <br><br>The Dutchman struck the winner three minutes later, leaving an angry Scolari to question the judgement of the officials.</p>
              <p>The Professional Game Match Officials, the body responsible for referees and their assistants, meet on Mondays to determine the appointments of officials for each round of matches.<strong><br><br>The Premier League, who speak on behalf of the PGMO, declined to comment on whether Stokes’ omission is as a result of the Arsenal game but their silence will lead to speculation that Stokes has paid the price for his error.</strong></p>

              <p><br>another interesting thing is that the guy 789 or 978 0r 879 didn't come in and say Arsenal is a cheat.. (even thou i would gather almost every players will just take such mistake and the most of it, and also i've nothing against them scoring)</p>

              <p>Like i have said earlier... I think Scolari has a point to be upset... but such things happen lor... Just too bad for Chelsea this time.</p>
              <p>Van Persie was indeed off-side when the pass was made but during the match, the commentator did mentioned or he thought the ball touch a chelsea defender along the way making it "onside"... I also thought that was the case at that point but close replay from different angles showed otherwise... Moreover the linesman on that end could only see from the back of the chelsea defender... So i guess he also thought it hit his leg...</p>
              <p>Arsenal got really lucky for this match but I also thought Chelsea didn't turn up to play... Players like Deco, Anelka, Lampard and Terry were not their usual self in this match... And Bosingwa only played well in the first half... Even their only goal was scored by an Arsenal player... what more to say... </p>

              <p><br>Because he is John Terry mah... Thats why he gets away with almost anything, even rugby tackles... The English FA won't want their England captain with a bad record so when he goes to play international matches... It won't reflect badly on them... I personally feel that sometimes even Rooney get some special treatment from English referees but Terry of course takes the cake lah... rugby tackle, handball in the box, pulling the red card away from a referee, now he can add double footed studs showing challenge to that list also...</p>
              <p>John Terry is already a legend even after he retires...</p>
