              <h3>ARSENE WENGER has told Cesc Fabregas he must publicly commit his future to Arsenal this week. </h3>
              <p>Fabregas will return to training on Thursday after a summer of speculation about a move to Barcelona and the Arsenal boss says it is now down to his captain to kill the story once and for all. </p>
              <p>Wenger, who also warned Barcelona skipper Carles Puyol to keep his mouth shut, said: "The story in the last six months has made our lives difficult and I believe what is important is that when Cesc comes back, he comes out and speaks. </p>
              <p>"Only Fabregas can clear the air when he comes back from holiday. The noises come back a lot from Spain and are translated here, and I believe it is important for the Premier League that all the clubs keep their best players. </p>
              <p>"Puyol has to keep to his own affairs and leave the rest to Cesc Fabregas. He has five years left on his contract and that's it." </p>
              <p>Fabregas broke off from his holiday in Mykonos to fly back for talks with Wenger in London on Friday. And his Arsenal team-mates are hoping their skipper and talisman will say he is staying at the Emirates - at least for another year.</p>
              <p>Bacary Sagna said: "I know he is on holiday but he will be back soon.</p>
              <p>"I do not know what he is going to do but I hope he will stay because he is a great player and we need him."</p>
              <p>New signing Laurent Koscielny said: "He's a big player so of course we want him to stay."</p>
              <p>Johan Djourou added: "Cesc is very important. So is Robin van Persie. These players are vital to us. They have proved themselves over the year.</p>
              <p>"Cesc is a great player and the captain, so it would be good if we could keep him.</p>
              <p>"I hope he stays. It is not our business, it is the business of the football club, but obviously we want him to stay."</p>

              <p>He should go la, i don't want the next year transfer period with all his stories again.. And besides why keep a player who's heart isn't with you anymore.</p>
              <p>Just to make an example, the 40mil touted for Fabregas can probably make Arsenal even stronger, 40mil last year could have gotten you Robben and Sniejder i think for that price.</p>

              <p>To be fair, all Fabregas need to do is just say "I want to stay at Arsenal" and all these noise will go away at once... And Barce and their players will not come up with new reports on a weekly or daily basis anymore...</p>

              <p>think logically, i think Cesc want to join barca. that why all the spanish player kbkb here and there. coz they are just echoing what cesc want to do.</p>
              <p>but cesc need to respect the contract. he is already the highest earners in arsenal. arsenal has been treating him well. no one force him to sign a new deal last year. he should honour his contract.</p>

              <p>Barce are paying for his present day level of skills... True he may have came from Barce but he wasn't the only one...  There was Fran Merida as well but we don't see Barce trying desperately hard to bring him back...</p>
              <p>Truth is, Arsenal have spent time and money to develop Fabregas these last 7 yrs... He definitely isn't the same player who came at 16... And when Arsenal bought him, there was no guarantee he would turn out to be the player he is today... So, Arsenal deserve better and definitely not the insults most of the Barce players seems to have no problem at all hurling at them... It started even before the WC and it's still going on...</p>
