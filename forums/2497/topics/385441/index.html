              <h3>ENGLAND football captain John Terry is SELLING private access to himself and 
                  his club through hush-hush £10,000 cash deals.</h3>
              <p>The Chelsea skipper uses notorious ticket tout Tony Bruce as a fixer. On 
                  Thursday the pair took 200 £50 notes from News of the World investigators for a 
                  tour of the Premier League team's five-star training facility.</p>
              <p>Terry, 29, said his share would go to a kids' charity but insisted we keep 
                  the deal secret, adding: "If the club finds out, it's a little bit. . ."</p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Terry took the secret £10,000 cash payment this week to lay on a 
                  behind-the-scenes tour of Chelsea's training ground.</p>
              <p>He arranged the backstage visit for an undercover News of the World team 
                  WITHOUT permission from his club's boss Carlo Ancelotti.</p>
              <p>And it was all fixed by middle-man Tony Bruce, 58 - a well-known ticket tout. 
                  Multi-millionaire Terry told our men he would give his £8,000 share of the fee 
                  to the Make A Wish charity that fixes treats for terminally ill children. The 
                  remaining £2,000 went to Bruce for his "cut."</p>

              <p><strong>The £160,000-a-week defender hosted our three reporters, posing as rich 
                  businessmen, for more than two hours at the state-of-the-art ground in Cobham, 
                  Surrey.</strong></p>
              <p>He gave them a full tour of the facilities and showed off star players Didier 
                  Drogba and Michael Ballack as they lounged in a Jacuzzi in their underpants.</p>
              <p>And he laid on lunch in the canteen where the £10,000 in £50 notes was handed 
                  over to Bruce in a black folder as a smiling Terry looked on. Just yards away 
                  manager Ancelotti, 50, was also dining, without a clue about the huge sum of 
                  money changing hands nearby. </p>
              <p>It was then the soccer star and the tout went to great pains to insist we 
                  keep all details of the pricey visit under our hats - for fear the club's 
                  management would find out and end Terry's private wheeler-dealing.</p>

              <p><strong>With a grin Terry whispered: "If the club finds out, it's a little bit. . . 
                  you know."<span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p>Sharp-suited Bruce - from Bromley, Kent - warned that if problems ever arose 
                  HE would take the rap and we must DENY Terry was involved. </p>
              <p>He said: "If anything ever goes wrong, then you say, 'John didn't know 
                  nothing about that.' </p>
              <p>"John just can turn round and say, 'Tony Bruce, he shouldn't be doing that.' 
                  He can deny it." Terry nodded his head and said: "Yeah." </p>
              <p>Then Bruce mentioned the money. One of our men produced the cash in a black 
                  folder and said: "Yeah, I've got 10 grand here." Bruce said: "Right, give that 
                  to me." And Terry chipped in: "Give it to Tony." </p>
              <p>A delighted Terry watched as the money was handed over. The whole deal was 
                  secretly videoed by our team and we are making it available to Chelsea and the 
                  Football Association. </p>
              <p>Terry - worth £17million according to the Sunday Times Rich List - offered to 
                  lay on THREE more similar tours of the training ground over the next few weeks.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Bruce said future visits would be fine provided we came up with "the 
                  readies". Terry told our team: "Yeah, we can sort that out." Terry then again 
                  impressed on us how it was important the arrangements were kept secret from 
                  anyone else at the club.<span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p>Told there would be more clients next week, Terry said: "Yeah, but you brief 
                  them that they don't speak to no one. Cos if anyone finds out, then we can't do 
                  it no more. </p>
              <p>"If you sort of brief them before, we can do as many as. . . and go through 
                  Tony." </p>
              <p>Bruce - a friend of Terry since he was a Chelsea trainee - then underlined 
                  his buddy's concern, repeating that the visits would need to be "very, very low 
                  profile". And Terry agreed: "Yeah." </p>
              <p>Our revelations are sure to anger boss Ancelotti. He will be alarmed his 
                  captain is allowing strangers access to the club's inner sanctum behind his back 
                  for money. Terry even gave an insight into tactics as the team prepared for 
                  today's match against West Ham. </p>
              <p>Thursday morning's ground visit was arranged after a two-month News of the 
                  World investigation into financial deals involving Terry. Bruce had already 
                  sorted us a £5,000 box at Wembley for an England under-21 match AND touted 11 
                  tickets - which he bragged came from players - for Chelsea's crunch home game 
                  against Man United.</p>

              <p><strong>Bruce originally asked £5,000 for a private meeting with the England skipper 
                  at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground - "as long as John's happy with the fees".<span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p>But when the venue was switched to the training ground the price doubled - 
                  because Terry wanted a "little bit more" for the privileged access. </p>
              <p>We were already investigating Terry when a marketing firm to which he is 
                  linked sparked comment by sending out an email, featuring the FIFA World Cup 
                  logo, looking for commercial endorsements ahead of next year's finals. </p>
              <p>Terry was not in breach of any rules and insisted the email had been sent 
                  without his knowledge. But senior figures at the FA were embarrassed because it 
                  made the England captain look "greedy". </p>
              <p>And England boss Fabio Capello is said to be concerned that Terry is too 
                  money-orientated, particularly at a time when the Chelsea team he leads is 
                  leaking goals. The evening before our meeting Terry had skippered Chelsea in an 
                  unconvincing 2-1 win over bottom club Portsmouth.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>When our men arrived at Cobham at 10.30am we were asked to sign in at the 
                  main entrance as guests of 'JT' before being led up to the players' dining area. 
                  Access to the ground is strictly controlled. And reporters have been known to 
                  need 48 hours' notice to gain admittance.<span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p>But our men were ushered through without any fuss. Terry, in a Chelsea 
                  training top, was buttering toast as he greeted us with warm handshakes. He 
                  smiled and said: "Help yourselves to breakfast. Do you want tea or coffee?" 
                  Thanked for sorting the trip out, Terry replied: "Yeah, no problem. Any time for 
                  Tony." At Terry's invitation we were then allowed to watch the Chelsea stars 
                  train for 90 minutes before joining him for lunch in the canteen and handing 
                  over the cash. Bruce said: "I'll have to give it to him discreetly." </p>
              <p>Terry then sat with us, chatted about the World Cup and we discussed a 
                  proposed deal where he would be an ambassador for a fake private travel service. 
                  Terry indicated he may do the work but Bruce butted in, saying: "Because of 
                  obviously John being England captain, you gotta be careful who you deal with. </p>
              <p>"If you got people out there with money to burn, I can definitely help with 
                  that. I'm that kind of guy, John, you know what I mean?" Bruce and Terry then 
                  laughed together. </p>
              <p>After lunch, Terry gave us a 20-minute tour of the luxury facilities. He 
                  bragged: "It's good to see behind the scenes." He took us to an area where 
                  team-mates, including goalie Petr Cech, were playing table tennis and then past 
                  the Jacuzzi where Ballack and Drogba were half-naked in their underpants. Then 
                  Terry sought to impress his high-rolling guests by going into a massage room 
                  where a sparsely-clad Joe Cole was receiving treatment. </p>
              <p>In the boot room we saw young apprentices cleaning the star players' boots. </p>
              <p>Terry then gave us three Chelsea team shirts and signed each one. Joking 
                  about the money we were paying, Bruce quipped: "You putting your account details 
                  on there, aren't you, John?" The player just laughed. </p>
              <p>As we left Bruce offered more visits to Liverpool, Man Utd, Arsenal and 
                  Tottenham, naming two high-profile figures who could help lay them on. </p>

              <p><strong>John Terry is seriously jeopardising his dual role as the captain of England 
                  and </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><strong>Chelsea</strong></a><strong> as 
                  senior Football Association officials are growing increasingly concerned about 
                  him and his off-field activities.</strong></p>
              <p>The centre back, who skippered Chelsea to a 1-1 draw at West Ham yesterday, 
                  has an estimated fortune worth £17million thanks to his £170,000-a-week 
                  salary.</p>

              <div class="floatRHS"><br></div>
              <p><strong>Yet he started the day at the centre of further unsavoury newspaper 
                  revelations as he was exposed for organising a secret tour of Chelsea’s training 
                  ground, apparently in exchange for a £10,000 cash payment that was made in the 
                  staff canteen while manager Carlo Ancelotti was dining at a nearby table. </strong></p>
              <p>Despite issuing a formal denial of any impropriety, it is understood that 
                  privately, Chelsea are distinctly unimpressed, while the FA have expressed 
                  concern over Terry’s newspaper column deal with The Sun and suggestions that he 
                  has gone against the wishes of England manager Fabio Capello and booked his 
                  family into Sun City for the World Cup.</p>
              <p>The latest controversy saw Terry, accompanied by well-known ticket tout Tony 
                  Bruce, tell undercover reporters from the News of the World that the 
                  arrangements for the training ground tour had to be kept secret for fear that 
                  the club would ‘find out’.</p>
              <p>‘If anything ever goes wrong, then you say “John didn’t know nothing about 
                  that”,’ Bruce told the reporters who were secretly filming the visit.</p>
              <p>Terry told the journalists he would be donating his share to charity and last 
                  night Chelsea issued an almost comical statement attempting to exonerate their 
                  captain, although it appears they had not been aware in advance of his ‘private’ 
                  tour arrangements.</p>
              <p>But this comes after Sportsmail’s recent revelations that Terry had enlisted 
                  the help of a marketing company, Riviera Entertainment Limited, to cash in on 
                  the England captain’s armband, prompting one FA official to say he had made 
                  himself look ‘greedy’.</p>
              <p>‘John Terry is available to create effective brand awareness and endorse 
                  products and services globally,’ said the email that used the official FIFA 
                  World Cup logo without permission and, much to the surprise of Stamford Bridge 
                  officials, used an image of Terry in a Chelsea strip.</p>

                  people.’</strong></p>
              <p>Even though Riviera claim to have a contractual agreement with him, Terry 
                  issued a statement saying the email had been circulated without his 
                  permission.</p>
              <p>And yesterday came another denial, this time from his club. ‘Chelsea FC hosts 
                  a large number of visitors at the training ground throughout the year,’ said the 
                  statement. ‘The majority of which are made up of club sponsors, our charity

              <p>Chelsea have defended captain John Terry after allegations that he
                  took secret cash payments to lay on a behind-the-scenes tour of the
                  club's training ground.</p>

              <p>But the Premier League leaders admitted they would be beefing up
                  security after the revelations in a Sunday newspaper.</p>
              <p>It is alleged that the England skipper arranged the backstage visit by an
                  undercover reporter without permission from manager Carlo Ancelotti.</p>
              <p>But a Chelsea spokesman said: ''Chelsea FC host a large number of visitors at
                  the training ground throughout the year, the majority of which are made up of
                  club sponsors, our charity partners and supporters.</p>
              <p>''The players play a big part in these visits and John Terry naturally has a

              <p>''John has also organised a number of visits for families with sick children as

                  to visits to the training ground.''</p>
              <p><em>The News of the World</em> claimed that £160,000-a-week Terry took a £10,000
                  payment, £8,000 of which he wanted to go to the 'Make A Wish' charity for
                  children with the other £2,000 going to a middleman.</p>
              <p>Chelsea, however, deny any wrongdoing and say they will be stepping up security
                  procedures.</p>
              <p>The statement added: ''Chelsea FC gives our players room to exercise their own
                  discretion when contacted personally with regard to visits and the club keeps
                  security and access to the training ground at Stamford Bridge under constant

                  will be further reviewing access to our facilities and clamping down where there
                  are gaps in the process.''</p>
              <p>Chelsea boss Carlo Ancelotti insisted he had ''a lot of confidence'' in Terry after Blues had drawn
                  1-1 against West Ham at Upton Park.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti
                  played down the allegations, claiming: ''This is not correct. This is
                  not true. The club, me, the players, have a lot of confidence in John
                  Terry and John Terry did nothing wrong. He was very quiet, very calm,
                  very concentrated for the game. No problem.''</p>
              <p>When asked whether Terry had told him the story was not true, Ancelotti added:
                  ''Yes. I have a lot of confidence in my captain.''</p>

              <p><strong>John Terry received a stern reminder yesterday of his responsibilities as 
                          England captain from a senior member of Fabio Capello’s coaching team. </strong></p>
              <p>The Chelsea defender is understood to have made contact with the FA in an 
                          attempt to give his version of events after allegations by a Sunday newspaper 
                          that he was paid £10,000 for offering a secret tour of the club’s training 
                          ground. It led to a frank conversation with one of England’s coaches, which has 
                          been relayed to Capello.</p>
              <p>The England manager is believed to have accepted Terry’s explanation that he 
                          did not receive any money and was merely offering a favour to a personal friend, 
                          Tony Bruce, the ticket tout, but still felt the need to remind him that his 
                          position carries certain expectations in terms of public behaviour and conduct. 
                          The Italian is understood to have been astonished when he heard of the latest 
                          embarrassment to befall Terry, and has expressed, in private, incredulity at his 
                          naivety in allowing himself to be exposed in such a manner, irrespective of his 
                          intentions.</p>
              <p>Capello has reassured Terry that his position as captain has not been 
                          jeopardised, as he still considers him to be an inspirational leader on the 
                          pitch and in the dressing room, but warned him that his judgment off the field 
                          needs to improve. The Italian has made a point of reminding all of his players 
                          of the responsibilities that come with representing England on a regular basis, 
                          but a little more than six months before the World Cup finals there is a feeling 
                          in the manager’s inner circle that the message may not have got through.</p>
              <p>Also a concern for Capello is the potential impact that repeated bad 
                          publicity could have on Terry’s mental state in what promises to be the most 
                          important season of his career. He has had to contend with a spate of 
                          humiliating headlines in the past few months. His father, Ted, was filmed 
                          allegedly arranging to pass a Class A drug to an undercover reporter last month, 
                          while his mother, Sue, and Sue Poole, his mother-in-law, were cautioned for 
                          shoplifting after being caught with £800 worth of clothes and groceries from 
                          Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer. Terry’s performances have dipped in the past few 
                          weeks as Chelsea have won only one of their past six matches, but Carlo 
                          Ancelotti, his club manager, remains unconcerned.</p>
              <p>Senior FA figures have also expressed disquiet at the negative publicity, 
                          particularly Terry’s apparent determination to gain as much commercial value as 
                          possible from his position as England captain, a stance that some feel demeans 
                          the office. The 29-year-old has signed a lucrative contract to provide exclusive 
                          columns to a tabloid newspaper, and last month Riviera Entertainment Ltd, a 
                          marketing company, circulated an e-mail announcing that he was eager to maximise 
                          his earning potential.</p>
              <p>Terry denied having given permission to Riviera to send that speculative 
                          e-mail, which among many excruciating claims declared the availability of “a 
                          British sporting hero” and “Dad of the year 2008 . . . to create effective brand 
                          awareness and endorse products and services globally”, but the damage was done. 
                          The FA has also taken a dim view of Sunday’s revelations, though it is not 
                          planning to intervene and will leave any action to Capello.</p>
              <p>Terry last night attended a Fifa gala in Zurich, where he gave warning of the 
                          threat posed by the United States in England’s World Cup finals group. 
                          “Everyone’s getting carried away and thinks it’s going to be an easy group,” he 
                          said. “The Americans are going to be a really tough game. Over the last four or 
                          five years, [their] improvement has been massive. We’ve seen some of the [US] 
                          players coming to the Premiership, some well-known faces and players across the 
                          world now playing at the highest stage.” </p>
