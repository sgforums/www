              <p><strong>Emmanuel Adebayor’s agent has defended his client against
              accusations of greed by insisting that his contractual dispute with
              Arsenal is not motivated by financial concerns.</strong></p>
              <p>Adebayor has angered Gunners fans after stating, in an interview
              published on Sunday, that he would leave the club if they did not match
              his wage demands – a reported £120,000 per week.</p>
              <p>The fact that he insisted he was worth as much as the club’s
              all-time record goalscorer, Thierry Henry, also rankled with supporters
              but his agent has attempted something of a damage limitation exercise
              by presenting his spat with the club in a new light.</p>
              <p>“Since the beginning, there has been a love story between Adebayor
              and Arsenal and his relationship with [Arsene] Wenger is based on trust
              and respect,” Courbis said in The Times.<br> <br>“Emmanuel is a man of heart, not of money. He is not greedy. He is a kid from the street, has sensibilities and is humble.</p>
              <p>“If this was a money problem, then he would have asked to leave. I
              know that Arsenal’s political position is that they don’t pay high
              salaries.”</p>
              <p>Despite such lofty sentiments, Courbis then urged Arsenal to up
              their contract offer if they want to keep Adebayor at Arsenal this
              summer.</p>
              <p>“It is important for Emmanuel that Arsenal show their motivation to
              keep him,” Courbis said. “Whatever they will decide, the decision will
              be taken with respect.”</p>

              <p><strong>Emmanuel Adebayor's agent has challenged Arsenal to do whatever it takes to keep the striker after the club rejected a £24m bid from Barcelona.</strong></p>
              <p>Adebayor, 24, insists he wants to stay with the Gunners, but he is yet to sign the improved £45,000-a-week deal he has been offered since scoring 30 goals last season.</p>
              <p>Stephane Courbis, his agent, said: 'It is vital that Arsenal show their motivation to keep him. 'Whatever they decide, the decision will be taken with respect.'</p>
              <p>Barcelona's bid is well below Arsenal's valuation of £35.6m - a price tag which has put off potential rivals for his signature, AC Milan.</p>
              <p>Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani said: 'Bids of £35.6m are impossible for Italian clubs, which is why the top players don't come here anymore.'</p>
