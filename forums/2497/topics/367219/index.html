              <p class="story_panel_text"><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Sam
                  Allardyce has confirmed Christian Vieri is training with Blackburn in a
                  bid to resurrect his career - but admits he is "out of condition".</span></strong></p>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/08/05/330/Fiorentina_v_Rangers_Christian_Vieri_woe_837151.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p><strong>The Italian striker has been
                  without a club since being released by Atalanta in April but has now
                  linked up with the rest of the Rovers squad for the start of
                  pre-season. </strong></p>
              <p>Allardyce accepts that he needs to work on his fitness and there is no indication that a deal could be close.</p>
              <p>However, the manager has been impressed by the 35-year-old's attitude and is happy to keep his options open.</p>
              <p>"He is obviously out of condition compared to the rest of the
                  lads but joining us at this stage of pre-season shows a certain amount
                  of commitment that he wants to try and play football again," Allardyce
                  said on Sky Sports News.</p>
              <p>"If he has got that desire and dedication and can adjust to the
                  physical levels of the Premier League at his tender age of 36 then we
                  have got a major player on our hands.</p>
              <p>"There is no harm in my point of view in watching his progress
                  and then seeing if there is a situation where we can have him for next
                  season.</p>
              <p>"He also has a desire to try and get in the Italy squad for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa."</p>
              <p>Allardyce has conceded that Peter Crouch and Ruud van Nistelrooy
                  are 'out of Blackburn's reach' but he remains hopeful of signing a new
                  striker.</p>
              <p>He explained: "We are obviously in the market for a striker and can spend a considerable amount of money to get one.</p>
              <p>"That gives you the opportunity to get a younger striker in and that is what we are looking for.</p>
              <p>"At the more mature end, certainly from abroad, you have to be a bit wary about the back end of their career.</p>
              <p>"We will keep our eye open in this country which would be the best bet from our point of view."</p>
