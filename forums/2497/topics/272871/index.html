            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/44041000/jpg/_44041425_craiggordon_snsb270.jpg"><br><span class="small">Craig Gordon has been training with Sunderland this week</span><br><br><strong>Scotland goalkeeper Craig Gordon has agreed terms with Sunderland and a Â£9m transfer from Hearts will be completed on Wednesday, BBC Sport understands. The 24-year-old had been expected to hold talks with Aston Villa boss Martin O'Neill before making his choice. But Gordon has agreed a five-year deal to become Sunderland's record signing after undergoing a medical at the club. It is understood that Sunderland will pay an initial Â£7m, plus Â£2m in future payments dependent on appearances. </strong><br><br>Gordon, who will become Britain's most expensive goalkeeper if confirmed, had spent two days training with Sunderland after a fee was agreed with Hearts. The Edinburgh club's captain was expected at Villa Park, but Sunderland manager Roy Keane appears to have persuaded him that his future lies at the Stadium of Light.<br><br>Sunderland had a Â£5m offer rejected in July, but chairman Niall Quinn had stressed on Tuesday that they were determined to get their man. "This is Roy Keane's department really, but we are trying hard," he said. "If it takes a bit longer, so be it. We are not going to lose our nerve now. There are lots of bits and pieces going on behind the scenes. "My message to our fans is that we haven't jumped in when an agent has rung us with a fashionable player. "A lot of things have to fall right for someone to come to play at Sunderland."<br><br>Sunderland, whose current record signing is Tore Andre Flo after his Â£6.75m move in August 2002, have also made a bid for Tottenham striker Mido after previously failing to sign the likes of Leighton Baines from Wigan and Preston striker David Nugent. English interest in Gordon had been rekindled after Hearts majority shareholder Vladimir Romanov last week indicated he would be willing to sell if the goalkeeper said he wanted to leave.<br><br>And Villa boss O'Neill had hinted that he had rekindled his interest after Hearts had reduced their "exorbitant" demands. O'Neill is keen to sign a goalkeeper with Thomas Sorensen, who has one year left on his deal, set to miss the start of the season with a hamstring injury.<br><br>BBC Sport understands that Manchester City boss Sven Goran-Eriksson was also considering entering the bidding - but it now appears that Sunderland have secured Gordon's services.<br></div>
