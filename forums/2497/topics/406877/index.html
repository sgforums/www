              <h3>STEPHEN IRELAND has hit back at Roberto Mancini after the Italian told him 
              last week that he has no future at Manchester City.</h3>
              <p>The former Republic of Ireland international did not reach the same high level 
              last season that he did the previous campaign, when he was voted Player of 
              the Year.</p>
              <p>Mancini is desperate to reduce the size of the squad as he needs to comply 
              with the Premier League's new rules on squad sizes not exceeding 25 players.</p>
              <p>But Ireland believes he was not given a fair crack of the whip under Mancini 
              as the team lost out to Spurs in the race for fourth place.</p>
              <p>"I came off playing 67 games two years ago to playing just 16 times, including 
              substitute appearances last season.</p>
              <p>"I can't really live up to what I did before that if I am not getting the 
              opportunities," he said.</p>
              <p>"For me, I found that very difficult but if the manager had had a team big 
              enough and strong enough to get through the games and bully teams and get 
              the points we would have done really well.</p>
              <p>"I am very ambitious but things are out of my hands.</p>
              <p>"I only know what I read in the papers. I haven't heard one bit of interest.</p>
              <p>"I have seen Fulham, Spurs and Sunderland mentioned but I haven't been told 
              anything. I'd hope the club would contact me if there was some interest."</p>

              <p><br>erm, i think the term ''great midfield maestro'' cannot be use to describe ozil yet. his performances in bundelisga is good but not superb. he's only coming off from a few great performances and people are calling him 'great', 'one of world's best'. to be called one of the footballing great i think the player himself need to win the big throphies and show consistency. Right now, whether he can continue his performances, we dontknow yet. And he certaintly hasnt win enough major tournaments with his club and country yet.  </p>

              <p>To be fair, City is doing the right thing here I feel cos, with so many new and bigger star midfielders coming in, there really isn't much place for him especially now with the new 25 men rule... I belief had the rule not be in place this season, he might still get a chance to hang around like last season. But with every club only being able to name 25 men by Sep 1... It make no sense cos they can't register him unless they want to leave out the likes of Yaya or Silva... Which what Joe Cole would say, a no brainer right ?</p>
              <p>But if City can't fill their 8 quota, he might come in handy though to make up the numbers...</p>
              <p>And yeah, he can indeed help Pool with their quota I guess...Cos I don't think they have enough numbers to fill their English or home grown quota yet...</p>
