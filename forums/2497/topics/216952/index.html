            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: olive;">BARCELONA are ready to offer Frank Lampard the chance to move to the Nou Camp next summer - and force Chelsea into a massive pay hike to keep the England midfielder.<br><br>Coach Frank Rijkaard has long coveted the England ace and is ready to use Chelsea's failure to conclude a new long-term deal so far to land his man for a cut-price Â£10million.<br><br>The midfielder and his advisers believe the England star's Â£90,000-aweek terms need to be improved after Andriy Shevchenko and Michael Ballack both arrived in the summer on substantially better deals. ($130,000)<br><br>If Chelsea do not come up with a better package, then Lampard, whose fiancee Elen comes from Barcelona, could use FIFA's new contract rules to leave for a fee of around Â£4.5m, effectively buying up the final year of his current deal</span><br><br>Funny... Chelsea said to be so rich still don't want to pay their players better... This problem seems like it will continue to grow every year... cos of their policy.<br><br>Actually they are paying theirs players very well already to be fair but the arrival of Andriy Shevchenko and Michael Ballack will not help things... cos those who were there before will feel unfair when they have put in so much and get lesser than 2 new guys who have yet to perform... We have already seen Gallas left now they will have to give Drogba a pay rise too... and very soon it will be Robben's turn to make noise...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Either way, its a headache for chelsea and Peter Kenyon. Tho they are rich but Kenyon is already trying to keep the budget down, and now face with Barce he can't not do nothing... give him more money, their squad budget will get bigger, don't give him... Barce can buy him on the cheap...<br><br>Then there could be another problem... Give him more money, other player at the club would also want an increment too... as they may feel that they have contributed more to the success than the 2 new buys.<br><br>Already Gallas has made noise and left, Now Drogba will be getting his after making noise last season... Soon we could see Robben too.<br><br>Guess Frank Rijkaard's way of getting back at Chelsea...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

The measure is an attempt to reverse some of the effects of the Bosman ruling. UEFA's chief executive Lars-Christer Olsson was reported by CNN to have said that some of the major clubs in Europe like Chelsea and Barcelona were not happy with this rule, and that he didn't rule out the possibility of a court challenge.<br><br><span style="color: brown;">An addendum to this rule means that a player may move in the final year of a four or five year contract provided he hands in a request to the club no more than 15 days after the end of the previous season. The club would be entitled to compensation, but only equaling the amount of the final year's wages as per the contract, which would be far less than an agreed transfer fee in most cases.</span></div>
