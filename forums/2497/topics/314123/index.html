              <p><strong>Chelsea's Champions League party is wild night.</strong></p>

              <p><strong>JT: serenading cheesy love songs to girls around the club.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Chelsea's Champions League party was never going to be a low-key affair. And the lads didn't disappoint as they celebrated reaching the semi-final with an ocean of champagne and vodka, a bit of old-school perving and some bad karaoke.</strong></p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">We joined John Terry, Frank Lampard and Joe Cole at the strictly "No Wags" event in the VIP section of London's Funky Buddha, where they were surrounded by gorgeous girls. Some players performed badly - ex-Chelsea keeper Lenny Pidgeley had to be helped out by security after downing 10 Jagermeister shots in a row.</p>
              <p>But skipper John Terry led from the front, grabbing the microphone from the DJ and serenading girls around the club with cheesy love songs, including Babyface's Roses Are Red. Before long JT had a circle of tipsy team-mates around him - including Cole, Lampard, Shaun Wright-Phillips and Michael Ballack - while he did an impromptu break-dance. And some of the lads then lounged about on sofas as girls danced provocatively in front of them, some exposing their knickers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Big Brother's Posh lookalike Chanelle Hayes and Chantelle Houghton were also there, in full Champions League flirt mode. Says our mole: "Chanelle was flipping her hair back while talking to Lamps, and they were smiling a lot. Lamps' friend then pulled him away. "Meanwhile Chantelle headed over to John Terry, and he didn't seem to mind her company either. But then the Soulja Boy song came on and he went back to party with his mates."</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">A brawl then broke out on the main dancefloor and spilled on to the lads' table, sending glasses flying. Security waded in and chucked a few men out. Cricketer Kevin Pietersen then poured ice-cubes down his shirt and pretended he was having a wee when the water came out at the bottom.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">As the minutes ticked by, there was one last piece of drama to come when Millwall player Pidgeley started flagging. We're told: "He had to go. The barman refused to serve him and gave him a free bottle of water after he could barely stand. He was forcing shots down the throats of the club managers too."</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Wonder what they'll do if they reach the final?</p>
