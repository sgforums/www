              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/67507/Theo-Walcott">Theo Walcott</a> has apologised for diving to try to win a penalty during the closing 
              stages of his side's third-round FA Cup tie against Leeds United at 
              Emirates Stadium.</p>

              <p>Walcott came off the bench in the second half as Arsenal were trailing to a spot-kick from Robert Snodgrass.</p>
              <p>Walcott
               found himself in the thick of the action as Arsenal pressed for an 
              equaliser, and looked to have won a penalty after going down under a 
              challenge from Paul Connolly. However, after consulting with his 
              assistant, referee Phil Dowd changed his mind.</p>
              <p>Moments later, though, it was a penalty when Walcott was tugged back by Ben Parker - and captain <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/38886/Cesc-F%C3%A1bregas">Cesc Fabregas</a> stepped up to fire past Kasper Schmeichel and earn a replay at Elland Road.</p>
              <p>Walcott issued a statement apologising for his actions.</p>
              <p>The
               21-year-old said on the club's official website: "I want to apologise 
              to the managers because I actually dived. I was trying to win the 
              penalty.</p>
              <p>"I said to one of their players, 'Would you have done 
              it?' and he said he probably would have. I am not the sort of player to 
              do it, but I own up to it and apologise. It is something I don't want to
               see in my game."</p>
              <p>Walcott continued: "I have heard some players say, 'If there is a slight touch, go down' and it can work both ways.</p>
              <p>"It was one of those things. I am not happy with myself for doing that, but I am happy that we got the draw.</p>
              <p>"I had a little joke with the referee afterwards saying, 'That was my first dive, can you tell?'</p>
              <p>"I
               don't have to own up to it and I can't speak for other players, but I 
              have just expressed how I feel. I hope people respect that."</p>

              <p>is he taunting leeds fans?</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">THEO WALCOTT admitted he cheated to try to win a penalty against Leeds.</h2>
              <p>The Arsenal winger <strong>DIVED</strong> in the box after a tackle by Paul Connolly in the FA Cup third-round clash.</p>
              <p>Walcott failed to win a spot-kick on that occasion. But he was fouled again in the area to earn his side an injury-time penalty that Cesc Fabregas converted as the Gunners nicked a 1-1 draw.</p>
              <p>England star Walcott, 21, said: "I want to apologise to the managers because I actually dived - I was trying to win the penalty.</p>
