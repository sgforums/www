              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>SINGAPORE: After more than six months of nail—biting suspense, sources have confirmed that football fans will be able to watch all 64 matches of the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa ’live’ on television in Singapore.</strong></p>
              <p>Details of the closely—guarded deal were, on Wednesday night, still being ironed out by the two telco giants — StarHub and SingTel.</p>
              <p>One scenario is for the matches to be split between StarHub’s cable service and SingTel’s mioTV. However, a source familiar with the outcome, pointed out that if the telcos split the bill 50—50, it was more likely that all the matches would be telecast on both pay television platforms.</p>
              <p>Selected matches will also be telecast live on free—to—air television by national broadcaster MediaCorp. The number of matches on free—to—air TV could not be confirmed but is likely to include the opening match between South Africa and Mexico as well as the semi—finals and finals.</p>
              <p>TODAY expects an announcement to be made this week.</p>
              <p>What’s the deal worth?</p>
              <p>When it comes to the exact dollars and cents of the deal the picture gets a little grainy, especially since both telcos are listed.</p>
              <p>According to sources, the telecast rights were finally negotiated down to about US$15 million, or about S$21 million. This is about half the S$40 million in many earlier news reports.</p>
              <p>How does this compare to past deals? Well, now the picture gets fuzzier. Exact numbers have never been revealed, the last deal inked by StarHub was for two World Cup finals — 2002 and 2006 — and given that the deal is in US dollars, the exchange rate has moved significantly over the past decade.</p>
              <p>It is believed that StarHub paid US$5 million for the telecast rights to the 2006 World Cup. If so, the US$15 million figure is in line with the three to four times more that many other countries are paying for telecast rights this year.</p>
              <p>So does that same three—fold multiplier apply to what fans will have to pay to watch the World Cup? In 2006, StarHub charged a $15 subscription fee for those who signed up during their early—bird promotion and $25 subsequently.</p>
              <p>Said banker Kelvin Tan: "I would definitely not pay more than $100 to watch the World Cup, at most $60 or so."</p>
              <p>Time was running out</p>
              <p>It was in December that StarHub and SingTel first revealed that they had submitted a joint bid to Football Media Services (FMS), the Asian representatives of the event’s rights holder, FIFA.</p>
              <p>It is understood there have been at least half a dozen bids tabled unsuccessfully. Some have blamed SingTel for its aggressive bid of more than $300 million for three seasons of Barclays Premier League (BPL) matches which may have sent a signal to FIFA, and its agent FMS, that there was money to be made in football crazy Singapore.</p>
              <p>So why did both sides finally settle on this smaller sum?</p>
              <p>One theory: Each day that passed without a deal meant that the telcos had less time to score advertising deals, which are the main source of revenue to defray their costs — short of passing them on to consumers.</p>
              <p>This made it less and less attractive for the telcos to raise their bid. With the World Cup kicking off on June 11, the telcos now have just six weeks to sell advertising.</p>

              media articles, 
                  the telcos do not have the rights at this juncture.
                  <br> <br> The telcos said they understand the anxiety of Singapore 
              viewers and are
                   trying their best to get the rights for them.
                  <br> <br> They were responding to media articles which quoted 
              sources saying all 
                  64 matches would be aired live on Singapore television.

              <p>Let's not be naive, if a major local newspaper can report this, I believed they had good reasons for it... I think it's just the 2 big companies working out how best they can get the most out of the fans that's all...</p>
              <p>Whether they get to show half / half whereby the fans have to subscribe to both and eventually pay more or both get to show all the matches but what price to fix it?</p>
              <p>The Today newspaper is a branch of MediaCorp and MediaCorp is part of the team that plays a part on the bidding where they will get the rights to show the starting, the 2 semi-finals and the final itself.</p>
              <p>The only thing I find rather disappointing with is, it changing numbers all the time... At the beginning, they said Starhub paid $15m for the 2006 rights and Fifa wanted $100m this time... Then they change to $40m out of the blue and even then said it's 3x more than the last rights was secured...</p>
              <p>Now I see a new figure coming out... It says StarHub only paid US$5 million for the telecast rights to the 2006 World Cup. And this time it's US$15m so it's still 3x more... What's going on here? From $100m can become $40m? Then now S$20m?</p>
              <p>I think the 2 companies just want to delay the announcement to work out a profitable price plan for themselves... As for MediaCorp, they have nothing to gain from holding back so made the news public first on their own newspaper... So I won't be too surprise if within a week the 2 companies will announce the deal is done... Just you wait and see...</p>
              <p>I smell a big rat here... or two... lol.</p>

This eleventh hour deal helps put to rest the months of worry and speculation.</p>
              <p>It’s been an exasperating experience for die-hard football fans like myself. Why couldn’t we have gotten it right from the start?</p>
              <p>Suffice to say, consumers in Singapore have inadvertently become the victims of the recent competition between SingTel and StarHub. In a report from Channel News Asia, the early bird subscription for the World Cup package will cost S$66 until 31 May, after which it will be S$88. This is a significant increase from the S$15 early bird price and S$25 subsequently that StarHub charged in 2006.</p>
              <p>The general sentiment on the <span style="color: #0000ff;">question</span> we posed on Yahoo! Answers is that anything above S$50 is considered too much, with many willing to boycott the subscriptions.</p>
              <p>According to die-hard fans, they are willing to sacrifice live matches in their own living rooms to send a strong message to the local telcos that they will not bow down to an inflated price plan that will only draw more money out of their pockets. For these users, there are other ways to catch the games, with tuning in to Malaysia’s RTM channels or going down to pubs with friends proving to be the popular alternatives.</p>
              <p>Although a deal between the two telcos and FIFA has been successful, it’s difficult to ignore the fact that the biggest football tournament in the world today has become something of a cash cow for them.</p>
              <p>What do you think of the package price? Is it too expensive?</p>

              <p>The deal was done more than a week ago already when the Today newspaper reported on it but I guess they took more than a week to work out how much to charge the fans and finally announce it now.</p>
              <p>Like I said earlier, would they show half / half whereby the fans have to subscribe to both or both get to show all the matches but what price to fix it? Now the price has been fixed... 'Early Bird' $66, latecomers $88... Wow! that is a lot...</p>
              <p>The question I like to know is... All along they have been telling us we can catch it on Malaysia and Indon channels... We can also get indoor antennas... lol. I am just wondering now will they resort to jamming the other alternatives?</p>
