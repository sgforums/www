With his team's 28-game unbeaten run grinding to an abrupt halt in Seville, Wenger chose to engage in an argument with controversial referee Eric Braamhaar over the play-acting of the Spanish team. </strong><br><br>It ended with his expulsion from the technical area but he refused to retreat down the tunnel, ignoring several requests from the fourth official to go. He watched the final few minutes from behind a UEFA sign at the back of the bench but the view did not get any better as Sevilla scored a third from the penalty spot to leave Arsenal struggling to top the group.<br><br>Afterwards, he branded the behaviour of the fourth official as "shocking". It had been a gamble to rest senior players before three away games in eight days Â— at Aston Villa, Newcastle and Middlesbrough Â— and field an inexperienced team against such dangerous opponents. He may live to regret it, even though he insisted he did not.<br><br>The Gunners lost the motivational tool of their long unbeaten run and though qualification is assured, they have also surrendered the initiative at the top of Group H. Wenger said: "An unbeaten record in the Champions League is not important. We had to make decisions because we have a very important December. We had to make choices between the competitions. December for me is about the Premier League."<br><br>Arsenal must now hope for a favour from Slavia Prague, who play Sevilla as the Londoners finish at home to Steaua Bucharest, but they may now face a tough tie against one of the other group winners. This was their first defeat since they lost at home to West Ham in early April and it was deserved.<br><br>This Arsenal team were no match for the slick and stylish football of a mid-table team in Spain's Primera Liga. As always, Wenger's team made their own pretty contributions to a brilliant game, played at a fierce tempo in a frenzied atmosphere, but Sevilla dominated. As Sevilla celebrated on the pitch at the final whistle, it was hard to recall how well it had all started for Arsenal with Eduardo's wonderfully worked opener in the 11th minute.<br></div>

With Wayne Rooney still sidelined with ankle trouble, Saha has been handed two opportunities to convince Sir Alex Ferguson he is worth retaining. He struggled at Bolton at the weekend and struggled again in this match.</strong><br><br>It took Tevez's closerange equaliser in the 61st minute and a sensational injury-time free-kick from Ronaldo to help United overcome a first-half deficit and head for the second phase of the competition as group winners. With United offering up some rather uncertain play in the opening period, Lisbon were allowed to take the lead when goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak misread a shot from defender Fernando Abel that fizzed past him at the near post in the 22nd minute.<br><br>United improved tangibly in the second period as Tevez and Ryan Giggs were sent on as substitutes. Ronaldo, in particular, was a spellbinding influence. It was, however, another night of anonymity from Saha that will give Ferguson plenty to think about ahead of the transfer window.<br><br>The United boss has previously indicated he will adhere to his preferred policy of not interfering with his squad when the rest of Europe begins its annual winter bargain hunt. He must, however, be beginning to wonder if that is now the way forward. With the likes of Bolton's Nicolas Anelka still on his radar, Ferguson is aware he would be given money to spend if he feels his squad needs fresh impetus.<br><br>Saha is simply providing evidence that a phone call to the Glazer family may be in order. He is a talented footballer; quick, intelligent and with the ability to finish calmly. But at Bolton and against Sporting he was poor. Seemingly drained by the toll of persistent injuries and the knowledge that some have doubts about his ability to cope with the rigours of a full season, the Frenchman cuts a sorry figure.<br><br>Ferguson has been supportive in public but the fact that Saha was hauled off and replaced by a midfielder Â— Owen Hargreaves Â— as United chased victory says everything. Saha looked shot to pieces as he trudged off the field and no wonder. Once again, Ferguson offered only encouragement and suggested his player merely needs games.<br><br>The United manager said: "His last full game before Saturday was last December and we should think about that before talking about touch and confidence. That is the important issue with Louis. "We are trying to manage him and we are sure that his form will come."<br><br>While Saha must search for the ingredients that once made him such a powerful player, Ronaldo will now believe his own spell of relatively indifferent form is behind him. The ball that he sent towards goal in the 61st minute was speculative and TV replays were unable to reveal for sure whether Tevez touched it in from six yards or whether the final contact came from Sporting defender Marian Had. It didn't matter. United were back in the game and the momentum they subsequently developed earned a fifth successive win in the competition.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><strong><span class="large">BenÃ­tez 'sure' Liverpool will triumph</span><br><br>If Rafael BenÃ­tez is a man who thrives on pressure, he will surely be in his element when Liverpool FC take on FC Porto in a crucial UEFA Champions League match at Anfield on Wednesday.<br><br>'Must not lose'</strong><br>The game has been billed as must-win for Liverpool, but BenÃ­tez was keen to stress that even a point against Porto might be enough to eventually see the five-time champions through to the last 16. "We must not lose," he said. "This may be something that people have not considered, but if we draw and then beat [Olympique de] Marseille and BeÂºiktaÂº [JK] also beat Marseille [on Wednesday], maybe we can also qualify. It's really important to win but it's more important not to make mistakes."<br><br><strong>'No distractions'</strong><br>BenÃ­tez has seen his position as manager become the subject of media speculation following an alleged fall-out with the club's American owners, Tom Hicks and George Gillett, concerning his ability to sign new players. However, the Spaniard neatly sidestepped every question regarding his future as he kept his focus on tackling the Portuguese Liga leaders. "I am sure we will win and we will play well," he said. "There have been no distractions ... we have only been thinking about Porto and nothing else. The most important thing for my club and our supporters is the game."<br><br><strong>'Pretty football'</strong><br>A tournament-record 8-0 victory against BeÂºiktaÂº on Matchday 4 enhanced Liverpool's qualification prospects and started a sequence of three successive wins which culminated in Saturday's 3-0 triumph at Newcastle United FC which left the Reds in fifth place in England. "We are unbeaten [in the Premier League] and in the last game we played really well. We were passing the ball and playing pretty football, so everything is much better now and we will try to keep the momentum going," said BenÃ­tez, who will be without defender Daniel Agger and midfielders Jermaine Pennant and Xabi Alonso due to injury.<br><br><strong>Porto poised</strong><br>Group A leaders Porto will qualify for the knockout stage if they win, although a point against Liverpool could also suffice provided Marseille avoid defeat at BeÂºiktaÂº. Porto moved to the summit by overcoming Marseille 2-1 in their last European outing and they are also unbeaten in the Liga. A 2-0 home victory over VitÃ³ria FC on Sunday kept them four points clear of SL Benfica at the top, and coach Jesualdo Ferreira is in positive mood. "It's true that a draw could serve Porto's interests but we are not thinking like that, that was never the idea," he said. "If we play at the highest levels we are capable of, then we will know if a draw is enough to get us through."<br><br><strong>Changes possible</strong><br>Ferreira has no injury concerns yet admitted he may tinker with his side: "We are not going to try to change our tactics but Liverpool have a different method and I will decide which of my players are best suited to playing as well and as openly as I want them to, and also with great intensity. Liverpool have a solid and balanced team and they have a tradition of attacking very quickly. They have great strength in depth."<br><br></div>

Wenger gets his orders</span><br><br><strong><span class="large">Wenger banned for Euro blast</span><br><br>ARSENE WENGER has been handed a Champions League ban after blowing his lid in Seville. The Arsenal boss will be barred from the dug-out and dressing room for the final group game at home to Steaua Bucharest on December 12. And he is likely to have that ban extended to the knockout stages at a UEFA disciplinary hearing scheduled for the following day. </strong><br><br>Wenger was sent from the technical area for arguing with Belgian ref Eric Braamhaar during TuesdayÂ’s 3-1 defeat in Spain. But he ignored the orders of fourth official Reinold Wiedemeijer to go to the stands and watched the final 10 minutes at the entrance to the playersÂ’ tunnel.<br><br>That defiance is certain to land him in further hot water when BraamhaarÂ’s official report reaches UEFA HQ. A spokesman said: Â“Article 70 of our disciplinary code states any coach who is sent off during a game must immediately remove himself to the stands. Â“That is what happened with Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard in Lyon on Tuesday. It is no excuse for a manager to say he could not find a seat.Â”<br><br>Wenger was fined Â£2,500 by the FA in March for abusing ref Steve Bennett but has never incurred a touchline ban before. Jose Mourinho was hit with a two-game Euro ban in 2005.<br><br>The then Chelsea boss was barred from the quarter-final with Bayern Munich but allegedly got around it by having himself smuggled into the dressing room in a laundry skip.<br><br></div>

Didier Drogba fired a double and boss Grant said: Â“The Champions League is one of our targets, maybe the main target because we want to be a big club. Â“One of the things to achieve is reaching the final. I hope we do it and we will do it. Hopefully this year.Â” </strong><br><br>Alex and Joe Cole also scored to sink Rosenborg, who had drawn 1-1 at Stamford Bridge earlier in the season when Jose Mourinho was in charge of the Blues. Chelsea have now scored 30 goals in 14 matches since Grant replaced the Portuguese chief in September.<br><br>Grant added: Â“We got goals and created a lot more chances. But the most important thing is we have qualified for the second round with one game still to play. Â“ThatÂ’s not bad considering we dropped two points in our first game. Â“We want to play positive, attacking football and IÂ’m very happy with whatÂ’s happened up to now. Â“WeÂ’ve not just won matches but played better from game to game with good attacking football. Â“WeÂ’re in the next round and also in a good position in the league. Â“I was freezing, I must tell you Â— but I was warm in the heart.Â”<br><br></div>
