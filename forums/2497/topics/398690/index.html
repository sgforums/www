              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ARSENE WENGER is ready to rescue Shaun Wright-Phillips from his misery at Manchester City.</h2>
              <p class="article">The tricky winger has failed to land a regular starting place under Roberto Mancini at Eastlands.</p>
              <p class="article">Now Mancini is ready to let him leave and Arsenal boss Wenger wants to snap him up in a cut-price £5million deal.</p>
              <p class="article">Wright-Phillips returned to City for his second spell with the club in an £8.5m deal from Chelsea in August 2008. He signed a four-year deal worth £60,000 a week but that was before the big money started being spent by new owner Sheikh Mansour.</p>
              <p class="article">Wright-Phillips has since been at odds with manager Mancini on the training ground and publicly complained about the club not offering him better terms on his contract.</p>
              <p class="article">He has started just seven games since Mancini took charge in December and has been substituted in six of those.</p>

              <p>This are 'good' buys that major clubs can afford to buy, even if they turn flop, it won't be much of a loss. Players like SWP, Rafael Van Der Vart, One of the Diarra(s) at Madrid are outcasts of mega money spenders, and I strongly believe that Liverpool should go for players as such.</p>

              <p>Yeah seriously I can't remember about our actual discussion but since you mentioned a mod from this forum and the point in case... Equaling the 2 at Pool with the Glazers as owners... It's amazing.</p>
              <p>I seriously think you should first check up carefully on your facts whether the Glazer had actually not put a cent into the club before you go about making a statement like "the fact still reminds that Glazers didn't invested a penny into ManU". This is a very big remark to make without any prove to back your statement you know...  Any how say just to win a point in a discussion?</p>
              <p>You seem to have the notion The Glazers won't be liable for anything should the club financial fortunes changes or collapse do you? I don't think I need to go into more detail on this as I belief almost everyone should understand this simple scenario. Let me ask you this question, do you even realise the amount of liabilities they are carrying?</p>
              <p>Again, you are dead wrong on this as well... Owners, along with the managers are like part of the team today. Only they have a different responsibility to that of the manager. Prior to the Glazers taking over at United, the club spent 2 to 3 yrs with the same management team without the title and was looking to be on a decline... It was no secret that many saw it as the beginning of the end of an era and many predicted a Chelsea domination for the next decade. Many even started to question whether Fergie should step down and make way for a new man. Cos under a PLC system, United were never able to spent $50m to some say $80m in a transfer window. But they did with the arrival of the Glazers... They brought in Owen Hargreaves, Nani, Anderson and Tevez all in the same season... Paid what many thought then was over priced for Michael Carrick the year before. All these might not have happened had they remain a PLC where they had to justify each player's price to their thousands of shareholders and the stock exchanged as well. And on top of all this, keep a discreet balance sheet in every financial year so that shareholders get a larger profit returns. We can see this happening at Arsenal right now. So you still belief owners don't play a part?</p>
              <p>Joan Laporta became president of Barce, in Spain, becoming president is like being the owner and not a manager... He took a down and out Barce side back to the top during his presidency... In between there was 2 managers Frank Rijkaard and Josep Guardiola... So who should get the credit? Cos Rijkaard did a great job, but Guardiola did just as well if not better... So the President not important to you as well?</p>
              <p>Is there really a need for an explanation? Just use your common sense. Reason being very simple... The Glazer may not have any say what goes on at Chelsea. But like you have said it yourself, Roman and solely Roman will call the shot with regards to anything at Chelsea, and not even their then CEO Kenyon or other directors.</p>
              <p>Roman cannot tolerate failures therefore the rise of Man United again in 2006 saw the end of Mourinho, Grant and Scolari... It's that simple. Then CEO Kenyon was not in favour of the sacking but some of it was done without his knowledge when he was on the other side of the world when it was announced.</p>
              <p>And on the no disagreement, no discontentment and no interference part, What is there to be reserved about? If it's there, it will happen no matter how well you try to keep it under the table... But if it's not, then there is nothing to come out of it... We all saw it at Chelsea with Mourinho, then there was Scholari too... But nothing with Ancelotti... And we have all seen it with Rafa as well not just this season, last season too... It happen at United as well prior to the Glazers taking over... The pair of JP McManus and John Magnier brought un-stability to the club for a period. So you seriously belief owner can't play a part?</p>
              <p>Again you are terribly mistaken... I don't think I need to say this but I don't have any love or hate for the Glazers... and I won't miss them should they sell out to a better owners. But I can appreciate the timing of their era just like I once belief the club becoming a PLC in the early 90s was a great move cos it took them a club once behind to Liverpool in many departments like transfer of players, salaries of players, stadium standard, brand name/ club attractiveness to potential players... almost everything and change all that in their first 15 years. But time changes and a PLC might not be the best thing anymore to counter the new types of other football club owners...</p>
              <p>On what has been said, it doesn't change for me one bit. In this period of time, The Glazers are the best owners United could have... We can argue they can get better ones but then again, they could have got worse ones as well... Like the 2 at Anfield...</p>
              <p>So for you to equal them like they are alike, it's just plain ridiculous no matter how many years later we talk about it... Cos first 4 yrs alone, we can already see the huge difference in results and trophies between them. That alone is enough said for my case...</p>

              <p><em>Disagreement, Discontentment and Interference from the owners doesn't effect the team?</em></p>
              <p><em>George Gillett and Tom Hicks are running Liverpool like the Glazers at United?</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway in case you are not clear still... I am just so surprise i have to provide you this... The Glazer bought the club for $780m to $800m pounds and to date, they are said to owe $700m but initially if was only $500+ million. So, do the maths my friend, even if it's the full $700m, where did the shortfall came from?</p>
              <p>And btw, that point I made was on my second paragraph... So you sure you stop after the 1st? lol...</p>

              <p>personally, i think ownership by a foreign legion of billionaires is bad for premiership.</p>
              <p>it jack up the cost of staying in the premiership and eventually causes many clubs to go underwater.</p>
              <p>look at liverpool, portsmouth, everton, man utd.</p>
              <p>these clubs spent beyond their financial means to compete staying up in the premiership and get into the championleague. what happen to the club once they fail? they become insolvent and clubs get relegated. who is on the losing end? the fans. do the foreign legion of owners give a damn? i dont think so. at most they write off their iniital investment of hundreds of millions and go away. leaving the clubs in deep abyss of debts they probably would never be able to pay them off. these clubs are living on borrow time. if they ever appoint a wrong manager, buy few flops players as liverpool did, they are in deep deep shit!!</p>
