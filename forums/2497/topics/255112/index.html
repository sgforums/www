            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/41755000/jpg/_41755606_roykeane203.jpg"><br><br><strong>Sunderland boss Roy Keane has released former Republic of Ireland team-mate Kenny Cunningham as he prepares for life in the Premiership. The 35-year-old defender is among four men to have been shown the door by Keane after the club published the retained list for next season.</strong><br><br>Midfielder Tommy Miller and striker Kevin Smith have also been told their contracts will not be renewed, while the Black Cats have decided not to take up an option on Frenchman William Mocquet. The decision follows the return of loan signings Jonny Evans and Danny Simpson to Manchester United after the pair played a major role in the club's victorious Coca-Cola Championship campaign.<br><br>Cunningham arrived at the Stadium of Light on a free transfer from Birmingham last summer before Keane succeeded chairman Niall Quinn at the helm and started the first 11 games of the campaign. However, he lost his place through injury and made only one more appearance - in the 2-0 league win over Barnsley on October 21 - with Evans establishing himself alongside Nyron Nosworthy following his January move from Old Trafford.<br><br>Miller, 28, moved to the club he had supported as a boy on a free transfer from Ipswich during the summer of 2005 and made 29 appearances in their ill-fated Premiership campaign. He started the first three games of the new season, but became surplus to requirements after Keane's deadline day spree and was sent out on loan to Preston. Miller briefly returned to the bench towards the end of Sunderland's charge up the Championship table, but his last game for the club came as a substitute at Barnsley on March 10.<br><br>Twenty-year-old Scottish striker Smith joined the Black Cats from Leeds in January last year, but did not make a senior appearance and spent part of this season on loan at Wrexham. Mocquet, 24, was another who was sent out on loan, this time to Rochdale and Bury, and did not figure for the first team. Another who arrived at the club before Keane's appointment, the former France Under-21 international midfielder did so on a two-year deal from Le Havre.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If he can stay anywhere within 6 to 15 place, he will be considered a success already. Cos not many clubs come up, stay up. Even 17th place in the first season will be seen as a good result for a new manager like him... Sunderland has always gone back down after getting promoted...
