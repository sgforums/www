            <div class='col-md body'>Rafa slams academy system<br>By Simon Fudge -  Created on 19 Dec 2006<br><br>Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez thinks the youth academy system in England has failed to produce quality players.<br><br>Despite having seen the likes of Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher come through the ranks at Anfield, the former Valencia boss insists the system has not produced the kind of talent that it was meant to develop.<br><br>"You need to improve the English academy system, because it's not the best," claims Benitez.<br><br>"You can't just have players playing 18 games in a year. They need competitive matches. The system at the moment simply is not working.<br><br>"I coached the Real Madrid B side in the (Spanish) Second Division, with youngsters coming up against 30-year-olds and 35-year-olds.<br><br>"Rooney, at 16, can't be playing in the academy leagues. That's crazy. The academy system is not working, and that is worrying.<br><br>"There will be long-term effects - just look at the last few years."<br><br>Benitez agrees with the approach taken by Carling Cup rival manager Arsene Wenger at Arsenal, as the Frenchman has had success at finding and grooming young talent in recent years.<br><br>"When Arsene Wenger talks about quality and not nationality, I agree with him," he added.<br><br>"If you can find a balance between local players and foreign players, you must, but the most important thing is to be winning.<br><br>"We know there is a big difference with Arsenal, who can pay millions for Denilson and also spend big on Walcott and (Abou) Diaby.<br><br>"We are trying to do the same things on a lot less money, so we have to work twice as hard."<br><br>With The Reds hosting The Gunners in the Carling Cup quarter-final on Tuesday evening, Benitez is hoping to erase the memory of their 3-0 Premiership defeat to Arsenal last month.<br><br>"We have not forgotten that and want to win this game - as we do every one," he added.<br><br>"The Carling Cup may be fourth behind the Premiership, Champions League and FA Cup, but it is an opportunity to win another trophy.<br><br>"We played in the final two years ago and want to do that again if possible."<br><br><strong>agree la... england has not produce as much good youngsters...</strong></div>
