            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez has refused to rule out a move for Barcelona's Samuel Eto'o.</strong><br><br>Eto'o revealed earlier this week his admiration for Liverpool and Reds skipper Steven Gerrard after being impressed by them in the two UEFA Champions League clashes between the two sides earlier this season.<br><br>The Cameroon star's future at Barcelona has been the subject of speculation after a bust-up with coach Frank Rijkaard with reports suggesting he could be on his way out of Camp Nou in the summer.<br><br>Liverpool have been linked with Eto'o as they are expected to try and bring in a new striker in the summer and Benitez has admitted he is a fan of the African hit-man.<br><br>"Samuel is very clever, normally everyone wants to play alongside Steven (Gerrard) or Xabi (Alonso)," said Benitez. "But we can talk about players in the next few months.<br><br>"But Samuel Eto'o is a good player, and so is Stevie. It would be normal they would want to play together.<br><br>"But it is just speculation, at the moment it means nothing."<br><br>Benitez is focusing his attention of tying down his top stars to new deals to ward off any potential exits from Anfield.<br><br>The likes of Gerrard, Alonso and Jamie Carragher are all expected to be offered lucrative new deals in a bid to keep them at the club for the foreseeable future.<br><br>Benitez has admitted the club are talking to several players about new contracts.<br><br>"We are talking now to the players," added Benitez.<br><br>Jose Reina is one of the players keen on signing a new deal and the Spaniard is hoping to have talks with the club's new owners soon as he believes the future looks bright for Liverpool<br><br>"We will be speaking to the new owners over the next few days, but I've said many times now I'm really happy at Liverpool and I want to extend my contract," Reina told the local tv.<br><br>"The key for any growing team is not only to improve with new players, but also to make sure the key players and the spine of the side stays together. Then you can build an even stronger team around this. That spine is here at Liverpool.<br><br>"The project will be to build a team which is massive and can win many things.<br><br>"The new owners have said before they make transfers they first of all want to prepare new deals. Then I'm sure they will think about the summer. At this moment, the future looks brilliant.<br><br>"I've not met the owners yet, but I'm sure it will happen soon." </span></div>
