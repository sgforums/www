              <h1>West Ham's Davenport suffers serious injuries in stabbing</h1>
              <p>West Ham United defender Calum Davenport
              underwent surgery for serious injuries on Saturday after being stabbed
              on Friday night, the Premier League club said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 26-year-old centre back and his mother both received stab wounds
              at home in Bedford late on Friday evening, the club said in a statement
              on their website (www.whufc.com).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Davenport's mother is recovering while the West Ham player's injuries were described as serious by doctors.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The club's medical team are in contact with hospital staff," the
              club said, adding that "due to the ongoing police investigation, no
              further information will be released at this time."</p>

              <h1>West Ham's Calum Davenport May Have Leg Amputated After Stabbing Attack</h1>
              <h2>The career of the West Ham man may come to a tragic end following the horrific stabbing attack yesterday.</h2>
              <p>Doctors are fighting to save the left leg of West Ham defender Calum Davenport after he was stabbed several times by thugs yesterday morning, while relatives have told <strong>Goal.com</strong> that he will never play football again.<br><br>The
              26-year-old Davenport and his mother Kim, 49, were both attacked
              outside their homes in Springfield Avenue, Bedford at 5am yesterday
              morning. Calum was stabbed several times in both legs and was rushed to
              hospital along with his mother.<br><br>A main artery in Calum’s left
              leg was severed, causing him to lose pints of blood, and he was forced
              to undergo emergency surgery yesterday as doctors battled not only to
              save his leg but also his life.<br><br>There are still fears that Calum
              may have to have his left leg amputated, with the next 24-48 hours
              being crucial, while relatives have told <strong>Goal.com</strong> that the West Ham star “probably will never play football ever again”.<br><br><strong>Goal.com </strong>sources
              have learned that the attackers deliberately targeted Davenport’s legs
              in an attempt to end his professional career. The motive for the attack
              is unclear, but it has been suggested that Calum was involved in a
              family row shortly before the incident and that he had told his sister
              Cara, 28, who was also at the house at the time of the attack, that he
              "didn’t like the crowd she was mixing with”.<br><br>Reminiscent of a
              gangster movie, there is currently a police guard outside the private
              hospital room Calum is being treated in. The ex-Coventry player’s
              mother is also in a “serious” condition in hospital with stomach wounds.<br><br>Two
              men are currently in police custody connected with the attack. A
              19-year-old man and a 25-year-old man, the latter who has been arrested
              on suspicion of attempted murder.</p>

              <h1 class="storyTitle" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-size: 2.8em;">Man charged with GBH after Davenport stabbing</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A 25-year-old man has been charged with causing grievous bodily harm to
              West Ham defender Calum Davenport, Bedfordshire police said.</p>
              <p>Worrell Whitehurst, of Finsley Walk, Derby, was charged with GBH
              after the 26-year-old player was allegedly stabbed in Bedford on
              Saturday.</p>
              <p>Bedfordshire Police said Whitehurst was also charged with causing actual bodily
              harm to Davenport's 49-year-old mother, as well as driving whilst disqualified
              and possession of a bladed article.</p>
              <p>He
              will appear at Bedford Magistrates' Court on Monday, while a
              19-year-old man arrested shortly after the incident was released on
              police bail pending further inquiries, police said.</p>
              <p>A spokeswoman for the force said: ''A man has now been charged and is due to
              appear at Bedford magistrates' court this morning.''</p>
              <p>Davenport is in a serious but stable condition while his mother is
              ''recovering well'', police added.</p>
              <p>The defender, a former England Under-21 international, underwent emergency
              surgery at Bedford Hospital for stab wounds to both legs after an incident at
              his mother's home in Springfield Avenue, Bedford, at 5am on Saturday.</p>
              <p>Before
              Sunday's match between the Hammers and Tottenham, both fans were united
              in their support for Davenport - who also played at Spurs - as news
              broke that he was in intensive care.</p>
              <p>''It was unbelievable when
              we heard about it,'' manager Gianfranco Zola said. ''You don't expect
              these things to happen, especially to the people that you know. We are
              very,
              very sorry for him.''</p>
              <p>Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp added: ''I
              had him on loan, a lovely lad, inoffensive and it's really sad to see
              what's happened to him. Hopefully he'll pull through and be okay.</p>
              <p>''You couldn't meet a brighter, more laid back lad than him. It's really
              sad.''</p>

              <p>The Hammers centre-half has spent the last week in hospital after being stabbed at his Bedford home.</p>
              <p>The 26-year-old and his mother were attacked last Friday and required urgent medical attention.</p>
              <p>Davenport was stabbed in both legs, with the severity of his injuries requiring him to undergo surgery.</p>
              <p>He
              is, however, making steady progress in his rehabilitation from the
              incident and is no longer deemed to be in a serious condition.</p>
              <p>While
              Davenport has been given positive news, with amputation fears allayed,
              it remains to be seen whether he will be able to revive his career as a
              professional footballer.</p>
