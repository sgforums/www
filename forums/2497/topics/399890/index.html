              <p class="caption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">When </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> published their accounts for 2008-09 earlier this year, the club announced that its owner, the Russian oligarch </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Roman Abramovich</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">, had written off his mammoth £726m loan to the club, and converted it into shares.</span></strong></p>
              <p>But is not quite as clear-cut as that. Abramovich channelled his loans to the club, since taking it over in 2003 and wanting to spend its way to trophies, via a holding company, Chelsea Limited. He loaned money to Chelsea Limited, who then loaned it on to Chelsea FC plc, which runs the club.</p>
              <p>It is true that the loans from the holding company to Chelsea FC plc were fully converted to shares last year. However Abramovich's loan to Chelsea Limited, the holding company which owns Chelsea FC plc, was not. That loan remains owing; in fact it increased from £701m, because Abramovich loaned another £25m in a year when Chelsea's extravagant spending, and the dismissal of Luiz Felipe Scolari and his coaching team, produced losses of £47m.</p>
              <p>The accounts of Chelsea Limited (whose name was changed during the year to Fordstam Limited), show that loan still outstanding: £726m, owed to Abramovich.</p>
              <p>A spokesman for the club confirmed that yesterday: "Recapitalisation of loans happened at the level of Chelsea FC plc, not the holding company (Fordstam), therefore making the football club debt free."</p>
              <p>That is true. But Fordstam owns the football club company, and owes Abramovich £726m. The loan is interest free, but it is repayable if Abramovich gives 18 months' notice. The Russian could still demand the money back some day, either if the club is making a profit, or if he were to sell it. He has not, in fact, written off the huge loans he has made on his Chelsea adventure.</p>

              <p>Roman is one smart ass... He made sure Chelsea will have to pay him one way or another by hook or by crook one day... Cos on the surface, the club seem to be "debt free" but now that the press have investigated deeper into his share conversion, they found out Chelsea's holding company which was known as Chelsea Limited and strangely had its name changed to Fordstam Limited probably to avoid being link to the club, still owe him $700 over million...</p>
              <p>This mean that Roman can ask for every penny back one fine day when he decides to call it quits... Cos technically, he doesn't own the club, or does he? It's one weird setup though.  </p>

              <p>The problem is, Chelsea is artificially pop up. Therefore, as a normal investor, when you see their returns, it won't inspire a businessman or any board to dare put in so much money when the returns is non existence or the chance of lossing more is a strong possibility.</p>
              <p>And to someone really that rich and decides to play real live championship football, why would he want to spend $700 or $800 over million when he can say spend $100+ million (Like WH) and used the balance to buy new star players? It's not as tho Chelsea has a great history... Newcastle, Liverpool or maybe even Leeds probably have a stronger history and would cost a lot lesser too... And I believed they also have a greater fans base. Just look at those Arabs, why City? Cos it's a lot cheaper and you can spend the rest decorating the squad with colourful names right... lol.</p>
              <p>When you think about it, they could have taken over Newcastle or even Liverpool but they would have to spend maybe 3 to 4 times more than City...</p>
              <p>I mean where is the excitement for some rich dude who wants to play real live championship manager when you have a ready made team... Cos even if they succeed, I think you somehow won't feel it's your team...

              <p><br>Of course it isn't as attractive as City. But it would be more so than Chelsea in my opinion wouldn't you think so? The history, the brand name potential, the fan base around the world... It's quite priceless... And I think they might cost around $350 to 400m for everything from owners to debts without the stadium and another $300m to build it.</p>
              <p>On the stadium thing, it is not as though they got no stadium. Just that it's not the size they desire that's all to accommodated all their fans... Anfield isn't as small as one might think, it's just about 3 to 4 thousand lesser than Man City's stadium only...</p>
              <p>The good thing about them is, they are looking to build a stadium for 60 to 70 thousand fans and i believe they can fill it without too much problem... If City have a stadium of that size, they might not be able to fill it at all... That's the big difference for now. </p>

              <p>I think the story already said Chelsea Football Club don't owe Roman any money...</p>
              <p>Their parent company Chelsea FC plc also don't owe Roman any money either...</p>
              <p>But it's their parent, parent conpany Fordstam Ltd (Formerly known as Chelsea Limited) that owes Roman £726m...</p>
              <p>In other words, Fordstam Ltd is the grandparent conpany of Chelsea Football Club...</p>
              <p>It goes one big circle but still comes back to Roman's pocket at the end of the day...</p>
