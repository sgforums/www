              <p>After CBL for the past five years and making S-league current stage worst off than it started, he calls it quits.<br><br>http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/fit-to-post-sports/league-ceo-step-down-042943811.html<br>S-League chief executive officer (CEO) Winston Lee has announced he will be stepping down after five years.<br><br>The Football Association of Singapore (FAS) made the announcement on Tuesday after it revealed a new management structure to lead the league's Strategic Business Unit to strengthen and boost the management of the S-League.<br><br>Lee will continue in his role as FAS general-secretary and oversee the implementation of the FAS Strategic Plan.<br><br>"He will also serve as a resource person for the S-League where he can continue to share his experience and expertise. In addition to these responsibilities, Winston will also continue to explore opportunities to promote Singapore football in Asia, including the Asean Super League committee which is chaired by him," said FAS president Zainudin Nordin.<br><br>The FAS has formed a selection panel to embark on a hunt for the new S-League CEO. Comprising Singapore Bowling Federation president Jessie Phua, former minister and FAS president Ho Peng Kee, Singapore Sports Council CEO Lim Teck Yin and current football chief Zainudin Nordin, they will make the final recommendation to FAS.<br><br>"I've always been a big supporter of football. The person we are looking for has a very tall order to fulfil as it's a tough job. We need someone with a good business mind to bring the sport to the next level," said Phua, who was speaking to TODAY.<br><br>Other senior personnel will also be recruited as part of the league's new management team.<br><br>The move is S-League's attempt at reviving the fan turnout for the league matches, which have dwindled in recent years.<br><br>The 12-team competition received a boost earlier this year when the FAS increased funding for the clubs.<br><br>Last week, it was announced that Singapore will return to the Malaysia Cup after 17 years, to the delight of many fans.<br><br>However, critics say that the move is a sign that the <strong>FAS have acknowledged the S-League's failure</strong>.<br><br>However, Lee, who has also been the S-League CEO since 2006, dismissed this.<br><br>"The new CEO and the FAS must work with the clubs to ensure the S-League thrives. The S-League is the heartbeat of Singapore.<br><br>"That is why we must ensure there is more funding for clubs. We've also adjusted the fixtures to Friday, Saturday and Sunday from next season for the benefit of fans.<br><br>"There will be a dedicated management team from the S-League that will work closely with clubs to bring our league to the next level," he added.<br><br>Maybe he is ashamed of drinking to much coffee and not doing enough!</p>

              <p>I always wonder why the amount of money given to the clubs are so pathetic every year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I can recall correctly, each team gets maybe a million dollars or less per season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For goodness sake, even a junior minister makes more than that amount every year but yet they won't increase the amount to say $5 million per team. </p>

              <p>And you wonder why the S League continues to lag behind other leagues in the region.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
