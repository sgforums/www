              <p><strong>Sam Allardyce may take pride in the fact he can 'outwit' Arsene Wenger but this was more of a mugging than a mind game.</strong></p>
              <p>The frailties of <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal </span></a>reserve goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski were ruthlessly exposed once again as Big Sam enjoyed a sweet victory at the expense of an old sparring partner.</p>
              <p>Fabianski knew exactly what was coming his way at Ewood Park. So did Wenger - and that just made it more painful to watch.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/blackburn-rovers.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Blackburn</span></a> made life as uncomfortable as possible for the suspect Polish keeper. Bombarded by high balls and buffeted at set pieces, he cracked.</p>
              <p>It enabled David Dunn and Chris Samba to score the goals that earned Blackburn a richly deserved victory after Robin Van Persie had given Arsenal an early lead from a set piece of their own.</p>
              <p>Predictably, Wenger was unhappy at the way Blackburn players crowded around Fabianski and accused referee Martin Atkinson of failing to protect him. But the fact was the keeper looked every bit as shaky here as he did at Wigan last month, when Arsenal suffered another shock away defeat.</p>
              <p>The goalkeeping issue is one the Arsenal manager must address if his side are to be genuine title challengers next season.</p>
              <p>'I think it was a foul for both goals,' said Wenger. 'When you stop the keeper from getting the ball then it is a foul. The referee cannot allow that. There's no chance for the keeper to go for the ball.</p>
              <p>'They had two players in front of him all the time whose only purpose was to stop him getting the ball. It's completely unfair.</p>
              <p>'I am very disappointed the referee let that happen. You have to give more protection to a goalkeeper. He had no chance. When you jump in the air and someone unbalances you, what can you do?'</p>
              <p>Asked if another bad experience in the north-west would knock Fabianski's confidence, Wenger said: 'I think he had a good game. It should affect the confidence of the referee.'</p>
              <p>He had a point. Fabianski is a sound shot-stopper and made some good saves. Twice he did well to turn away free-kicks from Morten Gamst Pedersen, then came out to thwart the Norwegian when he was put through by Keith Andrews.</p>

              <p><strong>Blackburn claimed they should have had a penalty when Sol Campbell challenged Pedersen as he chased the loose ball. In fact, Fabianski's reflex save from Junior Hoilett's second-half blast was the best of the game. But he clearly struggles with high balls and it was a weaknessAllardyce made no excuses about exploiting after his side went behind in the 13th minute.</strong></p>
              <p>Samir Nasri's corner was flicked on by Bacary Sagna at the near post and Van Persie was unmarked to head in his first goal in six months and his eighth against Blackburn in as many games from close range.</p>
              <p>The satisfaction was temporary for Arsenal. Fabianski was left floundering in a crowd of players when Pedersen floated over a 43rd-minute corner and the keeper was on the floor by the time Andrews drove the ball back into the box. Jason Roberts' touch delivered it perfectly to the feet of Dunn, who had an empty net in which to score his ninth goal in 19 Premier League appearances this season.</p>
              <p>It got worse for Fabianski from another Pedersen corner in the 68th minute. Chris Samba had the simple task of heading in as the keeper collapsed in a heap, again appearing overwhelmed by the defender's challenge.</p>
              <p>Allardyce made a habit of getting under Wenger's skin as Bolton manager, but this was the first time he had done it at Blackburn. He could barely hide his delight.</p>
              <p>The Blackburn manager said: 'If you target the opposition's weaknesses enough then eventually they will be exposed. The keeper has obviously been a weak link for Arsenal and our main tactic was to put balls into the box.</p>
              <p>'It has paid off because we have beaten Arsenal fair and square. He can't give every one as a foul on the goalkeeper. He gave his fair share of fouls on the keeper that didn't look like fouls.</p>
              <p>'We haven't got the resources Arsenal have and we can't afford to buy the players they can buy so we have to use the resources we have got to the maximum - and we have. I'm not over concerned about what Arsene says. He said it before about my tactics but we know the tactics work against Arsenal.</p>
              <p>'He's entitled to his opinion. Whatever's happened between us in the past, and sometimes he's been a little frosty, I've always respected him as a manager.</p>
              <p>'I can assure you that most of the time the big boys get the rub of the green more than Blackburn.' It was a bad day all round for Wenger. Arsenal Ladies even lost the women's FA Cup final. Now his team need a point in Sunday's final game against Fulham to be sure of finishing third, above rivals Tottenham.</p>

              <p>It's obvious from the start that Blackburn is going route one. Look at who their manager is! Big Sam is well-reknowned to go for the long ball tactics. He doesn't change his style since his Bolton days. Wenger should know better since they have cross path so many times before.</p>
              <p>Wenger's insistence on playing Fabianski ahead of Mannone in the absence of Almunia proved costly time and again.</p>
              <p>Robinson is kicking the ball straight towards Gunner's goalmouth and the rest of Blackburn outfield players are doing the same. Roberts is the targetman they're aiming at and they all knew Fabianski is very weak in air. Everyone knew and apparently Wenger doesn't know.</p>
              <p>Blackburn got the win for their hardwork. Arsenal lost because of the team selection. Most of them are reserve players and of course, Wenger's usual stubborness to admit he made a mistake and chose to blame it on others.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>well, my take is wenger knows he got a problem, but rather than smash his players' confidence, he plays the "huh? where" card again given it is near end season and his team got nothing much to play for. And then he will strengthen his GK's position.</p></div>
