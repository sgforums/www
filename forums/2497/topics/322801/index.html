              <p>This is the shocking CCTV footage which saw Newcastle's Joey Barton
              locked up for six months. It was released by police after Barton
              admitted that he also assaulted ex-Manchester City team-mate Ousmane
              Dabo during a training ground incident. He will be sentenced for that
              offence later today.</p>
              <p>Do you think Newcastle can continue to stand by
              Barton?</p>

              <h1>Barton is sentenced for assault</h1>
              <p class="first"><strong>Footballer Joey Barton has been given a four month suspended
                  sentence at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court for assaulting a
                  team-mate.</strong></p>
              <p>The 25-year-old midfielder, now with Newcastle United, repeatedly
                  punched Ousmane Dabo who was on the floor during the attack at a
                  training ground.</p>
              <p>On Monday he admitted a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm when both were Manchester City players.</p>
              <p>He is currently serving a six-month jail term for an attack while on bail.</p>
              <p>During the attack for which he was jailed he punched a man in Liverpool.</p>
              <p>For this latest incident, which happened in May, he has also
                  been ordered to carry out 200 hours community service and must pay
                  £3,000 compensation to Dabo as well as footing the prosecution costs.</p>
              <p>The court heard that Liverpool-born Barton punched former
                  Manchester City colleague Ousmane Dabo up to five times, leaving him
                  unconscious and covered in blood on the ground.</p>
              <p>He had claimed he acted in self-defence but changed his plea to guilty yesterday ahead of a scheduled trial in Manchester.</p>
              <p>Barton was sold by Manchester City to Newcastle United in a £5.8m deal last summer, signing a five-year contract.</p>
              <p>His club has said it will not be commenting on the case.</p>

              <h1>Dabo launches vitriolic attack on 'cowardly' Barton and calls on Newcastle to sack him</h1>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/07/02/article-0-055FEB130000044D-950_468x492.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="492"></p>
              <p>Ousmane Dabo last night labelled Premier League hooligan Joey Barton a coward and called on Newcastle to sack him.</p>
              <p>Dabo - now with Lazio - said: 'I almost lost an eye,' he recalled.  'It was a terrible day but now I am happy with the outcome.</p>
              <p>'Barton admits he attacked me, struck me from behind and beat me when I was unconscious.</p>
              <p>'He admits he behaved in a cowardly way, and he is a coward.</p>
              <p>'We met one another on Monday. He was in one corner and me in  another.</p>
              <p>'He did not talk to me or apologise. But it did not trouble me to see  him  again.'</p>
              <p>Barton is currently serving a six-month prison sentence for a
                  separate  assault, on a man oustide a Liverpool McDonald's restaurant
                  in December last year.</p>
              <p>Newcastle are keen to offoad the player
                  bought by former manager Sam Allardyce from City a year ago and
                  Sportsmail revealed yesterday that Bolton are the latest club to show
                  an interest.</p>
              <p>Dabo, however, believes Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan and owner Mike Ashley should make a moral stand and sack the player.</p>
              <p>The Frenchman added: 'This is not the first time he has had trouble with the law<br>'He attacked some people in Liverpool recently.</p>
              <p>'English clubs teach you lots of lessons, but in this case they truly lack ethics and morals.</p>
              <p>'Newcastle
                  have invested a lot in this guy, and they do not want to lose a lot  of
                  money. The club does not care a damn about the law - and it shocks me.</p>
              <p>'Thankfully
                  there was no confrontation at the court. Barton pleaded guilty straight
                  away and I did not need to give evidence. That says a lot about me - it
                  shows that my version of the truth is the truth. I am happy with the
                  outcome.'</p>
              <p>Dabo endured a miserable two years at City after being signed by Stuart Pearce in the summer of 2006.</p>
              <p>Last night the 31-year-old added: 'I am happy at Lazio, and I do not think I am cut out for the Premier  League.</p>
              <p>'At Manchester City I injured my knee, I got a three-match ban soon after I arrived, and I got attacked.</p>
              <p>'Then to finish things off I ended up with Sven Goran Eriksson as my manager -  and he never played me for a single minute.'  </p>
