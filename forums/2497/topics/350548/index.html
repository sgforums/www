              <p><strong>10. Steven Gerrard (Liverpool &amp; England) £7.7 million</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.footy-boots.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/gerrard.gif" alt="" width="139" height="173"></p>
              <p>Scouser
                      Gerrard is the heartbeat of the Liverpool team alongside mate Jamie
                      Carragher. Earning a weekly wage in the region of £120,000, Stevie G
                      also benefits from an endorsement contract with Adidas, wearing the Predator Powerswerve football boots, and has recently featured in the ‘Impossible Is Nothing’ PR campaign alongside Kaka and Lionel Messi.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>9. John Terry (Chelsea &amp; England) £7.7 million</strong></p>
              <p>It’s no surprise JT features in the Top 10 playing for moneybags
                      Chelsea. Not only does the England captain take home a cool £130,000 a
                      week, but he is handsomely rewarded by football boot brand Umbro for wearing the SX Valor.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.footy-boots.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/terry-football-boots.gif" alt="john terry-football-boots.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>8. Fabio Cannvaro (Real Madrid &amp; Italy) £7.9 million</strong></p>
              <p>Defender Cannavaro’s stock rose with a move to La Liga’s Real Madrid
                      from scandal hit Juventus, after leading the Azzurri to World Cup
                      success in 2006. Cannavaro supplements his income with an endorsement
                      contract to wear Nike’s Total 90 Laser football boots, as well as modelling for Dolce and Gabbana. Mamma Mia!</p>
              <p><strong>7. Zinedine Zidane (Retired) £8.5 million</strong></p>
              <p>Now retired Zizou left his reputation in tatters following his sending off against Italy in the 2006 World Cup Final. Adidas still love him though, with the former Predator Absolute wearer being heavily involved in the recent launch of the Predator Powerswerve football boots in Paris.</p>
              <p><strong>6. Thierry Henry (Barcelona &amp; France) £8.6 million</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.rickey.org/blog/images/2006/10/thierry-henry-08-2006-10-19.jpg" alt="" width="402" height="600"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The
                      French magician is plying his trade for Barca following his departure
                      from Arsenal in 2007. Henry’s wage at Arsenal was reported to be
                      £112,000 a week, and one can only conclude that his wage has increased
                      now at the Catalan club. Thierry Henry gets added pocket money through
                      his tie up with Reebok wearing the Sprintfit boot, and va-va-vooming about in car adverts.</p>
              <p><strong>5. Michael Ballack (Chelsea &amp; Germany) £9.1 million</strong></p>
              <p>Midfielder Ballack rakes in a whopping £121,000 a week at Chelski
                      but he reckons that even this isn’t enough for him to afford a house in
                      London. What a plonker! Surely with the money he accumulates by wearing
                      his Adidas Predator Absolutes football boots, he can just about stretch to a one bed studio flat!</p>
              <p><strong>4. Wayne Rooney (Man Utd &amp; England) £9.3 million</strong></p>
              <p>When Rooney shot on the scene with his pearler against Arsenal as a
                      16 year old, those in the inner circles of football already knew he was
                      something special. His football boot contract with Umbro was soon swapped for a Nike deal, and he currently wears the Total 90 Laserfootball boot. Wazza is now one of the top earners at United and he also has several commercial partners including Coca Cola.</p>
              <p><img title="rooney football boots" src="http://www.footy-boots.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/t90laser_wayne_rooney_031.jpg" border="5" alt="rooney football boots" align="absmiddle"></p>
              <p><strong>3. Ronaldo (AC Milan &amp; Brazil) £12.7 million</strong></p>
              <p>AC Milan striker was three times named World Footballer of the Year.
                      He wowed us with his goalscoring whilst a Real Madrid Galactico but
                      injuries and weight problems have hounded him over the last few years,
                      and he is having a stop-start career with AC Milan. The buck-toothed
                      Brazilian’s football boot deal with Nike has earned him millions over the years, and he has recently launched his new 10 year Anniversary Mercurial football boot.</p>
              <p><strong>2. David Beckham (LA Galaxy &amp; England) £15.8 million</strong></p>
              <p>Goldenballs is a marketing mans dream. Good looks, good on the pitch
                      and with a spice girl wife, the LA Galaxy midfielder shifts club
                      merchandise like no other player. His deal with the Galaxy will
                      reportedly earn him $250 million dollars, and when he decides to
                      retire, he also has his David Beckham Academies in London, LA, and
                      Brazil to fall back on. Becks even has his own football boot, the Adidas Predator Absolute Globe.</p>
              <p><strong>1. Ronaldinho (Barcelona &amp; Brazil) £16 million</strong></p>
              <p>Ronnie suffered a World Cup hangover and was not at his best during
                      the 2006-7 season. He’s gradually rediscovering his form on his return
                      from injury and he’ll need to with Barca currently trailing Real Madrid
                      in the La Liga table. The little Brazilian now has his own R10 brand of football boots and clothing with Nike, and also benefits from a commercial deal with entertainment company Sony.<img src="http://www.footy-boots.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/ronaldinho-football-boots.gif" alt="ronaldinho-football-boots"></p>
