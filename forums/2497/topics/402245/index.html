              <p><strong>Gary Speed, one of the Barclays Premier League's most outstanding 
              former players, has been awarded an MBE for his services to the game.</strong></p>
              <p>Born
               in Mancot, Wales, on September 8, 1969, Speed went Hawarden High School
               in North Wales until he was 16. He made his league debut for Leeds on 
              May 6, 1989 in a goalless draw with Oldham at Elland Road in the old 
              Second Division.</p>
              <p>Speed went on to play 840 matches and score 134 
              goals during a career that spanned five clubs - Leeds (312 games, 57 
              goals), Everton (65, 17), Newcastle (284, 40), Bolton (139, 14) and 
              Sheffield United (40, six).</p>
              <p>Speed also excelled at international 
              level where he became Wales' most-capped outfield player (85 games, 
              seven goals).</p>
              <p>Only goalkeeper Neville Southall has more caps (92) 
              and the midfielder was recommended for the manager's job by Mark Hughes 
              when he stepped down in 2004.</p>
              <p>"I played all the way through the 
              representative sides, but was not picked for Wales Schoolboys at 
              under-15 level," Speed said recently.</p>
              <p>"I thought at the time that 
              my career was over, but, from that Wales Under-15 team, only Chris 
              Coleman made it through to full honours. It is something I always 
              impress on youngsters today.</p>
              <p>"The best advice I was given was to 
              try your best, and remember you never stop learning. I was still 
              learning about the game when I retired from playing."</p>
              <p>Speed also 
              held the record of most Premier League appearances with 535 until 
              February 2009 when Portsmouth goalkeeper David James overtook him.</p>
              <p>Speed
               finished his playing career with Sheffield United at the end of last 
              season in his 41st year and is now on their coaching staff.</p>
