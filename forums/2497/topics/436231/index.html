              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">CHELSEA are going back to Tottenham with a £30million bid for Luka Modric.</h2>
              <p>New Blues boss Andre Villas-Boas is concerned by the lack of pace in his midfield - which he felt was shown up in Sunday's goalless draw at Stoke.</p>
              <p>Chelsea will offer £30m cash or £27m plus Yossi Benayoun.</p>
              <p>SunSport understands the midfielder is not against a move to White Hart Lane.</p>
              <p>The bid is a considerable increase on the Blues' opening £22m offer but is a sign of Chelsea's desperation. Currently they have put £27m on the table.</p>
              <p>Spurs chairman Daniel Levy has been emphatic in his refusal to sell the Croatian playmaker at any price.</p>
              <p>But it is believed boss Harry Redknapp is softening in his stance towards selling Modric, who is unlikely to play in the Europa League game at Hearts on Thursday night.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> are considering offering Yossi Benayoun and Salomon Kalou as makeweights in a deal for </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Tottenham Hotspur</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">'s playmaker </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Luka Modric</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Spurs have already rejected two Chelsea bids for Modric this summer, worth £22m and £27m, and the chairman, Daniel Levy, has insisted that the unsettled midfielder, who has expressed a desire to move to Stamford Bridge, will not be sold at any price. Despite this, a third bid has been anticipated for some time but with Chelsea apparently reluctant to offer more than £30m for the 25-year-old, they are now exploring alternative ways of adding value to any deal.</p>
              <p>Chelsea had been resistant to the idea of offering players as part of any deal for the Croatian, their principal creative midfield target. That stance is understood to have shifted with the option of offering the two players in part-exchange, together with a fee of around £27m, now under discussion.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's manager André Villas-Boas is aware that despite off-loading Yuri Zhirkov to Anzhi Makhachkala this summer, he must create spaces within his 25-man Premier League squad to be submitted next month – only 17 of whom can be non-homegrown senior players – if he is to strengthen the midfield.</p>
              <p>The Premier League runners-up are also monitoring Raul Meireles's availability at Liverpool, though their priority remains Modric. But it remains to be seen whether Tottenham would be receptive to the possibility of taking either of the players potentially on offer. Benayoun has attracted tentative interest from Roma, Galatasaray and clubs in Russia this close season, and is the man whose position would be most under threat should Modric move across the capital.</p>
              <p>The Israeli was denied the chance to make an impact in his first year at Chelsea after suffering a serious achilles injury last September and despite the 31-year-old impressing in pre-season, reports emerged in Israel last week that he expects to leave Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>Kalou's possible availability would constitute more of a surprise and the Ivorian started Sunday's draw at Stoke City. However, Chelsea have a host of forward options with Fernando Torres, Didier Drogba – a player Tottenham would be keener to sign – Florent Malouda and Nicolas Anelka now joined by Romelu Lukaku, and with Daniel Sturridge having impressed on loan at Bolton last term and for his own club in pre-season. The England Under-21 striker, who is serving a three-match suspension, is expected to play a significant role this term.</p>
              <p>Tottenham still hope to refresh their own frontline this summer – they have sold Robbie Keane to LA Galaxy for £3.5m and may yet move on any of Peter Crouch, Jermain Defoe or Roman Pavlyuchenko – though it would still represent something of a reversal of policy if Levy was suddenly receptive to a Modric deal with makeweights thrown in.</p>
              <p>Comparisons have been drawn with Spurs' apparently similar hard-line stance with both Michael Carrick and Dimitar Berbatov, which mellowed after much wrangling as the transfer deadline approached in both cases, though the Croatian's case is very different.</p>
              <p>Carrick only had two years to run on his Spurs contract in 2006 and had made it clear he would not sign a new deal at the club. With Berbatov in 2008, Tottenham feared the Bulgarian might invoke the Webster ruling and buy out the remainder of his contract the following summer to force through his own move to Manchester United, effectively for a knock-down fee. Yet Modric is contracted until 2016 and has been commended for his professionalism since arriving at White Hart Lane.</p>
              <p>Having secured Lukaku and Thibault Courtois, Chelsea still hope to secure a third addition from Belgium before the end of the month, after holding further talks with Genk over their 20-year-old winger Kevin De Bruyne.</p>
              <p>The young forward may be loaned back to his current club for 12 months, if a fee is agreed. "My agent went to Chelsea on Wednesday and discussions have been good," De Bruyne said. "Maybe, by the end of the month, a deal can be sorted out because that would be a good thing for all three-parties. If there is an agreement with Chelsea, I would certainly spend another year at Genk."</p>

              <p>Well, if you were Harry, you would think that letting go one unhappy player in exchange for $30m or $20 plus + 2 above average players isn't all that bad either... Although it may not help them overtake Chelsea, but it may help them against Liverpool and Arsenal... So why keep an unhappy player who might not want to perform?</p>
              <p>Anyway, Paulo Ferreira is like a cockroach man... Cos no matter how bad he is or gets, he still manage to survive despite the change of so many managers to date...</p>
              <p>I am betting he will out last Villas Boas too... lol</p>

              <p><strong>André Villas-Boas, the <span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span> manager, wants Pereira, as first revealed by Telegraph Sport, and Modric to join £27 million signing Juan Mata before the transfer window closes next week. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>If Villas-Boas signs the trio it means Chelsea will spend more than £73 million in the final days of the window in what amounts to a huge statement of intent from Roman Abramovich.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>A £30 million bid, the third Chelsea have made, was submitted for Modric on Sunday with the midfielder having already told Spurs manager Harry Redknapp that he was not in the “right state of mind” to play for his present club and did not want to appear for them again.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>Modric missed Monday’s Premier League match at Manchester United and is not set to feature in tomorrow’s Europa League play-off against Hearts — if he did play he would be cup-tied for the Champions League ending his hopes of joining Chelsea.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>However, Spurs are understood to have informed Modric that if he does not make himself available for the City game this weekend then he cannot join up with the Croatian national team. Croatia have crucial Euro 2012 qualifiers away to Malta and at home to Israel next month with Modric desperate to play for his country.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>Spurs’ stance has left the 25 year-old in a dilemma especially as Redknapp is sympathetic to his situation and has already suggested that it may be best for all parties if Modric is sold. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy, however, is adamant he will not negotiate at any price and there is a rift between him and Modric.</p>
              <p>Chelsea are unlikely to make a fourth offer for Modric and have now bid for Pereira, a key target for Villas-Boas who is finally set to raid his former club. Pereira is regarded as a direct replacement for Yuri Zhirkov, who was sold to Russian club Anzi Makhachkala, and can provide cover for Ashley Cole as well as play in midfield.</p>
              <p>It is understood that although Pereira has a €30 million buy-out clause in his contract, Porto are willing to sell for lower having already signed the 25 year-old’s replacement, Alex Sandro. There is less pressure for Porto to sell, however, following the deal they struck for Radomel Falcao to join Atletico Madrid.</p>
              <p>Chelsea’s interest in Pereira may surprise supporters — it would not appear to be a priority position — and would also raise further doubts over the future of Florent Malouda as well as that of Yossi Benayoun, who is available for transfer. However Villas-Boas believes Pereira would make a big difference to his squad.</p>
              <p>Chelsea will complete the £27 million signing of Mata from Valencia this week with another of their recent recruits, former Barcelona B midfielder Oriol Romeu, hailing the signing yesterday.</p>
              <p>“He’s a wonderful player who can contribute a lot to the team,” Romeu said of the Spanish international. “I think he will settle in really well.</p>
              <p>"He’s a good quality player. He has the technique to make it in the Premier League, and is physically good.”</p>
              <p>Last night Porto sources indicated the club would reject Chelsea's opening offer for Pereira.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ANDRE VILLAS-BOAS was last night snubbed by his old club Porto over a £15million bid for Uruguay full-back Alvaro Pereira.</h2>
              <p>And the Chelsea chief insists the deal will not go ahead unless the Portuguese champions drop their £26m asking price.</p>
              <p>AVB admitted last night: "I can confirm we have made a bid for Pereira but we are very far apart in terms of the figures.</p>
              <p>"He is a very influential player but it will be very difficult to make this deal work. There is a massive gap in terms of our valuations so I am not confident it is going to happen."</p>
              <p>Porto president Jorge Nuno Pinta da Costa said: "Chelsea made us an offer for Pareira — but it took just 30 seconds to turn it down.</p>
              <p>"Every player who has an escape clause in his contract can leave if somebody makes us an offer that matches that fee.</p>
              <p>"But for Pereira, that escape clause is 30million euros."</p>
              <p>Chelsea have already splashed out £50m this summer to bring Juan Mata, Romelu Lukaku and Oriol Romeu to Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>And they still have a £30m bid for Spurs midfielder Luka Modric on the table.</p>
              <p>Villas-Boas added: "The market gets pretty frenetic in the last week of the transfer window and I don't know if that is the last of Chelsea's spending. Let's see how it goes."</p>

              <p>Maybe they want to have a serious back-up for Ashley Cole? Cos the guy is already not very young to be running up and down, and also quite injury prone these days... Also David Luiz is more of a CB, Paulo Ferreira RB and Rajkovic, me don't know who is this guy yet... lol.</p>
              <p>Benayoun, Kalou, Malouda all these 3 could be shown the door before the window close, so who knows... with their quota of 17 full, they need to make space before new names arrive...</p>

              <div class="KonaBody"><span>.</span></div>
              <p>Chelsea had a first offer, believed to be in the region of €20 million, rejected by Porto last week, with Pereira's agent claiming on Tuesday that <a href="http://www.goal.com/en/news/11/transfer-zone/2011/08/30/2643539/chelsea-are-still-trying-to-sign-alvaro-pereira-agent"><span style="color: #004276;">the Premier League side were still in the hunt for the 25-year-old</span></a>.<br><br>Earlier on Wednesday, reports in England and Portugal suggested that all of Chelsea's approaches for the Uruguayan had been knocked back by Porto, and Flavio Perchman, an associate of agent Alejandro Savich, has indicated that a deal is highly unlikely now.<br><br>"Unfortunately, talks have collapsed. Right now, I do not believe it will happen," Perchman told <em>Maisfutebol</em>.<br><br>"Porto did not honour their word because, last year, they promised to sell Alvaro Pereira if an offer upwards of €20m was tabled. Chelsea offered more than that.<br><br>"They denied Alvaro the possibility to grow, even though he is a player who has given his all for Porto. They have turned down all offers."<br><br>With a €30m release clause attached to Pereira's contract, Perchman believes that the Europa League winners' unwillingness to negotiate for his client is related to the departure of coach Andre Villas-Boas to Chelsea.<br><br>"I think Porto are trying to use Alvaro to get back at Chelsea about Villas-Boas. But he has nothing to do with that issue," Perchman said.<br><br>"It was a great opportunity, because no-one pays €30m for a full-back, not even Roberto Carlos cost that. Well, I do not believe in this transfer anymore, but we will continue waiting."</p>
