I trust the board and our chief executive Peter Kenyon in the negotiations he is doing.<br><br>"I know the players want to stay and I would be happy if they signed."<br><br>Robben's future has been further clouded by Chelsea's signing of Lyon winger Florent Malouda and Robben admitted on 10 July that contract talks were not going well.<br><br>The winger is one of manager Mourinho's key players but his progress at Chelsea has been hampered by a succession of injuries.<br><br>Last season, a thigh strain and knee injury kept him on the sidelines for several weeks of the campaign.<br><br>However Mourinho said he was keen to keep Robben, despite Malouda's arrival.<br><br>Robben played 45 minutes of Chelsea's 1-0 friendly win over Suwon Bluewings at the Home Depot Center in Carson, California, on Tuesday.<br><br>After the match Mourinho said: "The latest with Robben is that he played the game. I cannot tell you more than that.<br><br>"At the moment he is a Chelsea player with two more years of contract and he is working well.<br><br>"For me, he is a player like Terry or Lampard with two more years of contract.<br><br>"I look at him as a Chelsea player and he has to compete against very good wingers like we have. I am happy with the situation."</div>
