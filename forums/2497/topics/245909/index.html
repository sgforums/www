            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">Jose Mourinho claims the fixture list is stacked against Chelsea overhauling Manchester United in the title race.<br><br>Chelsea's 1-0 win at Watford kept the gap at the top to six points after United had earlier beaten Blackburn Rovers 4-1 at home.<br><br>While Mourinho is refusing to write off his team's chances of completing a hat-trick of Premiership title successes, he feels the champions are being done no favours by the timing of games.<br><br>The Blues boss is unhappy that the current leaders have been kicking off before his own team and believes it puts his players at a disadvantage.<br><br>"I can still see United dropping six points - three against us and maybe three from the moon," said Mourinho after the Watford win.<br><br>"It only takes one bad game or maybe a couple of draws, so it is still possible.<br><br>"But something strange is always happening with us regarding fixtures and referees.<br><br>"For instance, when we play Manchester United on Wednesday May 9, they play at lunchtime on the Saturday before, but we have to play on the Sunday evening.<br><br>"Also, we have to play our games after them every time. They always get the chance to increase their lead, but we never get the chance to cut their lead to three points and see if they can respond.<br><br>"Next week is the first time that will happen in six or seven and that's strange.<br><br>"And this week I had three e-mails informing me of a change to the referee. First, it was Mike Riley, then it was Mike Dean and finally it was Uriah Rennie and that's strange, too.<br><br>"I'm not saying it is a conspiracy, but it is strange."</span></div>

And in the long term... will really hurt the club's ambition to be the biggest in the world.<br><br>I think jose's ways is more better at managing smaller clubs... Cos he likes to make neutral fans against his club to motivate his players but it tends to damage the club's reputation and makes neutral fans dislike them as well.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">Ferguson: Easter fixture list favours Chelsea<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson has hit out at the crazy fixture scheduling he believes has handed Chelsea an unfair boost in the race for the Premiership title. </span><br><br>Although Manchester United remain in pole position, six points clear with just seven games left heading into tomorrow's evening clash with Portsmouth, Chelsea are strongly fancied to halve the deficit against Tottenham a few hours earlier.<br><br>Spurs have been pressed into action just 39 hours after completing their draining UEFA Cup quarter-final first leg in Seville.<br><br>Chelsea rejected Tottenham's efforts to get the Stamford Bridge clash put back 24 hours as is usually the case after Thursday UEFA Cup games because of their own scheduled flight to Valencia ahead of Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final return leg, throwing the decision back into the Premier League's hands.<br><br>And, much to Martin Jol's displeasure and Ferguson's disbelief, the authorities decided the original date and kick-off time should stand.<br><br>'Given the power Chelsea seem to have over issues like this, I am not surprised,' said Ferguson.<br><br>'If the game had been played on Sunday lunchtime, Chelsea would still have had well over two full days to prepare for the Valencia game. As it is, Tottenham get 39 hours. What is the right decision?<br><br>'It seems the Premier League are quite happy to give Chelsea the extra time but not Tottenham.<br><br>'If Tottenham lose, and lose out on a European place because of it, I don't imagine they will be very happy.<br><br>'But it is the Tottenham supporters I feel sorry for. They have travelled to see them play in Seville and now their team is asked to play again so quickly. It is letting them down in some ways.'<br><br>If Chelsea do emerge victorious from the London derby, United's lead will be cut to its lowest level since Christmas.<br><br>Ferguson has already spoken about the psychological effect perceived swings in fortune can have, even when nothing has fundamentally changed.<br><br>So it is no surprise he is even more anxious than usual that United should approach the Fratton Park trip caring only about their own performance and result.<br><br>'We have to concentrate on ourselves,' he said.<br><br>'We have been doing really well. Our form is good. I have no issues about that at all. Hopefully that will continue.'<br><br>In order to ensure his team were fully prepared for the Portsmouth encounter, Ferguson took the unusual step of keeping them in Italy after Wednesday's draining Champions League tussle with Roma.<br><br>By flying straight to the south coast, Ferguson has cut down his side's travelling time and with their eyes firmly focussed on ending a four-year championship drought, the United boss does not believe there will be a problem with focus as attention shifts from major European challenges to huge ones on the domestic front.<br><br>'We have the league title uppermost in our thoughts and that is the best motivation you could possibly have,' said Ferguson.<br><br>'It is not easy coming out of a European game but it really helps that we are challenging for the title and I also believe we have done the right thing by staying in Rome.<br><br>'We have avoided a long trip back, which has allowed us to prepare properly to give ourselves the best chance possible of getting a result at Portsmouth.'<br><br><span style="color: green;">No Surprise If no man utd fan hit out @ SAF for saying this things that is very similar to what jose said</span></div>
