Mourinho, who shook hands and spoke with with owner Roman Abramovich - signalling a possible thaw in their reportedly frosty relationship - after Sunday's FA Cup semi-final win over Blackburn Rovers, believes Liverpool can concentrate solely on their European meeting.</strong><br><br>Chelsea, with the League Cup already secured, are battling on three fronts and are desperate to retain their Premier League title, trailing leaders Manchester United with six games remaining. They host United at Stamford Bridge in the league on May 9 and play them again in the FA Cup final on May 19. "One of my assistants went to watch Liverpool on Saturday and he left after 60 minutes because it was like a testimonial match," Mourinho told reporters. "And he saw the Champions League game against PSV and it was no different. It is clear they are preparing for the Champions League semi-final.<br><br>"But at Chelsea, after two hours of playing Blackburn we have a game with West Ham in two days we have to win and another one at Newcastle this weekend we also have to win. "This is what we fight for though - to be in this position. We can't complain about it." Mourinho said Alex Ferguson had predicted a possible meeting between his Manchester United team and Chelsea in the Champions League final when they met in November.<br><br>"I met Sir Alex Ferguson at a charity dinner when he invited me," he added.<br>"He was telling me he thought it would be an all-English final in the Champions League and I told him I believed him. "Now if we both get there it will be the cherry on the cake. It would be magnificent."<br><br>The Portuguese says he has the utmost respect for Ferguson.<br>"We can't be happy when one succeeds and one fails," he said.<br>"Of course we want to win, but we respect each other."</div>
