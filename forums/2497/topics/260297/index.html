            <div class='col-md body'>Arsene Wenger has thanked Arsenal's fans for their 'trust' - and promised a much more competitive team to watch at Emirates Stadium next season.<br><br>The Gunners boss returns to work this week with several key issues to resolve ahead of pre-season training next month.<br><br>The future of captain Thierry Henry - a reported target for both AC Milan and Barcelona - is top of the agenda, while Wenger must also recruit a new director of football as well as deal with the continued speculation surrounding a takeover, an Arab consortium the latest big-money link.<br><br>Wenger, 57, has already moved to reassure fans he has no intention of quitting the club in the wake of the shock departure of vice-chairman and close friend David Dein.<br><br>The Arsenal boss stressed there was 'absolutely no need to panic' and remains confident of the prospects for next season.<br><br>Wenger has long lauded the potential of his current squad, and insists he will only add players of 'exceptional' quality.<br><br>The Frenchman remains confident this Arsenal side are on the verge of greatness.<br><br>'I would like to thank the fans because they have been consistent in their support to our team - week in, week out, 60,000 turn up at the Emirates even when we were out of the championship race,' Wenger said in the Arsenal end of season DVD `Young Guns', out today in all Arsenal stores and via home shopping.<br><br>'First I would like to thank them for the way they trust us and promise them that we will come back next season and fulfil all their hopes and at least give everything to do it.'<br><br>Wenger accepts it took his team some time to adapt to their new surroundings - a trait which more than played its part in their lack of impact on the Barclays Premiership title race last season.<br><br>The Arsenal manager, however, knew it was a move which had to come to safeguard the long-term future of the club and see them compete at the very highest level, both on and off the pitch.<br><br>Wenger said: 'Because it is of course massive, it is big, more comfort. You lose a little bit that kind of compact atmosphere that you get still at Anfield - but on the other hand it has such a huge potential for the club to develop to a top level that is needed.<br><br>'It was needed and its fantastic.'<br><br>The likes of Cesc Fabregas, 20, and Kolo Toure, 26, both penned new deals during last season. This summer there were also contract extensions for full-back Emmanuel Eboue and striker Emmanuel Adebayor.<br><br>Wenger feels such driving ambition goes a long way to 'make' a club.<br><br>'They are top-class players, top-class personalities and they are winners,' said Wenger. 'At the end of the day those who make the clubs win first of all must have a burning internal desire to win.<br><br>'Winning must mean something to you. If your job is to win football games, it must mean something to you and for them both it is a big, big signification.'<br><br>I believe in him! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
