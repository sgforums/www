              <p><strong>Gianluca Vialli believes </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea </strong></span></a><strong>are going backwards this season because they can't beat the top teams. The former Blues manager watched their dismal 3-1 defeat by Roma in the Champions League as a pundit for Sky Sport Italia and was shocked by how badly they played.</strong></p>
              <p>It was Chelsea's heaviest defeat in Europe's premier club competition for four years, while they have also suffered setbacks in the Premier League against their title rivals, losing against Liverpool and drawing with Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Vialli said: 'I don't think Chelsea are the same team as they were a few years ago. They don't have the consistency any more.</p>
              <p>'They were beaten by Manchester United in the final of the Champions League last season and also lost against Liverpool at home the other week. Before they used to beat these teams.'</p>
              <p>Vialli feels manager Luiz Felipe Scolari, who has set his sights on winning all four trophies this season, was outthought by Roma counterpart, Luciano Spalletti.</p>
              <p>He added: 'Chelsea went to Rome to settle for whatever they could get and, when you do that, you end up losing the game on most occasions. Roma had a great reaction to this, especially after all the problems they have had recently.</p>
              <p>'Spalletti changed the system, with [Francesco] Totti behind [Mirko] Vucinic as well as [Matteo] Brighi supporting [Simone] Perrotta on the flanks, and this made life difficult for [Florent] Malouda. Roma showed great football with the ball to feet and it worked.'</p>

              <p>Here lies the dilemma... You rather they play slightly better but results wise not always fully convincing or like in a systematic way but gets the results needed ?</p>
              <p>Of course it would be great to have the best of both worlds i guess... But if they can't, then which one would you prefer? Some people will find it hard to pick i guess...</p>

They have been playing this way since the George Best and Bobby Charlton days... They have always had exciting wingers over the years... Olsen, <span style="color: #000000;">Andrei Kanchelskis, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Strachan, Giggs in his younger days... These players were selectively chosen because of the style they played... Players join the club and they are expected to play this style and eventually they keep it going till the next generation of players arrive...

              <p><strong>Chelsea striker Didier Drogba has issued an apology for throwing a coin back into the crowd during their Carling Cup defeat by Championship side Burnley.</strong> <strong>But he could still be subject to an investigation by the Football Association over the incident.</strong></p>
              <p>Drogba was handed a yellow card when he was seen throwing the coin back into the crowd after putting Chelsea in front in the 27th minute.</p>
              <p>A spokesman for Chelsea said: "We will deal with this in the usual way. "We are aware there is an incident. But we will not discuss it further until we have seen the referee's report."</p>
              <p>Burnley manager Owen Coyle did not see the incident and Chelsea coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said: "I have not spoken with Didier about any problem. "The referee gave him a yellow card but I did not see what happened."</p>
              <p>In 2002, Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher was sent off in an FA Cup tie against Arsenal at Highbury after throwing a coin back into the crowd. He received a mandatory three-match ban.</p>
              <p>He was also interviewed by police but no further action was taken. However, Carragher was fined by the club and warned as to his future conduct.</p>
              <p>Chelsea crashed out of the competition when Brian Jensen saved spot-kicks from Wayne Bridge and John Mikel Obi to send Owen Coyle's side into the last eight 5-4 on penalties.</p>
