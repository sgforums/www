            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has challenged Andrei Shevchenko to prove his critics wrong.</strong><br><br>Shevchenko has struggled to hit the heights expected in his first season in England following his Â£30million move from Milan.<br><br>The Ukrainian has scored just four Premiership goals as he has failed to live up his star billing at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>Mourinho has conceded he has been disappointed by Shevchenko this season and the Blues boss has laid down the gauntlet to the striker to prove he can be a success at the club next season<br><br>"It is up to him. Hopefully he is not happy," said Mourinho. "I hope he is not happy with what he gave to his team.<br><br>"If he is not happy it is a good start."<br><br>When asked if he expected Shevchenko to be a Chelsea player at the start of next season, Mourinho replied: "He is a Chelsea player and he has a contract.<br><br>"If he is not happy and he wants to try everything to improve, of course.<br><br>"Sheva's season was not what everyone was thinking, including myself.<br><br>"In his defence he has a history of many years in a completely different culture. That can be on his side."<br><br>Mourinho was more generous in his praise of Shevchenko's strike partner Didier Drogba, who ended the season as the Premiership's top scorer.<br><br>Drogba has so far scored 32 goals this season, including 20 in the Premiership to make him the first Chelsea player in 20 years to lift the Golden Boot.<br><br>"I think he deserves it (being top scorer). To be top scorer in the Premiership, without taking penalties, is more than deserved," added Mourinho.<br><br>"Every goal was a proper goal and I am very happy for him. I am happy he did score 20 goals and no penalties."<br><br>Mourinho also revealed that he did not plan any major signings in the summer as he believes he does not need to make many changes to his squad.<br><br>"There will be no big investments, we won't be involved in the big market," continued Mourinho.<br><br>"We don't need a lot of players, just a normal season without so many injuries." </span></div>
