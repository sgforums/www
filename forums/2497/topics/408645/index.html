              <p><strong>WILLIAM GALLAS is set to sign for Spurs - and instantly become a hate figure for Arsenal fans.</strong></p>
              <p>The free-agent former Gunners captain will have a medical and is due to sign a one-year deal over the weekend. <br><br>A pal said: "Apart from a few details, everything has been agreed and William will have a medical on Friday." <br><br>Gallas met Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp last night and asked for a two-year contract but only a year was on offer. <br><br>Redknapp was desperate to boost his defence due to the long-standing injury problems of Ledley King and Jonathan Woodgate. <br><br>Gallas, 33, will not be registered in time to face Stoke tomorrow or play in the crucial second leg of the Champions League qualifier against Young Boys with Spurs 3-2 down. <br><br>He was let go by Arsenal after refusing to accept a one-year deal that included a pay cut. <br><br>The ex-Chelsea centre-half suffered abuse from fans every time he went back to Stamford Bridge. <br><br>But that will be nothing compared to the reception he will get at the Emirates on November 21.</p>

              <p><strong>William Gallas is heading for his Spurs medical as Harry Redknapp makes his move for Steven Pienaar and Lassana Diarra.</strong></p>
              <p>Spurs are expected to offer £6million to Everton for Pienaar and Redknapp believes he can take Real Madrid midfielder Diarra on loan after the Spanish club announced he could leave.</p>
              <p>Former Arsenal skipper Gallas will have tests at Tottenham on Friday as Redknapp looks to strengthen the Spurs squad after a quiet summer.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">The France centre back is available on a free transfer after rejecting the offer of a two-year deal at The Emirates because it amounted to a significant pay-cut.</p>
              </div>
              <p>He is now close to agreeing a one-year deal with Arsenal’s fiercest rivals.</p>
              <p>Redknapp said of Gallas, 32: ‘He’s been an Arsenal player but he was at Chelsea before that and playing abroad before he arrived there.</p>
              <p>‘It’s not like we would be signing Tony Adams. He’s a good player and he would be a very useful addition to our squad.’</p>
              <p>South African Pienaar would excite Spurs fans. Redknapp has long admired the tricky wide man, who was Everton’s Player of the Year last season.</p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>Pienaar, 28, has yet to sign a new contract with Everton and has just one year remaining on his current deal. His representatives have also been upset that Everton have agreed deals ahead of him with Tim Cahill and Mikel Arteta, who had more time left on their contracts.</strong></p>
              <p>Pienaar admitted that he would be happy to stay at Everton if they offer him the right deal.</p>
              <p>He said: ‘I have a year left on my contract. I’m happy to sign a new one, but at my age it has to be right and fair. The only difference I’ve had with the club has been over what’s right.’</p>
              <p>However, it is understood Everton are still reluctant to offer what his representatives believe is right — and Spurs hope to take advantage.</p>

              <p><strong>Diarra, meanwhile, was told he is not part of Jose Mourinho’s plans at Real Madrid. Redknapp made an enquiry earlier this week about the player who served him so well at Portsmouth — and at that stage the Spanish giants said he was not available.</strong></p>
              <p>But Mourinho has since informed Diarra that the best he can expect is a place on the bench and he has now been added to a ‘for sale’ list, drawn up by Real sporting director Jorge Valdano.</p>
              <p>Manchester United, Liverpool and Aston Villa are also thought to be interested in the versatile former Chelsea and Arsenal player, 25.</p>
              <p>Redknapp hopes his relationship with Diarra will count in his favour. The French playmaker enjoyed the best spell of his career under Redknapp at Portsmouth, winning the 2008 FA Cup.</p>

              <p>To be fair, we shouldn't blame him cos Arsenal were the ones who didn't want him in the first place... They only offered him a 1 yr contract plus a pay cut... Who can take this type of treatment after serving them for so long?  And it's not like he is already over the hill, he is still very good in the centre-back position and his experience will help Spurs a lot this season.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, he will have the unique status of having played for the 3 London clubs...  Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs... How cool can that be? I just wonder anyone else have done so before?</p>
              <p>Lassana Diarra could join him in that unique club... lol.</p>

              <p>Wenger believes rival manager <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Harry Redknapp</span></abbr> is signing an excellent player who simply wants the best from himself and those around him.</p>
              <p>"William has an exaggerated bad reputation. I believe that he is a genuine winner," said the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> manager.</p>
              <p>"He wants things not to be done at 90 per cent and is completely focused and motivated to win.</p>
              <p>"He can be sometimes, a little bit brutal or impulsive in his reaction -
