            <div class='col-md body'>CHELSEA and referee Graham Poll are at war after the clubÂ’s bad-tempered defeat at Tottenham. Blues star Ashley Cole rapped: Â“If youÂ’re going to have a ref like that, you know itÂ’s not worth playing the game. Â“You know youÂ’re going to get a hard time.Â”<br><br>The Chelsea players blasted PollÂ’s performance and claim he warned two of them: Â“Your discipline is out of order and you need to be taught a lesson.Â”<br><br>They insist the statement came after he controversially disallowed a Didier Drogba Â‘goalÂ’ when Chelsea were already a goal up. There is a strong feeling within the championsÂ’ camp that Poll was pursuing an agenda.<br><br>Cole added: Â“Poll also said to Frank Lampard early in the game Â‘You need to get it in check and you need disciplineÂ’.Â” Chelsea finished SundayÂ’s 2-1 defeat with skipper John Terry sent off and a total of six yellow cards. They will now face an FA fine of Â£25,000 and a possible charge of Â‘unsporting conductÂ’.<br><br>Fuming England full-back Cole reckons Poll was influenced by the Champions League clash in Barcelona last week and that he was out to make a point. The game in Spain saw Drogba rapped for going to ground too easily and boss Jose Mourinho criticised for his goal celebration after the Ivory Coast strikerÂ’s last-gasp equaliser in a 2-2 draw.<br><br>Cole said: Â“What happened to us in Barcelona had an influence on the Spurs game, of course it did. Â“The referee has watched it and had an opinion and I think heÂ’s just taken it on himself to prove a point to everyone.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m not moaning but we really shouldnÂ’t lose a game like that one at Tottenham.Â” To make matters worse for Chelsea, Poll is thought to have branded the teamÂ’s protests after DrogbaÂ’s disallowed Â‘goalÂ’ as harrassment in his match report.<br><br>As a result, the club could face a further FA charge and possible fine. Cole, too, could find himself in trouble with Soho Square for his comments.<br><br>What bad losers they are... blaming the referee, and now trying to put pressure on referees in their future matches... Poll was lenient not to give lampard a yellow in the first half... somemore they can say like that... Can't they just face it, spurs played well that's all!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Latest Football News<br><br>November 10 2006<br><strong>Hackett backs Poll after red card for McFadden</strong><br><br>Referees chief Keith Hackett has insisted under-fire official Graham Poll was absolutely right to send off Evertons James McFadden in midweek. The Scottish forward claimed he was sent off in the Carling Cup defeat by Arsenal because Poll thought he called him a "f****** cheat" when he had in fact said "that was f****** s***".<br><br>Everton manager David Moyes was furious with the decision but Hackett, head of the Professional Game Match Officials, said that both outbursts warranted straight red cards and gave Poll his full backing to continue refereeing the top matches.<br><br>He said: "Both of those statements fulfilled the criteria of a red-card offence therefore the referee has on this occasion followed the rules. If one uttered those words to a policeman what do you think he would do? Were grown up about these things but theres a tolerance level and players have to be aware they have a responsibility to operate within the rules. Whatever way you look at the laws of association football, insulting language is not allowed on the field of play. If you are operating as professional player within this great game of ours you have to be aware of this responsibility. The principle is that insulting language in the laws of football, however you look at it, is a red-card offence."<br><br>It is the second time in a week Poll has endured the wrath of players and managers after he sent Chelseas John Terry off for two bookable offences at Tottenham. Terry claimed Poll changed the reason for the second yellow card, while Ashley Cole claimed the official had told Frank Lampard that Chelsea needed a lesson to improve their discipline - a claim fiercely denied by Poll. Hackett said Poll was one of the countrys leading officials and would continue to referee the top games.<br><br>He said: "We are talking about one of the top referees in England who features in the top games as well as less high-profile matches in the Premiership and Carling Cup. I feel he will remain strong as a referee and players have to be aware they have to play by the rules of football. He has just completed 300 Premier League games and is highly regarded in Europe. I want my top referee, who is performing well, to be available and he will be on duty between Manchester City versus Newcastle on Saturday."<br><br>Hackett said however Poll would not be a definite choice for the Manchester United against Chelsea match later this month. He added: "I and my team make that decision on the Monday before the game, based on a number of criteria including form. It is a big game but I cannot say at the moment whether or not Graham will be the referee."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jol gives Poll his backing<br><br>Tottenham boss Martin Jol has backed Graham Poll following the refereeÂ’s controversial performance at White Hart Lane last week. Poll was accused of deliberately targeting Premiership champions Chelsea during SpursÂ’ victory but Jol points to the Tring officialÂ’s previous record as one of the countryÂ’s top referees.<br><br>Poll made a high-profile blunder at the World Cup this year when he gave CroatiaÂ’s Josip Simunic two yellow cards without sending him off until he issued a third, but Jol still believes he is Â“one of the bestÂ”.<br><br>Â“HeÂ’s certainly one of the biggest personalities,Â” Jol said. Â“On performances in the past, if you judge him on that, heÂ’s probably one of the best. In Europe they would judge him as one of the best. If you look at Graham Poll and if you only judge him, for example, on the three yellow cards in Germany, I would call that Â’scoreboard journalismÂ’ Â– if someone makes a mistake heÂ’s bad. I donÂ’t believe in that. It would be the same if he made a mistake next time and gave them (the opposition) a penalty. I wouldnÂ’t change my mind.Â”<br><br>As well as PollÂ’s controversial performance on Sunday, Arsene Wenger and Alan Pardew clashed on the touchline earlier in the day when the West Ham manager celebrated a goal in front of his Arsenal counterpart. Jol was celebrating TottenhamÂ’s win himself when the final whistle went at White Hart Lane and Spurs had beaten Chelsea in the league for the first time since 1990.<br><br>He admitted he should have stayed clear of Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho, but added: Â“Mourinho was good. I was celebrating, I didnÂ’t even realise he was in front of me, and still he was good to me. Pardew did the same with Wenger and he wasnÂ’t. I was standing in front of him, I shouldnÂ’t do that, but it was spontaneous. I think heÂ’s a good man.Â”</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea have no grudge with Poll says Lampard<br><br>Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard insists the Premiership champions have no axe to grind with referee Graham Poll.<br><br>The World Cup official was criticised by Blues boss Jose Mourinho and defender Ashley Cole after he sent off their captain John Terry in a defeat at Tottenham last weekend, but Lampard was adamant there is no bad blood from the Londoners towards Poll.<br><br>"I will say nothing the next time I see Graham Poll," Lampard told a newspaper.<br><br>"There isnt anything to say. We have to get back to playing football and there will be no need for me to say anything. Graham Poll came to the training ground pre-season and explained the new laws and we have no problem with him. A big decision went against us in the Spurs game and thats it. There is certainly no grudge on our part and Im sure there wont be on his."<br><br>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson insists the planned meeting between Mourinho and referees chief Keith Hackett after the Portuguese criticised Poll is "ludicrous", but Lampard claims communication with officials is key.<br><br>"Referees say that sometimes players talk to them in a bad way but now there are times when a referee talks to a player in a bad way," he added. "When those things start to happen then the relationship starts to break down. Its a two-way street."</div>
