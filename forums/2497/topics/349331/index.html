              <p><strong>Joe Hart admits his place in the England squad is under threat following the arrival of Shay Given at Manchester City. </strong></p>
              <p>The England prospect was Mark Hughes’ first-choice keeper before the
              City boss spent £8 million in January to recruit Given from Newcastle.</p>
              <p>Hart has since slipped behind the new arrival in the pecking order
              and admits the situation could jeopardise his own international hopes.</p>
              <p>The keeper, who has been capped once for England, said: "It has been
              hugely beneficial and a great honour to be involved in the England
              squad.</p>
              <p>"My desire to become first choice for my country is as strong as
              anyone’s. I need to play first-team football to play for England and my
              aim is to force my way back into the City side.”</p>
              <p>Hart admits it has come as a blow to have lost his place in the
              side, but insists he bears no bad feeling towards the Republic of
              Ireland international.</p>
              <p>He added: "Shay has come in and done exceptionally well - I have
              nothing against him. It is not his fault, and if I had been in his
              situation I would have done exactly the same. He has been very good to
              me and I will be the same to him. </p>
              <p>“I have never taken a first-team place for granted ever since I arrived and I am happy to be at the club.</p>
              <p>"I would love to be playing, any player will tell you that, but
              right now I am not, and I have to work hard in training to try and get
              myself back in the side.</p>
              <p>“There is no point in sulking. I have not lost my job, just my place
              in the team. At the moment I am not the first-choice keeper and I want
              to change that as fast as I can.”</p>
