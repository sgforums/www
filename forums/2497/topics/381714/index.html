              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Wayne Rooney expects to open talks over a contract extension at Manchester United at some point over the next few months.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT">Â </span></span></p>
              <p>Barcelona are thought to be interested in adding Rooney to their impressive attacking arsenal and wondered whether they might be able to exploit financial pressures on the Old Trafford outfit to prize England's star man from their grasp.</p>
              <p>Even old team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo has issued a cheeky "come and join us" plea from Real Madrid, while admitting Rooney had the perfect home at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>It is that view the 24-year-old concurs with.</p>
              <p>Holding court in Doha, ahead of England's glamour friendly with Brazil on Saturday, Rooney revealed his hopes for the future. And it all revolves around United.</p>
              <p>"It's nice to be noticed but as I've said before, I'm really happy at United," he said.</p>
              <p>"Unless they tell me otherwise, I can't see myself leaving.</p>
              <p>"I have got two years left on my contract after this year and I'm sure we will be negotiating a new deal in the next few months.</p>
              <p>"I love the place. It's 30 minutes from home and all my family, and I have got a great chance of winning trophies."</p>
              <p>Rooney has won plenty already of course.</p>
              <p>However, by training every day with the likes of Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Gary Neville, he is aware of what he needs to do if he is to assume legendary status at Old Trafford as he desires.</p>
              <p>He has always felt an affinity for the Red Devils, even when his allegiance to Everton was at its strongest.</p>
              <p>Those ties are clearly more obvious now and the greats he wants to emulate shine no brighter than Eric Cantona.</p>
              <p>"Although I was an Everton fan, I loved watching United play," he said.</p>
              <p>"It probably started watching them from about 1994. Cantona was brilliant in that team.</p>
              <p>"He had something about him. You looked at him and he was so fearsome. And that was just on the television.</p>
              <p>"Imagine playing up against him?</p>
              <p>"They won a lot of trophies too. But it was more than just that.</p>
              <p>"It was the way they played and attacked. The way they played right to the end. They scored all those last-minute goals, which showed their desire to want to keep going.</p>
              <p>"Now, I am there and I have won trophies there myself. I just want to win more."</p>
              <p>That desire comes straight from the top.</p>
              <p>After all, Sir Alex Ferguson has won more than anyone. It affords him a reverence no-one else can match.</p>
              <p>"He is special because of the trophies he has won, first of all," added the striker.</p>
              <p>"But it is also the type of football he wants you to play.</p>
              <p>"He wants you playing attacking football all the time. Sometimes you feel you can't do it but he keeps you going.</p>
              <p>"Even at his age, he still wants to win all the time. It's incredible to see."</p>
