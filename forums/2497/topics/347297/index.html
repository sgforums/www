              <p><strong>Klaas-Jan Huntelaar does not want to leave Real Madrid and has a great relationship with coach Juande Ramos, according to his agent who was reacting to reports that the Dutch striker is unhappy at the Bernabéu.</strong><br><br><em>AS</em> stated that the 25-year-old had told friends that he was completely disillusioned with life with the Spanish giants after not being given much of a chance to prove himself.<br><br>But his representative, Arnold Oosterveer, has dismissed the stories and explained that it is not unusual for a player to be disgruntled if he is not playing all the time.<br><br>"The boy never said that he wants to leave Madrid. I have talked to him and he has denied these rumours. He never said that at all," <em>Marca</em> quote the agent as saying.<br><br>"It is normal that he is not happy because players always hope for more time. He will not play in the Champions League, but I think he will play a lot more in the league."<br><br>The recent rumours also stated that Huntelaar did not like Ramos and that the pair do not have much of a relationship during training.<br><br>"I categorically deny that. When a player does not always play, people always want to create a controversy," he added.<br><br>"He is 25 and it is normal that he wants to play. But he wants to do that with Real Madrid and he will continue to try and convince Juande Ramos to give him more playing time."</p>
