              </div>
              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> <strong></strong><strong>Goal.com UK</strong> brings to you the first of several World Interviews to come. A new year
              has brought this new feature to our readers, who were asked to pose
              questions to Manchester United and England star Wayne Rooney.<br><br>We
              received thousands upon thousands of questions, but could pick just ten
              to put to the 24-year-old striker, and here's how it went...<br><br><br>
              </span></p><p><strong>Wayne, who is the toughest defender you have played against?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>(Diemar</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>India)</strong></p>
              <p>That’s a tough one. I’ve played against so many defenders around the
              world it’s difficult to pin-point one player. But if I had to choose
              one defender, it would have to be John Terry.</p>
              <p>He’s a very physical player and always gives everything for England.
              You can concentrate on your game and not worry about the defence
              conceding because he always plays well.</p>
              <p><strong>Which player in the world would you like to see in a </strong><strong>Manchester</strong><strong> United shirt?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>(Hamisi, Kenya)<br></strong></p>
              <p>It’s not for me to say because that’s the manager’s job, to bring the best players to Manchester United.</p>
              <p>But I’ve played with some great players in the past and would have loved to have played with some legends of the game.</p>
              <p>Steven Gerrard is a very good mate of mine and he had trials at
              Manchester United as a kid, it would have been great to have had him at
              United, but that will never happen because he’s a Liverpool man through
              and through. He’s a top-class player.</p>
              <p>I’d have loved to have played with Zinedine Zidane. I’ve played
              against him and I was just in awe. But playing against him gave me a
              lot of confidence because  it gave me the belief to say ‘I can play
              with the best, and I’m just going to chill out and let my football do
              the talking'.</p>
              <p>Theo Walcott is so fast; he can go on for ages. He’s the fastest
              player I’ve seen. He’s so enthusiastic and got a good eye for goal.</p>
              <p><strong>What did you say to Carlos Tevez when he was about to take the penalty in the League Cup match vs </strong><strong>Manchester</strong><strong> </strong><strong>City</strong><strong>?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>(Teyco, Argentina)<br></strong></p>
              <p>Put it this way, I didn’t tell him to score.</p>
              <p><strong>After the 2006 World Cup, did you and Cristiano Ronaldo speak about the </strong><strong>Portugal</strong><strong> match? Did he say sorry – did you forgive him or did you all carry on as if nothing had happened?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>(Rude, Turkey)<br></strong></p>
              <p>I have no qualms about the red card and the fans didn’t blame me
              when we were knocked out. David Beckham had to take a lot of stick
              after the 1998 World Cup.</p>
              <p>We [Rooney and Ronaldo] spoke shortly over the phone some time after
              and when we got back for pre-season training the manager just got us
              together, told us some home truths and told us not to look into and
              listen to all kinds of rubbish that was published about us. We shook
              hands and that was it. He’s a good guy and we’ve always played well
              together.</p>
              <p><strong>Just a simple question; who is a better player in your opinion and why: Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>(Yoga, Indonesia)<br></strong></p>
              <p>I’ve played with Cristiano and he does everything from score great
              goals, great free kicks, crosses, he’s a top notch player and he’s
              doing well at Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>Messi, the ball just sticks to his feet, he’s very clever and the
              main thing is that he’s just passionate about his football and I love
              watching him play.</p>
              <p>They are different players and have different characters so not for
              me to compare really, but put it this way, they would be welcome at
              Carrington.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://u.goal.com/8700/8750.jpg" alt=""><br>Rooney's faith to United lies in loyalty to Sir Alex</p>
              <p><strong>At the 2010 World Cup, do you have any preference on who will be your partner in attack?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>(Marcio, Brazil)<br></strong></p>
              <p>No, that’s for Mr Capello to decide. It’s his job to pick the team
              and whoever he picks, I’ll be happy to play with, be that Emile
              [Heskey] or Jermaine [Defoe], not for me to say, but the manager knows
              what he’s doing and he’ll keep us all guessing, I’m sure.</p>
              <p><strong>If </strong><strong>Manchester</strong><strong> United were
              forced to sell you, which team would you like to join? Could you ever
              see yourself playing for another English team?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>(Aless, Sweden)<br></strong></p>
              <p>I’m a Manchester United player unless the manager tells me
              otherwise. I live near the training ground, life’s good and I just want
              to play for Manchester United because the manager has given me so much
              and I want to repay his faith in me.</p>
              <p>I’ve channeled my feelings and passion into all the right places and
              I’m a man, not the kid everyone saw a few years ago and I owe it to the
              manager.</p>
              <p><strong>How would you feel if your son said that he would like to be a </strong><strong>Liverpool</strong><strong> fan?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>(Manu, Spain)<br></strong></p>
              <p>My family are all Evertonians and I also grew up as an Evertonian.
              We all grew up absolutely hating Liverpool and that will never change.
              So my son will have plenty of positive influences around him [laughs].</p>
              <p><strong>Wayne</strong><strong>, just how good is Dimitar Berbatov?
              Do you think he gets too much stick from fans and pundits for not
              scoring a lot and do you think his arrival at the club has helped you?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>(Muhammad, England)<br></strong></p>
              <p>Strikers always go through a bad patch and they get criticised by
              people who do not see how much effort he is putting in day in and day
              out. </p>
              <p>Berbatov’s a very technically sound player, he can score, create
              opportunities for the guys and gives me a great deal of freedom to get
              forward. He does his fair share and our partnership is very fresh and
              it’ll get better. He’s just focusing on his game.</p>
              <p><strong>Since Ronaldo’s transfer, Sir Alex Ferguson must have told
              you to play in a different way than before. What do you think about the
              difference for you and the team?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>(Sim Hyeon-Jun, Korea Republic)<br></strong></p>
              <p>I wouldn’t say the manager has told me to play in a different way;
              I’ve been playing like this for years. I’ve just matured and been given
              a lot more responsibility, but that doesn’t mean I don’t want to win. I
              still have that passion and hunger.</p>
              <p>Hopefully I can have a good run in the side now and keep scoring goals. We’ve got ourselves into a good position in the league.</p>
              <p>We’ve dealt with defensive setbacks very well. The way we played
              last season has given us a lot of confidence and we will get there. The
              pressure to succeed is still there because every manager and every
              single player wants to make a name for themselves at our expense.</p>

              <p>A few years back i'd have to disagree with you but Gerrard seems to be on an alarming slide this season in terms of his contribution. Or maybe because he's tired of having to bail Liverpool all the time?</p>
