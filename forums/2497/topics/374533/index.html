              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fulham</span></abbr> midfielder Bjorn Helge Riise is determined to establish himself at Craven Cottage.</p>
              <p>"I know that I have the qualities, and will work hard to play myself into the team," Riise told Norwegian newspaper <em>Avisenes Nyhetsbyra</em>.</p>
              <p>"There are many players with a good name and good merits in the
              positions that I am fighting for and they also get away easier with the
              little mistakes that I do. That's just the way it is."</p>
              <p>Riise could not resist a swipe at his teammates, suggesting
              that certain players are making the team by name only, in particular
              new signing Damien Duff.</p>
              <p>"I don't think they've done all that good," he added. "But like
              I said, they have a good reputation and come from bigger clubs than me.</p>
              <p>"I came from little Lillestrom in Norway, but players like
              Damien Duff have a name and status after playing for clubs like
              Newcastle and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> and is ahead of me.</p>
              <p>"I will be happy to show them different the times I will be given the chance.</p>
              <p>"I believe I have better qualities and strengths as a player than he does. He has the speed and the experience, and a good shot.</p>
              <p>"But he is not that much faster than I am, and I have a better
              technique, a better touch and deliver better passes than he does. And I
              can be used in different roles."</p>

              <h2>RIISE DENIES FULHAM CRITICISM</h2>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Bjorn Helge Riise claims he has been misunderstood following reported criticism of his Fulham team-mates.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Norwegian midfielder, who moved to Craven Cottage over the
              summer, was quoted as saying that some players were making the side
              ahead of him because they have bigger reputations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Riise also said he had a 'better technique, better touch and could deliver better passes' than fellow winger Damien Duff.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The interview was held with Norwegian newspaper <em>Avisenes Nyhetsbyra</em> and Riise insists the message he meant to get across was lost in translation when reported back in England.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Clarifying his remarks, Riise told <em>VG Nett</em>: "I just want to say that I have never complained about a player in any of the clubs that I have played in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"If I chose to promote my own advantages and my confidence, it
              is always interpreted as if I am talking negatively about my
              team-mates. That is wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I have spoken to the manager and Damien Duff and everyone at Fulham. They told me it is cool, that this is nothing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"(Roy) Hodgson told me not to lose any sleep because of this."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Riise's older brother, Roma defender John Arne, backed up the story after sitting in on the initial interview.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"He was misinterpreted and misunderstood, and it is written in a
              different manner than it was spoken," said the former Liverpool man.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"That's the way they are. They can take something small and twist it into something big."</p>
