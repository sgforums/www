When Terry won he was laughing and slapping the backs of the other players.<br><br>Â“He was winding them up because they lost money Â— but he paid for the drinks.Â”<br><br>Terry Â— well known for his love of a flutter Â— was out with pals Lampard, Ashley Cole, Wayne Bridge and Shaun Wright-Phillips at the Colony Club, off LondonÂ’s Park Lane.<br></div>

We have seen many before him going broke after making millions or hundreds of millions during their short sporting careers but still ended up in a sad way cos of their indulgence in gambling, alcohol or women...<br><br>Just to name a few, George Best, Paul Merson, Paul Gascoigne, Neil Webb... These are just some of the more famous ones, there are even more that we are not familiar with. Even Mike Tyson who made more than all 4 combine... Around $300 millions or more during his career, ended up bankrupt and having to act for a Wrestling Entertainment match to make ends meet and pay his bankruptcy...<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ac/Wmxivscsa.jpg/180px-Wmxivscsa.jpg"><br><br>So don't think for one minute that it can't happen to any of todays players too cos gambling is probably the worst among it.<br><br>Anyway, footballers are not really rich if you consider other sports like golf, baseball, basketball, boxing... And Terry is not even consider rich in football's rich list... So if he don't know how to make money outside of football... He better be careful... or he could really end up as a postman of something earning $300 pounds a month...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/Beck1.jpg"><br><br></div>

This procedure will decide whether a further operation is needed.<br><br>If not then Terry could return within a couple of weeks, but if further surgery is required then he could be on the sidelines for six weeks or more.<br><br>This would mean Terry would not only miss a vital Premiership games (including a trip to Anfield to face Liverpool) but he could also be out for Chelsea's Champions League second round clash against FC Porto.<br><br>Jose Mourinho's side have missed their captain culminating in Michael Essien's comical own goal that handed Reading a share of the points on Boxing Day.<br><br>If Terry is out for a long period then Mourinho may adjust his transfer plans and buy another centre back in the transfer window, with Khalid Boularouz and Ricardo Carvalho their only other central defenders.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The smart money is on Terry being out of action for around a month.<br><br>Top doc Phil Sheard, who reckons the Blues chose surgery to speed along the defenderÂ’s recovery, revealed: Â“A couple of weeks is the most optimistic.<br><br>Â“Realistically, you are looking at four to six weeks before he will be back.Â”<br><br>The consultant orthopaedic spinal surgeon added: Â“In most cases, these injuries will get better by themselves. Â“But we frequently do operations so we can get people back quickly Â— and I think thatÂ’s what happened here.Â”<br><br>The England skipper, 26, had keyhole surgery to remove a sequestrated lumbar intervertebral disc in a two-hour procedure in Bordeaux. The op, by neurosurgical specialist Dr Jean Destandau, involved JT having a disc removed from his back, shaved and then replaced.<br><br>Conventional surgery would have seen him out for six to eight weeks but the revolutionary technique used means he can begin his recovery by targeting a return in time for the BluesÂ’ crunch Premiership trip to Liverpool on January 20.<br><br>That relatively positive news is unlikely to alter MourinhoÂ’s decision to pursue Manchester City defender Micah Richards. Terry should begin physio treatment at the start of next week but the delicate nature of the problem means he cannot be rushed back.<br><br></div>

That is great for us and great for John.<br><br>"We are not going to do anything with John that is going to cause him problems. I am not in the game of pushing him out there because it is for the benefit of Chelsea - but I also don't want to hold him back unnecessarily.<br><br>English also hit back at initial expert opinion outside the club which estimated Terry's injury would sideline him for up to six weeks.<br><br>Surgeons removed a sequestrated lumbar intervertebral disc, using a revolutionary new technique.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Terry facing FA rap<br><br><img src="http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2006/12/26/JohnTerry1.jpg"><br><br>John Terry will become the first England captain to be found guilty of improper conduct by the Football Association.</strong><br><br>Terry was keen to defend himself when he appeared before an FA disciplinary commission today after being charged in the wake of comments he made about referee Graham Poll after being send off against Tottenham in November. He was urged to admit to the charge in the hope of avoiding a ban. He will now not attend the personal hearing, having instead made a written submission that will be examined by the disciplinary commission today.<br><br>Terry was accused of questioning the integrity of Poll in an interview with Chelsea's own television channel. In a statement that was subsequently issued, the FA said: "Terry claimed in an interview, which was widely reported, that Poll had given him conflicting reasons for his second yellow card, saying: 'On the pitch, Graham Poll said to me that it was for the barge on Hossam Ghaly where I just kept running'.<br><br>"'Then, after the game, he then said to me it was for the fall when me and Ledley King fell so, you know, he's obviously had a look at it, or got people to look at it and decided that's probably the best option for him and it covers every angle for him.'"<br><br>In his written submission Terry has said it was never his intention to question Poll's integrity. But he does concede that his words could have been chosen more wisely and he will now wait to see what the disciplinary commission decides.<br><br>The FA will certainly be relieved that they do not have to arbitrate between the England captain and one of English football's most senior referees when Terry has essentially been accused of lying.<br><br></div>
