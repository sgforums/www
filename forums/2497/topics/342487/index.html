              <h1>Hughes set to finally get his man and seal £18m Santa Cruz switch <br></h1>

              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/12/31/article-0-02E031EC000005DC-699_468x700.jpg" alt="ITED KINGDOM - AUGUST 23: of Blackburn Rovers in action during the Barclays Prem" width="468" height="700"></p>
              <p><em>Roque Santa Cruz is set to become a Manchester City player in the New Year despite interest from Real Madrid</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1103318" rel="1103318_3" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1103318/Hughes-set-finally-man-seal-18m-Santa-Cruz-switch.html"></a></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester City</strong></span><strong> will kick-start the January sales by agreeing a fee of £18million with </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Blackburn</strong></span><strong> for striker Roque Santa Cruz in the next 24 hours.</strong></p>
              <p>Talks are at an advanced stage, with both clubs keen to complete the move quickly. City manager Mark Hughes is anxious to secure a player he signed for Blackburn from Bayern Munich for a bargain fee of £3.8m just 16 months ago, while new Rovers boss Sam Allardyce expects to be handed £10m from the sale and wants as much time as possible to spend it.</p>
              <p>Santa Cruz himself insisted on Tuesday he would only quit Ewood Park for another Barclays Premier League club despite interest from Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>The 27-year-old told Radio Primero de Mayo: 'I would like to stay in England. I like this league. It is one of the most competitive in the world.' He added: 'I have nothing to do with any offers. They are made to the club and the directors make a decision.'</p>
              <p>As revealed by Sportsmail earlier this month, Allardyce has always accepted he would have to sacrifice his prize asset to afford the reinforcements he needs to keep Blackburn up.</p>
              <p>Santa Cruz, 27, has to agree personal terms, but that is not expected to be a problem considering the wealth of City's owners, his close relationship with Hughes and an admission on the eve of Allardyce's first game that he wanted to test himself at a bigger club.</p>
              <p>The Paraguay striker, who scored 23 goals in his first season in England, has yet to play under Allardyce because of a calf injury. Having had two bids turned down, Hughes will now get his man at the third attempt to begin what is expected to be a busy month of transfer business at Eastlands.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/12/31/article-0-01BEF1D400000578-893_468x344.jpg" alt="German Philipp Lahm cele" width="468" height="344"></p>
              <p><em>Hughes may also try and bring German international Philipp Lahm to Eastlands</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He is also hoping to prise Germany's World Cup defender Philipp Lahm from Bayern Munich if Chelsea refuse to allow Wayne Bridge to join. Hughes pencilled the England left back on to his wish list almost as soon as the Abu Dhabi United Group takeover of City in August promised a money-no-object budget to sign New Year reinforcements.</p>
              <p>But Chelsea are in no hurry to do business with City after seeing their deal for Robinho hijacked at the 11th hour in the summer.</p>
              <p>Hughes is ready to pay £8m, but if Chelsea play hardball over Bridge, he will once again turn to his old club Bayern.</p>
              <p>Lahm made the all-star team at the 2006 World Cup and has six years' Bundesliga experience with the club he joined as an 11-year-old. He was a Barcelona target last summer but signed a new deal until 2012, so is likely to cost more than £8m.</p>

Manchester City owner Sheikh Mansour and chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak are giving full backing to manager Hughes despite a poor first half of the season. </h2>
              <p class="article">Blackburn striker Roque Santa Cruz tops Hughes’ wishlist. Sparky said: “We have to make sure the players we want to bring in are good for us in terms of quality and their position in the squad. If we do, I’m very positive for the second half of the season.” </p>
              <p class="article">Hughes is ready with a £15million bid to grab Paraguay hitman Santa Cruz, 27. He also wants to be reunited with Craig Bellamy too and hopes £10m will prise him away from cash-strapped West Ham. </p>
              <p class="article">Boss Hughes is also looking to strengthen the defence. He wants Chelsea left-back Wayne Bridge, Arsenal centre-back Kolo Toure and Everton defender Joleon Lescott. </p>
              <p class="article">He will also test Newcastle’s resolve with a £10m bid for Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Shay Given, 32. </p>
              <p class="article">Hughes wants this month’s deals done as soon as possible. He said: “We hope we can do business quickly because that will help us. “It’s not an exact science. You have to look at what’s out there, what’s attainable and the price clubs are asking for. </p>

              <p><br>I don't think he bought many players during Thaksin's time... I think only SWP and Ben Haim can be consider his purchases... Even Jo probably isn't... Thaksin even wanted Ronaldinho or Fat Ronaldo... He was also unfortunate that the Abu Dhabi took over very late just before the window closed and they only got Robinho which I think isn't his purchase either...</p>
              <p>At present, Not many or no big players really want to come to City until they see it as a serious side. So they need these kind of players first to get them there before those really big names will come.</p>
              <p>Chelsea wasn't very different actually... They got Glen Johnson, Duff, Scott Parker and a then not very big yet Frank Lampard too... Eventaully they move on to bigger things but they also had to pay a priced for it as well... Cos every player they became interested became extra costly during those days... Harry Kewell and Duff were seen as almost equals then... Duff eventually went for $17m as he had a released clause of that amount in his contract... Harry went to Pool for $5m only...</p>

              <p>If i rem correctly, lampard don't belong to the same batch of purchase like what you've mentioned. He joined during claudio ranieri's time, pre-abramovich era.</p>
