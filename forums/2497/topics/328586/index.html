              <h1>Ronaldo Will Join Manchester City - Galliani</h1>
              <h2>Milan vice president Adriano Galliani has confirmed that crocked Brazilian star Ronaldo will join Premier League side Manchester City.</h2>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The chief has been waving his fists all summer as he wheels and deals, wines and dines and continues to bring players in and out of San Siro. Galliani admits that some players are on their way and he is looking to kick Massimo Oddo and Ronaldo out of the door.</strong>   <br><br>“Ronaldo to Manchester City? It’s all true. A very good friend of mine who is a Brazilian football expert confirmed it to me,” Galliani told Sky Sport Italia.   <br><br>“Oddo? I can confirm that there has been interest from Lyon but he may stay. “Paloschi? There is something going on but we have to meet with his agent.”   <br><br>Ronaldo is currently recovering from a serious knee injury which threatened to bring his career at an end. He has been involved in all sorts of controversies including the Transvestite saga and he now seems to cause another hullabaloo by moving to City.   <br><br>The Brazilian never managed to make an impact with the Rossoneri after being hampered by constant injury and fitness problems. </p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">MANCHESTER CITY are trying to land Brazilian World Cup-winner Ronaldo. City executive chairman Garry Cook revealed last week he was looking to sign a superstar. And contact has been made with the former Barcelona and Real Madrid hitman, who is now a free agent after being released by AC Milan in the summer.</h2>
              <p class="article">Ronaldo, 31, is recovering from a severed knee tendon which he suffered last February. He is expected to be out until November and City are trying to find out the extent of the problem before making their next move.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">They also insist the player loses his excess weight and gets fit before any deal is done. It would still be an incredible move by a club who have spent £70million in the last year. That includes a club-record £19m on Brazilian teenager Jo.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">City failed in a bid this summer to land Ronaldinho, who preferred a move to AC Milan. Now they have turned to his team-mate from the same 2002 World Cup-winning team. Ronaldo’s wages would be structured on a pay-per-play basis.</p>
              <p class="article">City boss Mark Hughes has been kept fully informed of the movements for Ronaldo. And Sparky has been assured he would have the final say. Hughes knew before he took the job that City wanted a famous name to boost the commercial side.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Cook said: “We told Mark not to come if he thought we didn’t need a superstar. “Mark’s comment was: ‘We should all challenge ourselves. We should all challenge ourselves to do things differently as that’s what makes a difference.’ “He wants to challenge himself to manage the best in the world.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“He is a big character and is very good at taking young talent and bringing them on. He has never managed the big star.” City would be able to sign Ronaldo after the transfer deadline as he is a free agent.</p>
