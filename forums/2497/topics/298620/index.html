I don't think so.<br><br>'Would someone like Jamie Carragher have gone down like that? I think it's safe to say he wouldn't.<br><br>'Foreign players have brought a lot to our game, but what Obi did is something you don't want to see. I didn't catch him, but he went down like he had been shot.'<br><br>The England man's frustration boiled over as he jumped into a twofooted challenge which saw referee Martin Atkinson send him off.<br><br>Crouch, however, has pointed the finger of blame at Obi.<br><br>Crouch insisted his England team-mates would not have behaved as the 20-year-old Nigerian did, believing the Stamfrod Bridge man overreacted.<br><br>Crouch added: 'We were still in the game and could have nicked it. But after the sending-off it was always going to be difficult.<br><br>'Obi came in with his studs up and that was in the back of my mind. Then I thought there was another foul.<br><br>'There are no excuses for the tackle I made, but if the referee had pulled the foul up when he should have, it wouldn't have happened.<br><br>'A lot was going their way and I think frustration got the better of me.'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Mikel hits back at Crouch 'racism'</strong><br><br>Chelsea midfielder John Obi Mikel's agents have claimed Peter Crouch's suggestion that foreigners are prone to diving is "potentially racist".<br><br>The Sport Entertainment and Media (SEM) Group have responded following comments made by the Liverpool and England striker following his sending-off at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.<br><br>"SEM feel the comments were potentially racist to all foreign players, not just black or African ones," they told The Sun.<br><br>"We are intending to speak to Trevor Phillips at the Equality and Human Rights Commission on Monday.<br><br>"We hope football's governing bodies, who are meant to be committed to stamping out racism issues, will also get involved."<br><br>Mikel has also denied he is a play actor.<br><br>"There is nothing to say to Crouch. All I know is that I am not a diver and will not start doing that now," he said.<br><br>"Foreign players bring a lot to the league. That's why there are so many here at the moment.<br><br>"There is Didier Drogba, Michael Essien, Cristiano Ronaldo and Dimitar Berbatov, amongst other top players. They make the league very competitive and we cannot all be bad just because one player feels so."</div>
