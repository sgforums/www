            <div class='col-md body'>Jermain Defoe's controversial penalty fired Spurs to a narrow win to lift the hosts out of the bottom four and send Portsmouth to a second straight loss.<br>Referee Chris Foy was the villain of the piece, penalising Pedro Mendes, despite Didier Zokora's blatant dive.<br><br>It proved to be the winner, adding to Danny Murphy's 39th-second tap-in.<br><br>It was harsh reward for Pompey, who deserved more from a resilient display in a match that got off to a flying start.<br><br><strong>Final Score -  Tottenham 2-1 Portsmouth<br><br>Tottenham manager Martin Jol</strong><br>"Seeing Mendes' challenge on Didier now and I must be honest, there was no contact.<br>"I think Didier was anticipating Mendes' tackle and maybe lost his balance. But I don't think he did it on purpose. We don't want that sort of thing but I think this was something different.<br><br>"As for the game, I felt we deserved to win. They scored a soft goal from our point of view and then Paul made a great save at the end, but on the balance of chances we deserved it."<br><br><strong>Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp</strong><br>"We started sloppily and conceded an early goal but then came the second and, everyone who has seen it will agree, it was farcical.<br>"I've looked round in the dug-out and within 10 seconds I've seen the replay and you can see Pedro was nowhere near him. So if I've seen it, why can't the fourth official?<br><br>"Now's the time to do something. These are important games and it is not enough to say that these things even themselves out over a season. We need a solution and the technology is there - so why not use it."<br><br></div>
