              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">STEWART DOWNING has warned Manchester United: It's only a matter of time before we hand out a hiding.</h2>
              <p>Kenny Dalglish's new-look Liverpool have still to hit top gear after a host of arrivals.</p>
              <p>Yet Downing, a £20million buy from Aston Villa, reckons the Reds have already shown they can be the great entertainers.</p>
              <p>He is convinced they are on course to make someone pay over the coming weeks. And with United next up at Anfield, he would love it to be the 19-time champions.</p>
              <p>Downing, 27, said: "We've been creating chances and I think there will be a day soon when we put all of them away and we'll have a big win over somebody.</p>
              <p>"We need to be more clinical and kill teams off — the game against Wolves was a good example. We made it a harder day than it needed to be because we should have scored a few more times.</p>
              <p>"But it's good to see the fans are enjoying the way we're trying to play.</p>
              <p>"Fans want to be entertained, see goals and forward players attacking. It's nice when you can do that.</p>
              <p>"Some managers obviously don't want a game to be too open. But from a fans' point of view, players are there to entertain and do well. I think, particularly at home so far, we've done that. Our football has been good and long may it continue."</p>
              <p>Downing, an ever-present in the league this term, has still to open his Liverpool account. And he is dreaming of breaking his duck when Alex Ferguson and Co come to town.</p>
              <p>He added: "It's always nice to score, and I cannot wait to get one at the Kop end. Maybe that will happen against Man United — that would be perfect."</p>

              </span></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Manchester United star Patrice Evra has accused Liverpool striker Luis Suarez of racially abusing him during the 1-1 draw at Anfield.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Evra claimed Suarez had used the same racial insult ‘more than 10 times’ and the Liverpool player faces a Football Association investigation after referee Andre Marriner included Evra’s allegations about Suarez’s language in his match report.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Sources in France said the word Suarez is alleged to have used is ‘n*****’.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Marriner was seen talking to the players after a clash at a second-half corner and Evra was later booked for dissent.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Liverpool said Suarez categorically denied the claims, but France full-back Evra, who was born in the Senegal capital of Dakar, told French TV channel Canal Plus: ‘I was very upset. In 2011 you can’t say things like this. He knows what he said, the ref knows it, it will come out.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">‘I won’t repeat what he said, but it was a racist word, and he said it more than ten times. He tried to wind me up. I won’t make a huge deal out of it, but it’s very upsetting and disappointing.’</span></p>

              </span></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">Suarez is no stranger to controversy. The Uruguay striker earned notoriety at last year’s World Cup by handling a goalbound effort by Ghana in the final moments of the quarter-final, then celebrating when the resulting penalty was missed and Uruguay went through on a penalty shoot-out. </span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">In November, he was suspended for seven games by the Dutch authorities for biting PSV Eindhoven’s Moroccan midfielder Otman Bakkal on the shoulder while playing for previous club Ajax.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">There have also been accusations of Suarez diving but a conviction for racism would be far more serious and would overshadow the impressive start he has made in English football. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">A Liverpool spokesman said: ‘The first we knew about these allegations was 20 minutes after the final whistle when the manager was asked to go into the referee’s office and told about them. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">‘The first thing we did, as you would expect, is ask the player and he has categorically denied using any language of that nature.’ </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">An FA spokesman said: ‘The FA has been made aware this evening of an incident that is alleged to have occurred during the Liverpool versus Manchester United fixture at Anfield. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: black;">'Referee Andre Marriner was made aware of the allegation at the end of the fixture and has subsequently reported this to the FA. The FA will now be making enquiries into the matter.’</span></p>

              <p>Players The pair were certainly in each others faces during the game. In the 59th minute Suarez kicked Evra on the knee near the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/"><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span></a> goal-line and, while it was clearly a foul, the home support booed Evra for his perceived over-reaction.</p>

              <p>Evra and Suarez then had to be spoken to by Marriner after tussling ahead of a Liverpool corner, with Evra obviously unhappy.</p>
              <p>The referee ended up booking Evra for dissent in the 65th minute. Liverpool’s staff were not aware of any allegation until Marriner met with Dalglish after the game.</p>
              <p>There was no mention made of the allegation by either manager in their press briefings after the game but Evra gave an interview to French television station Canal Plus, which was broadcast last night, in which he accused Suarez.</p>
              <p>The game was otherwise devoid of the edge that recent encounters between these two sides has had: this fixture has thrown up five red cars in the last seven meetings between these two sides.</p>
              <p>Steven Gerrard, in his first start following six months out with a groin injury, scored with a free-kick after 68 minutes before substitute Javier Hernández headed in with 10 minutes to go.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson had rested several key players for the game, including Rooney.</p>
