              <h1>Clattenburg is handed Stamford Bridge showdown</h1>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/084dirk_468x623.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>Flying Kuyt: Liverpool striker Dirk Kuyt launches himself at Phil Neville in the fiery Merseyside derby in October that brought fierce criticism for referee Clattenburg</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mark Clattenburg, the referee who was put in charge of lower-profile games after his controversial handling of October's Merseyside derby, will officiate at Sunday's powderkeg Barclays Premier League game between Chelsea and Arsenal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The appointment marks a return to the fold for the 33-year-old, who also got a private rebuke from referees' chief Keith Hackett for his performance in Blackburn's 5-3 defeat at Wigan in December.</p>
              <p>It will raise eyebrows because Howard Webb, widely regarded as the best official, will be at neither of the 'Grand Slam Sunday' games.</p>
              <p>Manchester United's equally explosive clash with Liverpool has been given to Steve Bennett, while Webb will be at the comparatively low-profile match between Aston Villa and Sunderland on Saturday.</p>
              <p>Insiders say that Hackett has decided to change the policy of automatically selecting his top official for the biggest games because he is wary of repeating the situation where Graham Poll always got first pick. Clattenburg, the youngest English referee to be appointed to the</p>
              <p>FIFA list, will be in the spotlight for a fixture that has become increasingly bitter in recent seasons.</p>
              <p>In December, John Terry missed 14 games with an ankle injury after a high tackle by Emmanuel Eboue, a few minutes after Terry himself had caught Cesc Fabregas with a late foul during Arsenal's 1-0 win.</p>
              <p>Players from both sides brawled during last year's Carling Cup Final, in which Kolo Toure and Emmanuel Adebayor of Arsenal and Chelsea's John Mikel Obi were sent off.</p>
              <p>But Sunday's game is seen by Hackett as a chance for the Gosforthbased official to put his problems earlier this season behind him and prove he is back to his best form.</p>
              <p>Clattenburg infuriated David Moyes with his handling of Liverpool's 2-1 win at Goodison and Moyes got an FA charge for suggesting the official had been influenced by staying with Rafa Benitez's side during a pre-season tour.</p>
              <p>He caused a storm with a series of blunders at Wigan and Hackett made it clear that he would have been dropped from the list had he not already booked a Christmas break.</p>
              <p>But Hackett, himself the subject of withering criticism from Sir Alex Ferguson two weeks ago over the way he chooses officials, feels that Clattenburg is back on top of his game and has earned a high-profile match under the policy of picking on form.</p>
              <p>He has stuck by him through further controversy when he sent Ferguson to the stands at Bolton, a decision which landed the Manchester United boss with a touchline ban.</p>
              <p>The referees' chief also wants a no-nonsense approach to the high-profile games rather than what he sees as the lower-profile style of Alan Wiley and Mark Halse, and that explains his choice of Clattenburg and Bennett, who is one of the division's strictest disciplinarians.</p>
              <p>Kent official Bennett also has previous with Ferguson, who accused him of failing to protect Cristiano Ronaldo after the Portuguese winger was sent off two years ago in a Manchester derby defeat. Bennett also sent off Ronaldo at Portsmouth in August.</p>
              <p>While Bennett is criticised as a stickler for the rules, his consistency makes him a regular choice for big games. He feels players set the agenda and once said: "The laws are clear, I have to apply them. Sometimes the players put you in a position where you have to react."</p>

              <p><em>Essien v Adebayor</em></p>
              <p><em>Mikel v Eboue</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p>Or a serious injury to one of the players... The last 2 times Terry played against Arsenal, he was seriously injured and had to be out for a few months... If any of the gunners player get a red card, he will miss their matches against <em>Bolton (A), Liverpool (A) and Man Utd (A).</em></p>
              <p>For Chelsea, its <em>Middlesbrough (H), Man City (A) and Wigan (H)...</em></p>

              <h1>Chelsea striker Anelka in fitness race to play against Arsenal</h1>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/02_03/Anelka2502_468x569.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>Chelsea's Nicolas Anelka has ruled himself out of facing Tottenham in a bid to be fit for Sunday's clash with old club Arsenal. The striker has been suffering from a thigh injury for more than a week, although the club had wanted the problem to remain secret.</strong></p>
              <p>Anelka has not been named on any lists of injured players.</p>
              <p>But Anelka, 29, wants to rest the injury so he has a chance of featuring against Arsenal and won't return to full training until Thursday.</p>
              <p>He said: “I felt a pain behind my thigh before the match with Derby last Wednesday. The injury is not serious but I preferred to rest it for the Sunderland game and it's also better that I don't play against Tottenham.”</p>
              <p>The injury — which could also jeopardise Anelka's place in the France squad for next week's friendly with England — is another blow for the former Bolton striker as he attempts to establish himself at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>He has scored just twice since his £15m move in January, although Grant insists he will keep faith with him.</p>
              <p>He added: “I'm not worried as long as the team are scoring goals. If he plays well and Resting: Nicolas Anelka the team scores four or six goals, it's good.”</p>

              <h1>Liverpool triple-header will be 'good fun' - Clichy</h1>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/01_05/Clichy3101_468x525.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>Arsenal full-back Gael Clichy claims it will be 'quite good fun' to take on Liverpool three times in the space of a week next month as the pair go head to head in the Premier League and Europe.</strong></p>
              <p>The duo were already scheduled to meet at Emirates Stadium on Saturday April 5, in what could prove to be a key clash in the race for the title. Now by a quirk of the fixture list they will get the chance to know each other even better over two legs of their Champions League quarter-final tie.</p>
              <p>Arsenal host the first encounter in a fortnight's time, with the return at Anfield on Tuesday April 8. It is, though, not the first time the sides will have clashed more than twice in a campaign.</p>
              <p>During January 2007, the Gunners recorded an FA Cup and Carling Cup double in Liverpool as they won both ties in the space of just four days, running out aggregate winners by 9-4. Earlier in the current campaign Arsene Wenger's men earned a 1-1 draw at Anfield with a late goal from Cesc Fabregas.</p>
              <p>Clichy, 22, feels the team will take lining up against such familiar opposition in their stride. 'I don't think that affects the players at all,' the French defender insisted. 'We did it last season when we played the FA Cup and Carling Cup together. In fact it's quite good fun because it doesn't happen much. 'We will look forward to it and hopefully we will come out as the winner.'</p>
              <p>Despite taking on well-known opponents, Clichy is not expecting anything other than a severe test of Arsenal's credentials. 'An Italian team or Spanish team would have been fantastic, but Liverpool is not bad, they are a great side and it will be a great challenge,' he told Arsenal TV.</p>
              <p>'At this stage of the competition it doesn't matter who you play against because all the teams have great quality. 'We know Liverpool, they know us, it will be like a Premier League game and we'll see what happens.'</p>
              <p>Arsenal moved into the last eight after a superb 2-0 win over holders AC Milan at the San Siro earlier this month. Reports have emerged suggesting that during the Gunners' stay in Italy, winger Alexander Hleb and his agent Claudio Vigorelli were involved in clandestine talks with Inter.</p>
              <p>However, these claims have been rejected by colleagues of Vigorelli, who maintain the pair simply 'went for an ice-cream'. While Gunners boss Wenger may have been left less than impressed by the rumours, it is understood no official complaint has been lodged. Initially that would be with the Football Association, who would then pass the matter on to the world's governing body FIFA, which has jurisdiction and strict regulations over player transfers.</p>
              <p>Arsenal, meanwhile, could well find themselves with representation back in the senior England squad ahead of next week's friendly in France. Forward Theo Walcott, who turned 19 on Sunday, was yesterday conspicuous by his absence from the under-21s and is expected to be brought into Fabio Capello's party for the first time.</p>
              <p>The former Southampton trainee was a controversial inclusion in Sven-Goran Eriksson's ill-fated World Cup squad but did not make an appearance in Germany and was then overlooked by Steve McClaren. Another young Englishman looking to make his mark with the Gunners is teenager Luke Freeman. The 16-year-old recently swapped Gillingham for Arsenal's London Colney training ground and is more than happy with his progress so far - having already been likened to England striker Michael Owen.</p>
              <p>'Obviously I am still growing, and find that I am able to turn quicker than defenders, and I feel I am stronger than a lot of my opponents,' Freeman said. 'The boys in the academy have started calling me 'Owen' - obviously I'm pleased with the comparison, but I am my own player.' Freeman added: 'I am looking forward to rising to any challenges ahead. I already feel I am a better player since my arrival. 'I am happy to be at a club like Arsenal where I have the opportunity to be the best player I can be.'</p>

              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Blues brothers: Didier Drogba (right) with former Chelsea team-mate William Gallas</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Didier Drogba has cranked up the pressure ahead of Chelsea's Grand Slam Sunday clash with Arsenal by asking the Stamford Bridge crowd to unsettle William Gallas.</strong></p>
              <p>The Ivory Coast striker, who is looking forward to facing former Chelsea team-mate Gallas and compatriot Kolo Toure, said: "William knows he is coming to the cauldron of Stamford Bridge, like with Ashley Cole [at Arsenal], he will be booed. But they are top players and I will need help from the crowd to unsettle William.</p>
              <p>"Hopefully I will score on Sunday," he continued. "I will be against my mates but they also know it will not be easy for them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Arsenal travel across the capital to Chelsea on the same day as Liverpool take on Manchester United at Old Trafford in what promises to be the a pivotal weekend in the Barclays Premier League title race.</p>
              <p>"It is going to be some weekend," the Chelsea striker told skysports.com. "The games are too close to call but our experience will be needed on Sunday."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Drogba, who was allegedly angry with Avram Grant's substitutions during the 4-4 draw at Tottenham on Wednesday, added "Arsenal are a wonderful team with the ball, but we are very powerful.</p>
              <p>"At this time of ths season you won't see any big scores between the teams because all the games are now pressure games.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Hopefully we will come out stronger from the big encounters."</p>

              <h2>TERRY: SUNDAY IS A MUST WIN</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/terrypullpants.jpg" alt=""><br><br></div>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Chelsea captain John Terry has admitted that his side must win Sunday's game against Arsenal if they are to have any hope of winning the title.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chelsea lie five points behind leaders Manchester United after throwing away three points against Spurs on Wednesday, making the clash at Stamford Bridge even more crucial for Terry's side.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Sunday's a must-win game now. No question," Terry told The Daily Mirror.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The disappointment at Spurs was that we threw a lead away and put the pressure on ourselves to have to win on Sunday against a very good side.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"If we had beaten Spurs, maybe we could have afforded to draw against Arsenal but not now. We are at home and there's added pressure on us to win."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chelsea had been sneaking up on United and Arsenal with some solid performances in recent weeks, but wobbles in 'big' games have called many to question Avram Grant's tactical acumen and leadership.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Indeed, Chelsea have failed to beat any of the top seven in the Premier League this season, but Terry thinks that their opponents on Sunday are under as much pressure as they are:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"At the start of the season, when Jose Mourinho went and the new manager came in and we had injuries, everybody wrote us off straight away.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"That's suited us. It took the pressure right off us. As we come into the later stages, Arsenal haven't won in four games and maybe the pressure's getting to them."</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>ALEX FERGUSON was amazed at Javier Mascherano’s incredible show of contempt for referee Steve Bennett in a week when everyone in football was condemning the curse of dissent.</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The hotheaded Argentinian was shown a second yellow card and dismissed just before half-time after abusing Bennett and his assistants no less than SIX times in a non-stop tirade at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">He then refused to leave the pitch and had to be restrained as he tried to confront Bennett.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Bennett was the fourth official in the Tottenham-Chelsea game four days earlier, when Ashley Cole was blasted for turning his back on Mike Riley when the referee showed him a yellow card for a vicious tackle.</p>
              <p class="article">Ferguson, who boasted this week about how he “went off his head” with players who surrounded referees, said Mascherano could have no complaints.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">He explained: “I don’t know why he got involved. He came across from central midfield to argue with the referee.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“With what happened during the week with the Ashley Cole thing, there’s been a focus on dissent. He’d already been booked and he kept badgering the referee. Dissent is dissent — and I think that was dissent.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez amazingly tried to defend his player. The Spaniard said: “He knows he made a mistake but in this kind of game it is wrong to leave a team with just 10 players because one of them asked why.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“I talked to him in Spanish from the touchline and I kept telling him to stop, saying ‘It’s finished’. He doesn’t know the referees so well and I wanted him to stop.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“Mascherano is a fantastic professional and has been playing at the maximum level for years. When you play a big game like this you are surprised by something like this. And you want to know why you are sent off.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“We are talking about players who are passionate and who want to win. Mascherano was trying to work really hard, like everyone else, and we are disappointed with what happened.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“All of my people are disappointed and no one is more disappointed than me. We had our chances but with 10 players, it’s just ‘forget it’. Before the sending off we had chances and maybe we could have scored. But then we were losing 1-0 after a mistake and after the sending off everything was over.”</p>
