              <p>SINGAPORE: With SingTel and StarHub in a
              deadlock with Fifa over television rights to the 2010 World Cup, a new
              player has emerged with the ability to give Singaporeans full access to
              the biggest football extravaganza of the year.</p>
              <p>British company
              Perform Group, a sports and entertainment specialist for digital media,
              has been closely monitoring the drama that has kept the telephone
              companies in an impasse with football’s world governing body over a
              reported $40 million fee.</p>
              <p>No progress has been made yet despite the Football Association of Singapore’s approaches to Fifa.</p>
              <p>Perform
              is now interested in making available all the World Cup matches from
              South Africa to Singapore viewers after Fifa’s sales representatives,
              Football Media Services, approached the company.</p>
              <p>Mr Jason
              Swanson, Perform’s advertising and sponsorship sales manager in
              Singapore, told MediaCorp, they have the capability and technology in
              place, and can put it online — even at the eleventh hour.</p>
              <p>The
              matches, he said, will be shown live on the Internet — which Fifa would
              not otherwise make available to a country that does not pay the rights
              for it.</p>
              <p>Various packages, said Mr Swanson, would be made available to Singapore viewers.</p>
              <p>"It
              could be a pay—per—view option or a package for all the games," he
              said. "What we will do is to set up a site where people could go in and
              make their choices, whether they want to watch only the England games
              or all the matches. There are lots of ways we can do it."</p>
              <p>He added that Perform streams about 15,000 matches online every year and is currently delivering the Australian Open.</p>
              <p>Last
              October, the company made history by broadcasting an England match for
              the first time exclusively on the Internet for 5 ($11) for those who
              booked early, and 12 for late subscribers.</p>
              <p>The pre—World Cup
              qualifier with Ukraine was watched by 500,000 British viewers, which
              the company claimed was the largest audience for a pay—per—view sports
              event online.</p>
              <p>Mr Swanson said the World Cup could be made
              cheaper for Singapore, relative to the England—Ukraine match, as
              Perform intends to rope in sponsors and advertisers.</p>
              <p>He said
              the potential pool of 2 million viewers here can also expect high
              quality images of June’s World Cup that can be projected on television
              and big screens without Internet interruptions.</p>
              <p>"When we
              delivered the England game, there were no issues and there should be
              none in Singapore because we have the servers and the broadband here is
              also very good," he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Swanson said providing the World Cup service is something Perform is keen to do.</p>
              <p>"When
              I talk to people on the streets, they are pretty upset they may not get
              to see the World Cup. They want to watch here and not go across the
              Causeway," he said.</p>
              <p>"If none of the big players step up for
              the TV rights, we’ll see what Fifa wants because it would be worth
              doing it in Singapore.</p>
              <p>"They know our capabilities and are familiar with how we deliver sports events online." — TODAY</p>
