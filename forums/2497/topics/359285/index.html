              <p class="heading"><em>Ballack, 32, the Germany captain</em></p>
              <p class="heading"> </p>
              <p><strong>Michael Ballack, a protagonist in the ugly scenes that marred Chelsea’s Champions League exit, has been rewarded with an extended contract while the club await Uefa sanctions over the affair, The Times can reveal.</strong></p>
              <p>In a further show of support for their under-fire players, the West London club made it clear yesterday that they did not plan to punish Didier Drogba for his verbal assault on Tom Henning Ovrebo, the Norwegian referee, after their controversial elimination by Barcelona on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Ballack, 32, the Germany captain, who is likely to be among the players cited by Uefa next week for haranguing Ovrebo, has agreed terms on a one-year extension to a deal that includes wages of £121,000 a week and will keep him at Stamford Bridge until the end of next season.</p>
              <p>The initial three-year contract signed when he joined on a free transfer from Bayern Munich in 2006 expires this summer and both parties have agreed to trigger an extension clause, which will be announced imminently. Ballack had hoped to secure an additional two-year contract, but was told that no player will be offered more than a one-year extension until a new manager is appointed.</p>
              <p>Ballack’s new contract ensures that he retains his position as one of the highest-paid players at the club, just behind John Terry and Frank Lampard but ahead of Drogba, which is known to be a source of discontent to the Ivory Coast striker. Drogba, 31, is seeking a four-year deal but the club are unwilling to meet his demands and a lengthy stand-off is likely. However, Guus Hiddink, the interim manager, insisted that Drogba’s behaviour would not affect his long-term future.</p>
              <p>“I don’t think it’s an influence,” Hiddink said. “It’s up to me and the board, but I don’t think he will []. I think apologising openly is a big step forward. We have to go on.”</p>
              <p>Chelsea are also facing a dilemma because Andriy Shevchenko is due to return in the summer after starting only two Serie A matches this season on loan to AC Milan. Chelsea have had no offers for the 32-year-old and have the option of sticking him in the reserves or paying up the remaining £7 million on his contract.</p>
