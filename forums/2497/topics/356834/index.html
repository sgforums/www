              <p><strong>Mathieu Flamini has admitted that Emmanuel Adebayor would be a top signing for Milan.</strong></p>
              <p>French midfielder Flamini, who turned his back on a new long-term
              contract with Arsenal last season to join the Rossoneri, has made a
              declaration that his old fans will not be happy to hear.</p>
              <p>The 24-year-old has hailed Togolese star Adebayor as one of the best
              strikers in the world, and stated that he would be a great recruit for
              the San Siro outfit.</p>
              <p>The forward was strongly linked to Serie A giants Milan last summer,
              but he finally stayed at Emirates Stadium and recently committed
              himself to Arsene Wenger’s club during an interview.</p>
              <p>Wenger has frozen contract talks until the end of the season, and
              the Alsatian has previously declared that making sure his stars stay
              put remains his priority.</p>
              <p>“He [Adebayor] is a great player and if he was to move to Milan he would boost us,” Flamini told Datasport.</p>
              <p>“He was already very strong when he arrived at Arsenal, but he has
              improved a lot up there, and became one of the best strikers in the
              world.”</p>
              <p>A number of Arsenal players have been linked to other clubs this
              season - Cesc Fabregas to Real Madrid and Barcelona, Robin van Persie
              to the Catalonian side, Gael Clichy to Milan, Abou Diaby and Emmanuel
              Eboue to Inter, William Gallas to Juventus and Kolo Toure to Manchester
              City.</p>

              <p><strong>Arsenal defender Philippe Senderos has hinted that he could extend his stay in Milan.</strong></p>
              <p>The Switzerland international is on loan to Milan until the end of the season and he is determined to impress Carlo Ancelotti.</p>
              <p>Twenty-four-year-old Senderos was allowed to move to Italy at the
              end of last term, with his team-mate Mathieu Flamini also securing a
              move to Lombardia.</p>
              <p>The giant centre back has only made 12 Serie A appearances this
              term, nevertheless he is committed to proving his worth at the San Siro.</p>
              <p>Senderos, who spent five seasons with The Gunners, has hinted that
              he could convince Ancelotti to keep him at the club once the season is
              over.</p>
              <p>“Personally I hope to continue like this until the end of the
              season, I've been unlucky with injuries, but I hope to give my
              contribution to the team in this final part of the season and show the
              coach my desire to continue doing well with this shirt,” Senderos was
              quoted as saying on Milan’s official website.</p>
