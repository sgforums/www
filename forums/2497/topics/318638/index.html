              <h1>I'VE LET YOU ALL DOWN</h1>

              <p><strong>CRUSHED John Terry broke his silence on his penalty miss and confessed: "It will haunt me forever."</strong></p>
              <p>The tearful Chelsea skipper (right) made a public apology to fans and said: "I feel I have let everyone down and that hurts me more than anything. I have relived that moment every minute since it happened. "I have only slept a few hours and wake up every time hoping it's all been a bad dream. "I have watched it again on TV and you can see I slipped. It's unbelievable. "It will stay with me for the rest of my life. But I am a big man and I take responsibility for us not winning."</p>
              <div class="entry-more">
              <p>With the scores locked at 1-1 after a pulsating extra-time battle against Manchester United in Moscow, Wednesday's first all-English Champions League final ended in one of the most dramatic penalty shootouts in history. As Terry stepped up to take his kick he knew if he scored the Blues would win the shootout 5-4.</p>
              <p>But the England defender slipped, his shot hit the outside of Edwin van der Sar's post to force the shootout into sudden death. United keeper Van der Sar then saved Nicolas Anelka's spot-kick to seal United's third European Cup triumph.</p>
              <p>Speaking as he joined up with victorious Red Devils Wayne Rooney Rio Ferdinand, Owen Hargreaves and Wes Brown at England's London Colney training ground, Terry added: "As I walked forward to take my spot-kick I knew the Champions League was there to be won.</p>
              <p>"It was all down to me. But what happened next was a nightmare. "I slipped and that night in Moscow will haunt me forever." Terry broke down in tears and was inconsolable on the pitch. And 72 hours after the worst night of his professional career he was still struggling to come to terms with what happened.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://blogs.notw.co.uk/photos/uncategorized/2008/05/24/120johnterry.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="180"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>The 27-year-old centre-half then made a rousing promise to the Chelsea faithful. He insisted: "I am and ALWAYS will be Chelsea through and through. "I will give my all on and off the pitch to win the Champions League as a player and one day as a manager. And I am sure we will win it. The road to next year's final in Rome starts here, we have to try and turn this experience to our advantage."</h3>
              <p>And Terry was quick to make a full and frank apology to his Stamford Bridge colleagues and all Chelsea fans. In an open letter, the skipper added: "To all the Chelsea fans, all my team-mates, the manager and staff. "I am so sorry for missing the penalty and denying you the fans, my team-mates, family and friends, the chance to become European champions.</p>
              <p>"Many people have told me I don't need to say that but I feel I need to, that's just me. "I have had some amazing support from fans, current and ex-players, family and friends and I need to thank everyone for that. "I am very proud of how far we have come this season with everything that has gone on. "Thank you for all your support this season."</p>

              <p>as an arsenal fan, i admire his loyalty and attitude on the pitch, im thinking this is a tough break for him.</p>
              <p>if he learns from this and  cuts out nonsense like peeing on the floor, i'll say he deserves it from fate to be the hero in an important match, hopefully against manure.</p>
              <p>got some posts in the immdiate aftermath, probably its karma, he has a wife already still organising orgies and etc.. he mature jiu hao</p>

              <p>Actually, he's not very arrogant. A lot of players out there are truly arrogant, but in my opinion not Terry. Fine line between pride and arrogance.</p>
