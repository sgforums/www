              <p>Let's discuss about the upcoming 2nd Galacticos Era. As we all know, Real has so far bought Kaka, Ronaldo, Raul Albiol and Benzema. But many questions will arise throughout Real's organisation. Here are some that I can think of:</p>
              <p>- Where the hell does Real get their money from? So far, they've spent 178m euros. Are they going to be in debt later on? Are they still going to buy more players?!?!</p>
              <p>- What formation will they play? They have Kaka, Ronaldo, Benzema on the team. A 4-5-1 formation with 2 holding midfielders behind Kaka?</p>
              <p>- Club Captain Raul. Benched? Playing? Sold? He still has plenty of power &amp; authority in the dressing room. And the rest of the old guard. How will they fit into the new formation?</p>
              <p>- Which players will be sold? The Dutch contingent? Who would insist on staying and being a part of the new Galacticos?</p>
              <p>- Manuel Pellegrini; can he orchestrate the new team's success? Or will he eventually be humbled by the number of superstar players due to their earning power and forced to pick them because of their reputation over the other "average" players even though these players are on form?</p>
              <p>- Lack of defensive talent; same problem as when Makelele was sold. So far, only Raul Albiol has joined the team.</p>
              <p>- Lastly, the biggest question of all: Can they overcome Barcelona's own homegrown talent next season?</p>

              <p>Let's discuss about the upcoming 2nd Galacticos Era. As we all
              know, Real has so far bought Kaka, Ronaldo, Raul Albiol and
              Benzema. But many questions will arise throughout Real's
              organisation. Here are some that I can think of:</p>
              <p>- Where the hell does Real get their money from? So far, they've
              spent 178m euros. Are they going to be in debt later on? Are they
              still going to buy more players?!?!</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>They get loans from banks. No bank wants to be known as the one that caused RM's downfall.</strong></span></p>
              <p>- What formation will they play? They have Kaka, Ronaldo,
              Benzema on the team. A 4-5-1 formation with 2 holding midfielders
              behind Kaka?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>I've no clue what formation their gonna play. </strong></span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> But if i'm not wrong, Pellegrini prefers a 4-4-2 diamond formation. </strong></span></p>
              <p>- Club Captain Raul. Benched? Playing? Sold? He still has plenty
              of power &amp; authority in the dressing room. And
              the rest of the old guard. How will they fit into the new
              formation?</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">He's untouchable.</span></strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>- Which players will be sold? The Dutch contingent? Who
              would insist on staying and being a part of the new
              Galacticos?</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Reported that Sneijder wants to stay. Which is quite puzzling. Maybe he's hoping Pellegrini will play him more often unlike Ramos.</span></strong></p>
              <p>- Manuel Pellegrini; can he orchestrate the new team's
              success? Or will he eventually be humbled by the number of
              superstar players due to their earning power and forced to pick
              them because of their reputation over the other "average"
              players even though these players are on form?</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">I bet </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">he isn't even the one making these signings . </span></strong><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Got a feeling he'll turn out like Schuster. </span></strong></p>
              <p>- Lack of defensive talent; same problem as when Makelele was
              sold. So far, only Raul Albiol has joined the team.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>They did get Diarra in Jan though.</strong></span></p>
              <p>- Lastly, the biggest question of all: Can they overcome
              Barcelona's own homegrown talent next season?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>No.</strong></span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
