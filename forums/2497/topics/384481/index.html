              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp
              has made sure there won't be any dressing room bust-ups over the club
              Christmas party by banning his players from organising a festive
              knees-up. And Redknapp believes that such social occasions are a recipe
              for disaster.<br><br>"Don't have one – that's the only advice I have. I
              don't see the point because they're nothing but aggravation for
              everybody," he told reporters at his Friday press conference.
              </span></p><p>"Everyone's waiting for you to trip up, go out and get drunk or act silly. You don't need that.</p>
              <p>"It's a long season and at the end of that, if we are successful and
              achieve something at Tottenham, they can go and have a party. They can
              go and enjoy their break in the summer.</p>
              <p>"This is a busy period, a working period. Why should we have
              Christmas parties? Every year there's aggro at every football club that
              has one."</p>
              Redknapp is not even expecting club captain Robbie Keane to ask about a party.<br><br>"I
              don't think they'd take the liberty to have one without asking first.
              If they tell me they're having a Christmas party I'll tell them they're
              not having one," he said.
              <p>"I want to see them enjoy themselves but not at this time of year. They've got nothing to celebrate.</p>
              <p>"They have to maintain their fitness and be prepared for a tough
              program coming up – one thing they don't need is to get a load of booze
              down their neck."</p>
              <p>Reports surfaced earlier today that Redknapp had clashed with David
              Bentley during a Spurs friendly in midweek. The Tottenham boss played
              down rumors of a row though.</p>
              <p>"It wasn't a real bust-up, nothing that would compare with what we
              are talking about at the other clubs this week," he explained.</p>
              <p>"I wasn't happy with his performance in the first half of a game and that was it.</p>
              <p>"There was no blazing row. I just felt he could have done better
              than he was doing. It was very mild. I was supposed to have said I will
              sell him in January. That's absolutely rubbish."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Spurs welcome Wolverhampton Wanderers to White Hart Lane
              at the weekend boosted by the news that Luka Modric returns to the
              squad.</p>
              <p>The Croat has been out of action since August with a broken fibula.</p>
              <p>However, Spurs will be without Ledley King and Jonathan Woodgate.</p>
              "Luka came through a friendly game and was fine. It's a bit early to start him but he'll be involved," Redknapp added.<br><br>"Ledley jarred his knee again. It's blown up and swollen up quite badly.
              <p>"It was looking great, he'd worked hard for three weeks. He was just
              short of a game, unfortunately it was a freak accident – the ball hit
              him in the face and his knee jarred.</p>
              <p>"Hopefully he shouldn't be too long. Woodgate the same."</p>
