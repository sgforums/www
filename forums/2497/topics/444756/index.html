              <p>Tributes were paid on Monday to former Liverpool and Everton defender 
              Gary Ablett who has died from cancer at the age of 46. Ablett lost his 
              16-month battle against non-Hodgkin's lymphoma on New Year's Day.</p>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Former
               team-mates have spoken of their sadness at his death with Paul Walsh, 
              who played alongside Ablett at Liverpool in the 1980s, describing the 
              news as
              "absolutely tragic".</p>
              <p>"I'm absolutely stunned at the news. He was a hell of a nice person. He was a
              top lad," he told <em>Sky Sports News</em>.</p>
              <p>"He didn't do anything fancy but was a great pro who trained hard with a great
              attitude to everything he did.</p>
              <p>"There was also a steely determination about Gary. You don't get in the
              Liverpool team and come through the ranks at Liverpool and play 100 times for
              them if you haven't got that little bit of steel."</p>
              <p>Ablett, the only player to win the FA Cup with both Merseyside clubs, also went
              on to play for Birmingham, Wycombe, Blackpool and the American side Long Island
              Rough Riders before turning to coaching.</p>
              <p>He spent some time with Everton's youth set-up before replacing Paco Herrera as
              the coach of Liverpool reserves, where he won both the Premier Reserve League
              North and also the national title in 2008.</p>
              <p>Ablett left Liverpool a year later and was appointed Stockport manager at a
              difficult time for the club - they were in administration - and left after a
              season following a change of ownership.</p>
              <p>He was not long into a coaching stint at Ipswich when he was diagnosed with the
              disease in the summer of 2010.</p>
              <p>"He was good at everything he did as a player. He went into coaching and
              stamped his personality on to that and was doing a very good job, certainly at
              youth level," former Liverpool manager Roy Evans said.</p>
              <p>"I remember he had bit of a difficult first spell at Stockport, but overall
              he's had a great career in football. He's a big loss to the sport. He made a big contribution to the game."</p>
              <p>David Fairclough, who played for Liverpool between 1974 and 1983, added: "He
              was a lovely lad, he always conducted himself in the right way.</p>
              <p>"He was great with people, always personable. What always came through with
              Gary was his attitude was just always very right."</p>
              <p>Former Liverpool and Germany midfielder Dietmar Hamann, who became Stockport
              manager in 2011 a year after Ablett left the post, said: "It's devastating
              news. He's a very highly regarded and respected man on Merseyside and a true
              legend."</p>
              <p>Michael Owen said on his Twitter account: "So sad to hear the news that Gary
              Ablett has passed away today aged 46. He played for some great clubs and had a career to be proud of. RIP."</p>
              <p>In October Ablett spoke of the shock at being diagnosed with the disease.</p>
              <p>"Jacqueline (his wife) took one look at me and took me straight to the
              doctors," he said in an interview with Everton's website to support Blue
              September - a campaign to raise awareness of forms of cancer specifically
              affecting men.</p>
              <p>"The following day they whisked me to Ipswich hospital and the sister asked us
              if we knew why we were there</p>
              <p>"We said 'for tests' but she told us they had found a really aggressive
              lymphoma and that without immediate treatment I'd be in serious trouble.</p>
              <p>"From diagnosis to that first session of chemotherapy was less than three
              days, so it was a massive shock."</p>
              <p>Former club Birmingham have announced a minute's silence will be observed
              before their npower Championship match at Peterborough today with another held
              at St Andrew's on Saturday prior to their FA Cup third round tie with Wolves.</p>
              <p>Ipswich's players will wear black armbands for Monday's visit of
              Nottingham Forest and Ablett will be honoured with a minute's applause.</p>
              <p>Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish, who gave Ablett his debut during his first
              spell as Reds boss, offered his condolences.</p>
              <p>"It's a sad, sad day 
              for his family and everyone connected with Liverpool
              Football Club," he told Liverpool's official website. "The most 
              important thing just now is to pay our respects to Gary, his wife 
              Jacqueline, the two boys and his wee girl.</p>
              <p>"Obviously he had a long battle and I'm sure it was a lot of suffering and a
              lot of pain for him but the only thing you can say is at least he won't be
              suffering any longer.</p>
              <p>"I gave Gary his debut and remember him scoring on his first start at Anfield
              against Nottingham Forest.</p>
              <p>"He was a really good servant to the football club not only as a player, but
              also as reserve team coach. He served the club proudly and credibly. It's very sad for everybody."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">IT takes a special man to cross the Mersey divide and remain a hero to both 
              sets of fans. Gary Ablett did so twice.</h2>
              <p>And if one man deserves his special place in the history of Liverpool and 
              Everton — as the only player to lift the FA Cup as a Red and a Blue — it is 
              the Scouse defender.</p>
              <p>Yet no one chatting to him would have been any the wiser of his footballing 
              first. For Ablett did not do bragging. In his eyes he was simply fortunate 
              to have played for either, let alone both.</p>
              <p>To have celebrated being a winner at Liverpool would have been more than 
              enough for the one-time Kopite.</p>
              <p>Doing so at Goodison too was simply unbelievable.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, Merseyside was united once again by Ablett. This time in grief, 
              after another of football's genuine nice guys lost his courageous battle 
              with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</p>
              <p>Kenny Dalglish handed him a debut in December 1986 — the first of 147 
              appearances for the Reds, which brought two league titles and an FA Cup.</p>

              <p>And the Kop boss led the tributes to the man who was rarely seen without a 
              smile on his face, even as he took on his biggest battle of all.</p>
              <p>Dalglish said: "It's a sad, sad day for his family and everyone connected with

              <p>"The most important thing just now is to pay our respects to Gary, his wife 
              Jacqueline, the two boys and his wee girl."</p>
              <p>The fact Ablett made so many appearances for Liverpool — then the greatest 
              side in the world — at a time they had the legendary pair of Mark Lawrenson 
              and Alan Hansen, plus the emerging Gary Gillespie, speaks volumes.</p>
              <p>Lawro said: "He had lots of pace and was very good on the ball. You could 
              never have enough Gary Abletts in your team."</p>
              <p>After a playing career that also took in Derby, Hull, Sheffield United, 
              Birmingham, Wycombe and Blackpool, Ablett returned to Goodison to help 
              develop Everton's youngsters.</p>
              <p>Rafa Benitez brought him back to Anfield as reserve chief. It swiftly led to 
              them lifting the league title. Ablett then became Stockport boss before his 
              final job, as Roy Keane's assistant at Ipswich.</p>
              <p>It was during his time at Portman Road that he was diagnosed, in 2010, and 
              battled for 16 months before losing the fight on New Year's Day, aged just 
              46.</p>
              <p>In the last few months, Ablett often went to Everton's training ground and was 
              an inspiration to the current crop of Goodison hopefuls. Boss David Moyes 
              said: "He was a regular visitor to Finch Farm and was a lovely man. It is 
              so, so sad about Gary."</p>
              <p>There have been many greater talents to play for Liverpool and Everton — 
              Ablett would have been the first to point that out.</p>
              <p>There have been few greater men.</p>
