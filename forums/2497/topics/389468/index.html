              <p><strong>A Premier League footballer has won a gagging order stopping the public learning about his affair with a team-mate’s girlfriend.</strong></p>
              <p>The so-called ‘super-injunction’ was granted by a High Court judge under human rights laws. The married England international successfully claimed that exposing his infidelity would be a breach of his right to a ‘private and family life’.</p>
              <p>So draconian is Mr Justice Tugendhat’s order that even its existence is supposed to be a secret. This latest example of media censorship provoked fresh controversy yesterday.</p>
              <p>A sweeping privacy law – now regularly used by sports stars to shield their lifestyles from scrutiny – has been put in place by judges without the endorsement of Parliament.</p>
              <p>Last month, a married Premier League manager succeeded in keeping his identity out of the papers despite being spotted visiting a brothel.</p>
              <p>Privacy guaranteed by the courts is likely to be of great financial benefit to the sportsman in the latest privacy scandal. He enjoys lucrative sponsorship deals which might be put at risk if fans were to learn of his activities.</p>
              <p>By contrast, no privacy law binds the U.S. media and Tiger Woods has lost several highly paid deals since his serial infidelities were publicised.</p>
              <p>Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, said: ‘We are in a position where the very rich can stop any publicity they don’t like while in many cases they are perfectly happy to milk publicity when it’s positive and benefits them.’</p>
              <p>Mr Davies, a member of the Culture, Media and Sport select committee, which is shortly to publish a report on privacy law, added: ‘The whole situation with injunctions has gone way too far.</p>
              <p>‘A free Press should be the corner stone of a free country and a free society and I am disturbed that injunctions are being granted willynilly to the wealthy and powerful.’</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="img-no-border" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/01/29/article-1246925-08110A63000005DC-89_233x114.jpg" alt="Mr X" width="233" height="114"></div>
              <p><strong>The enforced silence over the footballer is doubly controversial because of the use of a ‘ super-injunction’ which forbids publication of anything about it.</strong></p>
              <p>Such powers were brought in to defend the public interest – such as protecting the operations of criminal justice agencies in pursuing criminals.</p>
              <p>Last autumn, Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge gave as an example of the proper use of a super-injunction the case of the investigation of a fraud ring.</p>
              <p>It was essential to keep an asset-freezing order against one member secret from the rest so that they did not dispose of their assets or flee.</p>
              <p>Privacy law has largely been created by a single judge, Mr Justice Eady, who has taken charge of a number of key cases.</p>
              <p>Last year he declared that Formula One chief Max Mosley had been deprived of his privacy when the News of the World claimed he took part in a Nazi-themed orgy with prostitutes.</p>
              <p>The judge said that despite the fact that the participants wore uniforms, spoke German and used suggestive props, it was not a Nazi orgy, and so publishing the story was not in the public interest.</p>
              <p>Parliament has never passed a law on privacy.</p>
              <p>However, judges have built one on the back of Labour’s 1998 Human Rights Act, which made the European Convention on Human Rights part of British law.</p>
              <p>Judges have made privacy rulings based on article 8 of the charter, which guarantees ‘respect for private and family life’.</p>
              <p>They have given this precedence over article ten, which guarantees freedom of expression and ‘freedom to receive and impart information’.</p>

              <h1>John Terry named as footballer in alleged affair with team-mate's girlfriend</h1>

              </div>
              <p>John Terry today faces serious questions about his role as England
              captain after he was named as the star having an alleged affair with a
              team-mate’s girlfriend.</p>
              <p>The Chelsea skipper is claimed to have cheated behind his wife's back. The England captain married Toni Poole in 2007.</p>
              <p>Terry had won a gagging order stopping the public learning about his alleged affair but the injunction was lifted today.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/01/29/article-1246974-08134142000005DC-105_468x328.jpg" alt="John Terry" width="468" height="328">
              <p class="imageCaption">Centre of attention: England captain John Terry</p>
              </div>
              <p>Terry's so-called ‘super-injunction’ was granted by a High Court judge
              under human rights laws. He had successfully claimed that exposing his alleged
              infidelity would be a breach of his right to a ‘private and family
              life’.</p>
              <p>The judge, Mr Justice Tugendhat, lifted the injunction on Friday afternoon, saying: 'I
              do not consider that an interim injunction is necessary or
              proportionate having regard to the level of gravity of the interference
              with the private life of the applicant that would occur in the event
              that there is a publication of the fact of the relationship, or that
              [the applicant] can rely in this case on the interference with the
              private life of anyone else.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Justice
              Tugendhat granted the interim order to lawyers acting for LNS -
              as Terry is identified on court papers - at a private hearing in London
              last Friday. He said that it should remain in force until he delivered
              his decision on the application, which he gave in writing today.</p>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>The order covered the fact of a specified personal relationship
              between Terry, who is married with twins, and the named person, details
              about it including certain specific consequences, information leading
              to the identification of Terry or the other person and any photographs
              relating to it.</p>
              <p>Giving his reasons for refusing to renew the
              injunction, the judge said: 'I accept that the information sought to be
              protected is not in the public domain in the sense that there is
              nothing left to be protected.</p>
              <p>'But the evidence is that there
              has been wide circulation amongst those involved in the sport in
              question, including agents and others, and not just amongst those
              directly engaged in the sport.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/01/29/article-1246974-08124CDF000005DC-660_468x632.jpg" alt="Toni Poole" width="468" height="632">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Married: Terry with his wife Toni Poole</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>'If the injunction ought
              otherwise be granted, I would not refuse it on this basis. But the fact
              that the information has become as widely available to so many people,
              means that an injunction is less necessary or proportionate than would
              otherwise be the case.</p>
              <p>'Further, if - as I think likely - the
              real concern of the applicant in this case is the effect of publication
              upon the sponsorship business, then damages would be an adequate remedy
              if Terry succeeds at trial.'</p>
              <p>It is the latest scandal to emerge surrounding Terry. In December,
              he was exposed for organising a secret tour of Chelsea’s training
              ground, apparently in exchange for a £10,000 cash payment that was made
              in the staff canteen.</p>
              <p>Terry, who was accompanied by well-known ticket tout Tony Bruce,
              told undercover reporters from the News of the World that the
              arrangements for the tour had to be kept secret for fear that the club
              would ‘find out’.</p>
              <p>‘If anything ever goes wrong, then you say
              “John didn’t know nothing about that”,’ Bruce told the reporters who
              secretly filmed the visit.</p>
              <p>That incident cam shortly after <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>revealed
              that Terry had enlisted the help of a marketing company, Riviera
              Entertainment Limited, to cash in on the England captain’s armband,
              prompting one FA official to say he had made himself look ‘greedy’.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Leader: Terry is captain of Chelsea</em></p>
              </div>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p>‘John Terry is available to create effective brand awareness and
              endorse products and services globally,’ said the email that used the
              official FIFA World Cup logo without permission and, much to the
              surprise of Stamford Bridge officials, used an image of Terry in a
              Chelsea strip.</p>
              <p>It then reminded potentially interested parties that ‘John Terry is:
              British sporting hero; England’s football captain; World Cup 2018
              ambassador; Football icon; Dad of the year 2008; Voted as one of the
              World’s most influencial (sic) people.’</p>
              <p>Even
              though Riviera claimed to have a contractual agreement with him, Terry
              issued a statement saying the email had been circulated without his
              permission.</p>
              <p>In March last year, Terry's mum and mother-in-law
              were allegedly caught shoplifting £800-worth of clothes and food from
              Marks &amp; Spencer and Tesco.</p>
              <p>There was further family scandal
              in November when Terry's father was caught selling drugs. Ted Terry
              allegdly organised a deal to supply undercover News of the World
              reporters with cocaine.</p>
              <p>Along with his two Premier League medals,
              Terry also won the 2008 Dad of the Year award after a survey carried
              out by Daddies Sauce.</p>

              <h3>ENGLAND skipper John Terry has lost a battle to gag the News of the World from reporting his alleged affair with the girlfriend of ex team-mate Wayne Bridge.</h3>
              <p>The Chelsea captain - who married Toni Poole (pictured) and is the father of twins - had won a controversial super-injunction preventing this newspaper from revealing the alleged affair with French model Vanessa Peroncel last Sunday.</p>
              <p>The 29-year-old had successfully argued that publishing the claims would breach his right to a 'private and family life' under EU human rights law.</p>
              <p>But a judge in London's High Court today ruled the rumours were too widely known in the media, footballing circles and beyond, to be protected by law. And he said privacy law did not exist to protect sponsorship deals.</p>
              <p>Terry has played alongside Bridge, who left Chelsea for Manchester City last year, in several England games and both were expected to go to the World Cup in South Africa.</p>
              <p>Mr Justice Tugendhat said: "There has been wide circulation amongst those involved in the sport in question, including agents and others, and not just amongst those directly engaged in the sport.</p>
              <p>"The fact that the information has become as widely available to so many people, means that an injunction is less necessary or proportionate than would otherwise be the case.</p>
              <p>"Further, if - as I think likely - the real concern of the applicant in this case is the effect of publication upon the sponsorship business, then damages would be an adequate remedy if Terry succeeds at trial."</p>
              <p>He concluded: "Freedom to live as one chooses is one of the most valuable freedoms.</p>
              <p>"But so is the freedom to criticise - within the limits of the law - the conduct of other members of society as being socially harmful, or wrong." </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Tom Crone, News of the World legal manager, said: "We welcome Mr Justice Tugendhat's decision as a long overdue breath of fresh air and common sense coming out of the privacy courts.</strong></p>
              <p>"Over recent years, there has been more prior restraint on freedom of speech in Britain than in any other democratic country in the world.</p>
              <p>"Gagging orders like the one sought by John Terry have been granted to numerous other Premier League footballers and assorted celebrities.</p>
              <p>"Hopefully today's victory by the News of the World will lead to a fundamental reassessment of our draconian privacy laws.</p>
              <p>"The British public's right to know has been the victim of this legal process. Hopefully that will now change."</p>

              <p><em>Vanessa Perroncel: had an affair with England captain John Terry</em></p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>England captain John Terry’s career was thrown into further doubt last night after it was revealed he got his team-mate’s girlfriend pregnant.</strong></p>
              <p>The Mail on Sunday has learned that French model Vanessa Perroncel, former partner of fellow England defender Wayne Bridge, had an abortion within months of the affair starting.</p>
              <p>The pregnancy and termination are thought to have been the ‘consequences’ referred to by the High Court judge who threw out the £170,000-a-week footballer’s bid to seek a draconian gagging order to keep his affair secret.</p>
              <p>Last night, the far-reaching implications of Terry’s extraordinary legal action were becoming clear.</p>
              <p>There is now a strong belief among fans that Terry may have caused irreparable damage to England’s chances of success at the World Cup in South Africa in June.</p>
              <p>Although he is seen as a vital member of the squad, his behaviour has turned him into a pariah and has deeply unsettled his team-mates.</p>
              <p>There is anger, too, that his decision to use a super-injunction to try to prevent scrutiny of his actions has only served to exacerbate an already painful situation.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Rejecting Terry’s claim for the right to have a ‘private and family life’, the judge said he believed it was more likely Terry was trying to protect his reputation and business interests.</strong></p>
              <p>In his written judgment, Mr Justice Tugendhat referred to ‘details of such affair and/or relationship, including the consequences thereof’.</p>
              <p>Although he as not explicit by what was meant by the ‘consequences’, the internet was yesterday buzzing with reports that it referred to Miss Perroncel’s abortion. When asked about it, Miss Perroncel’s publicity agent Max Clifford said: ‘No comment‘.</p>
              <p>Friends said last night the termination was arranged by Terry and took place at a private clinic under clandestine circumstances. Miss Perroncel arrived and left the clinic via a back entrance.</p>
              <p>Terry is now facing a showdown with England manager Fabio Capello, expected to take place today, which may well decide the course of his career. But yesterday he appeared to put his private troubles behind him when he captained Chelsea in their Premiership clash against Burnley, scoring the winning goal in the 2-1 victory in the 82nd minute.</p>
              <p>He was booed by the opposing home fans whenever he touched the ball, and endured their chants of: ‘Same old Terry, always cheating’ and the song: ‘Chelsea wherever you may be, don’t leave your wife with John Terry.’</p>
              <p>Friends said Terry’s affair began soon after Miss Perroncel, a lingerie model, split from Bridge last summer. At first it was platonic, but became sexual in September. It is understood she became pregnant in October and had the termination weeks later.</p>
              <p>‘John has known her for years and there was always something between them, a kind of flirtatious thing,’ a friend told The Mail on Sunday. ‘It used to upset John’s wife Toni.</p>
              <p>‘After Vanessa and Wayne separated, John would go around to her house, initially at least, to offer support. Then it got a lot heavier very quickly.’</p>
              <p>On Friday, after the gagging order was overturned in the High Court, Mrs Terry rang Miss Perroncel, who lives close to the couple’s £3million home in the footballers’ enclave of Oxshott, Surrey.</p>

              <p><strong>The two women had been close friends before the news of Terry’s infidelity broke and sources described their conversation as ‘extremely tense’.</strong></p>
              <p>Earlier that day, Miss Perroncel spoke for the first time about the affair to a Mail on Sunday reporter. Describing how Terry’s secrecy bid backfired so spectacularly, she said that Bridge, the father of her three-year-old son, only learned about the liaison because of the court action.</p>
              <p>‘Wayne rang me last weekend and started shouting at me and accusing me of having an affair,’ said Miss Perroncel. ‘It was terrible. He was saying horrible things.’</p>
              <p>She said she told Bridge, 29, that she wasn’t having an affair ‘but he wouldn’t believe me’. Earlier, she said: ‘Wayne was convinced I had been cheating on him because the court action had been taken. It was an agonising call and he was furious.</p>
              <p>‘I am a close friend of his [John Terry’s]. We don’t talk everyday, but we are in touch a lot. I have known him for eight years, I even knew him before Wayne.</p>
              <p>'He has been to my house. I am also a close friend of his wife and I phoned her last weekend to arrange for us to go out together.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>‘I am friends with Frank Lampard’s ex-fiancee Elen as well. I don’t know what they are all going to think. It is a very close community of footballers and their wives here. I’m a single mother with a little boy to think about.’</strong></p>
              <p>Miss Perroncel’s £3 million mansion on an exclusive estate in Oxshott is a short drive from where Terry lives with 28-year-old Toni, his childhood sweetheart, and their three-year-old twins.</p>
              <p>His mother and mother-in-law both live on the same road, while other neighbours include West Ham midfielder Scott Parker, Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole and England star Ashley Cole and his wife Cheryl.</p>
              <p>Terry, 29, is believed to have spent yesterday explaining himself to his wife. Friends said that although Terry has been caught cheating before, his previous encounters had been much less serious and short-lived. ‘Toni will find this devastatingly painful,’ said one friend.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile Terry also faces a backlash from players and fans. Bridge, once a close friend, is said to have made it clear in football circles that he will not travel with Terry to the World Cup if, as expected, he is selected for the squad.</p>
              <p>News of the affair broke as Bridge and Miss Perroncel, who were together for three years, were struggling to sort out a settlement following their split six months ago. He moved to a £2million Edwardian mansion in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, while she remained in the marital home, after his transfer to Manchester City.</p>
              <p>Speaking about the negotiations, Miss Perroncel said: ‘Wayne and I are trying to sort out a settlement and I have been told by lawyers not to say certain things because it could affect it. The house I am living in is the one that Wayne and I had. It is very sad.’</p>
              <p>Yesterday, Bridge declined to comment on the affair.</p>

              <p><strong>It is understood Terry was seen visiting his lover’s home in his green Bentley two weeks ago. A witness said he appeared to use an electronic ‘beeper’ to get through the security gates.</strong></p>
              <p>Toni and Vanessa became close friends in 2006 after the model started dating Bridge and last summer the two women went on a ‘girls’ break’ together.</p>
              <p>In 2005, two years before his marriage to Toni, Terry said: ‘I’ve mis-behaved and slept with girls behind her back. I’m not going to cheat on her ever again and I want to marry her more than anything.’</p>
              <p>But the day he was quoted, it emerged he had a fling with a blonde – and even borrowed Bridge’s house as a love nest.</p>
              <p>The girl concerned, 25-year-old Shalimar Wimble, said at the time: ‘John never mentioned his fiancee Toni to me – I guess that’s why he took me to Wayne’s place.’</p>
              <p>On Friday, Mr Justice Tugendhat said it was crucial that newspapers should not be prevented from reporting details of his philandering ways just because they were ‘socially harmful’.</p>

              <p><strong>It was also revealed in court that Terry tried to silence his former lover by getting her to sign a ‘confidentiality’ agreement. In documents disclosed by Terry’s lawyers, it was claimed that she was offered just £1 in return for signing the agreement.</strong></p>
              <p>But Judge Tugendhat said that it could have been a nominal sum and she might have been given more.</p>
              <p>The deal was done at a hotel after Terry became concerned about rumours circulating in the football world a week ago.</p>
              <p>He believed a newspaper was about to expose his secret, so on Friday January 22, two of Terry’s business partners met Vanessa at a London hotel and she signed two documents, the court heard.</p>
              <p>The first was a short letter which said: ‘I agree to keep such information private and confidential’ and promising to pass any media inquiries on to one of Terry’s business partners.</p>
              <p>The second document said she agreed to keep quiet, ‘in order to assist you in keeping such information confidential and in consideration of £1, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged’.</p>
              <p>The judge said he was ‘troubled’ by the arrangement and in a scathing remark said: ‘Their business interest is to protect Terry’s reputation. I am left in serious doubt as to whether the information sourced through the business partners is full and frank.’</p>

              <h2>How advisers’ attempt to gag lover backfired</h2>
              <p>An attempt by two of Terry’s business partners to silence Miss Perroncel was partly responsible for the judge’s decision to allow damaging details to be reported.</p>
              <p>Court documents revealed she was given £1 for signing a confidentiality agreement. But Mr Justice Tugendhat ‘did not feel confident’ the papers she signed expressed her wishes.</p>
              <p>He also suggested she may have been given more money.</p>
              <p>She met the men at a London hotel on January 22. But the judge was concerned that the ‘business partners’ had not been frank with the court about events leading to her signing of the contract.</p>
              <p>The identity of the two men was not revealed but the judge said they promoted the player for sponsorship deals and protected his image.</p>
              <p>Terry is represented by Elite management, run by Essex businessmen Paul Nicholls and Keith Cousins. Both men describe themselves as ‘long term friends’ of Terry. Nicholls played alongside Terry as a Chelsea youth player.</p>
              <p>Mr Cousins and Mr Nicholls took over Terry’s management before the start of the season after he parted company from agent Aaron Lincoln.</p>
              <p>Lincoln had been credited with cultivating a more wholesome image for Terry.</p>
              <p>In November, Terry was severely embarrassed when an email was circulated among the sports business community.</p>
              <p>It had been sent by a small firm called Riviera Entertainment, based in Enfield, North London, hired by Elite management to fix lucrative commercial deals for the star leading up to the World Cup.</p>
              <p>The email was widely criticised as a bid to use Terry’s position as England’s captain as another cash cow.</p>

              <p>seriously Terry many revelations really made him a liability as captain of England. the past england captains of recent years, alan shearer, bryan robson, david platt, no such dirt was ever digged out from them, certainly not having an affair with your england team mate and your friend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>maybe can make either gerrard as captain and rooney as vice captain.</p>
