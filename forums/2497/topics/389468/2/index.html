              <p>I'm in two minds over this....</p>
              <p>On one hand, I always think that private life and football should be kept separate, and if John Terry is indeed a cheater, then that's for him and his wife to sort it out....</p>
              <p>On the other hand, if what they say is true with these revelations bringing about dressing-room disunity, then it might be wise for him to give up his England captaincy to, say, Steven Gerrard.</p>
              <p>Whatever the case, cheating on your wife with your best friend's girlfriend (who is herself a friend of the wife) is a pretty low blow.</p>
              <p>All the more so if you try to shut it up with a 1-pound offering. </p>

              <h3>CHEAT John Terry's devastated wife Toni TORE into his bit-on-the-side brunette in a blistering phone bust-up after news of their affair broke, we can reveal. In an astonishing confrontation on Friday, furious Toni demanded that model Vanessa Perroncel tell her EVERY DETAIL about their secret relationship. </h3>
              <p>But incredibly, the French beauty managed to persuade Toni there had been NO affair. The smug mistress later bragged how Terry's wife of three years had swallowed her story - and Terry's - that the pair were nothing more than close friends. </p>
              <p>Our insider said: "John and Vanessa have been extremely cocky. They're desperately denying everything to Toni. "They know they're walking on a knife-edge, but somehow at the moment, they think they've managed to convince her it isn't true." </p>
              <p>Full back Bridge, 29 - now with Manchester City - finally split with Vanessa after they both holidayed with pals Ashley and Cheryl Cole in the south of France last June. </p>
              <p>That was six months after he moved from Chelsea to City and three months before the affair began. Bridge called Vanessa two weeks ago when rumours began circulating the Premier League, asking if it was true. But she said it wasn't. </p>
              <p>But Terry's wife Toni was even more determined to get to the truth and had a screaming phone conversation with the model after the gagging injunction was lifted - demanding to know if she'd been sleeping with her husband. </p>
              <p>A source in the camp said: "It was a real shouting match between the two of them. They were both ranting and swearing down the phone. But Vanessa just denied there was an affair." </p>
              <p>She is sticking to her story that they are just good friends - and that she kept the "friendship" between her and Terry secret to prevent any suspicions. </p>
              <p>Our source added: "When rumours first circulated Vanessa seemed worried. But as the lawyers seemed confident of gaining an injunction she changed her tune. She boasted that no-one could say anything about the affair." Early last week the brazen brunette even attended a crisis meeting at Chelsea to discuss the pair's next move - to the surprise of staff. </p>
              <p>One club insider told us: "She drove up to the gate to the car park, but was refused entry. "Parking is really strict, so she called Terry on his mobile and passed the phone to an attendant. "And then she points up to this window, and Terry's standing there waving, with his shirt off. The car park worker couldn't believe it. Obviously she was let in super-quick." Once inside Vanessa disappeared for a meeting, before bumping into the players. </p>
              <p>A source said: "Everyone was really polite, but they all know Vanessa and what's going on. Terry's the club captain, so no-one's going to say anything." </p>
              <p>Terry also scored in yesterday's Chelsea win at Burnley - but the lifting of the injunction has now got him sweating over the damage the affair could do to his sponsorship deals. His Chelsea pay packet gives him a yearly wage of £8.32 million, while deals with sportswear firms like England kit firm Umbro are said to be worth up to an extra £2 million a year. </p>
              <p>He's also appeared in adverts for phone firm Samsung, Nationwide and King of Shaves. A source close to Terry told us he also fears Toni will now divorce him - which could cost him a huge chunk of his fortune. The couple have been together for 12 years. </p>
              <p>The pal said: "She's told him if it's true, she's had enough. He's genuinely worried. "Both he and Vanessa have been hoping they can deny everything. But those hopes must have all but faded."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>This vile and gutless man</h2>
              <p><em>By Carole Malone, News of the World columnist</em></p>
              <p><strong>IT goes without saying that John Terry is a five-star scumbag-a liar, a cheat, an adulterer and a man who thought nothing of betraying his friend and teammate by having an affair with the mother of his son.</strong> </p>
              <p>This is a man who believes that because he earns £160,000 a week doesn't have to live by the rules that apply to the rest of us, hence the brawling, the urinating in public and the sex in the back of cars with starstruck young girls. </p>
              <p>But worst of all, John Terry is a snivelling coward who hired top lawyers to help him hide his debauchery and treachery using human rights laws-laws designed to protect the vulnerable and the weak, not the reputations of louts like him. </p>
              <p>The only thing that matters to John Terry is money and his precious sponsorships, which is why he and his big shot lawyers used laws supposed to protect people to protect his bank balance. </p>
              <p>But coward that he is, Terry pretended this was some noble fight for his family and their privacy-that same family he has all but destroyed. </p>
              <p>The only good thing to come out of all this is that impressionable young fans will now see this vile man for what he is-just a heartless, gutless cheat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>His betrayal of everyone</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>By Tracey Cox, our Good Sex Guru</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>WHILE lust is a powerful emotion that's difficult to resist, Terry's affair is an unforgiveable betrayal on so many levels. He didn't just betray his wife Toni, he crossed the line of friendship. </h3>
              <p>True, Bridge is no longer involved with Vanessa. But we all feel a sense of ownership about our exes and few friendships survive if a close friend ends up dating someone we once had a serious relationship with. </p>
              <p>Even more humiliating for Toni is the fact she was Vanessa's pal. </p>
              <p>The couples were firm friends and spent time together and the affair throws up all sorts of doubts. </p>
              <p>The innocent partners-Bridge and Toni-are left feeling foolish, humiliated and wondering if it had been going on all along, under their very noses. </p>
              <p>The reigning Father Of The Year hasn't just lost the respect and trust of his wife and teammates. </p>
              <p>He has lost a friend who deserved to be treated with respect. Bridge once loved Vanessa. She was a friend to his wife. </p>
              <p>This was always doomed to disaster and now everyone involved will be paying the price.</p>

              <p><br>What they did should be praised for a job well done again... Whether its's right or wrong, The judge has already explained the reason for allowing them to publish it.</p>
              <p>On a higher level, cheats and adulterer should realise the court should not be made to protect them. Terry is the England captain, some very young boys as well as teenagers look up to him and idolize him. And if his behaviour is seen to be acceptable by the general public, then it is a very sad day. And the other woman don't seem to be bother with it either bragging about it...</p>
              <p>We shouldn't blame the Press for the news or created much embarrassment to the two families... The Press can't do it if Terry didn't cheat on his wife in the first place... And maybe Terry's wife and Wayne Bridge might actually thank the Press for bring it to light. Otherwise they would continue to be kept in the dark and continue to look like a fool to many...</p>
              <p>Remember, the Press alone can't do this. It needed Terry to commit the act before they can report on it. If Terry stay clean, they have nothing to report or expose.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The footballer's wife has fled their £4million home telling friends she would divorce him over his affair with lingerie model Vanessa Perroncel  -  her former close friend and neighbour. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">And Terry, 29, was revealed to have arranged for his mistress to undergo an abortion after she became pregnant during their relationship. </span></span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">He started the affair after Bridge, who had lived on the same estate as the Terrys, signed for </span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Manchester</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> </span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">City</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> and moved to a house in </span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Cheshire</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> leaving his partner and mother of their three-year-old son behind.</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Miss Perroncel reportedly became pregnant within weeks and friends said the termination was arranged by Terry and took place at a private clinic under clandestine circumstances in October. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">She arrived and left the clinic via a back door, while the operation was reportedly delayed so Terry could attend after a training session. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">When Terry finally told his wife, she immediately rang her former best friend to confront her. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">A friend said: 'It was a real shouting match between the two of them. They were both ranting and swearing down the phone. But Vanessa just denied there was an affair.' <br><br></span></span>
              </p><p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Another source said that Toni told Vanessa: 'Call yourself a friend? What sort of friend sleeps with their mate's husband?' </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The £170,000-a-week </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Chelsea</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> star is worth an estimated £25million with lucrative marketing and media contracts. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">With Toni entitled to half of his fortune, both now and in the future, it could be the biggest-ever divorce settlement in </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">UK</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> sport. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">As further details of Terry's relationship with Miss Perroncel emerged, she spent two hours with publicist Max Clifford last night discussing how she might break her silence on the affair. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">But the impact the scandal is having on the </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">England</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> squad was immediately apparent with reports that Bridge is understood to have told friends and family that he will not play for his country while Terry remains the captain. </span></span></p>
