              <p><strong>Cheick Tiote has enlisted the help of his favourite witch doctor in a bizarre bid to regain full fitness for Newcastle.</strong></p>
              <p>As Sunday Mirror Sport revealed last month, Tiote is set to join ­Chelsea in a £25million deal – if the Blues can beat away a counter offer from Manchester United.</p>
              <p>But the Toon want him fit as soon as possible after a knee injury.</p>
              <p>So the Ivory Coast star was given permission by club owner Mike Ashley to fly back to his homeland to see the shaman.</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old has fluid on his right knee which is causing pain and restricting his movement when twisting and turning. He has ­already missed vital Premier League games against Manchester United, ­Chelsea and leaders Manchester City.</p>
              <p>The injury is taking too long to heal, in Tiote’s opinion. So with ­Ashley’s blessing he flew back to Yamoussoukro, capital of the Ivory Coast, for his bizarre treatment.</p>
              <p>The shaman – wearing a leafy head-dress – performed a ritual ­involving mysterious chanting, singing and prayers so that Tiote’s injury curse would be broken.</p>
              <p>He has not played for Toon since October 22, when his high-flying side beat Wigan 1-0.</p>
              <p>Alan Pardew’s team were undefeated in the Premier League this season when the combative African was playing, highlighting just how important he is to the north-east club. Without him, Newcastle’s form has deteriorated markedly.</p>
              <p>The African has looked a bargain since arriving from FC Twente for £3.5m in August 2010. His advisers have been in England ­trying to thrash out a deal which could take the midfielder to ­Stamford Bridge in the summer for around £25m.</p>
              <p>United are expected to submit a bid to rival Chelsea’s. Both clubs had originally hoped to seal Tiote’s signature in the January transfer window but it is now likely to ­happen next summer.</p>
              <p>With the Africa Cup of ­Nations due to start in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea in January, and running into February, Tiote has indicated he would ­prefer to stay at Newcastle this season.</p>
