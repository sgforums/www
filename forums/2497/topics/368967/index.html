              <h1 class="storyTitle" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-size: 2.8em;">Angry Beckham confronts boo-boys in Los Angeles</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2009/0720/davidbeckham412bannersatlagalaxy20090719_412x232.jpg" alt="" width="412" height="232"></p>
              <p>David Beckham got involved in an ugly confrontation with fans at his
              first home game for the Los Angeles Galaxy after returning from Italy.</p>
              <p>The former England captain <span style="color: #000000;">attempted to jump over a barrier as he left the
              field at half-time into a section of the crowd that had been jeering him.</span></p>
              <p>He was held back by security staff, members of whom were also needed to
              restrain an angry fan who left his seat and rushed towards the footballer.</p>
              <p>The 34-year-old explained afterwards in comments broadcast on <em>Sky Sports News</em>:
              "I tried to shake one of the guy's hands but he didn't want any of it. That's
              the way it is.''</p>
              <p>Beckham received a less than friendly welcome at his first home game after
              returning from a five-month loan spell at AC Milan - the team the Galaxy faced.</p>
              <p>A hardcore section of the crowd booed Beckham every time he touched the ball
              and held aloft signs reading "<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Go Home Fraud'' and "23: Repent''</span></strong> in reference
              to his shirt number.</p>
              <p>Another read: "<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Hey Becks, Here Before You, Here after You, Here Despite You''
              while one stated: "Is evil something u are...or something u do?''</strong></span></p>
              <p>Earlier this year, Beckham indicated he wanted to stay in Milan rather than
              return to America, stating that the standard of play was far higher in Italy.</p>
              <p>The apparent snub has angered some Galaxy fans, notably a hardcore that sit in
              the so-called LA Riot Squad section.</p>
              <p>Throughout the first half of the game he was subjected to jeers and obscene
              chants.</p>
              <p>After the referee blew for half time, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Beckham tried to hurdle an advertising
              boarding and appeared to make a "come on'' gesture towards fans.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">In response, one man left his seat, jumped down on to the pitch and attempted
              to run towards Beckham.</span></strong> At this point security intervened and escorted Beckham
              to the changing room, while removing the fan from the pitch.</p>
              <p>Despite the incident, Beckham returned in the second half. He was the last man
              to take to the pitch and hugged several of his former Milan team-mates before
              gesturing towards the rowdy section of the crowd.</p>
              <p>A line of yellow-jacketed security staff stood below the supporters in the
              trouble area as a precaution.</p>
              <p>On the pitch Beckham had a hand in both Galaxy goals, scored by Alan Gordon and
              Bryan Jordan, as they twice came from behind to draw 2-2 with the Rossoneri.
              Thiago Silva and Filippo Inzaghi scored for Milan.</p>
              <p>After the second Galaxy goal, Beckham turned and shrugged his shoulders in the
              direction of the section of crowd that had been jeering him.</p>
              <p>The former Manchester United star was substituted after 75 minutes and walked
              off to a mixture of cheers and boos.</p>
              <p>On the boos, Beckham said: "It's to be expected. Sometimes it goes beyond it.
              The majority of the fans have been great.''</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">DAVID BECKHAM will become a loan star again in a bid to convince manager Fabio Capello to pick him for England. The superstar makes his MLS return for his club LA Galaxy against New York Red Bulls amid a storm of criticism. </h2>
              <p class="article">England midfielder Becks was slammed in the States for his loan move to AC Milan which saw him miss the start of the MLS season. But Beckham, 34, stood firmly by his decision last night and vowed to do the same again to keep his World Cup dream alive. </p>
              <p class="article">He said: "Leading up to the World Cup in South Africa next year, the England manager has made it very clear to me that I need to be playing at European level. "I'd always regret it if I did not do everything to give myself a chance to be involved in that." </p>
              <p class="article">Beckham enjoyed a successful six months under Carlo Ancelotti at Milan. He is hopeful that he will return to the Italian club in December, despite Ancelotti now being in charge of Chelsea. </p>
              <p class="article">Beckham added: "Milan have said they'd love to have me back. "I think it would have to be leading up to the World Cup. </p>
              <p class="article">"With the last loan, it worked out pretty well. I'm not going to sit here and say it was ideal and perfect. "It was great for myself but it's tough for the Galaxy and the guys when you lose any player." </p>
              <p class="article">Since returning to Los Angeles Beckham has also said he would not rule out a return to the Premier League, six years after he left Manchester United. LA Galaxy team-mate Landon Donovan slated Becks and questioned his commitment to the MLS. </p>
              <p class="article">Beckham, however, revealed he had received an apology from Donovan. He said: "Landon apologised and I told him my view on things and it's forgotten about. We're both men. "We don't take it on to the field because that's when it would disrupt us, and we go on and play our soccer. That's the most important thing."</p>

              <p>"There's no possibility for him to come
              sooner," the Milan chief told reporters. "David knows that the doors of
              Milanello are always open for him, his lawyers also know that.</p>
              <p>"I
              hope he returns in January, but before then he won't because that's
              when the market reopens even though he finishes there at the end of
              November.</p>
              <p>"There are insurmountable financial obstacles.</p>
              <p>"The
              most likely hypothesis is that Beckham plays for us from January until

              <h1>Beckham fined after fan argument</h1>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><span id="intelliTXT">David
              Beckham has been fined by Major League Soccer following his ugly
              confrontation with Los Angeles Galaxy fans earlier this week.</span></p>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/09/07/330/davidbeckham_2334713.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>MLS commissioner Don Garber dished out a $1,000 (£609) penalty to the former England captain on Friday evening.</p>
              <p>The 34-year-old has endured a rocky relationship with American
              supporters since returning to the Galaxy after a five-month loan stint
              with AC Milan.</p>
              <p>Galaxy fans in particular were angered by Beckham's reluctance
              to return from Europe, where he is expected to return at the end of the
              MLS season.</p>
              <p>It was against his former San Siro team-mates on Monday that
              Beckham apparently lost his cool with the constant barracking from the
              stands.</p>
              <p>The former Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder marched
              over to a section of supporters and had to be restrained by security as
              he sought to make his point.</p>
              <p>An angry fan also jumped down from the stands and attempted to reach Beckham before having his way blocked.</p>
              <p>It was the veteran's first home match since returning to the
              Galaxy, and he was greeted with several hostile banners reading
              messages such as 'Go Home Fraud' and 'Hey Becks, Here Before You, Here
              after You, Here Despite You'.</p>
              <p>Galaxy next play at Kansas City Wizards on Saturday.</p>
