              <h1>Cut-price Adebayor: Arsenal clear the way for Milan move after dropping asking price by £17m<br></h1>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/07/12/article-0-0621C5850000044D-519_306x569.jpg" alt="Emmanuel Adebayor" width="306" height="569"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>AC Milan target Emmanuel Adebayor is a step closer to the San Siro after current club Arsenal dropped their asking price, according to the player's agent.</strong></p>
              <p>The Rossoneri have long been linked to the 24-year-old but reportedly balked at the hefty transfer fee which Arsenal slapped on his head.</p>
              <p>However, Vincenzo Morabito claims that the Gunners have now almost halved the price. "We're working to make the deal easier," he told Italian television channel Antenna3. "The signs are very positive. "We're arriving at more reasonable figures.</p>
              <p>"They're still a lot, but a lot less than the 45million euros (£36m) that were initially asked for. A bit more than half. "More than that of (Samuel) Eto'o and (Didier) Drogba but they are a little bit older."</p>

              <h1>AC Milan near deal for Emmanuel Adebayor</h1>
              <p> </p>

              <p><em>New direction? AC Milan have confirmed they are in 'advanced' talks with Emmanuel Adebayor.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="small"></p>
              <p class="story"><strong>AC Milan last night confirmed that talks are at an advanced stage to sign Emmanuel Adebayor following weeks of rumours about the likely destination of the Arsenal striker.</strong></p>
              <p class="story">Both Milan and the player's agent, Stephane Courbis, said that although no fee had yet been agreed, the Togo forward was on the verge of switching to the San Siro leaving Arsenal in urgent need of a proven goalscorer a month away from the start of the new season.</p>
              <p class="story">"I can confirm that we have strong hopes Adebayor will soon become a Milan player," a senior official of the Italian club told The Sunday Telegraph. "We certainly want him and I think he wants to come but the work still has to be done with Arsenal. It's just a question of finding the time and the place."</p>
              <p class="story">Although nothing has been signed, it is expected that Milan will give Adebayor a five-year deal depending on the transfer fee, which Arsenal are prepared to drop from their initial £30 million asking price to £24 million. His agent refused to confirm the fee yesterday but admitted Milan were favourites to sign him. "We have discussions with Milan, Arsenal and the player but for the moment nothing has been agreed," he said. "I'm getting really fed up with being bombarded by journalists so for the moment we are saying nothing more."</p>
              <p class="story">Milan are known to be in the market for a top class centre-forward, and a couple of weeks ago announced they would be signing one out of Samuel Eto'o, Didier Drogba, Adebayor or Amauri who has subsequently joined Juventus.</p>
              <p class="story">Since then Ronaldinho's name has also been linked with Milan but their spokesman said that, if they signed Adebayor, they would not sign the Brazilian. "If we buy one we won't buy the other, simple as that," he said.</p>
              <p class="story">Adebayor's likely exit will free up the cash needed for Arsenal to pursue Andrei Arshavin. The Russian playmaker's agent, Dennis Lachter, says Arshavin is "desperate" to leave Zenit St Petersburg and join Arsenal.</p>

              <h2><span><img src="http://clientimages.teamtalk.com/08/04/160/Emmanuel_Adebayor_Manchester_United_Arsenal_P_783911.jpg" border="0" alt="Milan end their interest in Ade"></span></h2>
              <p><strong>Arsenal forward Emmanuel Adebayor is no longer a transfer target of AC Milan, according to Adriano Galliani.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Togo forward has been Milan's number one target this summer, but problems have continued to arise over the reported price tag which Gunners manager Arsene Wenger has put on his prize asset.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And now Rossoneri vice-president Galliani has seemingly lost interest in bringing the former Monaco star to the San Siro. Galliani told <em>Gazzetta dello Sport</em>: "We've stopped dealing with Wenger and have to reconfirm that up to now Milan has, above all, important sacrifices to make in negotiations with its current players, starting with Kaka."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, if Milan do resurrect their interest in the hitman, they could be in for a cut-price deal. Adebayor's agent Vincenzo Morabito claims that the Gunners have now almost halved the price tag. "We're working to make the deal easier," Morabito told Italian television channel Antenna3. "The signs are very positive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We're arriving at more reasonable figures. "They're still a lot, but a lot less than the 45million euros that were initially asked for. A bit more than half. "More than that of (Samuel) Eto'o and (Didier) Drogba but they are a little bit older."</p>
