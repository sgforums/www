            <div class='col-md body'>To be fair, Houllier did not really do a good job at pool, but when he was at Lyons, they ran away with the title.<br><br>Another example, like the Aston Villa Manager, Martin O'Neil, he did not do great in EPL, but he went to Celtic, get a good winning history and then ascended to god-like status in EPL.<br><br>Traditionally, teams such as Lyon, Valencia, Celtic do well irregardless of fluctuations. They can sell their best players, but still, they manage to get good league standings.<br><br>I was just wondering whether when you inherit a good team,win the league, are you counted as a good manager or the team just good??<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another example would be England team with Eriksson.<br><br>England team was bursting with talent. And he just needed to show more passion and get the selection right.<br><br>Instead, with the ample talent, he still failed to deliver in the WC, EC.<br><br>So is he really tat good or just the team's quality manage to show that manager is good?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i disagree with you one o'neil cos he has a good stlye of play. he surpassed expectations with lecester city and he has finally got his team to gel together and they will be much stronger next season. but he has similar attacking approach. heskey with lecester, hartson with celtic and now carew with villa. he has a winning formula and i will want to see how strong villa will challenge next season.<br><br>on the other hand,inheriting a good squad does not mean success. look at newcastle. they sacked a man who brought them just one place off the champions league zone and now struggling just to get into the uefa cup. and they also have a bigger squad now, so this failing is solely due to the managers</div>
