              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has had a
              Rafa-like moan at Rafa Benitez, accusing the Liverpool boss of treating
              Sam Allardyce 'with contempt'. </strong></p>
              <p>Benitez and Allardyce have shared a long-running feud that dates back to the Blackburn manager’s spell as Bolton boss.</p>
              <p>However, the Spaniard’s reaction to Fernando Torres’ second goal in
              last weekend's 4-0 win, a gesture that seemed to signal ‘game over’,
              has prompted angry reactions from both Allardyce and Ferguson. <strong></strong></p>
              <p>Speaking ahead of an FA Cup semi-final with Everton, Ferguson lost
              focus – much like Benitez did in his January rant – accusing the
              Liverpool boss of a lack of respect towards Allardyce.</p>
              <p>"Arrogance is one thing. But you cannot forgive contempt, which is
              what he showed Sam Allardyce last weekend,” Ferguson told Friday’s
              press conference.</p>
              <p>"When Liverpool scored their second goal he signalled as if the game was finished. I do not think Sam deserved that.</p>
              <p>"Sam has worked so hard for the LMA (League Managers' Association)
              and he's had a weakened team. I just thought it showed contempt.</p>
              <p>"In my experience no Liverpool manager has ever done that. It was beyond the pale."</p>
              <p>As United try to prevent Liverpool chopping any further into their
              title lead, Ferguson also dragged up a previous spat between Benitez
              and Everton as he touched on a further example of Benitez 'arrogance'.</p>
              <p>"Everton are a big club, not a small one which Benitez arrogantly said," added the United boss.</p>

              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Sam Allardyce has
              launched a scathing attack on Rafa Benitez in the wake of Blackburn's
              4-0 defeat by Liverpool at Anfield last Saturday. </strong></p>
              <p>Allardyce has accused the Spaniard of being
              'disrespectful' and 'humiliating' over gestures he made on the
              touchline after Fernando Torres had headed the home side into a
              two-goal lead before the interval.</p>
              <p>Television replays showed
              Benitez shrugged his shoulders and then crossed his hands, which
              Allardyce has taken to mean that the Reds boss felt the game was
              already over, even though there was almost an hour still to play.</p>
              <p>Relegation-threatened
              Rovers, who were second best throughout the match, were missing several
              players through injury and employed centre-back Chris Samba in a lone
              striking role.</p>
              <p>Allardyce claims he attempted to speak to Benitez
              about his actions after the game but could not make contact with the
              Spaniard and has been left fuming by the incident.</p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p>He told <em>Sky Sports News</em>: "It's not
              out of our system for two reasons. One is the disappointment at the way
              the team performed. I know we had a lot of injuries on the day, but I
              still felt that we should have gone there and done better than we did.</p>
              <p>"And
              two, is the unfortunate gestures from Rafa Benitez after the second
              goal. I wanted to clarify his gestures. I think you'll see them as
              pretty dismissive to me and to Blackburn Rovers' team as a whole.</p>
              <p>"I think they are disrespectful and quite humiliating.</p>
              <p>"I waited to have a word with Rafa Benitez in his room after the game but as usual, and unfortunately, he didn't turn up.</p>
              <p>"I
              was hugely disappointed by those gestures and having re-looked at them
              this week I think I'm right and I think everyone will see why I'm
              complaining."</p>
              <p>When asked if he felt Benitez was writing his side
              off, Allardyce replied: "That was the feeling by the gestures. It was
              an open arms and a cross-over of arms as if that was it.</p>
              <p>"The game is hard enough as it is without a fellow manager trying to do, what seemed to be, an undermining gesture."</p>
