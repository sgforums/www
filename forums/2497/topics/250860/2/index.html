The Red Devils take a 3-2 lead into the decider against AC Milan at the San Siro, but Ferguson knows the presence of Vidic and Ferdinand could be invaluable as they look to preserve their narrow lead. </strong><br><br>Ferdinand aggravated a groin injury against Middlesbrough 10 days ago and Vidic has not played since breaking a collarbone in the Premiership triumph over Blackburn on March 31. However, Ferguson was optimistic enough over both players to name them in his travelling party.<br><br>"It is too early to say whether they will play," said the Scot. "They will travel and we will assess the situation after training." With Patrice Evra suspended, the odds are at least one of them will play, allowing Gabriel Heinze to switch into his favoured left-back role.<br><br>Louis Saha could be on the bench despite his recent hamstring problems although the absence of Gary Neville will only fuel speculation the United skipper's ankle injury will rule him out for the season.<br><br>Heinze, Cristiano Ronaldo and Paul Scholes - who famously missed the 1999 Champions League final - are one caution away from a ban, although Ferguson will hope the trio remain fully focused on steering United to what would be only their third European Cup final.<br><br>Twice before, in 1958 and 1969, United have fallen to Milan at this stage of the competition. Ferguson himself has suffered semi-final defeats against Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen. But, a better statistic for United followers is that their club have not lost a European tie after winning the first leg since 1985 and have never done so under Ferguson.<br><br></div>

Reports suggested there had been a rift between the player and the club but Chelsea have moved swiftly to deny there is any problem.</strong><br><br>A statement from Chelsea read: "Contrary to media reports, Andriy Shevchenko did not refuse to travel with the team to Liverpool. "He suffered an injury during training on Sunday and it was decided after training that he was not fit to play against Liverpool and therefore, like other injured players, did not travel."<br><br>Shevchenko has also confirmed that he was injured, expressing his disappointment at being unavailable. He told his official website: "I am really sorry to miss the match and can't be with the team to help and support them in what must be one of the most important games in Chelsea's history. "I will remain in London and work hard on my rehabilitation to ensure I can make myself available as soon as possible."<br><br></div>

Liverpool trail 1-0 from the first leg at Stanford Bridge so it's imperative that they do not concede an away goal. The Spaniard claims that Reds goalkeeper Pepe Reina is now better than Petr Cech and backs his compatriot to keep a clean sheet against the Premiership champions. </strong><br><br>"A goal at Anfield is key. If Liverpool score I am convinced that we can make it through," Alonso told the Sky Sports website. "Pepe Reina is sensational. For me now he is better than Cech. I'm backing Pepe to finish at Anfield without letting a goal in." Alonso believes that Chelsea's real threat comes from their midfield, saying: "People praise Drogba and the Chelsea forwards but for me the danger is in the midfield. To restrict players like Lampard, Essien or Makelele is our aim. Without their work The Blues are different.<br><br>"The battle at Anfield will be in the centre of the field. If we stop those lines of play for Chelsea the path of success is open to us but if they are allowed to play, the problem will be huge." Liverpool's team is undoubtedly stronger than the one that beat Chelsea on their way to the final two years ago, but Alonso believes that the Blues have got weaker.<br><br>"I believe that Chelsea are not as strong as in other years but they are a dangerous team, especially away from home. Against Valencia they won in the worst moments of the match and we need to assure the score in the first half. "I am optimistic and I believe in our qualification because historically Liverpool is the team that has created more problems to Mourinho's Chelsea and now is the time to confirm it."<br></div>

The Chelsea boss has become an Anfield hate figure since his "shush" gesture at the 2005 Carling Cup Final and ensured he would be the target in tonight's Champions League semi-final second leg as his war of words with Rafa Benitez intensified. But as skipper John Terry announced he would love to succeed Mourinho as Blues boss when he stops playing, the Chelsea chief claimed the Liverpool fans should be standing to clap him, rather than shower him with abuse.</strong><br><br>Mourinho, who saw groin victim Andriy Shevchenko join Ricardo Carvalho and Michael Ballack on the sidelines, said: "The Liverpool fans have to be very happy with me because of my comments about them. "I said that it was impossible to compare Chelsea with Liverpool. I showed great respect for a great club. "They have a big history in Europe that Chelsea do not. What I deserve from the Liverpool fans is applause."<br><br>Mourinho, however, dismissed the notion that the Kop and the Anfield factor would be decisive as they were two years ago when the Portuguese accused the Slovakian officials of being taken in by the crowd to award Luis Garcia's decisive "ghost goal".<br><br>The Chelsea boss added: "The effect of a hostile atmosphere on the away team depends on the character of the players. "It can be an extra motivation for people with a lot of experience. We are strong enough." Terry told BBC 1's Inside Sport: "I'd certainly like to manage one day. "When I was speaking about my contract with Chelsea, I was talking about maybe an option to manage at the end of it."<br></div>

We all read the press and understood what he was saying. It was a bit disappointing hearing him say we are only a little club, but there you go. Mind you, weÂ’ve got to two European Cup finals in three years now. Not bad for a little club, eh?</strong><br><br>Despite Dirk Kuyt hitting the bar and going close to a winner in the last minute of extra time, Mourinho flatly refused to accept Liverpool had booked their place in Athens on merit. "It is the most heartbreaking moment of my time at Chelsea, and it is all the harder to take when you consider we were the best team," he said. "We were the only team trying to win it in 90 minutes and again in extra time. "But football is like this, and in 10 years or so no one will remember that we were the best team and should have won. All I saw was one team in blue playing without any problems and trying to win the game.<br><br>"They were stronger when it came to penalties but I donÂ’t accept Liverpool had the best chances. We werenÂ’t the team playing for penalties. We created good chances and had a dominant figure in Didier Drogba. "Liverpool knew that, and that is why they defended so much.<br><br>Benitez could barely believe MourinhoÂ’s claim that the better team lost but preferred to salute his team and, in particular, Reina, who saved three out of four penalties in last seasonÂ’s FA Cup Final shoot-out with West Ham. "He really said that?" queried the Liverpool manager. "I would rather concentrate on my teamÂ’s marvellous achievement and the amazing atmosphere our fantastic supporters created.<br><br>Bookmakers are now offering odds of 11-10 that Mourinho will not be in charge of Chelsea next season. They also make Liverpool evens favourites to win the Champions League, with Manchester United 7-4 and Milan, their opponents tonight, 3-1.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I hate to say this. Van der Sar is sure to concede a goal again. But milan's defence is not rock steady too.<br><br>3-3 is my prediction.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Welcome to San Siro where an expectant crowd await the second semi-final of this season's UEFA Champions League, between AC Milan and Manchester United FC. Tonight's visitors hold a 3-2 advantage going into the second leg thanks to Wayne Rooney's added-time winner at Old Trafford and welcome back Nemanja VidiÃ¦ from injury. His defensive team-mate Rio Ferdinand is only fit enough for a place on the bench, while Patrice Evra is ruled out through suspension. Milan, meanwhile, will be hoping for more magic from the competition's leading scorer KakÃ¡ but are without inspirational captain Paolo Maldini because of a knee problem.</strong><br><br><img src="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p143/zococl/U3.jpg"> <img src="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p143/zococl/U2.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p143/zococl/U1.jpg"></div>
