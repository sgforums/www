              <p>Real Madrid speculation is again
              sparking after Cristiano Ronaldo's strop in front of Manchester United
              boss Sir Alex Ferguson yesterday.</p>
              <p>Shocked TV viewers saw him throw a tantrum after being hauled off an hour into this easy derby win over Manchester City.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo angrily pushed away a tracksuit held out to him and, as he sat on the bench, called the decision “a joke”.</p>
              <p>Yet boss Fergie backed the player’s reaction. He said: “He
              wanted to stay on. He’s in great form but I have to look at the big
              picture. We have to think about keeping him as fresh as we can. It’s
              fabulous that they want to play.</p>
              <p>“Of course he wants to play, you know what he’s like. He’s such
              a great athlete but he ran his socks off on Tuesday. I’ve got Wednesday
              night at Wigan and Saturday against Arsenal to think about. So there
              was no problem.</p>
              <p>“Wednesday will be a hard game. I’ll freshen it up again. We’ll
              make two or three changes. I need to do that because I’ve a big squad
              and I need to keep them playing.”</p>
              <p>The Portugal star had scored United’s opener.</p>
              <p>But his tantrum reignited talk of the 26-goal ace moving from Old Trafford this summer.</p>
              <p>His protest is sure to interest long-term suitors Real Madrid, who are mulling over another bid this summer, says <em>The Sun</em>.</p>

              <p>Ronaldo is just upset that he was taken out as he is fighting for the top scorer award...

              <p>He is just selfish...football is not about individual, it's about a team. He can score 4 goals in a game but their next game is 3 days away. He may lost his form if he is too tired. This kid really can't think...and show tantrum in front of millions of viewer show his maturity.</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Parker calls on Man Utd winger Ronaldo to apologise</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p>Former Manchester United defender Paul Parker has called on Cristiano Ronaldo to make an apology for his ugly strop on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Parker told the <em>Telegraph</em>: "Ronaldo's reaction to being
              substituted was disrespectful first and foremost to the person who
              handed him the tracksuit top, but it was also disrespectful to the
              manager and the guys he plays with.</p>
              <p>"For all his personal ambition and desire to win Golden Boots
              and other awards, Ronaldo cannot achieve anything without the 10 guys
              who play alongside him on the pitch. Some people have suggested that,
              because he is so important to the team, Sir Alex has to handle Ronaldo
              like he handled Cantona.</p>
              <p>"Eric got away with things with the manager. We would all have
              to wear a tie with our club suits, but Eric never did and it was never
              mentioned. Eric didn't play to the cameras, though, and he would never
              have reacted like Ronaldo did on Sunday. He had too much respect for
              the manager and his team-mates.</p>
              <p>"We all accepted Eric's relationship with the manager because
              he respected us. If we arranged a night out at the Dog and Duck, then
              Eric would be there with us.</p>
              <p>"Ronaldo? I'm not too sure. How you are seen by your team-mates
              is crucial, but they won't be happy with what he did. He has to
              remember that you are only as good as the guys you play with. I'm
              certain Sir Alex will deal with it, but Ronaldo needs to apologise to
              the manager and his team-mates."</p>

              Yes,CR was not showing respect to the guy who had the tracksuit.
              
              I feel that no matter how successful/rich you are,you should still be humble and respect other people even the kit man,the hotdog seller or even the toilet cleaner at Old Trafford

              <p>I feel it's blown out of proportion already only b'cos he is Ronaldo... The Press makes too much out of it... This has happen with Rooney before too but not many notice it... Cos he has no transfer deals hanging in the media going to Spain or somewhere else... It has happened to much more older and experienced players as well like when Grant took Ballack out or Hiddink taking out Lampard against Barce in the first leg... There are also many times senior players from smaller clubs reacting this way... Although its not right but It's nothing new...</p>
              <p>Remember Gallas behaviour towards Wenger and the whole Arsenal squad. Carvalho with Jose... were they and better? Carvalho launched a withering attack on Jose in the Press after being left out of the squad when Mourinho opted for Terry and Gallas as his centre-back pairing... Jose replied with "Carvalho seems to have problems understanding things, maybe he should have an IQ test"</p>
              <p>We have also seen this kind of things happening at international level... Rvn was unhappy with Van Basten for taking him out and put Huntelaar on and later quit the Dutch team and refused to play under him for a period of time...</p>
              <p>I belief Fergie will know how to deal with this type of things... Leave him time alone to realised his mistakes and if he does, very good... He will have learnt something and come back a better player and more determine to do well or if he doesn't (Like Keane), and continue to create trouble, he can get rid of him when the time comes... Sometimes not doing anything is better than an immediate response...</p>
              <p>Nothing much to it really, Fergie have enough experienced to handle this things well... Which ever way we look at it, the club can't lose... either the player repent or the club gets lots of money...</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="FONT-SIZE: 1.05em; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.05em">SENIOR Manchester United players have turned on Cristiano Ronaldo and told him to stop acting like a PLONKER.  </h2>
              <p class="article">A number of them were angry with the Portuguese star’s lack of respect for boss Alex Ferguson when he was substituted in Sunday’s Manchester derby.  </p>
              <p class="article">A club source said: “A number were unhappy about Ronaldo’s behaviour and told him so.  “A lot of these players have grown up with Alex Ferguson as their manager and do not like seeing anyone show him disrespect.” Portugal winger Ronaldo, 24, threw a tracksuit top to the floor and mouthed an expletive as he sat in the dug-out.  </p>
              <p class="article">But when he got into the changing rooms he was immediately told by some of the players not to act up like that with the boss and to calm it down.  </p>
              <p class="article">Ronaldo tried to plead his case but, in the end, accepted he was in the wrong. He left the ground within 15 minutes — more in embarrassment at his actions than in anger.  </p>
              <p class="article">Ferguson has not confronted Ronaldo about the incident and has preferred to let him stew. The boss now has to decide whether Ronaldo will be in the right frame of mind to play against Wigan at the JJB tonight.  </p>
              <p class="article">United need just four points to clinch the Premier League title. But his show of petulance has once again sparked rumours both in Spain and Portugal of him leaving for Real Madrid.  </p>
              <p class="article">United are growing tired at Real’s posturing and particularly that of prospective president Florentine Perez. He says he is willing to offer United £80million for Ronaldo and will tempt the player with a five-year deal worth £120m.</p>

              <p>Yes, CR needs to apologize to the guy who handed him the tracksuit..  this kind of "BIG F*CK" attitude, total disrespect to someone who's kind enough to hold a tracksuit for him.</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Man Utd star Ronaldo has £240,000-a-week Real Madrid contract offer</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p>Manchester United wing ace Cristiano Ronaldo has been tabled a Real Madrid contract offer worth a massive £240,000-a-week.</p>
              <p><em>El Pais</em> says the total value of the deal would be in excess
              of 100m euros (£89m) when taking into account a big cut for Ronaldo's
              agent Jorge Mendes. The former Sporting Lisbon player could expect to
              pick up £12.5m a year - a whopping £240,000 a week.</p>
              <p>The alleged contract states that United would have to accept a
              bid of £71.5m after July 1, provided that neither side divulges details
              before May 31. Whether apparent press leaks such as this scupper the
              deal remain to be seen.</p>
              <p>The new Madrid president would have to accept the deal, too, and this is where <em>El Pais</em> sees a stumbling block to the agreement.</p>
              <p>Florentino Perez, the man who ushered in the era of the
              Galacticos earlier in the decade, is expected to win elections on June
              14 and return to the post he walked away from just over three years
              ago.</p>
              <p>He is understood to be keen on Ronaldo but, despite sensational
              claims to the contrary, it is unlikely he could sanction a deal for
              both the United star and AC Milan playmaker Kaka.</p>
              <p>Kaka is seen as a cheaper option who would free up cash for other targets, leaving Perez with a dilemma.</p>
              <p>United have consistently said there is no secret deal in place
              and insist Ronaldo will go nowhere. The player has even brushed off
              reports in recent weeks.</p>
              <p>But <em>El Pais</em> repeat claims that he only agreed to stay
              at Old Trafford last summer on the understanding that it would be his
              last season in England.</p>
              <p>United's No 7 has already taken a patent on 'CR9', leading to speculation he will wear a new number at the Bernabeu.</p>
              <p>Madrid legend Raul wears Ronaldo's current number.</p>
