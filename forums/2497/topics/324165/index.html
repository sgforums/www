              <p class="ss-text-bold">Ronaldinho is due to hold talks with Barcelona and Milan on Monday in a bid to finalise his move to the Serie A side.</p>
              <p>The Brazilian star has been told he is surplus to requirements at Camp Nou following a dip in form last season and the recent appointment of Pep Guardiola as the club's new manager.</p>
              <p>Manchester City have a long-standing interest in bringing Ronaldinho to the Premier League, but now look set to miss out on the World Cup winner.</p>
              <p>Milan's Spanish consultant Ernesto Bronzetti has spoken to the talented playmaker, and claims Ronaldinho has given verbal assurances that Carlo Ancelotti's side is his preferred destination.</p>
              <h4>Meeting</h4>
              <p>Ronaldinho, accompanied by his brother and agent, Roberto de Assis, is reported to be due to fly from Brazil to Barcelona for a meeting with Barca technical director Txiki Begiristain and Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani.</p>
              <p>Bronzetti told <em>Gazzetta dello Sport</em>: "I spoke with Ronaldinho as he was leaving Porto Alegre for Barcelona and he told me I want to play for you'."</p>
              <p>The consultant also claimed that the Italian side will release Ronaldinho for Brazil's attempt to win their first Olympic gold in China this summer.</p>
              <p>He added: "I believe that Galliani has already said yes to him</p>

              <p><strong>According to <em>The Sun</em>, the Blues are lining up an eleventh-hour â‚¤18million bid for the two-time FIFA World Player of the Year with the hope of derailing his imminent move to Milan.</strong><br><br>It is the second time in as many days that an English club have stumped up big money for the 28-year-old, with Manchester City reportedly emailing a â‚¤22million offer to Barca on Sunday evening.<br><br>The Citizens have been keen on Dinho for several months and have held extensive talks with his agent, Roberto de Assis; however, it appears the Brazilian playmaker will reject an Eastlands move in favour of a more glamorous destination.<br><br>City had hoped to exploit a reported stall in negotiations with the <em>Rossoneri</em>, and it seems Chelsea will attempt to do the same – and although their bid is lower than their Premier League rivals’, several factors point in their favour.<br><br>Luiz Felipe Scolari’s presence at Stamford Bridge could well lure Ronaldinho to west London, not to mention the promise of Champions League football and the prospect of linking up with fellow Barca-leaver Deco.<br><br>Nonetheless, it would take a near-miracle for Scolari to land the <em>Seleccao</em> superstar at this point, given he has one foot in the door at San Siro. But if anyone could change Gaucho’s mind at this late stage, it would surely be the man who coached him to glory in the 2002 World Cup.</p>

              <h1>City fly in as race for Ronaldinho gets hotter: Barca want Brazilian star to join the Blues</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/07/14/article-1034971-01F2C5D700000578-51_468x552.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="552"></p>
              <p>Manchester City officials flew into Barcelona last night with hopes
              raised and chequebook open - refusing to accept defeat in their bold
              attempt to capture Ronaldinho's signature and the completion of the
              biggest transfer coup in their history.</p>
              <p>Chairman Thaksin
              Shinawatra's chief negotiator Pairoj Piempongsant led a delegation for
              meetings with Barcelona president Joan Laporta and for fresh talks with
              the Brazilian star himself.</p>
              <p>However, AC Milan responded by increasing their offer to £15million yesterday and had their own talks with Barcelona.</p>
              <p>Ronaldinho's brother and agent Roberto de Assis emerged from a meeting
              with Milan chief executive Adriano Galliani to say: 'It couldn't have
              gone better. Whether a deal will be done tonight though, we'll have to
              see.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="relatedItemsTopBorder"> 
              <p>Yet City's £22m offer - exclusively revealed in Sportsmail - has
              been accepted by the Spaniards and City's wage offer is more than
              double the Italian one. Only the lure of Milan's status is keeping them
              in the hunt with the player still preferring the San Siro.</p>
              <p>After
              spending £65m this summer, Laporta is under pressure to accept the City
              offer and has asked Ronaldinho, 28, to take two or three days to
              consider it - telling the Brazilian it would be better for him and
              Barcelona if he chose Manchester.</p>
              <p>Laporta confirmed last night:
              'Ronaldinho and his agent have two interesting proposals and they are
              leaning more towards the one from Manchester City. We hope to have this
              resolved by the weekend.'</p>
              <p>And Spanish radio reported: 'A deal
              for Manchester City could be completed in days. Milan must act quickly
              if they are still serious.'</p>
              <p>Piempongsant has had four meetings
              with De Assis, who has also met Thaksin in Thailand. City, who open
              their season against Eb/Stremur, of the Faroes, on Thursday, are saying
              nothing until the contract has been signed but have put their
              commercial department on alert for the explosion of interest the
              player's arrival would ignite.</p>
              <p>A four-year deal is expected with wages of around £200,000 a week, partly supported by sponsors.</p>
              <p>A
              City source said: 'If this happens, can anyone question the ambition of
              the owner now. First Mark Hughes, then Jo and now the very serious
              prospect of Ronaldinho.'</p>
              <p>Thaksin told Sportsmail last month: 'He
              is a great player. Whatever your club, you would want to see this
              player in England. I am hearing good things about his hunger. The magic
              is still in his boots. But you need a player who is about more than
              winning the match and Ronaldinho can achieve so much more for the club.'</p>
              <p>Ronaldinho returned to Spain last night after an intensive fitness
              campaign left him looking trim. He will play in the Beijing Olympics as
              an over-aged player - a stumbling block for Milan - and did not show
              for the first day of Barcelona's pre-season yesterday.</p>
              <p>Barcelona
              believe that Alexander Hleb will join them by the weekend for £15m from
              Arsenal and may yet return for Emmanuel Adebayor.</p>
