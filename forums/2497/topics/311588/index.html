              <h2><img src="http://goal.com/images/26025_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="219"></h2>
              <h2>Arsenal ace Emmanuel Adebayor has recently cut his braids and many
              have jokingly speculated it has caused the player to lose his
              goal-scoring touch, a claim he vehemently denies...</h2>
              <p>The Togolese striker has not scored in the league since cutting his
              braids, with his record prior to doing so standing at an exceptional 19
              goals in 24 games.<br><br>Of those, Arsenal lost just one, while drawing four and winning the other 18 — they were top of the table.<br><br>Since
              the dreaded snip, Arsenal have drawn four Premier League games on the
              bounce — all games they, on paper, were expected to win — and have
              since surrendered their five-point lead at the top of the table and,
              barring a miracle from relegation strugglers Bolton on Wednesday, will
              trail new leaders Manchester United by three points.<br><br>Of course,
              there are far more logical reasons for Arsenal's slump in form: the
              distraction of the Champions League, the demoralising and somewhat
              humiliating exits from the Carling and FA Cup, the demand in general of
              playing so many competitions at once, and of course the loss of striker
              Eduardo Da Silva to a horrific broken leg, just as the Brasilian-born
              Croatia international was looking to play a key role for Arsene
              Wenger's men.</p>
              <p>However, it has been deemed far more amusing to blame the barber on
              this occasion, with Adebayor now having to come out and explain exactly
              why he gave his dreads the drop, whilst maintaining they had nothing to
              do with his lack of goals.<br><br>“They were getting on my nerves. I could only wash them once every three weeks,” he said.<br><br>“I
              don’t feel I have lost form at all. If you watch our matches closely,
              you will see that, even when I don’t score the goals, my contribution
              to the team is 100 per cent.<br><br>“The most important thing is the team should win."<br><br>Which
              they're not — a fact becoming increasingly worrying for many Gunners
              fans, as a potential dream season is now slipping away from Arsene
              Wenger's inexperienced side. This will only serve to anger many
              faithful fans who laughed off cynics predicting just this: that
              Arsenal's inexperienced side wouldn't last the course of the season.<br><br>Former Arsenal player Nigel Winterburn has chimed in on the debate, claiming many footballers have dubious superstitions.</p>
              <p>He himself, like Adebayor, is not one of them, and believes the
              imposing forward will have to rediscover his form in front of goal if
              Arsenal are to keep pace with Manchester United and now Chelsea, who,
              though in third place, arguably have momentum on the Gunners.<br><br>“A lot of players have superstitions or use psychology in their game," said Winterburn.<br><br>“I
              never believed in anything like that but I remember David O’Leary
              always used to put a ring in his pocket before the warm-up. I’m sure
              the fans would like to think Adebayor’s dip in form was down to his
              hair. But, for me, it’s all down to ability.<br><br>“He is one of a number of key players who are perhaps five per cent off their best at the moment. <br><br>“To win the title you need all 11 players at their maximum.<br><br>“Manchester
              United look to Cristiano Ronaldo for inspiration, Chelsea have Frank
              Lampard. Arsenal need Cesc Fabregas and Adebayor to raise their game
              but recently that hasn’t quite been the case. <br><br>“United and
              Chelsea might have the momentum, yet I’m certain Arsenal are still in
              the title race and wouldn’t be surprised if it goes down to the wire.”</p>
