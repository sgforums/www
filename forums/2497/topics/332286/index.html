              <p>Manchester City have revealed their search for top talent to Eastlands
              in the January transfer window is already well under way.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>City are now one of the heavyweights in the football transfer
              market following the arrival of billionaire new owners, the Abu Dhabi
              United Group, in August.</p>
              <p>Backed by new found riches, boss Mark Hughes signed Robinho in
              a British record deal from Real Madrid on deadline day of the summer
              transfer window, while he also bid for Stuttgart striker Mario Gomez
              and Valencia star David Villa.</p>
              <p>And Hughes' assistant manager Mark Bowen has now revealed that
              City, who have also been linked with Bayern Munich forward Lukas
              Podolski, already have their 'private detective' scouts working abroad
              in preparation for when the transfer window reopens in 2009.</p>
              <p>"We have people out there looking at names already, we will be
              travelling Europe over the next few months," Bowen told City's official
              website.</p>
              <p>"We also have the chance, because we know what the budget is,
              to target players at the very top so if you think you can get them
              maybe they will come."</p>
              <p>Bowen, though, insists Hughes is determined to maintain harmony at City and is eager to secure a strong dressing room spirit.</p>
              <p>"You can also do a lot of background work, a lot of our scouts
              might almost be like private detectives to see if a target might settle
              in with us," Bowen added.</p>
              <p>"Are they likely to embrace what we do, not just on the pitch but on the training ground as well?</p>
              <p>"The gaffer puts a lot of emphasis on training and if you are
              asking players to perform at the highest level of intensity, then
              bringing people in who just want to stand around at training counting
              the hours to Saturday might upset the balance as well.</p>
              <p>"That homework has to be done. Possibly the hardest job will
              be careful selection of the players we bring in, but also moulding them
              into a team. We have to make sure that we have a team.</p>
              <p>"You can't just point at the best players in the world, it does
              not work that way. You have to man-manage them and motivate them, you
              have to carefully select who you bring in and who they will work
              around."</p>
