              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Chelsea may not have a manager but they have tabled a £20million bid for Bayern Munich midfield star Franck Ribery. Ribery is a key man in the France squad at the Euro 2008 finals, so there will be no quick conclusion to Chelsea's interest. But the approach to Bayern emphasises that the Blues' hierarchy want to improve their squad - despite not having a boss in place.</strong></p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Just before dismissing Avram Grant the club announced the recruitment of £16.5m Jose Bosingwa from Porto to fill Chelsea's problem right-back slot. Now the Blues want to add Ribery's skill and invention to midfield. He can operate in a central role or on the flank. Ribery's arrival will place a huge question mark over the future of his international team-mate Florent Malouda, who completed a £13m move to Stamford Bridge from Lyon last summer but has failed to impress.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">It has not gone unnoticed at the club that while Malouda has struggled in Chelsea blue he has produced some impressive performances at international level. Ribery only joined Bayern from Marseille 12 months ago. And, for all their wealth, the Blues may not find it so easy to prise Ribery away from the German Champions who beat off opposition from Spanish giants Real Madrid to land his signature.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Bayern paid £17.5m for Ribery and a further £3m after qualifying for the Champions League.</p>

              <h1>Chelsea told: If you want Ribery, he'll cost you £31m</h1>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/06/09/article-0-00B582BF00000578-432_468x534.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="534"></p>
              <p>Roman Abramovich has been told he will have to pay a British record transfer fee to prise Franck Ribery from Bayern Munich.</p>
              <p>Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon has already made contact with Bayern about the<br>midfielder’s proposed move to Stamford Bridge but a decision will not be made until the end of Euro 2008.</p>
              <p>Ribery has emerged as one of Chelsea’s top three transfer targets this summer - AC<br>Milan midfielder Kaka and Liverpool striker Fernando Torres are the others - but<br>Chelsea will have to pay in excess of £31million to sign the France midfielder.</p>
              <p>On the managerial front, Luiz Felipe Scolari is now their first
              choice, and even though negotiations with Portugal’s coach have not
              been concluded the club are still ready to sign more big names.</p>
              <p>Chelsea
              and Portugal defender Paulo Ferreira claimed Scolari would be a great
              success. Ferreira said: "He has the experience. He has been an
              international manager for six or seven years but before that he was at
              a lot of clubs, so we know he can do it. I would like him."</p>
              <p>Bayern Munich’s new coach Jurgen Klinsmann clearly wants to keep Ribery, voted<br>German football’s Player of the Year, at the Bundesliga champions but the midfielder is well aware of Chelsea’s interest.</p>
              <p>Despite
              Bayern’s initial resistance, Chelsea are prepared to pay more than the
              £30.8m they spent on Andriy Shevchenko two years ago.</p>
              <p>Ribery, who
              scored in France’s 1-0 victory over England in a friendly in March,
              plays for his country against Romania tonight in their first group game
              of the tournament.</p>
              <p>He moved to Bayern for £16m last summer on the back of a successful season with<br>Marseille - he was voted Player of the Year in France in 2007 - and he arrives at Euro<br>2008 in top form.</p>
              <p>Kenyon
              is also in negotiations with Milan about former world player of the
              year Kaka, and Chelsea have been encouraged by Liverpool not rejecting
              out of hand their initial<br>approach for Torres.</p>
              <p>Although Kaka signed a contract at the San Siro earlier this year and claimed that he<br>wanted
              to be ‘immortalised’ in the same way as Paolo Maldini, Milan’s failure
              to qualify for the Champions League has altered his position.</p>
              <p>Milan are ready to sign Didier Drogba, and the Kaka deal could be linked to that.<br>Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani said: "Chelsea have authorised us  to begin<br>negotiations with Drogba. Unfortunately, Chelsea will not sell Shevchenko."</p>
              <p>The absence of injured talisman Drogba was felt by the Ivory Coast yesterday when<br>they were surprisingly held to a 0-0 draw in a World Cup qualifier in Madagascar.</p>
              <p>The Chelsea striker missed a  second successive match for his country as a depleted<br>Ivorian side, also missing Drogba’s clubmate Salomon Kalou, could only pick up a<br>point against the Indian Ocean island, whom they were expected to beat convincingly.</p>

              <h1>Ribery Cools Chelsea Interest</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/29282_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="250"></p>
              <h2>Franck Ribery has insisted that he is perfectly happy at Bayern
              Munich in the face of reports that Chelsea are willing to break the
              bank if that's what it takes to bring him to the Premiership.</h2>
              <p>Ribery, 25, was nothing short of magnificent in his first season for
              Bayern, as he was one of the core reasons for them clinching a league
              and Cup double, and was thus voted their ‘Player of the Year’.<br><br>While
              he did not comment directly on the rumours that Chelsea owner Roman
              Abramovich is prepared to part with £31 million, Ribery was adamant
              that he has no intent on leaving Munich in the summer.<br><br>"I signed
              a four-year contract when I arrived at Bayern a year ago and there is a
              good chance I will fulfil it," said the French star.<br><br>"I have so much fun at this club - it is like Marseille multiplied by 10."</p>
