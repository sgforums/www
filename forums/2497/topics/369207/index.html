              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">You only need to look at Steven Gerrard’s body language. </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">'s players are not happy about the absence of their quarterback.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">They used to call them playmakers when I was trying to be like the old-fashioned No 10, the player who excelled with the ball and ran the game at his pace. </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">France</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> had Michel Platini, </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Holland</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> had </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Johan Cruyff</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">, </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">England</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> had Glenn Hoddle.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Xabi Alonso is a deep-lying modern-day version who plays in the pocket and would pass the ball forwards, rarely sideways. He is a player capable of shifting the play, changing the point of attack. If Gerrard or Fernando Torres gambled on a run, they knew the ball would soon arrive.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Xabi has two great feet. When I played against him, you didn’t know which way he would go, left or right, and the game comes easily to him. Alonso had an appreciation of the weight of a pass; either a 50-yard ‘</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Hollywood</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> delivery’ inside a full back... or a 10-yard straight ping in to feet... or into space to run on to. Anyone can hit safety-first balls but it was his key passes that made him stand out. Now he will be producing those passes for Real Madrid.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 12pt;    ">Javier Mascherano is a strong holding midfielder but lining up alongside Lucas the pair are too similar. Each may require two or three touches when Alonso needed one pass. This is stating the obvious but they lacked creativity at Tottenham. Their passing wasn’t crisp and, consequently, Gerrard didn’t get enough of the ball at the point of their midfield three. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 12pt;    ">
              </span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Compare his performance at Spurs to that of Cesc Fabregas at Everton, where he dominated the game. This is not how </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> are going to win games.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Teams will sit in deep and demand they create an opening. Stoke are at Anfield tomorrow and they are disciplined and organised. It may be that Gerrard has to drop back into a deeper role, with Dirk Kuyt restored to the front line.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Alberto Aquilani, their £20million signing from Roma, may well be a very good purchase. We’ll see. What I know is that he’s out for six weeks and, by then, </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> may well have a lot of ground to recover in the title race.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Why did they sell Alonso? The manager fell out of love with him and the damage was done to their relationship last season. Rafa Benitez thought Gareth Barry was a better player and was prepared to sell Alonso for £18m. Having failed to sign Barry from Aston Villa, he overlooked Alonso for his first line-up of the season. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 12pt;    ">Instead, against </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 12pt;    ">Sunderland</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 12pt;    "> he picked Damien Plessis, who went on to make only two further appearances all season. Real </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 12pt;    ">Madrid</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 12pt;    "> had few such doubts.</span></p>

              <h1>Reds: No Real deal done for Xabi</h1>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><span id="intelliTXT">Liverpool
              have dismissed claims they have agreed a fee with Real Madrid for Xabi
              Alonso and denied he is set to leave the club's Far East tour.</span></p>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/09/07/330/Xabi-Alonso_2335567.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Speculation in recent days
              has suggested Alonso's move to Real is as good as done but those fears
              were allayed when the 28-year-old trained with his team-mates at
              Singapore's national stadium on Thursday.</p>
              <p>The club insist Alonso did not figure in Wednesday's 1-1 draw
              with Thailand in Bangkok purely because of an ankle injury and Rafa
              Benitez was calm over the rumours.</p>
              <p>He Benitez said: "Alonso is here and he will enjoy the weather and the fans and the journalists.</p>
              <p>"He is ready and can play."</p>
              <p>A Liverpool spokesman added: "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Xabi is with us in Singapore, and
              will train with the rest of the squad. He was injured ahead of the
              Thailand game, people can say what they like about that. </span></p>
              <p>"And there has been no deal agreed with anyone for his transfer to anyone."</p>
              <p>Alonso has made his desire to leave clear, and had hoped not to
              have to fly to Vienna on Sunday to meet up with the Liverpool squad
              ahead of the flight to the Far East.</p>
              <p>But Alonso did make the trip, and sources at Liverpool expect
              him to face Singapore on Sunday before the squad fly back to the UK the
              following day.</p>
              <p>Madrid sporting director Miguel Pardeza backed up Liverpool's
              claim that nothing is imminent regarding Alonso, but he still hopes the
              Spanish giants will be able to sign the midfielder - and Alvaro
              Arbeloa.</p>
              <p>With regards Alonso, Pardeza said: "It's at a standstill. From
              day one, Liverpool have asked for more than Madrid are ready to pay and
              it's very difficult to understand. But I've not lost hope that things
              can be resolved."</p>
              <p>Pardeza, who confirmed Madrid have been looking for an
              alternative to Alonso but with little success, also admitted a lack of
              progress in their chase of defender Arbeloa.</p>
              <p>"With Arbeloa there was an option which, at the moment, has
              come to nothing. Liverpool haven't had much intention of letting him
              go, even though he has one year left on his contract, and we are still
              in this situation," Pardeza told Spanish newspaper Publico.</p>
              <p>"There is more than a month of the transfer market left and
              this could change. I'm not going to deny that we'd like to have
              Arbeloa."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile Benitez has also moved to dismiss speculation that Javier Mascherano also wants out of Anfield.</p>
              <p>His agent, Walter Tamer, was quoted on Wednesday as saying the
              Argentine midfielder was tired of life in England, and favoured a move
              to Barcelona.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">However, Benitez said: "In the press these days there are too
              many websites, too many newspapers, radio, television. You have to have
              stories every day so sometimes you repeat something from 15 days ago. </span></p>
              <p>"It's much the same situation, he knows our ideas. He's been working very hard and he's a very important player for us."</p>
