            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">Chelsea's Ukrainian striker Andriy Shevchenko has revealed how he would like to become part of the growing football revolution in America at some stage of his career.<br><br>Shevchenko, who joined the Premiership club for Â£30million last summer, has failed to reproduce the kind of form which prompted Chelsea to pay AC Milan a record fee.<br><br>But the 30-year-old, who missed Chelsea's FA Cup final victory over Manchester United on Saturday because of a groin injury, admits to having an ambition to play in the US.<br><br>Real Madrid's David Beckham is about to cross the Atlantic to join Los Angeles Galaxy and Shevchenko said: 'I'd like to play there, actually.<br><br>'Soccer is growing in the US and I'd like to be a part of that. I played there last summer against the MLS All-Stars and I saw myself that it's definitely improving.'<br><br>Shevchenko maintains that playing out of position for Chelsea did not help his cause during a difficult opening season at Stamford Bridge but he insists he was happy to make the sacrifice for the benefit of the team.<br><br>'It wasn't a great season but it hasn't been the worst,' Shevchenko told the website.<br><br>'People always expect a lot from me. I wasn't well in the first four months, partly because of fatigue from the World Cup and partly because of the injury I was carrying. But then I had a good stretch in the middle of the season.<br><br>'In the end, despite everything, I ended up with 14 goals and 11 or 12 assists, and that's not a bad season.<br><br>'I know people wanted 30 goals a season, but the reality is that it can't happen every season. With all the problems I had, I don't think I did that badly.<br><br>'I didn't play in my position this year. I wasn't the key of the attack. I was playing further behind, away from goal, which is different from how I played at Milan and maybe that's why Didier Drogba scored so many goals this year.<br><br>'We made a good partnership with me setting him up some of the time. At Milan I played in my natural role. Here I had to adapt to be something else and I did it so I could help the team. The main priority for me is feeling well next season.'<br><br>Meanwhile, captain John Terry has dismissed suggestions that he was ready to hand in a transfer request as 'ludicrous' and insists he wants to sort out his Chelsea future as soon as possible.<br><br>Terry's position at the club came under increasing speculation in the build-up to the first FA Cup final at the new Wembley, which Chelsea won 1-0 thanks to Drogba's 33rd goal of the season five minutes from the end of extra time.<br><br>Terry was understood to have rejected Chelsea's latest offer and, according to reports, was on the verge of handing in a transfer request.<br><br>But Terry declared: 'That's ludicrous. I would never do that. Now the season is over for Chelsea, I'd like to think things are going to get sorted out and I'm hopeful we will be in talks.<br><br>'I didn't want to be in talks in the build-up to the FA Cup final and the build-up to what could have been us possibly retaining the Premiership.<br><br>'I told Chelsea to wait and we would go again in the summer. It was not right to go into important games with things on your mind and being unhappy.<br><br>'Hopefully it will be resolved as soon as possible really.'</span></div>
