              <p><strong>Lee Bowyer was forced to apologise after reacting to crowd taunts with a disgusting foul mouthed blast at a grandmother.</strong></p>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/birmingham-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Birmingham</span></a> midfielder was substituted in the 68th minute of <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/west-bromwich-albion.html"><span style="color: #003580;">West Bromwich's </span></a>3-1 win - having been booked for a lunging tackle on Gabriel Tamas. He responded to jeers from fans by lashing out at Albion season ticket-holder Sandra Cox.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Mrs Cox, who was sitting behind the dug-out in the family enclosure with seven-year-old grandson Luke, told <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span>: 'Bowyer called me a f****** ****. It was appalling, especially with my grandson sitting next to me. He's only seven.</p>
              </div>
              <p>'Everybody was having a go because of the tackle. Then he came over and was effing and blinding at everybody. It's terrible to hear such bad language.</p>

              <p><strong>'We sit there so Luke doesn't have to hear it, but it's even worse because you hear all the players. I reported it to the nearest steward straight away.'</strong></p>
              <p>Bowyer apologised immediately. He could then be seen asking fans to calm down before taking his seat to watch the rest of the match.</p>
              <p>Birmingham boss Alex McLeish, who admitted he took Bowyer off to avoid him getting a second yellow card, said: 'I could see Lee getting mouthfuls from angry people sitting in the stand and the only thing I saw him do was put his hands up telling people to calm down.</p>
              <p>'Footballers occasionally say things they might regret in the heat of the moment but that's not an admission of guilt on behalf of Lee because I just don't know what happened.'</p>
              <p>A West Bromwich spokesman said: 'The lady complained straight away, saying she had been verbally abused, but the clubs are also aware that Lee Bowyer made a complete and profusive apology. </p>
              <p>'That is the end of the matter as far as West Brom are concerned.'</p>
