              <div class="ds-firstpara"><strong>SPORTS injury specialists
              today warned they are seeing growing numbers of young players with
              injuries linked to "blades" football boots.</strong></div>
              <div class="ds-firstpara"><br></div>
              <p>The boots have become hugely popular in recent years after being worn by a number of top players, such as David Beckham, below.<br><br>However, concerns about a heightened risk of injury have led specialists to warn players to think twice before buying them.<br><br>Some
              youth sides in the city are also following the example of Manchester
              United manager Alex Ferguson and banning players from wearing them.<br><br>Specialists
              fear that players can suffer more severe injuries wearing blades
              because they grip the turf more firmly than traditional studs.<br><br>Their
              elongated shape may mean that when a player's body twists, under the
              force of a tackle or a fall, their leg does not turn properly with them.<br><br>There are also concerns that their sharper shape can inflict worse injuries on opposition players than rounded studs.<br><br>Carol
              Black, an Edinburgh podiatrist who works with the Scottish Youth
              Football Association's development squads, said she was concerned about
              young players wearing blades.<br><br>"It's a case of getting past the
              fact that David Beckham wears them," said the specialist, who is based
              at the Blackhall Chiropody and Podiatry Clinic.<br><br>"In my job,
              whether it's coincidence or not, the majority of young footballers
              whose feet I treat wear blades. Is that all that's available? And the
              number of knees I've seen that have to be stitched because of tackles
              involving metal-tipped blades."<br><br>The players at both Hibs and
              Hearts do not tend to wear blades in either matches or training,
              although neither club is thought to have banned them.<br><br>Stewart
              Laird, who coaches young players at Fernieside FC, believes his blades
              may have exacerbated a serious injury he suffers. <br><br>As a result, he now advises his young charges against buying them.<br><br>He said: "I made a tackle, placed my foot down, and my knee gave way. <br><br>"I have never felt pain like it.<br><br>"I was nine months out after damaging the cruciate in my knee. <br><br>"I've not been able to kick with my right foot since, but thankfully I'm both-footed.<br><br>"I
              tell my players at Fernieside not to wear blades. I'm not an expert,
              you just need to go into sporting books, and you are advised not to
              wear them."<br><br>Leith Athletic are among the other youth sides to have banned them.<br><br>Keir
              Blaikie, 17, was told his blades may have made his injury worse when he
              suffered an horrific double leg break playing for Hutchison in May.<br><br>Yet
              despite this, the Eyemouth High School pupil remains unconvinced. He
              said: "I'm not sure I'll wear my old boots again and I'm not sure,
              unless I found conclusive proof (of the effect of blades], that I'd
              think twice about buying another pair. <br><br>"As long as they're light and they feel ok, I don't mind."<br><br>Johnny
              Pearson, head of the sports science department at Stevenson College,
              said: "I know they were banned in the NFL in America because if you
              turn quickly wearing blades you are more vulnerable to injury than if
              you were wearing studs.<br><br>"It is worse on astroturf than grass because that has some give, but it's also more dangerous for other players.<br><br>"If
              you go into a bad tackle with the blades they would cause more damage
              than studs, although having said that studs can cause injury as well."</p>
