              <p>Agreed. But if Babel has a stinking attitude, he should be sold at an instant. Look at Quaresma. Touted as the next Ronaldo. Where is he now? Rotting on the bench of inter.</p>

              <p>Not really. He spent 11m pounds on him and Babel did really well in his first season. Reports seem to suggest that Babel just doesn't seem to have the 'right attitude'. Ngog has gotten ahead of him and Benitez was praising him for having the 'right attitude'.</p>

              <p>Attitude during training. Rafa was quoted recently that Ngog has a great attitude in training, willing to learn from everybody. And he seems to be hinting that Babel has a poor attitude. Dirk Kuyt has been shit all this season and he yet hardly goes with Babel. i really pity Babel and i would be sad if he was sold. This guy came with so much potential and when he's on the ball, i dare say he's the most dangerous player after Torres. But sometimes his touch is real shit and he lacks a footballing brain. Maybe all he needs is a run of games.</p>
              <p>Edit: He's just been left out of Liverpool's clash with Wolves. Benitez opted to go with youngsters like Darby, Spearing and Pacheco. Same with Voronin, Degen and Dossena. Seems like they are off. Maybe one last appearance on tues to put them on the shop window.</p>
              <p>And pls look out for Pacheco. He's gonna be the next big thing.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>The financial support is never enough if you are Rafa... Why do I say this? Cos he squander the money needlessly... Had he made better used of the money he got, then he won't need to keep complaining that he haven't got enough... He would have got all the players in place already. Just one player can make a lot of difference... But unfortunately, he have got it wrong too many times. </p>
              <p>Robbie Keane was a good example. I don't think he is a bad player, I guess he just couldn't get along with Rafa... Probably the same with Alonso too... Johnson is just another one... Not that he is a very poor player but he is just overpaid, for the transfer and even his salary... Imagine if you are Gerrard and played there all your live till now coming to 30 years old... You are not just seen as one of the best player at the club but in the world. And he goes out and get someone who is hardly a world class player and offer him a higher salary than you... How would you feel?</p>
              <p>There are just too many examples he lose good money for the club. Selling good and useful players like Bellamy, Crouch, Keane... Buying poor players at high fees... Dossena, Riera and even Aquilani... As good as some people claims he is, Its still a waste of such a big sum for someone who isn't fully fit and can't play for so long... The season is already over for Pool and he is only about to start... The money could have been better used to strengthen the squad for this season and go and get him with next season's budget if he really recovers or if he really like him that much...</p>
              <p>Like you have said yourself, before they came Pool can spend $20m on average per season... But the last 3 seasons they have spent like $160m or more. That's like more than $50m per season. Is that very little? Compare to United, they have to let Tevez go cos his owner wanted too high a fee and they won't match his salary at City... Then there was Benzema, they let it go too cos they couldn't afford the $35m Euros Lyon wanted... In the end, they settled for a free Owen which Rafa didn't want in the first place...</p>
              <p>Liverpool's current problems is down to Rafa... Like I said earlier you compare O'Neill at Villa... He have lesser money right? People go out and buy Dunne, he paid more for Dossena... O'Neill buy Young he buy Babel, O'Neill promote Milner, he promote Lucas. O'Neill brought Agbonlahor up from the youth, he bring N'Gog in. I don't think they are very bad players, it just that he doesn't bring the best out of them... And his match tactics, players selection and sub used... Even Pool fans are upset... That day I saw a disgruntled Dossena who keeps asking to go back to Italy starting on the left wing when he is more of a left back and fit Babel and Benayoun on the bench... I actually found it funny... But I can tell you, if i was a Pool fan, I wouldn't find it one bit funny at all... That is Rafa... good as he is but he have more minus than plus this season.</p>
