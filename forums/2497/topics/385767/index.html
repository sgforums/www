              <h1 class="titlestory">Prince Faisal returning to Liverpool as buyout talks revived</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p>George Gillett's 50 per cent stake in <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> could be sold to a Saudi prince.</p>
              <p>The <em>Daily Mail</em> says Prince Faisal bin Fahad bin Abdullah announced on television that he was flying to England to attend the Barclays <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> match against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Anfield on Boxing Day as a guest of Gillett.</p>
              <p>Sources in Saudi Arabia immediately insisted that the wealthy prince
              was serious in his intent to acquire the holding and that Gillett was
              now ready to sell. They also understood that Gillett’s partner Tom
              Hicks would no longer block the sale.</p>
              <p>This will be the second visit this season to Anfield of Prince Faisal, who watched the 6-1 hammering of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Hull City</span></abbr> in September.</p>
              <p>Christian Purslow, who was appointed managing director by
              Gillett and Hicks earlier this year, has been leading talks with a
              number of parties about a share issue.</p>
              <p>There has been particular interest from the Far East and there
              remains hope that a deal to raise at least £120m could be concluded in
              the new year.</p>

              <p><br>at least, it's better to have more $$ than no $$ rite?with this prince, he can push  liverpool to a higher level of spending and stabilise the ship, after that when he's done with the club, by then LFC's debt can be serviced by LFC's revenue...</p>

              <p>Actually, part of the loans are also from the purchased of players like Masch and Torres... The club originally had debts already, something like $45m... The 2 Americans bought them together with the debts.</p>
              <p>Of course the additional debts came from the new owners taking out loans for the purchase of the club. But this wasn't the only reason they took the loan... They took the loans for the purchased of new players as well like Masch, Babel, Pennant, Benayoun, Lucas, Leto and Torres... That year the 2 Americans came, Rafa bought 27 players in one season... Not to mention paying extra 27 players salaries...</p>
              <p>So to blame the 2 guys I feel is rather unfair, Its not that they didn't gave him money to buy... And again I say for every player he brings in, the club will need to pay the extra salaries for the extra head...   </p>

              <p>I find it particularly amusing that Liverpool fans are buying into the crap that the owners are at fault for the predicament they are in and selling to a rich  Arab will now svae Liverpool. </p>
              <p>The 'facht' is the amount Rafa has spent is on par, if not more than Man Utd. It is Rafa who's buying crap players and piling up his reserves without ever adding much quality to his first-team.</p>

              <p>How are the owners not at fault? They loaded hundreds of millions of debt onto the club. Originally every season, Rafa is given 20m to buy new players. But now, the 20m includes contract renewal and all that shit, effectively meaning that he has to sell before he can buy.</p>
              <p>The amount Rafa has spent is on par, if not more than Man Utd? Google up some statistics mate. Rafa might also have a big squad and hardly any of these youngsters make it to the first team. But u have to keep in my mind that they are sold to other clubs instead and this generates profits. To name a few: Guthrie, Anderson, Adam Hammil. You just need one out of five to succeed in becoming a professional to recoup your losses for these five players.</p>

              <p>Hundreds of millions? Its only 2 hundred. But first we have to see how these debts came about...</p>
              <p>Well, why i said we can't fault them is because they have given Rafa more money then people realise... He have got more than any other Pool manager ever received... Liverpool were bought by American owners, so is Aston Villa. So we take Villa as a more likely comparable.</p>
              <p>Villa's American owner Randy Lerner have given Martin O'Neill a lot lesser to purchased players during this period compare to Rafa... Liverpool were amongst the top clubs before Rafa took over, Villa on the other hand wasn't. They went from bad to worse before O'Neill took over, they were fighting relegation and ended the season on 16 position in the table of 20... These were all in 2006 only. </p>
              <p>Rafa on the other hand, had good support when the 2 Americans came... They immediately bought Mascherano for a then club record of $18m... And they follow that up with another new record of $20m for Torres. And if you add those I mentioned earlier, the Babel, Pennant, Benayoun, Lucas, Leto and of course Torres and Masch, all bought in year 2007, Its already close to $70m here... What about those undisclosed fees for the others? And all these in year 2007 only... Rafa follow that up with another $45m in 2008... </p>
              <p>And lets not forget how badly he has also squander in Keane as well and Johnson looks like another one... So how can anyone even think of blaming the 2 American owners is beyond me... Cos the $240m loan they owe, You can see its like almost half of it went into the purchased of players alone... and $45m was the original debt before they came...</p>
              <p>Now we look at O'Neill... with little fundings, he bought players that are useful. His selection of players and match tactics is the reason Villa is current above Pool... If you talk about who spent more, Villa will be way below Liverpool in the money league... Their most expensive player is maybe $12m i think in James Milner...</p>
              <p>Another good example we see is... Rafa spent $11m for Babel while O'Neill spent $8 on Ashley Young... They joint about around the same time. Today Young is probably worth 2 to 3 times his original value but Babel probably 2/3 of his now...</p>
              <p>And its true that there was a report that Rafa has spent more or almost level with United these last 5 years... And if we take into the account of players sold during this time, United also recoup more to Rafa's Pool...</p>

              <p><br>They indeed took a loan to buy the club... But look at the sum Rafa spent since they came to Liverpool... About $120m in 07 and 08... Where do you think those money came from?</p>
              <p>These 2 guys bought the club for less than $220m, $45m were debts from the previous owner they inherited... But now they owe the banks $240m? Obviously they can't be owing more then what they purchased the club for right unless... </p>
              <p>The way I see it is, They took a loan to purchased the club... But they also took extra to finance Rafa's $120m year 07 and 08 purchased... Cos if they can't even afford the club outright and took a loan to buy it, then where did Rafa's shopping spree came from?</p>
              <p>And I think we don't even need to talk about the new stadium yet... I believed the money for it isn't accounted for yet with the current loans... I think the current $240m debts is just for the purchased of the club and players... I guess there should be more to come if they intend to build the new stadium... Maybe to a tune of another $300m.</p>
