              <p><strong>Guus Hiddink has put himself in the frame to replace Rafa Benitez as </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool </strong></span></a><strong>manager but will first seek the approval of </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span></a><strong> owner Roman Abramovich.</strong></p>
              <p>The Dutchman, who was a huge success during a four-month spell at Chelsea last year, is set to leave his job as coach of Russia and has told friends he would relish the challenge at Anfield.</p>
              <p>Hiddink’s menacing presence in the wings came as Benitez suffered the devastating blow of losing three vital players to injury — Fernando Torres for six weeks, Steven Gerrard for a fortnight and Yossi Benayoun for a month.</p>
              <p>Benitez is likely to survive the season despite the humiliating FA Cup loss to Reading on Wednesday. The home defeat sparked fury among Liverpool fans, who flooded radio phone-ins and internet forums with demands that he be sacked.</p>
              <p>Hiddink, 63 and a veteran of three World Cups, is still to thrash out the terms of his departure from Russia but sources close to him have revealed he is desperate for a second opportunity in the Barclays Premier League. He will consult Abramovich, who has stopped funding his £6.25million-a-year salary as Russia coach, before making up his mind.</p>
              <p>Hiddink said: ‘I have to speak to the federation president before making any decision on my future, but it is true that I would like to coach in England again. After all the support I’ve received from Roman Abramovich I owe it to them to discuss anything with them first.’</p>
              <p>Just when Benitez thought things could not get worse, he was buffeted by a torrent of bad news on the injury front. Torres was found to have torn a cartilage in his right knee in the opening minutes on Wednesday, and Gerrard strained a hamstring and will miss the away games with <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/stoke-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Stoke</span></a> and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/wolverhampton-wanderers.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Wolves</span></a> and the Anfield clash with<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html"><span style="color: #003580;"> Tottenham </span></a>next Wednesday.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Spanish pain: Benitez sees Torres limp off on Tuesday and the striker has called for new players</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Torres can add </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/everton.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Everton</strong></span></a><strong>, </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Arsena</strong></span></a><strong>l and </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester City</strong></span></a><strong> to the catalogue of key Premier League fixtures he will have to sit out, and there was a further setback when it was revealed that Benayoun had cracked a rib.</strong></p>
              <p>Benitez’s reputation, so long defended on Merseyside, now seems irreparably damaged. Ronnie Whelan, a key member of Liverpool’s midfield in the 1980s, issued a withering condemnation.</p>
              <p>He said: ‘I think he should have gone a long time ago. The whole club is struggling — the owners, the club’s in debt, the players are not good enough, the manager’s not good enough. I don’t know where they go.’</p>
              <p>Torres also added to the pressure on the club’s owners by saying: ‘This season should have been the turning point for us, the chance to do something great. It is now the owners’ turn. They have to sign players, so that this does not happen again.</p>
              <p>‘If we want to compete with Manchester United and Chelsea, we need a much, much more complete squad,’ he says in an interview to be published in <span style="font-style: italic;">Four Four Two </span>magazine.</p>
              <p>‘We need more genuinely first-class players, and we also cannot let our best players go.’</p>

              <p>Liverpool should jump at this chance to sign Hiddink. Clearly rafa specialises in cup competitions and not the league in EPL, although he as won twice as league champions in La Liga with Valencia. after 5 seasons, rafa clearly is not the man to win the league title in EPL.</p>
              <p>Although the owners need to pay rafa compensation for replacing rafa, but its a small price to pay if Hiddink can win the league title in 2 or 3 seasons. I think that is what the fans at liverpool wants, more than CL I reckon. If Hiddink can win the CL, its a bonus, but the priority is the league title, no doubt.</p>

              <h1>Rafa Benitez looks a broken man... just like his ragged Liverpool team</h1>
              <h1> </h1>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/01/14/article-0-07D9F7DE000005DC-604_468x594.jpg" alt="Benitez dejection" width="468" height="594"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Ton of trouble: Benitez has brought in close to 100 players in his five-and-a-half years at Anfield</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1243316" rel="1243316|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1243316/Rafa-Benitez-looks-broken-man--just-like-ragged-Liverpool-team.html"></a> </p>
              <p><strong>The now infamous email Tom Hicks Jnr sent to a disgruntled Liverpool fan last week is starting to look like some kind of exit strategy as well as an indecent proposal. A win-win tactic that was going to ease his pain, whatever the response from the recipient.</strong></p>
              <p>The supporter reacted the way one might expect when receiving such a shameless invitation, outing the Anfield part-owner's son and so ensuring that he was quickly out of the club.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">But Hicks might just have seen the writing on the wall, might just have realised that things were only going to get worse rather than better. Reading in an FA Cup replay?</p>
              </div>
              <p>The days of nipping down The Sandford for a few pints were most definitely going to be numbered after his dad's team had lost to the visitors on Wednesday night.</p>
              <p>Rafa Benitez is not the same animal, however. He's as stubborn as a mule, a Texan like Hicks would no doubt say, and he has no intention of making it easy for his employers, and a good deal cheaper, by quitting.</p>
              <p>'I will fight until the end,' said the manager last week, even if the end appeared to be a good deal further away than it does now. But Benitez has the protection of a lucrative five-year contract and an unbreakable confidence in his own ability, drawn, as you might expect, from the success he has achieved in the past.</p>
              <p>He conquered the Spanish duopoly of Real Madrid and Barcelona when he guided Valencia to two La Liga titles. He guided Liverpool to Champions League glory in his first season at Anfield. Not to mention the UEFA Cup he won while in Spain, the FA Cup he won here and a second Champions League final appearance.</p>
              <p>It was only a year ago that his team were top of the Barclays Premier League and he probably reminds himself of that before he goes to bed each night.</p>
              <p>He does not think he's bought badly, even if a lack of quality in a squad he has spent more than £250million assembling is a principal reason why it has been such a disastrous season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/01/14/article-1243316-07DCD366000005DC-629_468x668.jpg" alt="How His Predecessors Fell" width="468" height="668"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"> </div>
              <div class="thinCenter"> </div>
              <div class="thinCenter"> </div>

              <p><strong>For all the good players he has recruited, and in Fernando Torres, Pepe Reina and Xabi Alonso he has bought some gems, he has signed up far too much rubbish.</strong></p>
              <p>And before he starts listing the money raised by the sale of certain players, the net spend is still somewhere approaching £120m and that is more than Manchester United's.</p>
              <p>If you include some of the kids who were sent straight to the academy, Benitez has brought in close to 100 players in the five-and-a-half years he has been on Merseyside. Almost 100 players, but not enough decent ones to cope now that Torres and Steven Gerrard, indeed Yossi Benayoun, are back in the treatment room.</p>
              <p>Things, as Hicks Jnr would seem to have anticipated, are only going to get worse when Champions League qualification now remains the only serious objective. Can they climb from seventh in the Barclays Premier League table, having already suffered seven defeats, and secure a place in the top four when the team is so lacking in confidence and the competition from teams like Manchester City, Tottenham and Aston Villa is so intense? At this moment the answer would appear to be no.</p>
              <p>In the absence of Torres and Gerrard more defeats are likely because look what's coming up next. First, it is Stoke away, then Tottenham at home and, after meetings with Wolves and Bolton, they then take on Everton, Arsenal and big-spending City.</p>
              <p>Alberto Aquilani? Against Reading he looked like a player with plenty of style but no substance. So what are Liverpool to do? Push the button now or soldier on in the knowledge that a desperate situation probably won't improve, and that, for all Benitez's strength of mind, the mindset of his team is all wrong? Even the fans who have been so remarkably loyal to their beloved Rafa are starting to turn.</p>
              <p>There is a solution in the form of Guus Hiddink. His romance with Russia is over and an opportunity to return to the Premier League is something he would take once he has cleared it with Roman Abramovich, and the fine job he did at Stamford Bridge would suggest that he is perfect for the role.</p>

              <p><strong>Not even the expense of firing Benitez and his staff should be too much of a consideration when you begin to weigh it up against the cost of missing every target they set themselves at the start of the season. Bringing in Hiddink now actually makes an awful lot of sense.</strong></p>
              <p>Yesterday, however, the message from the Anfield hierarchy remained much the same as it has been for the last three months.</p>
              <p>It was delivered with less confidence - they are hurting as much as everyone else at a time when they continue to stress the need for stability during their search for new investment - but the intention at this moment is to stand by their man in the vain hope that he can revive his team. If he does, and Liverpool somehow end the season ahead of City, Tottenham and Villa, then it will go close to equalling anything Benitez has achieved since arriving in England.</p>
              <p>This, after all, is half-time in Istanbul. A time when nobody is giving Liverpool chance. A time when Benitez looks as bereft of ideas as his players. In Istanbul, Liverpool somehow managed to bounce back but on this occasion it seems even more unlikely.</p>
              <p>Benitez is too stubborn to admit the problem is with him but he looked like a broken man when he gave his post-match press conference on Wednesday night and his team looked broken, too.</p>
              <p>So much so that, for all their desire to resist it, a less indecent proposal to Hiddink might not be too far away.</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rafa Benitez</span></abbr> has no intention of resigning.</p>
              <p><em>The Times</em> says having signed a new five-year contract only last
              March, he remains committed to working his way out of the malaise that
              reached new depths when Reading became the third lower- division side
              to eliminate them from the FA Cup during Benítez’s tenure.</p>
              <p>His lengthy, lucrative contract could provide one explanation for the refusal of the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> board to contemplate dismissing Benítez.</p>
              <p>Benítez would be entitled to have the majority of the earnings
              due to him from the remaining four years on his deal paid in full if he
              was forced out.</p>
