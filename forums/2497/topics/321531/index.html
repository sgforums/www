              <p><strong>Arsenal’s hardworking defender Kolo Toure has expressed his desire to stay at the Emirates Stadium until the end of his career.</strong></p>
              <p>The 27-year old Ivory Coast International, who joined the Premier
              League club in 2002 has delivered outstanding consistent performances,
              and could possibly replace William Gallas as captain next season.</p>
              <p>“When I put the shirt on it means a lot of things for me. I will be
              so glad to finish my career here. At the moment everything is going
              well.</p>
              <p>“We had a great season and played some fantastic games. But
              we(Arsenal) went away without any trophies - and that’s a big, big
              thing for us.</p>
              <p>“The team are still really strong, the club are still really strong and the manager is doing a great job.”</p>

              <p>Not that Arsenal's squad is weak but because of the huge spending power of MU &amp; Chelsea..</p>
              <p>It makes Arsenal harder to compete with them..</p>
              <p>Chelsea can afford to pay high wages to attract the finest players..</p>
              <p>Nowadays, its more about money than anything else..</p>
              <p>Just look at the Ronaldo saga presently.. sigh~</p>

              <p>The salary Arsenal pay isn't exactly peanuts... It was reported that in their last accounting year they only pay lesser than United by a mere $2m... $92 and $90 million respectively...</p>
              <p>The overall Arsenal team problem isn't just about money... They have many great players in their squad... And last season, they actually lead the premiership with a lead of 5 points until Feb... The problem they had was, apart from the unlucky injuries they got, the overall team was too young and lack the experience to see out the season when the pressure started to build...</p>
              <p>On the players buying part, I think its more by choice rather than by necessity cos before Wenger adopted the idea of buying mostly youngsters only, Arsenal were also buying established players such as Sylvain Wiltord in 2000 for $13m, Edu 2001, Henry 1999, Overmars 97... During those days, these were rather large sums for a transfee fee. But a shift in buying policy may have taken place somewhere in the middle so as not to get the club into debts... But they are still doing fine and if not for the new stadium... they wouldn't be in any debts today.</p>
