              <p>Manchester City midfielder Stephen Ireland has blamed former boss Mark Hughes for his loss of form this season.</p>
              <p>The
              23-year-old was named as City's player of the year for 2008-09 but,
              following the arrival of Carlos Tevez as a deep-lying striker this
              season, Hughes moved the Republic of Ireland international into
              unfamiliar positions, and he admits that the tinkering took its toll.</p>

              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/11/article-0-08194593000005DC-298_468x337.jpg" alt="Stephen Ireland" width="468" height="337">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>City slicker: Stephen Ireland has praised the job done by Roberto Mancini since his arrival in December</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>'The last six months under Mark Hughes was very frustrating for me,'
              says Ireland. 'I was being played out of position. Maybe as a holding
              midfielder, left wing, right wing. It is not me.</p>
              <p>'You have to
              adjust and think 'I have to do it' but if you want the best out of me
              you have to play me in my best position. Then I can be myself because
              the chains are off.'</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Mark of frustration: Ireland admits he was disappointed by Hughes' decision to change his position this season</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Under new manager Roberto Mancini, Ireland has been given the
              opportunity to revert to his favoured attacking midfield role, and he
              is full of praise for the job carried out by the Italian since he
              replaced Hughes in December.</p>
              <p>'It is difficult for anyone to come into a club, turn it round and get it going their way' said Ireland.</p>
              <p>'The
              manager is doing different things but he has done a really positive job
              so far. We are still scoring goals but we have not conceded as many and
              are working hard.'</p>
              <p>Ireland's displays are believed to have caught
              the eye of Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson but, for now, the
              midfielder remains loyal to City, a club he feels welded<br>into despite his roots on the other side of the Irish Sea.</p>
              <p>I have really worked hard over the last two years to build up my relationship with the fans,' he said.</p>
              <p>'Even
              when I was doing a signing session a few months ago I ended up staying
              for over three hours. It comes naturally to me. Even though I came over
              from Ireland, the fans still regard me as one of them. I am very
              grateful for that.'</p>
