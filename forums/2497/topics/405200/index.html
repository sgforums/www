              <p><em>Javier Mascherano</em> </p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">JAVIER MASCHERANO'S agent claims his client would jump at the chance to follow Rafa Benitez to Inter Milan.</h2>
              <p>Benitez is rumoured to be weighing up a bid for Mascherano after replacing Jose Mourinho at the San Siro. The Spaniard signed him during his time in charge at Liverpool and Walter Tamer has revealed the midfielder is yet to speak to new Reds boss Roy Hodgson.</p>
              <p>The agent said: "Mascherano has not spoken to Hodgson nor with Liverpool. "After the World Cup, he has switched off but it's clear he is happy to be a target of top clubs in the transfer market.</p>
              <p>"Last season, it was the European champions Barcelona that wanted him and this year it's Inter, the current Champions League winners.</p>
              <p>"For him to be linked to Inter has a magical taste — it's a dream.</p>
              <p>"Think about it, the strongest team in the world wants him, a team where many of Mascherano's compatriots play and a side that is guided by a coach with whom Mascherano has a personal bond."</p>
              <p>Mascherano is under contract with Liverpool until June 2012. But Tamer insists the 26-year-old would happily sit down to discuss a deal with Inter.</p>
              <p>He added: "If it was up to Mascherano, the negotiations would be very easy. "But he has a contract with Liverpool and the two clubs would have to find an agreement before we step in."</p>

              <p>The former Liverpool boss looked in good spirits as he put his players through their paces at their facility in Appiano Gentile.</p>
              <p>Stars including the much-coveted Mario Balotelli were in attendance but Benitez has given those involved in the World Cup extra time off for rest and recuperation.</p>

I have left him voice messages and sent him texts but had no reply. To be fair to him, that's not unusual because he's had a tough World Cup and I believe he's gone back to Argentina.
              <p>"It's not always easy to get in touch with people. I have tried to reach him to make clear I am happy to talk with him at his convenience.''</p>

              <p><strong>Inter Milan striker <span style="color: #000000;">Diego Milito</span> is confident that Liverpool midfielder <span style="color: #000000;">Javier Mascherano</span> will soon become his club team-mate at the San Siro.</strong></p>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Mascherano has been strongly linked with a reunion with former Liverpool boss <span style="color: #000000;">Rafael Benitez</span> at Inter, and Milito - believes it is only a matter of time before his Argentina captain joins him at the Nerazzurri.</p>
              <p>"We are very excited about Mascherano joining us at Inter," Milito told the Daily Star Sunday. "He has made it clear he wants to be here and it's just down to the relevant people agreeing the deal now.</p>
              <p>"In my view we are getting the very best defensive midfield player in the world and Maradona calls him one of the three most important players in the Argentina squad along with <span style="color: #000000;">Lionel Messi</span> and (Carlos) Tevez. That's how highly he is regarded.</p>
              <p>"I think it's unrealistic of Liverpool to think they can keep hold of Mascherano when they can't even offer Champions League football and are not challenging Manchester United and Chelsea for the Premier League title.</p>
              <p>"The boss and Mascherano have a good friendship so there were no other clubs on the cards for him after that, including Barcelona. He has wanted to join for a while but when the boss joined Inter I think that sealed the deal.</p>
              <p>"Rafa has already made it clear that he wants another season like Jose had with us last season. Javier is a natural-born winner. He'll relish being at a club where he will win top honours.</p>
              <p>Milito claimed that without the draw of Champions League football, Liverpool may now struggle to keep their big names, and also revealed that he hopes that <span style="color: #000000;">Carlos Tevez</span> may consider moving to Serie A.</p>
              <p>"I think it will be hard for Liverpool to hold on to the top players, including (Steven) Gerrard and (Fernando) Torres, but that is not my concern.</p>
              <p>"I would like Tevez to join us as well but I don't think that will be possible this summer. Manchester City are in a position where they don't have to sell, but Carlos has told me he would like to play in Italy in the future."</p>

Roy Hodgson is believed to be ready to sell the Argentina captain at the right price to raise funds, after warning Liverpool supporters that several more signings are needed to lift the "doom and gloom" that enveloped the club last season.</strong></p>
              <p>Liverpool want at least £25m for Mascherano, who has made no secret of his desire to move to Inter and link up again with Rafael Benítez, Hodgson's predecessor as manager at Anfield. Mascherano's agent, Walter Tamer, recently said it was his client's "dream" to join the Serie A club and the approach had been anticipated.</p>
              <p>Mascherano has been disillusioned at Liverpool for some time, having seen Benítez block a proposed move to Barcelona last summer. Hodgson reported last week that the 26-year-old had not responded to his telephone or text messages while on holiday following the World Cup. He had been keen to discuss the player's future.</p>
              <p>The manager will have only a modest amount to spend on transfers unless he increases that budget through sales, meaning Mascherano's departure could suit both parties. Hodgson's funds look set to be swelled by the sale to Olympiakos of Albert Riera, who played no part in tonight's 0-0 draw with Grasshopper in a friendly in Switzerland because talks with the Greek club are ongoing.</p>
              <p>The Olympiakos manager, Ewald Lienen, is expecting to sign the winger by the end of the week. "Unless there is a major surprise then he will be our player," he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One target for Hodgson could be Manchester City's Wayne Bridge. City look set to bring in Serbia's Aleksandar Kolarov from Lazio to play at left-back and Liverpool will be without a senior player in that position if, as expected, Emiliano Insúa moves to Fiorentina.</p>

              <p><strong>Javier Mascherano is ready to ask for a transfer to push through his proposed move from Liverpool to Inter Milan.</strong></p>
              <p>Representatives of the Argentina captain were reported to be in Milan yesterday holding informal talks over his planned transfer and expect to formulate an offer from Inter over the next week.</p>
              <p>Inter manager Rafael Benitez agreed as part of his settlement when he left Liverpool that he would not return to sign any of their players for the next three months.</p>
              <p>However, Liverpool are well aware that Inter are the only real contenders for Mascherano's signature.</p>
              <p>He intends to leave and they recognise it may be in their best interests to strike a deal and sell the 26-year-old before the saga overshadows Roy Hodgson's preparations for the new season.</p>
              <p>Inter are unwilling to offer Liverpool's valuation of £30m instead they intend to deal closer to £20m - but could offer players in return such as former Portsmouth midfielder Sulley Muntari.</p>
              <p>Mascherano, who has so far failed to return Hodgson's calls, is due to return to the Liverpool fold on Monday but has made it clear to friends that he wants to go.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, AC Milan are showing interest in Liverpool's Ryan Babel although no formal contact has been made. Birmingham are also interested but Babel is not keen on a move to the midlands.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption">Back at Melwood: Javier  Mascherano has returned from holiday after his exploits at the World Cup</p>
              </div>
              <p>Javier Mascherano has met new <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool</span></a> manager Roy Hodgson for the first time  after returning to pre-season training at Melwood.</p>
              <p>The Argentina captain has been uncontactable since going on holiday after the World Cup but was back on schedule along with compatriot Maxi Rodriguez on Monday morning.</p>
              <p>Hodgson tried to speak to the 26-year-old, who has been heavily linked with a summer reunion with former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez at Inter Milan, following<br>the end of the player's involvement in South Africa.</p>
              <p>However, Hodgson was only able to leave messages for Mascherano telling him he was looking forward to meeting him back on Merseyside as his calls were not returned.</p>
              <p>The new Liverpool chief will outline his plans to Mascherano in much the same way as he has already done to senior players Steven Gerrard, Jamie Carragher and Fernando Torres in an attempt to persuade him he has a future at Anfield.</p>
              <p>But there still remains a nagging doubt that the combative midfielder, who was offered a new contract in the latter stages of last season, has set his sights on a move to the continent.</p>
              <p>Neither Mascherano nor Rodriguez will be available for Thursday's Europa League third qualifying round first leg tie against Rabotnicki in Macedonia.</p>
              <p>However, Hodgson admits he may have to field a number of his other World Cup stars earlier than he would have liked.</p>
              <p>The club's medical staff have warned their manager bringing the likes of Gerrard, Carragher, Glen Johnson, new signing Jole Cole and Daniel Agger back too soon may have dire effects later in the season.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Therefore, Hodgson admits he may not be able to afford to take the risk of not using senior players.</p>
              <p>'I don't know what to do at this stage,' he said. 'I will have to make a decision by Tuesday on what sort of team I can put out.</p>
              <p>'I can promise the Liverpool fans we will put out the best possible team, without compromising the future.</p>
              <p>'The only players I will take will be the ones that I definitely think will play a valuable part in the game.</p>
              <p>'I would not take Steven Gerrard there to play for the last 10 minutes as a substitute.'</p>
              <p>One senior player who will be available is midfielder Alberto Aquilani, who sat out Saturday's friendly defeat to Kaiserslautern with a knee problem.</p>

              <p><em>Roving eye: Javier Mascherano is said to be keen on a move to Inter Milan after more than three years at Liverpool</em></p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1297852" rel="1297852|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1297852/Javier-Mascherano-says-leaving-Liverpool-Inter-Milan-line-25million-bid.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Javier Mascherano confirmed Roy Hodgson's worst fears on Monday when he told the Liverpool boss: 'I'm off'.</strong></p>
              <p>The Argentina captain has been linked with a reunion with former boss Rafael Benitez at Inter Milan and Hodgson is now preparing himself for a £25million bid from the European champions. </p>
              <p>That will be hard to resist, considering Liverpool's dire financial state, but the 26-year-old midfielder's departure will be a blow for Hodgson, who was boosted last week by the arrival of Joe Cole and Steven Gerrard's commitment to the club.</p>
              <p>However, £25m would help the Anfield manager strengthen the squad, particularly as he needs at least one left back and, with Mascherano gone, another tough-tackling enforcer to replace him.</p>
              <p>Holding on to Mascherano always looked unlikely after Hodgson failed to make contact with the Argentina captain several times since the World Cup.</p>
              <p>Mascherano had his differences with Benitez in the past but their relationship was far more amicable during the Spaniard's last year at the club and Inter offer him the chance to play Champions League football this season.</p>
              <p>The move suits him from a lifestyle point of view too, with fellow Argentinians Javier Zanetti, Esteban Cambiasso and Diego Milito playing for Inter. That almost caused him to leave last summer before Benitez managed to persuade him to stay.</p>
