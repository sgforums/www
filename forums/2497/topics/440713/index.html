              <h1>Man United legend Solskjaer guides Molde to first ever league title<br></h1>

              <div class="thinCenter"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/10/30/article-2055462-0E280FFB00000578-123_468x286.jpg" alt="Maiden title: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer led Molde to the league title" width="468" height="286"></span>
              <p class="imageCaption">Maiden title: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer led Molde to the league title</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Former Manchester United striker and coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer managed Molde to the Norwegian league title for the first time in their 100-year history on Sunday night.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>A drew 2-2 with Stromsgodset coupled with Rosenborg's home defeat to Brann, put Solksjaer's side seven points clear with just two games remaining.    </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Molde looked like securing the title with a victory over Stromsgodset until a last-minute equaliser from Anders Agnes Konradsen postponed the party at the Aker stadium.    </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Rosenborg kicked off against Brann knowing they needed a victory to keep their slim hopes alive, but they looked nothing like title contenders as they conceded three goals in the first 20 minutes on the way to a 6-3 defeat.    </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Founded in 1911, Molde had finished runners-up in the Tippeligaen on seven occasions but it took the return of the talismanic Solskjaer to deliver the title the club had craved.    </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Despite scoring 33 goals in 42 matches for Molde before moving on to a glittering career at Manchester United, Solskjaer had never won a major trophy in his native country.    </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>He took over as manager at Molde in January 2011 following a successful stint as reserve team coach at United but suffered a rocky start on his return to Norway.  </span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Molde lost his first league game to promoted Sarpsborg 08, before draws against Tromso and Viking left his side with just two points from a possible nine.</strong>    </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Solskjaer, famed for his ability to come off the bench and change a game as he did when he scored in stoppage time to secure United's dramatic Champions League final victory over Bayern Munich in 1999, turned the team's fortunes around. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Victory at rivals Tromso on October 2 put Molde in pole position in the title race and draws against Odd Grenland, Stabaek and Stromsgodset secured the trophy.</span></p>

              <p><span>
              </span></p><p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has warned Ole Gunnar Solskjaer against heading straight back to England so soon after his Norwegian title success with Molde.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Ferguson always felt Solskjaer was the most likely of his long-serving members of his Manchester United squad to become a coach.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The long-serving United boss offered Solskjaer the opportunity to coach the reserve side at Old Trafford when he retired from the game in 2008.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>After a two-year apprenticeship Solskjaer returned to his former club Molde in December, triggering an instant reversal in fortunes to a team that finished last season in 11th spot.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>At the weekend, he was confirmed as a league champion, the 38-year-old clinching Molde's first title in their 100-year history.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The achievement brought an immediate link to the present vacancy at Championship outfit Portsmouth, and a more obvious suggestion he could eventually replace Ferguson at United.</span></p>

              <span style="font-size: x-small;">
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>However, the Scot believes a man who will forever have a place in Red Devils' folklore due to his injury-time winner in the 1999 Champions League final, should enjoy his time at home before opting to make a return to England.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'It is possible (he could return as boss in England),' said Ferguson. 'It just depends when.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I don't think he should rush into it because experience is good and the experience he has got at Molde is a very good one.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'He comes from the area. His wife and family are all back home there.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'He has won the championship and there is no need to hurry.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'The time will come and the timing will be important but he is easily capable of coming into English football.'</span></p>
              <p class="imagecaption" style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Ahead of his own side's Champions League encounter with Otelul Galati at Old Trafford on Wednesday, Ferguson recalled how Solskjaer made such a positive impression during his own 366-game career at United, which yielded 125 goals in addition to the one he is most famous for.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'My knowledge of Ole as a student of the game is quite clear; every game he played and every training session he took part in he always wrote it all down,' said Ferguson.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'That tells you his dedication to learn the game and also his attention to meticulous detail.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'That gives him a great start because you need dedication and sacrifice to go into management these days.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'He was a great player and a very nice person. Players will respond to him.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Ferguson revealed he jumped the gun with his congratulations, texting Solskjaer prior to the 2-2 draw with Stromsgodset on Sunday that secured Molde a place in next season's Champions League.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'All the players have been in touch. I texted him on Saturday thinking he had won the league but he was playing on Sunday.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'It is a great achievement considering this is his first year. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'He had a great spell with our reserve team so he wasn't coming into the job blind but it is fantastic news.'</span></p>
