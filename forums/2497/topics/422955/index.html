              <p class="storycopy">Barca are yet to win a single away game in the knockout stages under boss Guardiola and have drawn five games and lost twice on their travels.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">And Guardiola has promised Barca will go for the jugular at the Emirates Stadium in the first leg of their last-16 tie against the Gunners, even if it means they risk defeat.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“This is the best moment to break this record,” said Guardiola. “There have been moments when we have lost and drawn, but teams in Europe are very strong.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“The other reality is in the last two years we have reached the final and semi-final, so the percentage is good for us. Sometimes we have played badly and qualified and sometimes we have played well and been knocked out.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“We know the tie will not be decided tonight, it will be decided in Barcelona, but we want to win the game.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“We are Barcelona and we will go out to attack. We might lose, but we want to attack, try to score a goal and go for the win. That’s what we’ll try to do.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“I have a lot of respect for Arsenal and Arsene Wenger and we know they will also try to attack.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“They have very good players in Theo Walcott, Robin van Persie, Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri.”</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta said: “We know our results away from home in Europe have not been great, but when we have lost we have then won at home. Nothing will be decided in the first leg.”</p>

              <p>no one commented here during match?!?! lol. Wasn't exactly a classic but definitely pulsating. Arsenal seemed to show too much respect for barca in the early stages, people like nasri, van persie didnt show up. Walcott was fine running at defenders. Sometimes just need that belief because barca tried to run the show.</p>
              <p>At one point the stats on screen showed barca had 412 passes as compared to arsenal's 203. They tend to pass around in triangles when in tight spots and it's really one touch stuff.....then in the 2nd half, somehow this faded and they held on to the ball longer. When you play one touch football week in week out, it somehow becomes natural and it's easy to dominate games once the team masters it.</p>
              <p>Van persie is class.....he scored from a very tight angle, thru victor valdes' near post. Think he will be crucial to arsenal's run in with man u.</p>
              <p>And this scezny guy, the young arsenal keeper....he will be one to watch for the future. He has an imposing presence in front of goal.</p>
              <p>Anyway, good game!! Look forward to the one in nou camp.</p>

              <p>Hmmm... I thought Arsenal was totally outplayed in the first half... And Barce could have got more than 1 goal...</p>
              <p>At one point, I thought I was watching Arsenal vs Bolton with Arsenal's role reverse to become Bolton's rough house physical game kind... Kicking and pushing the Barce players... lol.</p>
              <p>To be honest, Barce didn't deserved to lose cos they were the better side on the night... But somehow, a very bad mistake from the Barce keeper allowed Arsenal to get back in... and by some luck, Arsenal got the winner... lol.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I found Barce's game very boring... Yes they do pass and attack well but they seem to waste a lot of time moving the ball around and back for long periods until their final move...</p>
              <p>For now, Arsenal have the advantage... But I don't know if they can survive nou camp cos in last night's match... Had the game been in Nou camp, I am sure the referee would have awarded Barce at least 2 genuine penalty calls had the fans been on their side... But strangely, I find the Barce players didn't seemed to really take it too serious kind in a way unlike when they played against Chelsea... Protest on the slightest possibility... Here they didn't seem to really care...</p>
              <p>Anyway, let's hope Arsenal are able to go to Spain and defend their lead and kick Barce out of the CL... It's quite possible as Barce who are not known to defend well, will even miss their 2 first choice centre-backs... I wonder do they even have proper cover for Puyol and Pique as they usually don't really need when they play in La Liga... Cos the opponent's attackers is all so weak that without them in the odd match also wouldn't do to much harm... lol.</p>
              <p>But against Arsenal...</p>
              <p>So gunners got a very good chance to go through...</p>

              <p>Hmm actually when barca hold on to the ball for 20-30 consecutive passes, it scares the shit out of opponents.....makes them sweat, look like schoolboys etc. To me, it has a certain psychological effect on the other team.</p>
              <p>Anyone saw how nasri couldn't get the ball off one barca player (forgot who)?....think it's pedro. He eventually went for the leg and got a yellow.</p>
              <p>Just like how you try to take the ball off zidane and you can't, it can make the team feel down.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">DAVID VILLA claims Arsenal did not deserve to beat Barcelona.</h2>
              <p>The Spanish striker scored the opener at the Emirates in the Champions League last-16 first-leg clash last night.</p>
              <p>But goals from Robin van Persie and Andrey Arshavin stunned the visitors.</p>
              <p>Villa said: "They are a very good team. They've caught us on two counter-attacks and caused us a lot of damage.</p>
              <p>"We were better but they hurt us on the counter. We didn't deserve this result.</p>
              <p>"The scoreline, when we were 1-0 up, should have been bigger looking at the chances we had.</p>
              <p>"But Arsenal are a great team and took advantage of their opportunity.</p>
              <p>"We have a team to get through. We will be ready for the day."</p>
              <p>Keeper Victor Valdes is equally is confident Barca will progress.</p>
              <p>He added: "We had the game under control but they took advantage of their chances well.</p>
              <p>"There's still the second leg and we have faith that things will turn out in our favour.</p>
              <p>"It's possible in our stadium. We are confident that it will all work out for us."</p>

              <p><br>you never watch world cup? *Almost* every game they play is under. Win by 1 goal only, courtesy of Villa 90% of the time.</p>
              <p>Recently in international friendlies get trashed by Portugal, Spain, almost drew goaless to Colombia which is way lousier than them in rankings.</p>
              <p>Without Messi, they got nobody to unlock the opponent defences.</p>
