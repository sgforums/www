              <p>The SUN has come up with many great stories and latest news over the years... They broke the story of Robbie Keane could be sold back to Spurs at a cut-priced fee that many at first thought was ridiculous given that he just joint from Spurs for a huge fee which turns out to be true...</p>
              <p>They had many inside stories on Chelsea like what was happening with Mourinho and Roman those years... The unhappiness within the squad then and later the players unhappiness with Scolari's training style especially Terry and Lampard... The club were not saying it but they got the inside story on them. Their inside source seems to be very good... They also predicted the removal of Scolari within a few day and it turns out to be correct too... They said Guus would be appointed within 24 hours, which prove to be correct too.</p>
              <p>The Press seems very powerful and they have their sources within clubs... Recently they said Henry was hurt and would miss the Semi-final with Chelsea... Barcelona deny it but later it turns out to be correct too...</p>
              <p>On the Tevez story, they are just giving a possibility... Doesn't mean its written in stone. Just read the first line (UNITED <span style="text-decoration: underline;">could</span> try to sign Carlos Tevez on a Bosman-style free transfer.) and if you still can't understand then... too bad lah.</p>
              <p>Could does not mean Will... It implies that their source within the club informed them that the club were secretly exploring whether there were any legal loopholes in the striker’s contract. It certainly did not mean there is or it will be free...</p>
              <p>It doesn't take much to understand really... But sometimes the reader must also look at it with an open mind... After all, most news started out as a rumour before it becomes true or false wouldn't you agree? Just like with Silva now... its still a rumour now but it could still become true correct? Or the Ancelotti to Chelsea news... During the Euro Cup, they said Scolari to Chelsea was a done deal... Their source in Chelsea were very good... Within hours, Chelsea admitted Scolari would join them right after the Euros... Scolari wasn't pleased it was exposed but he later admitted it in a press conference did he not.</p>
              <p>It bring us back to the Robbie Keane transfer again... The day before it was made official, Rafa was still denying it on live Tv right after their match... He said Keane was still a Pool player... Of course he was but they the Press got it spot on didn't they when they said Keane was heading back to Spurs in a surprise move that was very much unexpected at that time.</p>

              <p><br>What do you mean by that? I just can't take it when some other fans (especially Manure!) use this to mock us! What the hell is that for? So many fans died and you all dickhead keep reminding us of this? Think of the family of the victims? go hang your head in shame!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What type of news The Sun reported specifically? Liverpool fans pickpocket on victims? urinate on police? We are talking about the fact that The Sun is really a crap tabloid. I never buy that damn paper, not because of their report on the disaster. Have you ever lived in the UK? Do you know lots of people in Britian hated this tabloid, not just Liverpudlians!! Do you know their general feedback on it?</p>

              <p>"some looks stupid, but once they open their mouth, they remove all doubts". &lt;---- It seems like you referring to yourself... </p>

              <p>Everyone has different opinion. I personally do not like this tabloid, not because their report on the disaster. It doesn't have a real news in it, racist, killing trees for reporting $hits!</p>

              <p><br>What do you mean by that? I just can't take it when some other fans (especially Manure!) use this to mock us! What the hell is that for? So many fans died and you all dickhead keep reminding us of this? Think of the family of the victims? go hang your head in shame!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What type of news The Sun reported specifically? Liverpool fans pickpocket on victims? urinate on police? We are talking about the fact that The Sun is really a crap tabloid. I never buy that damn paper, not because of their report on the disaster. Have you ever lived in the UK? Do you know lots of people in Britian hated this tabloid, not just Liverpudlians!! Do you know their general feedback on it?</p>

But at a private lunch in 2006, he suggested he had only apologised because Rupert Murdoch forced him to and was quoted as saying: "All I did wrong was tell the truth ... I was not sorry then and I'm not sorry now."</p>
