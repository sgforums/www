              <p>What type of news The Sun reported specifically? Liverpool fans

              fact that The Sun is really a crap tabloid. I never buy that
              damn paper, not because of their report on the disaster. Have you
              ever lived in the UK? Do you know lots of people in Britian hated

              <p>Gosh, your reaction and words just show your real character
              there.</p>
              <p><br> "please, take a look @ yourself.. So those fans died, tell me, how
              it affected you, moron?" &lt;--- If tomorrow a bunch of your fellow
              Manure fans died, will you not be affected at all?
              Jezz...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I lived in London for 4 years+ and I travelled to
              Anfield at least once a month!! I have a deep
              passion for my team. But I don't think there is a need for me
              to say too much to you. If you want the last word, I can happily
              give it to you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, you write like an uneducated but I believe you are
              not. Also, is there a need to hide behind computer and calling
              other names? Hmmm...coward in real life I suppose. Looking forward
              to your next shot. ;-)</p>
