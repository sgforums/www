            <div class='col-md body'><strong>EX-REF Anders Frisk has hit out at Jose Mourinho for stirring up trouble ahead of big games.</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.abc.net.au/reslib/200409/r29856_74483.jpg"><br><br>Frisk quit in 2005 when he received death threats after a run-in with the Blues boss.<br><br>Mourinho claimed that Barca boss Frank Rijkaard had tried to influence Frisk in a half-time meeting at the Nou Camp.<br><br>But UEFA found that a meeting never took place and found Mourinho guilty of bringing the game into disrepute.<br><br>The Swiss official's latest outburst is sure to re-ignite the feud.<br><br>Frisk said: "Mr Mourinho has to take responsibility for his actions.<br><br>"He should maybe analyse what things could happen if he did things differently.<br><br>"If he changed then I'm sure he would have much nicer meetings than he does at the moment.<br><br>"There are a lot of coaches who behave well and I think that most of them have been very, very good.<br><br>"But there is a trend that has been set over the last three years by some managers that is not good for football.<br><br>"It is not good for the image of football and I suffered because of that. A lot of people are still suffering from that.<br><br>"Every week we can see them building conflicts up before a football match.<br><br>"It is as if it were a boxing match coming up.<br><br>"I would like to see that kind of communication being taken away from football."<br><br>Frisk - in an interview with feelfootball.com - has also slammed footie stars for diving.<br><br>He believes this can make a referee's job almost impossible.<br><br>Frisk has called on UEFA to bring in retrospective punishments for anyone is caught cheating.<br><br>He added: Â“The behaviour of some players - if they get a little touch they dive and act as if they are dead.<br><br>"I think it is important in these situations that the football authorities get involved and say Â‘we will investigate this match and then bring the player to justiceÂ’ to try and ensure he does not do it again.<br><br>Â“As a referee, if you whistle for a penalty and afterwards see that the other player was not near him, then of course you have made a big error.<br><br>"And you know that if you make such big mistakes then you will be suspended for several fixtures.<br><br>Â“This creates problems for referees because in situations like this it's sometimes impossible for a referee, in a split second, to be able to say whether an injury is genuine or fake.<br><br>Â“So what I would like to see is for the football authorities to get involved afterwards - watch the video footage and condemn such actions.<br><br>"They need to send out the message: Â‘This is not OK, and we as a football authority have banned this player for two matchesÂ’.Â”<br><br>Frisk used the example of Maradona - who famously scored the 'hand of God' against England in 1986 - for modern stars who choose to cheat.<br><br>He said: Â“I think Maradona is one of the most brilliant football players, but sadly he was also a cheating football player.<br><br>Â“I think the one big goal for football is to realise how bad it is to have the attitude that it's OK to cheat the referee.<br><br>Â“This should be taught from a young age, from the beginning. It will take time, of course.<br><br>"We've had a bad tradition with this, and unfortunately maybe in some ways we have praised behaviour like that in some countries.<br><br>"We have not condemned it, and I think we should be proactive and say this is not OK.Â”</div>
