              <h1>I want more! £200,000-a-week at Real Madrid is just NOT enough, moans Ronaldo</h1>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/06/17/article-0-0536904B000005DC-253_468x388.jpg" alt="Cristiano Ronaldo" width="468" height="388"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Standing firm: Cristiano Ronaldo is rumoured to be demanding more money from Real Madrid</em></p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1193805" rel="1193805|3| nofollow" href="/sport/football/article-1193805/I-want--200-000-week-Real-Madrid-just-NOT-moans-Ronaldo.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo last night demanded more money from Real Madrid before he completes his world record transfer from Manchester United.</strong></p>
              <p>The astonishing £80million move - agreed a week ago - would pay him £200,000-a-week after tax, but the 24-year-old now wants the Spanish club to smash their image rights pay structure, too.</p>
              <p>His agent, Jorge Mendes, is still locked in talks over bonus payments which are based on personal sponsorship and other commercial deals, including shirt sales, and it is understood that he wants Madrid to give Ronaldo 55 per cent of the income he generates.</p>
              <p>Brazilian superstar Kaka, who has just signed from AC Milan for £56m, will get only half of the revenue he generates and this is the most the club usually agree to.</p>
              <p>At that 50 per cent level, it has been estimated that Ronaldo would enjoy 25 per cent pay increases each year as Madrid develop more commercial deals, and it is likely that he would be commanding an astonishing weekly wage of £557,000 by the end of his six-year contract. And he still wants more.</p>
              <p>That works out at more than £29m-a-year but, with the transfer not sealed and United not due to be paid before 30 June, Mendes is trying to improve terms. Ronaldo already has deals with companies such as Nike and Banco Espirito Santo but his camp are reluctant to share earnings from new endorsements even though he would receive a cut in return from the sale of Real Madrid merchandise bearing his name.</p>
              <p>Madrid are expected to find another way to increase Ronaldo's pay rather than set a divisive new precedent for their galacticos as they prepare to present latest additions Kaka and Ronaldo separately at the Bernabeu next month. With such an expensive transfer they cannot concede too much more ground because club president Florentino Perez expects to make money from the Portugal international.</p>
              <p>Perez was the man who signed former England skipper David Beckham for Madrid in 2003 and made the Spanish club the richest in the world.</p>
              <p>They increased their commercial earnings by more than 600 per cent on the back of the midfielder's presence and want to replicate that success with Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>Comparisons between Ronaldo and Beckham have been made before and the 24-year-old, forward on the verge of becoming the world's most expensive player, seems to enjoy the limelight as much as his Manchester United predecessor.</p>
              <p>Both have worn the valued United No 7 shirt and Beckham has led the way in personal commercial deals, exploiting the celebrity status that comes with a former pop star wife and demands from the fashion world.</p>
              <p>Beckham has regularly been pictured in attention-grabbing clothes and with a range of hairstyles in much the same way Ronaldo has this summer. He has been photographed partying late into the night in Los Angeles this summer and enjoying the company of socialite Paris Hilton.</p>

              <p>There is really nothing wrong with his demands... Obviously he feels he is good enough for it and if Real wants him bad enough, they will compromise... Which I believe they will... They just have to work out how not to upset the rest like Kaka also on 50/50 only...</p>
              <p>Ronny is only thinking whats best for himself only... His contract is 6 yrs long... At the end of it he would be over 30 yrs old. Their career are short, that extra 5% for 6 yrs could add up to tens of millions extra... So I don't really see anything wrong with his demands... Its just what it is today in professional football... Aguero asking for $200k a week, Eto'o asking for $46k a day... Kaka is on $200k after tax...</p>
              <p>So if he have it, hang it up and sell for the best price since it's in demand today... Your chance may never come back again...</p>
