            <div class='col-md body'>A defensive midfielder basically has these attributes: energetic (picture energizer), wide coverage of the field (M1 or Singtel) and can hound the opposition player who is in his vicinty and given the chance, hack down the player if need to (Paparazzi).<br><br>However...<br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">Have you guys ever thought how some holding midfielders can make good full backs?</span></span><br><br>I know not all DMs are capable of such, but I can't help but pondering why some can perform so well as full backs? The most popular example is Essien of Chelsea. He is a typical DM and the next to dominate in the field work of DMs after Roy Keane and Patrick Vierra. Did you see when Mourinho switched him to right back, Essien basically bombard the flanks and turned the tide of the match?<br><br>Even Hargreaves was also considered as back up right back for England in the past. Flamini too has his talents exploited when he was used as an emergency left back for Arsenal 2 seasons ago.<br><br>We have seen how Mascherano performed for Liverpool. Though I have not seen it yet, but there may come a time when he will be deployed as a full back for tactical changes or when Finnan is no in the line up.<br><br>I know not all DMs can do that. For 1, Carrick never done that. He is not your typical DM. I am not even sure if he is a DM to begin with. Even Alonso is not the kind to be used that way. They both are a different kind of holding midfielders.<br><br>I have not seen many too but Gattuso, Hamann, Deschamps and maybe even Dunga(!) could be closet full backs. This is really interesting but the most baffling thing is, how is that so?<br><br>What you guys think?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Hargreaves and Essien were not defensive midfielders in the first place!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Essien played Lamp's role in his national team and Hargreaves is an attacking midfielder before he was converted to a defensive midfielder. Which means to say that both players can adapt and is flexible in playing at either attacking or defensive positions.<br><br>Also notice that both players are pacy? Pacy players have advantage in Soccer.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Whereas for players like Gattuso, Hamman, Deschamps and Dunga, their primary role is defensive midfielder. They were taught to play in that position and they sticked to it till now (or till retirement).<br><br>So i guess flexibility is the key.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cheers.<br>CK</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah... energy and robust eh? I think Stevie G can play as full back too. Kieron Dyer as well. I remember in the year 2002 when I played the Championship Manager, both of them were classified as DMs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>No kidding. Then later both were more like AMs. Stevie G definately can defend well. Not sure Dyer can defend well or not, but given a bit of tweaking, I think they can play as full back.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

You go to those less common clubs (like scottish league, portugese league and other leagues), you see the players in there, find 1 DM and you put them as defenders. Quite a number are good in the back lines. Especially full backs.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think dm often tracks back and find themselves most of the time in defensive positions, whether it's just in front of the back four, covering full backs.
