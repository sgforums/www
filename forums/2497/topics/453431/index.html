              <p class="imageCaption">Moving on: Kuyt signs a three year deal at Fenerbahce</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Kuyt has invoked a clause allowing him to quit Anfield for just £1 million. The 31 year-old’s decision follows a discouraging final year on Merseyside when he was named only as a substitute for both <span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span><span style="color: #000000;">'s</span> cup finals.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>Rodgers was eager to retain Kuyt’s services, making it clear every member of the Liverpool squad would have a fresh start. The Northern Irishman certainly did not immediately sanction his sale but was helpless to prevent it.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>The exit clause in Kuyt’s contract – now recognised as a misjudgment by the Anfield hierarchy – meant Liverpool could not stand in the Dutchman’s way if he received a lucrative offer from abroad.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>Kuyt has moved to Turkey on a three-year contract on terms believed to be worth £3 million a season.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>“After six years I am ready for a new challenge,” Kuyt said. “Liverpool, I will always carry in my heart. The appointment of the new coach has nothing to do with it. But when Fenerbahce came to me and made their ambitions known, from the first moment I was sold. They give me the confidence that I lost.”</p>
              <p>To lose a player of Kuyt’s calibre for such a paltry fee is a setback for Rodgers, who knows replacing someone who is a key member of <span style="color: #000000;">Holland</span><span style="color: #000000;">’s </span><span style="color: #000000;">Euro 2012</span><span style="color: #000000;"> squad for a similar price is virtually impossible. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Kuyt joined Liverpool from Feyenoord for £9 million in 2006, finally ending his trophy drought when he scored after coming off the bench in last season’s </span><span style="color: #000000;">Carling Cup</span> final against Cardiff.</p>
              <p>He built his reputation as a player who shone on the biggest occasions, while his hard-working style endeared him to the crowd. His most notable highlights were a hat-trick against <span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and the winner against Sir Alex Ferguson’s side in last season’s </span><span style="color: #000000;">FA Cup</span><span style="color: #000000;"> tie at Anfield. He also scored in the 2007 </span><span style="color: #000000;">Champions League</span> final when Liverpool were beaten 2-1 by AC Milan in Athens.</p>
              <p>For his first five seasons he rarely missed a game and totalled nearly 300 appearances for the club, scoring 71 goals, mainly from a right midfield position. Under the management of Kenny Dalglish, however, he had begun to play a more peripheral role and it was clear disillusionment was setting in during the middle of last season.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Kuyt expressed his frustrations as he was benched for the biggest fixtures and admitted last week his agent was negotiating with numerous European teams. His former club, Feyenoord, had also tried to lure him from Anfield but the financial clout of the Turks has taken him to Fenerbahce.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">He has opted for the move to Istanbul, though, possibly attracted by the prospect of Champions League football next season.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Kuyt will certainly leave Anfield on good terms, although Rodgers is suffering because of the baffling clause which was placed in Kuyt’s contract by the previous management team.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> could have expected at least a few more million in a transfer fee had they wished to sell Kuyt on their own terms.</span></span></p>

              <p>At 30 something, it's time to play in a less competitive league and get ready for retirement. <span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  "><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></p>

              <p>Actually he might play even more game under the new manager. His style is more suitable and who can question his work rate? So more like he isn't interested or confident of what the new manager can bring... So better use his get out clause now before that deal expire.</p>
              <p>He is younger than Gerrard so shouldn't question his fitness or age. He is also less injury prone than Gerrard... But then i think getting a secure deal for the next 3 yrs plus CL football isn't a bad thing.</p>
              <p>The only bad part for Pool is he is allowed to leave on the cheap. A current and regular Dutch international, chow chow also should get at least $5m to $6m.</p>

              <p>1 million or 3 million is an major pay cut for Kuyt.</p>
              <p>Can imagine how disgusted he is under Kenny.</p>
              <p>He was hoping for return of Rafa or his dutch ah kong.</p>
              <p>But, none of them came.</p>
              <p>So, he have to go cheap.</p>
              <p>At least he is playing champion league next season.</p>
