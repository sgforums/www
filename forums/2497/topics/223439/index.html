            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool close to being sold to Dubai Holdings<br><br>Liverpool could soon be the next Premiership club under foreign ownership.<br><br>The Mail On Sunday reports the team could soon be bought out by Dubai International Capital (DIC) for around Â£450 million.<br><br>However, the deal faces opposition from Kop supporters and football authorities who are anxious to avoid another English club falling into overseas hands.<br><br>The DIC are a branch of the Dubai government-owned Dubai Holdings. They are already owners of a few English holdings such as Madame Tussauds and the London Eye.<br><br>Liverpool have been searching for investment for almost three years as they seek to erase Â£80 million of debts and fund a Â£200 million new stadium.<br><br>They recently rejected a Â£450 million bid from American multi-millionaire Geogre Gillett Junior as well as three rival bids.<br><br>The Anfield board has apparently settled on the Dubai company and has subsequently given them exclusive rights to study the clubs books.<br><br>If the deal goes ahead Liverpool will become the sixth Premiership club in four years to be taken over by foreign investment following Chelsea, Manchester United, Portsmouth, Aston Villa and most recently West Ham.<br><br>However concerns will be raised about a potential conflict of interest for the Dubai investors because of Arsenals relationship with the Dubai based airline Emirates.<br><br>Emirates and the DIC are both independent companies but are ultimately both an offshoot of the same government.<br><br>Arguments may be voiced that this could affect the competition within the Premiership.<br><br>When asked about the prospective deal Liverpool did not comment.<br><br><strong>wtf middle east  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </strong></div>

They are willing to fund the Â£200m construction of a 60,000-seat stadium and will cover the club's long-term debts - about Â£80m - but it remains to be seen whether Rafael BenÃ­tez will benefit in the January transfer market.<br><br></div>

But according to the Sun...<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">"The Anfield club have given Dubai International Capital permission for an intense study of the books Â— and a Â£450million deal seems to have come about...<br><br>The figure is made up of Â£250m for a new stadium and LiverpoolÂ’s current Â£80m debt, valuing the club itself at around Â£170m."</span><br><br>I guess not many people were aware that Pool had a debt of Â£80m outstanding... cos whenever its publish, Pool is alway in the top 10 as one of the most profitable club. Even if some knew they have, i guess many didn't expected it to be so much after all, Liverpool don't seem to have spend a lot over the last 5 yrs...<br><br></div>
