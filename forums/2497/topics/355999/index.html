              <p> </p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>Chelsea are through to the Champions
              League semi-finals after a 4-4 home draw – 7-5 on aggregate – against
              Liverpool at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>An incredible game in West London saw Chelsea and Liverpool share
              eight goals, as The Reds threw away a two goal lead, but then rallied
              only for the home side to respond in kind and progress through to a
              semi-final meeting with Barcelona.</p>
              <p>On the 25 occasions that an away team have won the first leg of
              a Champions League fixture, only once has a team failed to progress.</p>
              <p>Liverpool nearly made it two.</p>
              <p>If Liverpool dominated the first half against a nervy looking
              Chelsea side, then the second half, if not belonging to the home side,
              they showed great character in taking the game to the visitors.</p>
              <p>When Fernando Torres missed an early chance it seemed as if
              Liverpool would struggle to score the three goals necessary to progress
              into the semi-finals of the Champions League.</p>
              <p>But Chelsea seemed uncertain how to cope with a 3-1 first leg lead and handed the initiative to the Reds.</p>
              <p>On 19 minutes Liverpool pulled a goal back with an audacious free kick from Aurelio.</p>
              <p>With Chelsea stopper Petr Cech expecting a conventional delivery
              he left his post unmarked and the Brazilian drove home from 25 yards.</p>
              <p>Nine minutes later and the visitors had deservedly drawn level on aggregate.</p>
              <p>This time Aurelio's free kick drifted into the penalty area and
              Ivanovic is spotted by Spanish referee Luis Medina holding down Alonso
              – penalty.</p>
              <p>Alonso sends Cech the wrong way and blasts Liverpool two goals to the good.</p>
              <p>Still Chelsea failed to respond and on the stroke of half time the Reds almost get a third.</p>
              <p>First, Dirk Kuyt's header is clawed away by Cech, then when the
              ball is returned a goalmouth scramble ensues which the home side are
              fortunate to escape without conceding.</p>
              <p>Within a minute of the restart and Cech raced out of his goal almost gifting a chance to Liverpool.</p>
              <p>But then Chelsea began to claw their way back.</p>
              <p>On 50 minutes Anelka's low cross was met with the faintest of
              touches by Didier Drogba and keeper Reina fumbled the ball over the
              line.</p>
              <p>A thunderbolt free kick from Alex brought Chelsea level as Liverpool began to wilt.</p>
              <p>Then, when Frank Lampard put Chelsea ahead with 15 minutes remaining it seemed as if Liverpool were down and out.</p>
              <p>Yet this game still had more twists to come.</p>
              <p>Lucas shot from distance took a deflection and it was now 3-3.</p>
              <p>Two minutes later and Liverpool were back in front; Riera crossed and Kuyt powered home a header.</p>
              <p>With eight minutes remaining The Reds just needed to score one more time to knock Chelsea out at the quarter final stage.</p>
              <p>But it was Frank Lampard who had the final say, as Liverpool
              pushed forward, Chelsea broke quickly and Lampard curled in his second
              of an unbelievable night to make it 4-4.</p>
              <p>Chelsea boss Guus Hiddink admitted harsh words were said at half time.</p>
              <p>"We got angry, and why not?</p>
              <p>"We only started playing just before the break. A few tactical
              tweaks were necessary but mainly we gave Liverpool too much respect.</p>
              <p>"That's what I liked about the second half, the way the team reacted.</p>
              <p>"We sat too far back defensively and asked for problems which we got."<br> Liverpool chief Rafa Benitez was proud of his team and supporters.</p>
              <p>"We are disappointed to score four goals away in an unbelievable game and not get anything.</p>
              <p>"I'm disappointed for the player's and for the fans.</p>
              <p>"When we scored the second goal I had confidence, but there was no rush to score a third goal.</p>
              <p>"Even when they scored we still controlled things but against
              top class players if you make a mistake you get punished, and that's
              what happened."</p>
