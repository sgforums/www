              <h1>Old foe Ronaldinho seizes centre stage and condemns Mourinho to first defeat</h1>
              <h2 id="stand-first">Former Chelsea coach sees his Internazionale side fall to city rivals Milan</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/ronny-412.jpg" border="0" alt="Ronaldinho" width="412" height="232"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div id="article-wrapper">
              <p><strong>Jose Mourinho and Ronaldinho have met before. In March 2006 the Brazilian scored a goal for Barcelona which made sure Chelsea were knocked out of the Champions League. It was a bitter night for the Portuguese, who was taunted by the Nou Camp fans during the game. "Mourinho - this is the theatre," they sang, in reference to his accusations that Lionel Messi's acting had led to Asier del Horno's red card at Stamford Bridge in the first leg.</strong></p>
              <p>In Italy they call the San Siro stadium "La Scala del Calcio" after the famous Milan theatre and last night Ronaldinho took centre stage once again, this time to ruin Mourinho's first derby as Internazionale coach, scoring the goal in Milan's 1-0 win.</p>
              <p>The goal that ended Mourinho's unbeaten start as Inter manager came after 39 minutes as Kaka beat the offside trap on the right to pick up a long pass from Ronaldinho. The attacking midfielder returned the pass to his compatriot, who outjumped Esteban Cambiasso to head home from 10 metres out before setting off on a typically flamboyant Brazilian dance to celebrate his first Serie A goal.</p>
              <p>Mourinho, who saw his side finish with 10 men after the second-half sending off of Nicolás Burdisso, said Inter had deserved at least a point. "Milan scored a goal and we did not, this is the story of the game," he said. "[But] they had two other shots on goal, one from Ronaldinho in the first half and one from [Andriy] Shevchenko at the end of the game, while we had more [than that] even when we were playing with 10 men. I don't think either team was better than the other on the night.</p>
              <p>"Milan have three points but they are behind us in the table. It was a good derby, it ended 1-0 for them, but 1-1 was the more fair result in my opinion. We lost a game but nothing more than that," he added.</p>
              <p>Mourinho declined to comment on the performance of the referee, Emidio Morganti, who apart from dismissing Burdisso also sent off the already substituted Marco Materazzi for dissent. "I don't speak about the referee because I want to sit on the bench for the next game," he said before going slightly cryptic. "Burdisso did not deserve any of the two bookings and Materazzi's sending-off from the bench is like a movie I have already seen."</p>
              <p>"This goal is for all the Milan fans," Ronaldinho said. "Every day I feel more at home here. I'm here to give joy to all Milan people and I also know that tomorrow [Monday] is president [Silvio] Berlusconi's birthday and this goal is also for him."</p>

              <h1>Jose Mourinho: Inter Milan did not deserve to lose to boring AC Milan</h1>
              <h2>Jose Mourinho has said AC Milan did not deserve their victory after watching his Inter side go down 1-0 at the San Siro in the Milan deby.</h2>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01000/jose_mourinho_1000475c.jpg" alt="Volatile: Jose Mourinho believes the 1-0 defeat was harsh on his Inter side" width="460" height="288"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Ronaldinho scored the only goal of the game with a header in the 36th-minute of a fractious enounter that saw Inter have Nicolas Burdisso and the substituted Marco Materazzi dismissed in the second half. It brought a heated end to the weekend for Mourinho, who was already fired up after a spat with</strong> <strong>Claudio Ranieri.</strong></p>
              <p>Mourinho reacted angrily to suggestions he had shown a lack of respect by failing to turn up to a midweek post-match press conference, ridiculing the Juventus manager’s level of English in his time with Chelsea.</p>
              <p>After the derby, the Portuguese said: “Milan scored a goal and we didn't, that is the story of this match. They had a few shots on goal and despite playing a man down, we had some great chances. “I saw two teams play and neither one deserved a win more than the other. I will not talk about the goal or the red card, as I don't want to get suspended.</p>
              <p>“When I don't like the result, I am not afraid to run risks. I did the same when we were 0-0 against Lecce, but here when we went down to 10 men I couldn't replace Esteban Cambiasso with Mario Balotelli. "We needed the midfield held together and the way things were going Patrick Vieira would've got a second booking too.</p>
              <p>Lazio now top the Serie A standings following their convincing 3-1 win away to Torino, but Mourinho said: “When I look at the table, with all due respect, I don't look at Lazio, Napoli or Catania. I see that we are ahead of Roma, Juventus and Milan.</p>
              <p>“A team that plays against Milan, who are basically all midfielders, needs to balance things out. We only had two midfielders - Cambiasso and Vieira - so Cruz is in better physical shape and I put him there to put pressure on Clarence Seedorf.</p>
              <p>“A side with 10 men that ends the game like this on the attack and forcing Milan to introduce a defender for a forward says it all. Milan were more pragmatic, but this is football. “It seemed a real derby to me and a very entertaining game. I feel 1-1 was the right result, but this was down to pragmatism.</p>
              <p>"It's better to lose a game than to be afraid of playing football. We played. Milan have a lot of experience and they know how to control the tempo, commit a tactical foul or pretend to have an injury to slow down the pace."</p>
              <p>Mourinho's comments did not go down well with the Milan players, with midfielder Kaka claiming his side were worthy victors. Kaka said: "I think Milan dominated the match and always tried to play attacking football. That negative moment has passed and now we have notched together a series of four victories and are playing very well.</p>
              <p>"Mourinho makes me laugh, like when he said Dejan Stankovic’s foul was really me pretending to be injured as a tactical choice. It’s funny."</p>

              <h1>Kaka Responds To Mourinho Comments</h1>
              <h2>AC Milan midfielder Kaka has laughed at the post-match comments of Jose Mourinho and believes that his side were worthy derby victors...</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/28549_news.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Milan were 1-0 winners at the San Siro over Inter on Sunday evening, with Kaka assisting Ronaldinho's winning goal. After the match Inter coach Jose Mourinho had stated that he believed neither side should have won and that Milan were 'pragmatic' in their approach.</strong></p>
              <p>The Brazilian international then responded to Inter's coach: "Mourinho makes me laugh, like when he said Dejan Stankovic’s foul was really me pretending to be injured as a tactical choice. It’s funny."</p>
              <p>Mourinho was not joking when he made the comment, it was likely just a bitter reaction from losing the match from the Portuguese tactician.</p>
              <p>Kaka and Ronaldinho combined on several occasions, including the winning goal and Kaka praised the Brazilian's resurgence following his dismal spell last season at Barcelona.</p>
              <p>"It’s wonderful to see Ronaldinho so happy and determined to become a decisive player again," said Kaka. "He is working so hard and is on his way back.<span>  </span>I am very glad he’s here, as he has brought many things the team were missing."</p>
              <p>Milan have won three Serie A games on the trot after losing their first two, as they look to recover and compete for the Scudetto. The Rossoneri's last Serie A championship was won in the 2003/04 season.</p>

              <p>anybody who watched the derby will know how Milan controlled the game and never allowed Inter to play the way they did in their past few games</p>
              <p>it's just too bad for Mourinho that he got off his Inter coaching career with his first defeat coming from their biggest rivals.</p>
