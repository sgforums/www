              </span></p><p>Manchester United's dominance of English football might never have materialised had Sir Alex Ferguson given into his initial reaction to a severe facial injury and left Great Britain while a player at St Johnstone.</p>
              <p>However, the Scotsman, famed for possessing a no-nonsense approach
              to his high-profile players, received a "hairdryer" treatment of his
              own - from his mother - and restored his faith in the sport when he
              struck a hat-trick the next day against Rangers.</p>
              <p>Manchster United fans will thank her for the intervention as
              Ferguson, now 68, has acted as a trophy-magnet during his managerial
              years, transforming Scottish Premier League side Aberdeen, and current Manchester United outfit into European champions.</p>
              <p>The two-time Champions League winning boss said to <em>Press Association Sport</em>:
              "I was part-time and in a reserve game against Airdrie I broke my
              eyebrow, cheekbone and nose and was out for months. They put this
              massive plaster cast on my face.</p>
              <p>"After I came back from the injury I played three reserve games. We
              lost 8-1, 7-0 and 9-2. I said 'That's it - I am finished'. I took out
              papers to emigrate to Canada.</p>
              <p>"On the Friday, my brother's girlfriend phoned up my manager at St
              Johnstone and told him I had the flu. But when I arrived home from a
              night at the swimming baths with my pals, my mother tore into me.</p>
              <p>"She said, 'I've had a telegram from your manager - get down to the
              telephone booth and call him'. The manager said: 'Report to the Bath
              Hotel tomorrow, you're playing against Rangers'."</p>
              <p>Ferguson then claimed that the events that unfolded altered his destiny.</p>
              <p>"I scored a hat trick and became the first player to do so against
              Rangers at Ibrox - it changed my life. I became a full-time footballer
              in the summer and never looked back."</p>

              </div>
              <p>The Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson,
              has revealed he was so disillusioned with professional football at one
              point in his playing career that he almost quit the game and came close
              to emigrating to Canada.</p>
              <p>However, he had a change of heart after
              harsh words from his mother and responded with a "life-changing"
              hat-trick against Rangers.</p>
              <p>Ferguson, 68, may be the most
              successful British manager of all time but back in the 1960s he was
              struggling to make his mark as centre-forward with St Johnstone.</p>
              <p>"I
              was part-time and in a reserve game against Airdrie I broke my eyebrow,
              cheekbone and nose and was out for months. They put this massive
              plaster cast on my face," he said. "After I came back from the injury I
              played three reserve games. We lost 8-1, 7-0 and 9-2. I said 'that's it
              – I am finished'. I took out papers to emigrate to Canada.</p>
              <p>"On
              the Friday, my brother's girlfriend phoned up my manager at St
              Johnstone and told him I had the flu. But when I arrived home from a
              night at the swimming baths with my pals, my mother tore into me.</p>
              <p>"She
              said, 'I've had a telegram from your manager – get down to the
              telephone booth and call him.' The manager said: 'Report to the Bath
              Hotel tomorrow, you're playing against Rangers.'</p>
              <p>"I scored a
              hat-trick and became the first player to do so against Rangers at Ibrox
              – it changed my life. I became a full-time footballer in the summer and
              never looked back."</p>
              <p>Ferguson, who related the story to students
              in Glasgow, also gave an insight into how football has changed. He is
              in his 24th year at Old Trafford and has won over 30 trophies,
              including 11 Premier League titles and two European Cups.</p>
              <p>United,
              who are looking to make it an unprecedented four successive Premier
              League crowns, are at home to struggling Portsmouth on Saturday.
              Ferguson is as driven as ever but is not certain many share his undying
              love for the game.</p>
              <p>"Young players now are more fragile, they are
              more cocooned," he said. "They are encouraged by an insatiable press to
              think they are better than they really are, and they are protected by
              their agents. But you have to deal with that in sport now. You have to
              be very conciliatory."</p>
