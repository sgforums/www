              in Kaka loan deal</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Real
               Madrid</span></abbr> are open to sending <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Kaka</span></abbr> on-loan to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> - in exchange for Ashley Cole.</p>
              <p><em>Itasportpress.it</em> says the Spanish giants may be warming to the 
              idea of off-loading their £56million star if they can secure a player in
               return, and with a left-back high on their radar, Cole would be the 
              obvious make-weight in any deal.</p>
              <p>The 29-year-old may also feel like it’s the right time to join the 
              Galactico ranks, after personal problems and media scandal have dogged 
              his last season with the Blues.</p>
              <p>However, it's unlikely that <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Carlo Ancelotti</span></abbr> will want to enter into any kind of 
              deal involving his full-back, and will likely try a straight-cash swoop 
              in a bid to lure the Brazilian international.</p>

              <p>Kaka is a big flop, and he just got found out that's all. I think City were very fortune not to have signed him...  Not to say he is a bad player, but he was never really that special a player like Ronaldo or Messi that's all... So in a way, his disappointment at Real was quite expected as they do have many stars as well therefore it would be a lot more difficult for him to come up unlike at AC where he was the only star...</p>
              <p>If Chelsea really do go for him, I don't know is it a good thing or a bad one in the long term. Of course having another 'star' player in the squad should be good but his transfer fee if there is one and his super salary won't go unnoticed to those who have serve the cause these last few years... And they might probably demand a salary close to his as well like what Terry and Lampard once did when they saw the likes of Shevchenko and Ballack getting more while they did the business on the field... This time it could be Malouda, Essien or Alex... And for all we know he could be the next Deco...</p>

              <p>For me, Kaka is a special player. I recall how he destroyed MU in UCL. He may not be flashy like Messi, Ronaldo, but he is quality.</p>

              <p>well, I am unsure why the harsh judgement but he was injured and in a new environment.Like Sheva, maybe he shouldn't have left Milan where they were doing so well.</p>
              <p>For me, Kaka is a special player. I recall how he destroyed MU in UCL. He may not be flashy like Messi, Ronaldo, but he is quality.</p>

              <p><br>Well, I remember how good Ronaldinho was too at the WC or during his Barce days... But clearly those days are long gone... Therefore even at $56m last season he was already well over priced.</p>
              <p>If many thinks Gerrard is just above average, then Kaka is below Gerrard in my opinion...</p>
              <p>Not to forget the high salary he is on at Real... So the loan deal as strange as it may sounds, who knows... Maybe Real really want to cut their losses and let him go for a season and in return get what many consider one of the best left-back in the world... After all, it's only a loan deal, and if he does well they can take him back anytime or sell to Chelsea at a price the won't lose money ($56m or more)... Cos in current form, it's quite difficult to offload him for a profit or even a break-even sum... So they may have to take a 1/3 loss if they want to get rid of him right now... Kaka is still quite young anyway... Another selling point to Chelsea, Lotti might still fancy Kaka.</p>
