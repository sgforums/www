              <p><strong>Everton striker Louis Saha narrowly cheated death on Sunday night when he smashed his Ferrari sports car on a busy country road.</strong></p>
              <p>The former Manchester United ace, 32, was on the Altrincham Road, in Wilmslow, Cheshire, when he lost control of his car shortly before 9pm.</p>
              <p>Police sources have indicated the damage to the vehicle was 'extensive'.</p>
              <p>Amazingly the Frenchman - who was in the car alone - escaped without injury and did not need hospital treatment.</p>
              <p>A Cheshire Police spokesman said: 'We can confirm there was a road traffic accident on Altrincham Road, Wilmslow, at 8.54pm. Fortunately there were no injuries.'</p>
              <p>A source added: 'The car was extensively damaged. He is lucky to be alive.'</p>

              <p><strong>It is not known what Ferrari he was driving but the star does own a £170,000 458 Italia model, of which all 1,200 were recalled by the manufacturers in September last year as a design fault could cause them to catch fire.</strong></p>
              <p>The first incident occurred in July, when the driver noticed the rear panel of his 458 Italia was on fire while he was driving in Paris. A passer-by used a fire extinguisher to douse the flames.</p>
              <p>A few days later the engine of an Italia driving up a mountain pass in Switzerland caught fire. In August last year a 458 in China and one in the US burst into flames.</p>
              <p>After sending its engineers around the world to investigate the reports of 'thermal incidents', Ferrari asked the owners, including around 50 in Britain, to bring them in for modification work.</p>
              <p>Eric Clapton, the rock star, and Chris Evans, the broadcaster, are also among the car's owners.</p>
              <p>Ferrari said the problem had been traced to adhesive used in the wheel-arch assemblies.  In certain circumstances the glue could have begun to overheat, smoke and even catch fire.</p>
              <p>In extreme cases, the melting of the adhesive could lead the heat shield - the liner protecting the engine - to deform and move closer to the exhaust, causing the lining to catch fire. </p>
