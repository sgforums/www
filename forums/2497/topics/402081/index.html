              </p><p><strong>Sick Leave Expected to Increase during World Cup</strong></p>
              <p>Employers in Singapore need to consider the impact of the World Cup on their workforce and productivity levels when the nation catches football fever later this week, said recruitment &amp; HR services specialist, Randstad.</p>
              <p>Because many Singaporeans are passionate about football, the World Cup is likely to have an impact beyond tired faces at the office. Employees are likely to watch replays on their computers in the office, have post match discussions, as well as participate in online forums – particularly as the final approaches. There are likely to be some very “late starts” or people “calling in sick” during the two-and-a-half week tournament.</p>
              <p>Karin Clarke, Regional Director (Singapore &amp; Malaysia) of Randstad, said: “Some businesses, especially those which are tightly resourced and still trying to build up from the Global Financial Crisis, may find World Cup Fever to be irritating and a major distraction to achieving their goals. However, instead of dampening people’s spirits and expressing your frustration, it’s actually an ideal time to embrace the spirit of the sport, have fun and build employee morale through celebration and a culture of teamwork.”</p>
              <p>Clarke said that allowing people to express their emotions and be passionate about this global sporting event could have a positive impact on their overall happiness and mental attitude in the workplace. Themed marketing and business development activities could also be effective tools to generate sales and build stronger relationships with staff and customers.</p>
              <p>“There’s no doubt the World Cup will affect productivity both locally and globally. One of the key things employers should consider is to monitor pre-agreed leave days and plan effectively to ensure projects are resourced at normal levels,” Clarke said. “Meetings, projects and deadlines may require flexibility or rescheduling, particularly if the staff working on these projects are passionate football fans. Temporary staff can fill the gaps where needed. If business leaders understand that work may stand still or ‘dribble’ along, they may be more inclined to get behind the spirit of the sport and join in the celebration with their people.”</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>“It’s actually a great time to celebrate diversity in the workplace, by encouraging people to get behind their favourite team. Employers should see this as an opportunity to build a sense of team spirit, boost the overall culture of the company and demonstrate to their workers they are a supportive employer inside and outside of the workplace,” Clarke added.</p>
