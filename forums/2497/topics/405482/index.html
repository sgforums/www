              training 
              session with new club Real Madrid.</h2>
              <p>Having steered Inter to Champions League and Serie A glory last term, 
              Mourinho 
              has been given the task of reviving the form of Real's Galacticos.</p>
              <p>But there was no Cristiano Ronaldo or Xabi Alonso to welcome the former 
              Chelsea boss and his clipboard to the club's sport city training 
              complex.</p>
              <p>They are just two of several players who have been given some extended 
              leave 
              after being involved in the World Cup in South Africa.</p>
              <p>Two other senior pros missing were midfielder Guti and striker Raul. 
              Both have 
              been given a few days to consider their futures.</p>
              <p>One piece of business concluded was the signing of Pedro Leon from 
              Getafe.</p>
              <p>The attacking midfielder has signed a six-year contract after his 
              transfer was 
              agreed for around £9million.</p>

              <h1>PICTURE SPECIAL: Jose Mourinho gets down to business as the Special 
              One takes his first Real Madrid training session<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Jose Mourinho began his quest to become the first 'Grand Slam coach' 
              when he took charge of his first training session as Real Madrid manager
               on Friday.</p>
              <p>The Special One took the Bernabeu job after guiding 
              Inter Milan to an historic Champions League, league and Italian Cup 
              treble last season and promptly announced he wanted to make history by 
              winning a titles in England, Italy and Spain.</p>
              <p>The former Chelsea 
              boss has been linked with plenty of stellar signings as he looks to 
              rebuild a Mardid squad high on attacking flair but low on defensive 
              steel. The likes of Ashley Cole, Steven Gerrard and now Nemanja Vidic 
              have all been mentioned as possible big-money targets for the 
              Portuguese.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Madrid are also said to be 
              closing in on the £8.5million signing of Stuttgart midfielder and 
              Germany international Sami Khedira.</p>
              <p>But there was little sign of 
              such star quality on view at Mourinho's first session, held at Madrid's 
              Valdebebas training centre, with galacticos such as Cristiano Ronaldo, 
              Gonzalo Higuain, Kaka and Xabi Alonso all still on holiday following 
              their World Cup exploits.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Lassana Diarra and Karim Benzema did have an early opportunity to
              impress Mourinho, as their new boss put them through their paces. Former
               Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek also got his chance to make an 
              impression.</p>
              <p>In a city still recovering from Spain's World Cup 
              triumph and the wild celebrations that followed, Mourinho made a low-key
               start to life at Europe's most successful club.</p>
              <p>But, knowing 
              Mourinho, this will turn out simply to be the calm before the storm.</p>
