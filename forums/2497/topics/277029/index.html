            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/wenger-2.jpg"><br><br><strong>DAVID DEIN last night revealed why he joined the Russian revolution Â— to make Arsenal the worldÂ’s No 1 club. Dein sold his 14.58 per cent Gunners stake to billionaire Alisher Usmanov for Â£75million. And he will now become chairman of UsmanovÂ’s company, Red and White Holdings Ltd, with the aim of getting involved with the Gunners again.</strong><br><br>Dein quit as Arsenal vice-chairman in April after a disagreement over whether US tycoon Stan Kroenke should invest. But he is still big pals with Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger and insists his first goal is to get the Frenchman to sign a new contract.<br><br>Dein said last night: Â“TodayÂ’s announcement marks a significant step towards realising the vision I share with thousands of fans at home and abroad Â— making Arsenal the worldÂ’s No 1 football club. Â“I have not lost my passion for the club. Indeed, it is greater than ever. Â“IÂ’ve been flattered by the offers I have received to work with other clubs, both in England and elsewhere. Â“But there is only one club for David Dein Â— and that is Arsenal.<br><br>Â“IÂ’ve always had the best interests of Arsenal at heart Â— IÂ’ve had a love affair with the club since I was six. Â“My ambition remains to play an active role in Arsenal again. My immediate intention is to work with others to provide the financial resources to turn the vision into reality.Â”<br><br>He added: Â“To provide these financial resources, Arsenal need new investors. Â“The reality is that football is changing dramatically. Â“A growing number of clubs are being funded by individuals or consortia that are prepared to invest previously-unimaginable sums aimed at winning the gameÂ’s biggest prizes.<br><br>Â“I believe the board should welcome non-British involvement, given the wealth of nationalities responsible for ArsenalÂ’s success on the pitch Â— including its manager. Â“Without new investors, I feel very soon Arsenal might not be able to compete successfully at the very top level, despite the fantastic work of Arsene Wenger.<br><br>Â“IÂ’ve maintained my close friendship with Arsene. Â“I believe our professional partnership over many years was highly successful and beneficial for the club we both love. I hope it can be resumed.<br></div>

His only prominent involvement in sport until now has been as president of the Russian and European fencing associations.<br><br>But Mr Usmanov has been building up a media empire in Russia, with Kremlin approval, and may see a stake in Arsenal as a way to boost audiences by screening matches to football-crazy fans.<br><br>Like other billionaire businessman in Moscow, nervous of a sudden turn against them by the Kremlin, he may also have concluded from Roman AbramovichÂ’s ownership of Chelsea that a stake in a high-profile foreign club helps to protect other assets at home from official prying.<br><br>Mr Usmanov, who is married and has two children, was born in Uzbekistan but is a Russian citizen. He is linked to the Kremlin as general director of Gazprominvestholding, the subsidiary that manages the debts of the state-controlled gas monopoly Gazprom.<br><br>He has enjoyed a privileged position during Mr PutinÂ’s presidency to the extent that he was forced to deny speculation that he had bought Kommersant, one of RussiaÂ’s most influential papers, at the KremlinÂ’s request.<br><br>With Mr Putin due to stand down as President in March, Mr UsmanovÂ’s involvement with Arsenal may be an insurance policy against any unexpected downturn in relations with his successor as president.<br></div>
