              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">A BUS carrying the Togo national football team was blasted with gunfire in Angola, killing a driver and injuring two players and two team staff.</h2>
              <p class="article">Manchester City's £25million star striker Adebayor, 25, and Aston Villa midfielder Moustapha Salifou, 26, both play for the Togolese national side.</p>
              <p class="article">A Manchester City club spokesman confirmed tonight that Adebayor was unhurt in the attack. Togo and Nantes striker Thomas Dossevi said shortly after the attack: "I'm OK but several players are in a bad state.</p>
              <p class="article">"We are still at hospital. We were machine-gunned like dogs. They were armed to the teeth. We had to remain hidden under our seats for around 20 minutes to avoid the bullets.</p>
              <p class="article"><em>"We had just crossed the border five minutes before, we were surrounded by police buses, one in front of us another behind. "Everything was fine and then there was a powerful burst of gunfire.</em></p>
              <p class="article">"Everyone threw themselves under the seats and tried to protect themselves but some couldn't escape the bullets. "It lasted a good 15 minutes, the police fired back but really, it was hard to handle and it still is now. I'm shocked.</p>
              <p class="article">"When we got off the bus we were asking ourselves why us and not others? We were asking ourselves what had happened, we were crying and thanking God."</p>
              <p class="article">The side are in the country for the African Nations Cup, which kicks off on Sunday.</p>
              <p class="article">Togolese football federation vice president Gabriel Ameyi said backup goalkeeper Obilale Kossi and central defender Serge Akakpo were among those hurt.</p>
              <p class="article"><em>Mr Ameyi said: "They should not have traveled by road. They did not tell CAF (Confederation of African Football) that they were traveling by road. They should have flown to Angola."</em></p>
              <p class="article">Romanian side FC Vaslui confirmed Akakpo, 22, who joined them from French side Auxerre last year, was shot and badly injured in the attack.</p>
              <p class="article">A club statement said: "Badly injured in an ambush in Angola, Serge Akakpo is now out of danger. "Akakpo was struck by two bullets in the attack and has lost much blood. His condition was stabilised by doctors.</p>
              <p class="article">"FC Vaslui have been in touch with relatives of the player, who confirmed he has undergone surgery, which went very well."</p>
              <p class="article">Midfielder Alaixys Romao admitted the players feared the worst and thinks Togo are now likely to pull out of the tournament. The Grenoble player said: "We're not thinking yet of what could happen.</p>
              <p class="article">"But it's true that no-one wants to play. "We're not capable of it. "We're thinking first of all about the health of our injured because there was a lot of blood on the ground.</p>
              <p class="article">"For the moment there is not much news because they have been taken to different hospitals.</p>
              <p class="article">"In cases like these we're thinking of those near us, of those we love because that really could have been the end of us."</p>
              <p class="article">Togo are scheduled to begin their cup campaign against Ghana on Monday. Midfielder Richmond Forson claimed the number of injuries would have been much worse had the gunmen not originally fired on the wrong bus.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "It was the bus carrying our baggage, which was in front of us, which they fired on the most. They thought we were in the bus in front, fortunately for us. That's what saved us.</p>
              <p class="article">"Then they fired on our driver and those who were in front. The windscreen was shattered by the first bullets. "It's disgusting to take bullets for a football match."</p>
              <p class="article">A Togolese sports ministry spokesman said: "The Angolan driver was killed on the spot," adding that the attack took place in the Angolan region of Cabinda.</p>
              <p class="article">Following the attack, a Portsmouth FC spokesman said the club would consider recalling its players from the African tournament.</p>
              <p class="article">Portsmouth has Nwankwo Kanu with Nigeria, Aruna Dindane with the Ivory Coast, and both Nadir Belhadj and Hassan Yebda in the Algeria squad.</p>
              <p class="article">Club spokesman Gary Double said the club has asked the English Football Association to seek assurances from world governing body FIFA that Angola is safe for its players.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: "Our players' safety is paramount and if it can't be guaranteed the players should be sent home."</p>

              <p>He said: "I am appalled. This throws a question mark against next
              summer's World Cup. You simply cannot put the safety of players,
              officials and fans at the slightest risk. That is totally unacceptable.</p>
              <p>"I have two players - Daniel Cousin and Seyi Olofinjana - on

              <p>The Togo team coach driver was killed - and two players injured

              <p>Adebayor and other players frantically ducked behind seats as gunshots peppered the bus during a vicious 20-minute attack.</p>
              <p>Pompey chief executive Peter Storrie said: "This is a terrible,
              tragic incident and I am very concerned about this whole situation. The
              safety of all the players must be paramount and that's why I believe
              they should all come home as soon as possible.</p>
              <p>"We have four out there and, although they are not with the
              Togo team, you naturally worry about their well-being in the light of
              such an awful attack. That's why I'll be calling the FA to ask them to
              contact FIFA as soon as possible to see what is going to happen next.</p>
              <p>"I know what should happen. It's common sense to scrap the tournament and bring them home."</p>
