              <p><em>Rafa Benitez</em></p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Liverpool owner Tom Hicks insisted last night that Rafa Benitez will be his manager for at least two more years.</strong></p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">The
              American issued a rallying cry to the club's supporters by pleading
              with them to get behind the regime, after the crisis of the last few
              weeks. He pledged his "complete backing" to Benitez, adding there will
              now be no sale of the Anfield club to Dubai investors DIC.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">The
              Mirror can reveal that Hicks has been in contact with the investment
              arm of the Dubai Government over the past few days, but it is thought
              that talks have now stalled completely.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Dic remain in the
              background, but they have admitted their only hope of a takeover lies
              with a split between Hicks and his American business partner George
              Gillett.</p>
              <div id="mpu1" class="ad0 ad-mpu" style="display: block;"></div>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">There
              has been tension between the pair, but Gillett signed a massive
              financial agreement at the end of last week that ties him to Hicks.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"Sometimes we don't agree, but that's what business partnerships are all about," said Hicks.</p>
              <p>"There was never a possibility we would split and George would do a deal with Dubai.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"There's
              no question in my mind of me selling Liverpool Football Club - I want
              to win the support of the fans with my actions. I want people to watch
              my actions, and not somebody else's words.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"I will not sell, absolutely not. It was never a serious possibility and it certainly isn't today."</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Hicks is hoping to win back support among the fans by offering his total commitment to Benitez.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">The
              Spanish coach has been given nearly £75million to spend by the
              Americans so far, and the Texan insisted that his contract - which has
              two years remaining - will be honoured.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"I
              want Rafa to be in charge of Liverpool for the discernable future,
              absolutely. He's got my total backing, I have made that very clear,"
              Hicks said.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"He has a
              contract for two more years, and Rafa Benitez will be here as far as
              I'm concerned for at least the length of his contract. Hopefully it
              will be longer than that.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"The
              fans should know we are building the best football stadium in the world
              and we have got a great manager in Rafa, who has our full support.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"We have have never turned down his requests for money on any player.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"We
              have given him funds already in the transfer window, we are ready to
              endorse the signing of Mascherano, and we are already talking about the
              summer."</p>
