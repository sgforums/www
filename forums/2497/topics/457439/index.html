              <p><span>The complaint was lodged in July and was discussed at a meeting of the Premier League board, according to Goal.com.</span></p>
              <p><span>A statement read: 'The Premier League has received a complaint from Fulham FC regarding certain comments made by Liverpool FC officials and is currently looking into the matter.'</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>The complaint relates to comments made by Rodgers when quizzed about his interest in Dempsey.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>A story appeared on a website belonging to Liverpool's owners, Fenway Sports Group, last month claiming Dempsey was a Reds player. The article was quickly removed.</span></p>
              <p><span>Rodgers said at the time: 'Clint is a player we've inquired about, it is as simple as that. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>'Ian Ayre, our managing director, has spoken with the club to see what the position is. That is where we're at. He's a very talented player but we don't like to talk about other clubs' players.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Dempsey will once again be missing from the squad when the Cottagers travel to Old Trafford for Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash with Manchester United.</span></p>
              <p><span>The United States international has been dropped by boss Martin Jol after agitating for a move to Anfield, missing last weekend's 5-0 rout of Norwich.</span></p>
              <p><span>Jol is frustrated by Liverpool's conduct and feels a distracted Dempsey is unfit to play once more.</span></p>
              <p><span>'It's the same situation. There has been no formal bid on the table and nothing has changed,' Jol said.</span></p>

              <h3 class="padding-bottom-7">ANGRY Fulham last night took Liverpool to a Premier League tribunal for allegedly tapping up Clint Dempsey.</h3>
              <p>Liverpool were left red-faced after accidentally “announcing” they had agreed a deal for the American in the newsfeed on the official website of Anfield owners Fenway Sports Group.</p>
              <p>The Premier League confirmed Liverpool have been asked to explain their actions and could face sanctions.</p>
              <p>A statement read: “The Premier League has received a complaint from Fulham regarding certain comments made by Liverpool officials and is looking into the matter.”</p>
              <p>Fulham also claim comments by Kop boss Brendan Rodgers have helped unsettle their 29-year-old star and the Premier League board, which convened last week, accepted Liverpool have a case to answer.</p>
              <p>The Reds have to respond over the next fortnight and the Premier League board will decide next month whether to refer the case to a three-man independent panel.</p>
              <p>Top officials told SunSport last night that this case is not as blatant as the infamous tap-up row between Arsenal and Chelsea over the transfer of Ashley Cole six years ago.</p>
              <p>The Blues were fined £300,000 and copped a suspended three-point deduction.</p>
              <p>Dempsey-gate began when an initial £5million offer was rejected even though the player has only one year left on his contract.</p>
              <p>Fulham have been demanding £9m but Rodgers has refused to meet the asking price.</p>
              <p>It is understood the saga could be drawing to a close as the Reds were set to go back in with an improved £7.5m bid.</p>
              <p>Fulham are hoping to replace Dempsey with the £3.5m capture of Arsenal misfit Park Chu-Young.</p>
              <p>The South Korea striker, 27, knows he has no future at the Emirates.</p>

              <p><span>Fulham accepted a £7m bid from Villa earlier on Friday and turned down £4.5m from Liverpool but the forward held out for a move that suited him better.</span></p>
              <p><span>Dempsey joined Fulham in 2007 from New England Revolution, scoring 60 goals in 224 appearances for the Craven Cottage team. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>He had been hankering after a move to Liverpool all summer, but he is now more than happy to have signed for Tottenham.</span></p>

              <p><span>'There are a lot of great players here, I'm looking forward to training and playing with them.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Dempsey had not played for Fulham this season after it became clear he wanted a move, but he added on Tottenham's website: 'A lot was said and written ahead of me leaving Fulham. It wasn't how it was portrayed, but that's in the past now and we move on.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>'I want to thank the fans for everything, some of the best memories I've had in football, and thank the chairman for giving me the opportunity to come from the MLS and compete over here.</span> </p>
              <p><span>'All I can say is thank you and now I'm looking forward to the next challenge.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Meanwhile, Norwich have announced the signing of Tottenham striker Harry Kane on a season-long loan.</span></p>
              <p><span>Kane was expected to figure in Andre Villas-Boas' plans this term, but the Spurs boss has decided that the 19-year-old would be better off at Norwich after he signed Clint Dempsey just before Friday night's deadline.</span></p>
              <p><span>Kane scored seven goals in 19 starts while on loan at Milwall last season and also featured heavily in Tottenham's Europa League campaign.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I'm delighted to bring in someone of the quality of Harry,' Norwich manager Chris Hughton said.</span></p>
              <p><span>'He is a very talented young player and has bags of potential.</span></p>
              <p><span>'He enjoys scoring goals, as he shown coming through the ranks at Spurs and during some good loan spells as well.'<br></span></p>

              <p><span><strong>France No 1 goalkeeper Hugo Lloris has joined Tottenham from Lyon on a four year deal.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The fee is £8m which could rise to £12m - and the Ligue 1 side also say they are entitled to 20 per cent of profit should he leave White Hart Lane.</span></p>
              <p><span>Lloris meets the specific requirement of Villas-Boas. The 25-year-old is an athletic keeper capable of operating outside his area, enabling his back four to play higher up the pitch. </span></p>
              <p><span>He cannot play against Norwich on Saturday and will compete for a place with Brad Friedel.</span></p>
              <p><span>Lloris thinks that he has joined a club that is capable of qualifying for next year's Champions League.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I am here because I believe in Tottenham," the goalkeeper told Spurs TV Online.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I think everything is OK for the future of Tottenham. They have great team, great players, and a great coach so everything is all right, I think, to win a place in the Champions League next year.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Now we have to prove that on the pitch and I am ready to give it my all for the club and for the fans.'</span></p>
              <p><span>The deal had looked to be in doubt earlier in the day after the Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas accused Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy of moving the goalposts and said negotiations were the hardest of his 25 years at the top.</span></p>
              <p><span>Speaking after Friday afternoon's Europa League draw in Monaco, he said: 'We have had people speaking all night with Daniel Levy. He talks a lot and goes back on what we've agreed in writing.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Agreements have not at all been respected. We've done what we can. Hugo has been troubled by the difficulty in these negotiations.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Brendan Rodgers will consider a move for Michael Owen after seeing his goal-shy side comprehensively beaten by Arsenal at Anfield.<br></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The Liverpool manager admitted he would never have let Andy Carroll go to West Ham on loan had he known he would not be replaced. His team looked desperately short of firepower as goals from two of Arsene Wenger’s new signings, Lukas Podolski and Santi Cazorla, won the game for Arsenal.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Rodgers is so short of options up front that he is prepared to approach Owen to discuss a controversial return to Anfield, eight years after the striker left for Real Madrid. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">He scored 158 goals in 297 appearances between 1997 and 2004 but his move to Manchester United in 2009 was badly received on The Kop. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Stoke have been pursuing Owen, who is a free agent after leaving Manchester United, and have offered him a two-year deal worth in the region of £1.5million a season.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Sunderland have also shown interest but Owen, 32, wants to stay in the North West and the chance to rejoin Liverpool may be impossible to resist.</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Rodgers needs to bolster his ranks and, after seeing Tottenham hijack the signing of Clint Dempsey, he is considering drastic measures, though there is little chance of offering Didier Drogba a return from an unhappy spell in China.<br></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Rodgers said: ‘Any player that I believe can improve the squad, I will look at. We have got a very small group here.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Liverpool lost out to Tottenham after they offered only £3m for Dempsey on deadline day and Fulham are understood to be furious with how Liverpool conducted their attempts to sign the American.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">When asked if he would have let Carroll go on loan to West Ham, knowing what he would be left with, Rodgers simply replied: ‘No.’ A clause in the deal that took Carroll to Upton Park could see him recalled to Anfield in January.<br></span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Unlike last season, when Arsenal won at Anfield in fortuitous circumstances, the visitors were comfortable winners on Sunday after goals either side of half-time from Podolski and Cazorla.<br></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Wenger said: ‘Podolski is deadly when he gets a chance. When you have good spirit and good work-rate in the team, you always have possibilities. I am very pleased with the potential of this team. We have a good feeling.</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Brendan Rodgers’ determination to land Clint Dempsey has been laid bare after it was revealed he attempted to broker the deal by offering several Liverpool stars in exchange.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Rodgers had agreed a swap in principle with Fulham for Jordan Henderson but it now appears that Stewart Downing and Jose Enrique were also mentioned as possible departures.</span></p>
              <p><span>Agents circulated the players’ names to rival Barclays Premier League clubs in the hope of raising the money that would clinch a deal for the United States forward. </span></p>
              <p><span>Liverpool’s manager was also attempting to land an experienced left back — either as a rival to Enrique or as his replacement — as the clock ticked down towards the end of the transfer window.</span></p>
              <p><span>The moves came to nothing as Dempsey agreed a late switch to Tottenham,  scuppering Rodgers’ attempt to land one of his prime  targets of the summer.</span></p>
              <p><span>However, Joe Allen, one of his main captures, said that his move to Anfield had given him confidence to perform at the highest level he can. ‘The level of faith shown in me has been flattering,’ said the 22-year-old midfielder. </span></p>
              <p><span>‘It inspires me to go out and perform. From a confidence point of view, it’s been beneficial.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘What I have seen is that you have to be confident,  bordering on arrogant, and you see the difference it makes to the top players.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘I told myself at the start of the season that I’m going to give it everything I can for club and country. I can’t really do any more.’</span></p>

              <p><strong><span>Alessandro Del Piero has completed his move to Australian club Sydney FC, despite reported interest from Liverpool.</span><br></strong></p>
              <p><span>The 37-year-old former Juventus striker confirmed the deal at a press conference in Turin where he announced he has joined the A-League side.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I'm happy to have signed with Sydney and for the next two years I will play with them,' Del Piero told reporters at Wednesday's press conference.</span></p>
              <p><span>'A lot of clubs contacted me, Italian teams too and I thank all of them. Today my new adventure starts and my emotions are mixed.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>'I thank Sydney for this opportunity and his fans that already adopted me. I will discover a fantastic city and a fantastic country. I am grateful to my family for being with me in every moment.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>'I will continue to cheer Juventus. In Australia I will be able to deepen my passion for rugby. Above all I'm here to score a lot of goals and to try to improve Australian football with my experiences. I hope Australian people love football.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Del Piero's move to Sydney hit the headlines last week when completion of the deal was delayed after Liverpool and Barclays Premier League rivals Southampton both reportedly made late offers.</span></p>
              <p><span>Reds boss Brendan Rodgers admitted his frustration at failing to bring in a replacement for Andy Carroll after the striker was loaned to West Ham before Friday's transfer deadline.</span></p>
              <p><span>Sydney chief executive Tony Pignata claimed that Liverpool had made a late attempt to hijack the deal.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Liverpool have come in - and they're a big club, there's no denying that,' Pignata told Fox Sports Australia.</span></p>
              <p><span>In addition to Liverpool and Southampton, Sydney also have reportedly also fended off interest from Champions League clubs Celtic and Braga as well as Swiss side Sion.</span></p>

              <p><br>I dunno and I dun care. its their problem. their fans will be the judge if the owner is good for the club or same as the previous greedy yanky owners.  liverpool tend to make mistakes twice or many times, they never seemed to learn their lesson well. previous yankee owner already like fark, still accept the current yankee to buy their club? same as the appointment of manager. their managers since 1991 have been all half past six, except for houllier and rafa, who won some cups under their tenure, but never won the holy grail ie the league title since 1990.</p>

              <p>league is not so easy win de, need to built up slowly one.</p>
              <p>Rafa is very close to it and they finished second place, then somehow Xabi alonso and Mach(something) gone to real and barca, then they screwed up liao.</p>
              <p>That time their team is very strong with Alonso and Mach(something) with Gerrard in the midfield. Then Torres is at the top of his form. </p>
              <p>Somehow they just screwed up so hardcore.</p>

              <p>as a new manager comes in and take over, he tried to make too many changes too quickly, reminded me of AVB last season and he lost the dressing room.</p>
              <p>remember souness when he took over from kenny in 1991 when he resigned. he rid of peter beardsley, steve staunton, steve mahon and bought many new players like nigel clough, jamie rednapp, paul stewart etc. he eventually resigned in 1994 when after 3 seasons, liverpool seemed to go from a good side, to an average side, cos of too many changes to the playing personnel.</p>

I’ve won everything there is to win so another Champions League campaign would have done nothing for me.<br><br>“I came to Australia to experience something new and I want to make the most of this new adventure.<br><br>“Above all I just want to play football.”<br><br>Del Piero also took time to recall the emotions he felt in his final game for Juve, a 3-1 league victory over Atalanta at the Juventus Stadium in May.<br><br>He added: “The fans went above and beyond that day.<br><br>“No one had actually told me that I would never play for Juve again, but I knew that was the case.<br><br>“I saw the board go up with my number on it and asked myself ’Do I really have to say goodbye? Do I have to leave the stadium for the last time?’.<br><br>“I bowed to all four stands and waved to my family. I wanted to take it all in but I remembered where I was and told myself ’Ale, get off, it’s over’.<br><br>“But the fans made me come back out onto the pitch. I did two laps of honour and they threw hundreds of scarves at me, and every now and then I paused to savour the moment.<br><br>“I saw people crying. I suppose it went well, but goodbyes always leave a bitter taste in the mouth.”</span></p>

              <p><span>Fulham blame Liverpool for unsettling the player and  creating the circumstances that led to his move to Tottenham on transfer-deadline day.</span></p>
              <p><span>Ayre wrote: 'Please also consider this letter from me to be an additional expression of sincere regret and apology from our club to your club for our actions last summer. Our club can do better and  we pledge that it will.'<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Fulham’s official complaint followed a series of clumsy bulletins from Liverpool and their owners, the Fenway Sports Group. The first was an announcement on the FSG website that Liverpool had signed Dempsey from Fulham. </span></p>
              <p><span>This was followed by an interview on the Liverpool website with manager Brendan Rogers, in which he talked of the USA forward in glowing terms. </span></p>
              <p><span>Finally, pictures of Liverpool's new strip with Dempsey's name on the back were published.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>The 29-year-old had been on a summer break in America when the FSG announcement was made, and Fulham’s complaint to the Premier League intimated that their relationship with the player who was last season’s top scorer had not recovered from that point.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Dempsey did not officially go on strike, but told Fulham he wanted to leave. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>The club considered he was becoming a bad influence in the dressing room and he did not play a game for Fulham before signing for Tottenham.</span></p>
