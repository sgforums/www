              <p class="article">The Fiorentina ace says he can fire the Italians to victory in the Stadio Artemio Franchi tonight. But Mutu said: "Once upon a time, beating Liverpool would be a famous win and you could make a fuss, but no more. Since I have been in Florence, the team, the club and the whole environment have grown to the point where we can now beat anyone in our stadium."</p>
              <p class="article">Mutu, 30 says: "My time in England was not easy. I was young and I had a lot of troubles. "But I'm a better player now, more mature and much stronger physically." Mutu spent one season in England after a £17m move from Parma in 2003.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: "I am sure we will not make special plans for Fernando Torres or Steven Gerrard, that is not our style."</p>
              <p class="article">Reds boss Rafa Benitez told his side they need to cut out their soft centre in Italy tonight. Liverpool have leaked 10 goals already this season - with <strong>NINE </strong>from set-pieces.</p>
              <p class="article">Benitez said: "It is clear we have made too many basic mistakes, making life difficult for ourselves at times. We need to improve in defence."</p>

              <p><strong>Rafael Benitez aims to make it two Champions League wins out of two on Tuesday night and insists Liverpool can "beat anyone" in Europe.</strong></p>
              <p>Liverpool have won six games in succession and beat Hungarian champion Debrecen 1-0 in their opening Group E match a fortnight ago. If the Reds can win against Fiorentina in the Stadio Artemio Franchi on Tuesday night, then a place in the last 16 would be within their grasp.</p>
              <p>Benitez, whose team will be without hamstring victim Javier Mascherano, said: "The Champions League is a very different and difficult competition, but we have confidence we can beat anyone.</p>
              <p>"The Champions League, if you start winning consistently, becomes massive. We got three points against Debrecen and if we can win against Fiorentina it will be a very good step forward. "Because then we maybe have to win two more at home and that will be enough to qualify."</p>
              <p>Liverpool thrashed Hull 6-1 at the weekend, and Benitez said: "I think we can take this mentality into the Champions League, because the team is playing with confidence and scoring goals and playing good football.</p>
              <p>"It is easy for the players and the staff to have the same mentality. "I am sure it will be different because Fiorentina are a very organised team so it will be more difficult to play good football but we will try."</p>
              <p>Benitez has shrugged off criticism of his side's recent defensive lapses, and pointed to the positives of a stunning 24-goal haul so far this term.</p>
              <p>The Anfield chief knows, too, that Spanish striker Fernando Torres has a lot to do with the goals rush, having hit eight in eight games this term. He insists that the team's attacking approach will not change in a difficult away European tie, and that Torres can get even better.</p>
              <p>Benitez said: "Our form has a lot to do with Torres, obviously. In the last three games he has been outstanding. "Torres can still improve, because he likes to learn. He is on fire at the moment and is a key player for us, but the Champions League is more difficult and he is aware of that."</p>
              <p>He added: "We are scoring more goals and not really worried that we have conceded a few more. "Our aim is to score goals and win matches, keeping clean sheets is a bonus. "This has been a very good goalscoring start to the season, I'm told the best for over 100 years at this club. "But even if you score goals and also concede, then someone will see the negative of that."</p>

              <p class="article">Liverpool fell to two first-half goals from Fiorentina wonderkid Stevan Jovetic, 19 - and were lucky not to lose by a hatful. Manager Benitez said: "Never have I seen us struggle so badly as in the first half - it was a poor performance.</p>
              <p class="article">"They were on top of us all the time and we didn't do things like we talked about before the start. We were very bad. </p>
              <p class="article">"Fiorentina did a very good job on us, they pressed us all around the pitch and they pressed us into making mistakes. </p>
              <p class="article">"If you make mistakes then you pay for them, which is exactly what we did. "We had to change everything and the second half was much better - but it was too late by then." </p>
              <p class="article">Jovetic made the most of some awful defending to throw Group E wide open. He beat the offside trap to slot past Pepe Reina and then reacted quicker than Martin Skrtel to prod Juan Vargas' cross-shot home. </p>
              <p class="article">Boss Benitez added: "We knew that Jovetic was a very good player and we expected him to be busy but we gave him too much of an opportunity." </p>
              <p class="article">Benitez called on his troops to show their true colours in Sunday's trip to Stamford Bridge. He added: "You will see a totally different Liverpool at Chelsea in the league."</p>
