              </div>
              <p>Many of us have spent the past three weeks watching the World Cup 
              unfold, rubbing our eyes in disbelief.</p>
              <p>A number of players we
               used to watch in the Premier League have suddenly exploded to life.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/07/article-1292769-0A585BFF000005DC-893_468x286.jpg" alt="Giovanni van Bronckhorst " width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Star man: Giovanni van Bronckhorst celebrates 
              his wonder goal for Holland in the World Cup semi-final</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>A number of flops who left under a dark cloud have shone in South 
              Africa - there are several in the Holland side alone - <span style="font-style: italic;">Ryan Babel you know who I am talking 
              about...  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">So Sportsmail </span>has
               been left asking the question - when did this famous five become so 
              good?</p>
              <h2>Robinho (Manchester City and Brazil)</h2>
              <p>The arrival of Robinho led boss Mark
               Hughes to gush: ‘I am absolutely delighted to get the opportunity to 
              work with such an incredible talent like Robinho’ Sixteen months later, 
              they were both out of the club.</p>
              <p>City fans complained the £32.5m 
              signing from Real Madrid seemed lethargic and there were off-field 
              distractions too – including his ‘unauthorised trip’ home in January 
              2009.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>

              <div class="thinArtSplitter">
              <div class="splitLeft"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/07/article-1292769-07286B7F000005DC-882_224x397.jpg" alt="Robinho of Manchester City" width="224" height="397"></div>
              <div class="splitRight"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/07/article-1292769-0A4007FB000005DC-473_224x397.jpg" alt="Robinho " width="224" height="397"></div>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              </div>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Waste of cash? The Manchester City Robinho
               never scores away from home or looks like he's trying but with Brazil 
              he becomes a whole new player</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Loaned out to former club Santos in January, Robinho returned to our 
              screens in June a different player with Brazil. The creative spark had 
              returned, the cheeky grin was also present - as were calls from fans and
               players to bring him back to Eastlands.  </p>
              <h2>Diego Forlan (Manchester United and Uruguay)</h2>
              <p>It took Forlan an agonising 27 
              games to break his scoring duck after signing for United from 
              Independiente in January 2002. And he only managed a further nine in his
               63 league games for the club. </p>
              <p>He eventually departed for wearing
               the wrong boots! Sir Alex Ferguson insisted he wear long studs, when he
               failed to adhere to the edict and subsequently slipped in front of goal
               – he was out.</p>

              <div class="clear"></div>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em> Forlan figure: The Old Trafford no-hoper 
              bloomed into a Uruguayan world beater </em></p>
              </div>
              <p>His career was resurrected at Villarreal and more recently at 
              Atletico Madrid and has forced his way into the reckoning for player of 
              the tournament in South Africa. Oh, and his goal against Holland wasn’t 
              too shabby, either. </p>
              <h2>Giovanni van Bronckhorst (Arsenal and Holland)<br></h2>
              <p>Granted the former Rangers and 
              Feyenoord winger departed north London with a stack of medals but 
              there’s no denying Arsenal fans didn’t get to see the best of the 
              Holland captain. </p>
              <p>Van Bronckhorst spent three years under Arsene 
              Wenger, picking up a league title and two FA Cups but his tenure was 
              blighted by injury. He made just 41 league appearances for the Gunners 
              before moving to Barcelona.</p>

              </div>
              <p>This tournament is his football swansong, and he’s going out with a 
              bang. Into the final after scoring one of the tournament’s best goals. </p>
              <h2>Giovani
               Dos Santos (Tottenham and Mexico)<br></h2>
              <p>It doesn’t take too much to 
              excite Spurs fans – and the prospect of bringing one of the hottest 
              talents at Barcelona to White Hart Lane was no different. </p>
              <p>The 
              long-suffering fans thought they had brought the new Cesc Fabregas to 
              the club but what they got  was a Fabregas-lite version – plenty of 
              tricks and touches but not much end product.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>New man: Stick him in a Mexico shirt and 
              he's great - stick him in a Tottenham Hotspur shirt and he grates...</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Loaned to Ipswich and then to Galatasaray, Tottenham seemed certain 
              to lose their £4.7m investment in an attempt to off-load him. </p>
              <p>But
               his performances for Mexico have given Harry Redknapp a clue as to what
               Dos Santos is capable of and the playmaker is keen to return to north 
              London.</p>
              <p>He said: 'I can prove myself here with some patience 
              and opportunities. I need to speak to the club to understand how they 
              look at me - but ideally I want to stay.' </p>
              <h2>Juan Veron (Manchester United, Chelsea and Argentina)<br></h2>
              <p>There’s no doubt that Veron 
              arrived at Old Trafford with an impeccable CV but things couldn’t have 
              gone much worse for the holding midfielder.  </p>
              <p>But for £28.1m – and
               a further £15m splashed out by Chelsea - we expected a little more. He 
              managed two years in Manchester and made just nine appearances for 
              Chelsea before being banished never to be seen again (or so we thought).</p>

               arrived at the finals in South Africa in something of a mess but with 
              Veron holding the midfield alongside Javier Mascherano, Maradona’s side 
              excited. Until they met the Germans, that is. Then they exited.</p>
