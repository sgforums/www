And like a drunk at Speaker's Corner, he rambled on about all manner of other stuff. What on earth is he on about?<br><br>RAFA BENITEZ has launched a blistering attack on Manchester United over the Gabriel Heinze saga. The Premier League agreed yesterday that United do not have to sell Heinze to Liverpool Â— despite the player possessing a written guarantee from Red Devils chief executive David Gill. And the decision has left Benitez at boiling point over what he sees as bias towards the champions.</strong><br><br>The Reds boss fumed: "I would like to ask the Premier League a number of questions. "Firstly, how can a player with a signed agreement be treated like this? "He has a document which is clear, but the Premier League prefers to believe the word of someone else who made a mistake. "I know there were accusations made against Liverpool in the Premier League hearing which were unbelievable. How can this be allowed?"<br><br>Benitez also wants an explanation as to why his side normally end up with an away game after international fixtures. He added: "Following an international break, why is it that Liverpool always play the most fixtures away from home in an early kick-off? "We had more than the top clubs last season and we have four already to prepare for this season."<br><br>Benitez's comments are likely to raise more than a few eyebrows at the Premier League. But that did not stop the Spaniard wading into the decision to let United sign Carlos Tevez on a two-year loan. He raged: "Finally, I want to ask the Premier League why it was so difficult for Liverpool to sign Javier Mascherano? "We had to wait a long time for the paperwork, but it was so easy for Tevez to join Manchester United."<br><br>Mascherano joined Liverpool from West Ham in the January transfer window and the deal took weeks to clear as the row over third-party ownership intensified. But Tevez's switch to Old Trafford took less time to approve, with the Argentina star's representatives paying West Ham Â£2million to release his registration in time to beat the transfer deadline.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Gabriel Heinze's representatives tried to bypass Manchester United's block on the player moving to Liverpool by engineering a move to Crystal Palace first. Under the proposal made to Palace, the Argentina defender would have first been bought by the south London club and then sold on to Liverpool.</strong><br><br>The bid was revealed in evidence given to a Premier League panel earlier this week by Palace chief executive Phil Alexander. It is understood Alexander confirmed to the panel that a proposed scheme had been put forward by Heinze's representatives to secure the eventual transfer of the defender to Liverpool by initially transferring him to Palace.<br><br>The panel went on to reject Heinze's bid to force United to sell him to Liverpool. The 29-year-old claimed United had written a letter allowing him to leave if another club offered a fee of Â£6.8million.<br><br>The panel dismissed Heinze's case and backed United, who maintained they made it clear to the 29-year-old both verbally and in writing that he would not be permitted to join one of their title rivals.<br><br>Heinze is appealing against the panel's decision but it now seems if he is intent on leaving United before the transfer window closes he will have to move abroad - although West Ham could match his wage demands and are watching with interest to see the outcome of his appeal.<br><br>Real Madrid have been linked with Heinze, while French club Lyon are also keen on signing the player - who has become unsettled after losing his United first-team place to Patrice Evra.<br><br></div>

The messy saga reached its conclusion with the Argentinian defender joining Real Madrid on a four-year contract. </strong><br><br>Heinze, 29, was still considering whether to launch an appeal against the decision when the Spanish champions made their move. Liverpool manager Benitez could not hide his hurt at seeing the player finally slip out of his grasp.<br><br>He said: 'I am really disappointed with the situation because we had 100% confidence he would be arriving at Liverpool. 'But after the hearing it was impossible for him to remain here. He was so disappointed he knew he would have to go to another country.' Benitez maintains that his club got a raw deal from the panel that adjudicated on the matter. 'It was a special situation - because we are Liverpool,' he said. 'The verdict was a surprise for everyone, our lawyers, the player and his agent. I could not believe it.'<br><br>Although Heinze still wanted to explore the Liverpool option, he knew that by dragging the situation out even further, his chances of moving out of England before the August 31 transfer deadline would effectively disappear. Having already had one lot of talks with Real earlier in the summer, he opted to join them instead. Benitez is now considering his options following Heinze's departure to Spain although he is running out of time with the transfer window due to close in eight days.<br><br>However he insists his focus at the moment is on the Premier League match against newly-promoted Sunderland at the Stadium of Light on Saturday. Benitez said: 'We need to analyse the situation and look at the squad. It is not easy to find a player of Heinze's quality.<br><br>'However for the moment we have to concentrate on the game at Sunderland. That is the important thing.' England midfielder Steven Gerrard is expected to be ruled out because of a broken toe. However Benitez claims he has enough good cover at the club to cope with Gerrard's absence. 'It is clear we have a better squad and more players in this position, said the Anfield coach.<br><br>'If we need to manage now it will be easier, I am sure.'</div>
