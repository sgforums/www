              <h1>Manchester United Ready To Move For Real Madrid Hitman Karim 
              Benzema - Report</h1>
              <h2>The French international could be on his way out of the Santigao
               Bernabeu...</h2>
              <div id="small_article_image_container"><img src="http://u.goal.com/93500/93555_news.jpg" alt="Karim Benzema, Real Madrid (Getty Images)"></div>

              </div>
              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> French international Karim Benzema appears to be on his way out 
              of La Liga giants Real 
              Madrid following English powerhouse Manchester 
              United's decision to make a move for the highly rated striker, if a 
              report in <em>Marca </em>is to be believed.<br><br>Manchester United are
               desperate to land a new attacker in the summer transfer window and 
              manager Sir Alex Ferguson has supposedly made the capture of Benzema one
               of his primary objectives ahead of the 2010-11 campaign.<br><br>Benzema
               joined the Blancos from Olympique Lyon in the summer of 2009, but the 
              22-year-old has failed to live up to expectations in Madrid so far. <br><br>With
               Real pondering a swoop for Arsenal attacker Robin van Persie, Benzema 
              could decide to leave the Spanish titans again after just one season in 
              order to get regular first team football elsewhere.<br><br>The report 
              claims that United are preparing a €30 million offer for the former Lyon
               star and Madrid are likely to cash in on Benzema if an offer in that 
              region comes in. They paid €35m to Lyon last term to add Benzema to 
              their ranks. </span></p>

              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> Manchester
               United are looking to jettison Dimitar
               Berbatov and Anderson
               in order to fund a £24 million bid for Real Madrid
               striker Karim 
              Benzema, according to AS.<br><br>Benzema, 22, was a target for Sir 
              Alex Ferguson last summer before he chose a move to the Spanish capital.
               Despite missing out on the France World Cup 2010 squad and grabbing 
              nine goals in 32 appearances, the Scot remains a firm fan of the 
              forward.<br><br>With money tight at Old Trafford, he is believed to be 
              ready to cut loose Anderson and Berbatov to be able to afford his man. 
              United are hopeful Bayern Munich will offer £20m for the Bulgarian, 
              while French trio Olympique Lyonnais, Olympique Marseille and Paris 
              Saint Germain all expressed an interest in Anderson before a knee 
              ligament injury in the New Year.</span></p>

              <p>Agree with you on your first point. Maybe England's dismay performance in the World Cup is a blessing in disguise as United's English players can get some rest.</p>
              <p>Now United has Rooney, Berbatov, Owen, Hernandez, Diouf and Welback leading the line. To be frank, i do not forsee Diouf and Welback leading the line, they would most probably be out on loan. Hernandez could be useful provided his form at World Cup remains. Owen is a wildcard - Use at your own risk. Berbatov is enigmatic and cant perform in big matches. Looks like Rooney is the only one left standing. A recruit like Benzema would be good.</p>
              <p>Anderson should stay unless Fergie successfully sign Sneijder as well. I forsee Hargreaves getting injured again, Carrick going downhill and Gibson turning out to be just another "Scholes successor" imposter. Fletcher should up his game after a summer off without International duty.</p>

              rather fergie go buy midfielders than a striker, because united
              midfield need an overhauling. scholes is already 35 and giggs is
              36, how much stamina do they have now, not to mention the lack of
              pace. it would be good if sneider were to come, so is ozil. That
              said, I be happy if Benzema is to come.</p>

              <p>in the past, yes, MU can waltz into the transfer market and state terms. Now, with bigger sharks in the water, it is not as easy as ABC or for that matter, DEF anymore. Plus, any established star players are potential targets not just for MU and MU may not be on the top of their lists given the cash these bigger sharks can litter.</p>
              <p>And given the dismal season the three u mentioned, carrick, anderson, berba, U expect top $$$??</p>
