              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">LIVERPOOL'S £35million striker Andy Carroll was officially valued at £1m by Newcastle at the start of last season. And relegated Toon were not even convinced they should keep Carroll for their promotion push back to the Premier League - marking him down as one of their squad to "monitor".</h2>
              <p>SunSport can today reveal the incredible change in fortunes for both Carroll, 22, and owner Mike Ashley after we learned of the club business plan for 2009-10.</p>
              <p>The document was put together for prospective bidders after Ashley publicly declared he wanted to sell the club.</p>
              <p>It is a detailed breakdown of the entire 21-man senior playing staff, including their individual transfer values along with a key code next to each name indicating whether they should be retained, sold or monitored.</p>
              <p>Carroll was involved in the Newcastle side which went down to the Championship. But his future, like many Toon stars, was up in the air.</p>
              <p>He had scored only three goals in 14 Premier League games and the jury was out.</p>
              <p>However, the big forward hit the ground running in the Championship campaign - bagging 17 goals in 39 matches as Newcastle romped to the title.</p>
              <p>Then, after continuing with 11 in 19 games in the Premier League this season and winning a first England cap against France, Carroll's value went through the roof.</p>
              <p>Spurs tried to get him for £20m in January but Kop boss Kenny Dalglish struck on transfer deadline day after selling Fernando Torres to Chelsea for £50m.</p>
              <p>A Newcastle source said: "There were soundings taken around the club about how players should be valued and there was a feeling Andy still had to prove himself.</p>
              <p>"He was a young lad who wasn't established in the first team and he had limited experience in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>"It was a case of seeing how he got on at the start of last season. "Andy did really well and started scoring plenty of goals. "But if anyone had come in with a £1m offer that summer you wonder what the club would have done."</p>
              <p>The likes of Obafemi Martins, who scored Sunday's Carling Cup winner for Birmingham against Arsenal, and Sebastien Bassong were both given £8m price tags - and were sold in the summer of 2009.</p>
              <p>Martins had been listed as one to sell and went to German side Wolfsburg for £9m. Bassong, in the retained column, was still flogged to Spurs for his £8m valuation.</p>
              <p>Newcastle were desperately trying to get the high wage-earners off their books as they prepared for life in the lower division. </p>
              <p>And they were ready to take a big hit on the fees they had paid. Defender Fabricio Coloccini, who had joined for £10.5m from Deportivo La Coruna a year earlier, was on sale for £3m because the Toon wanted to save on his £70,000-a-week wages. </p>
              <p>Argentinian wideman Jonas Gutierrez, signed for around £10m a year before, was also up for grabs at £3m. Irish winger Damien Duff, rated at £3m, went to Fulham for that amount and defender Habib Beye joined Aston Villa for £2.5m - even though both were identified as players to keep.</p>
              <p>Newcastle were also trying to shift Spanish full-back Jose Enrique for just over half what they had paid for him two years earlier. Enrique cost £6.3m from Villarreal but was marked as one to sell for £3.5m. Enrique, who had not impressed at the time, is now considered one of Newcastle's most valuable assets but will only have a year left on his contract at the end of this season.</p>
              <p>Liverpool are interested in reuniting him with Carroll and Newcastle will probably cash in if they get an offer of around £10m.</p>
              <p>The Toon were also planning to offload Alan Smith, on £60,000 a week, for £3m and striker Shola Ameobi for £2m. But there were no takers. Nor could a deal be done for Joey Barton, also on £60,000.</p>
              <p>The midfielder was valued at £1.5m and listed in the sell column. Barton had been involved in a late-season bust-up with caretaker boss Alan Shearer and the club had made it plain he could go.</p>
              <p>Newcastle's relegated squad was valued at £56m in total.</p>
              <p>The aim was to bring in £28m from player sales - and they were on the way to achieving their target with the transfers of Beye, Duff, Bassong and Martins.</p>
              <p>The Toon insider added: "The document would have been available to anyone who wished to go through the due diligence process with a view to buying the club.</p>
              <p>"Carroll was really an unknown quantity at the time and considering he was only valued at £1m, you have to say Ashley has done fantastic business to get £35m for him."</p>

              <p>many times, you look at a player's face and you can tell can make it or not.............</p>
              <p>Carroll cannot make it.....................</p>

              <p>example.................when Adriano (former Inter Milan) was at Parma..................you see his face you can tell there's a lot of ''menace'' in his face.............</p>
              <p>later when he lost all form......................he looks like a smiling buddha..................totally harmless-looking..............</p>

              <p>I think he will come good in time but the present day, he was over-priced by Newcastle...</p>
              <p>I will be fair to say he should be worth at about $20m just for being English, young and also shown some good potential... He is a risk but could come good.</p>
              <p>The only thing that will always be hard to justify is the sum he was sold at this present time...</p>
