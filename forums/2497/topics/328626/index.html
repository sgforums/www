              <h1>Unpleasant but ingenious <br>Mourinho divides a nation</h1>
              <h3>Tens of thousands of votes received in our online survey asking you what adjective best describes the personality of the Portuguese tactician. Survey reveals that percentage of readers who disapprove of him is almost identical to that of readers who respect him</h3>
              <p><img title="Jose Mourinho smiles: Inter fans already love him. Afp" src="http://images.gazzetta.it/Hermes%20Foto/2008/08/26/0K64M3IF--346x212.jpg" border="0" alt="Jose Mourinho smiles: Inter fans already love him. Afp"></p>
              <p><em>Best adjective to describes</em> <em>Jose Mourinho  -  </em><strong>Unpleasant </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="p">One thing that we can confidently say about Jose Mourinho is that he's certainly a man that can raise a discussion. It has been almost three months since June 3rd, when the Special One introduced himself to the Italian public at Inter's La Pinetina training complex flaunting an already enviable use of the Italian language. Since then, the new Inter manager has moulded the side to reflect his own style, he has teased his rivals and those around him and has attracted upon himself the envy that men of his success have to inevitably learn to live with.</div>

              <div class="p"><span style="font-weight: bold;">THOUSANDS OF VOTES</span> - In just a few hours, over 60 thousand fans have voted in our online <a class="a" href="http://www.gazzetta.it/appsSondaggi/pages/gazzetta/d_http:/www.gazzetta.it/appsSondaggi/votazioneDispatch.do?method=risultati&amp;idSondaggio=3160.jsp"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">survey</span></span></a> - which can be found on our homepage - and it has emerged that there is a divide of opinions as to how to best describe the Portuguese tactician's distinct personality: at the time of writing, there are slightly more readers who think of him as unpleasant, but only marginally less who believe him to be an ingenious person. There were also many of you who choose the adjectives troublemaker, cunning or competent. On the other hand, there were only very few people who thought of Mancini's successor as funny, down-to-earth or diplomatic. Overall however, the clearest trend to emerge is that the number of people who view him under a negative light is almost equal to those who think the direct opposite. But the results of the survey are very much just provisional: there is in fact still time until this evening to cast your vote.</div>
