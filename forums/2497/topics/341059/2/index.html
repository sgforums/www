              <p class="ss-text-bold">Jose Mourinho is happy to have been drawn against 'the best' with Manchester United awaiting in the UEFA Champions League.</p>
              <p>The former Porto and Chelsea manager saw his Inter
              Milan charges paired with the reigning European and Premier League
              champions in the last 16 of Europe's leading club competition.</p>
              <p>The
              Portuguese guided Porto to a memorable Champions League victory at Old
              Trafford on their way to lifting the trophy in 2004 and enjoyed Premier
              League success over Ferguson with the Blues in 2005 and 2006.</p>
              <p>Inter will host the first leg at Giuseppe Meazza in February before travelling to Old Trafford for the return fixture in March.</p>
              <h4>Unforgettable</h4>
              <p>Mourinho
              told a news conference: "I am satisfied, I wanted the best and I have
              got the European champions who maybe in two days will be world
              champions.</p>
              <p>"It is a team with the current Ballon D'Or winner
              (Cristiano Ronaldo), a great coach in Alex Ferguson and a stadium with
              a fantastic atmosphere.</p>
              <p>"It will be unforgettable returning to Manchester.</p>
              <p>"Some say I have a good record against Alex Ferguson but the record isn't mine, it's Chelsea's."</p>
              <h5>Arsenal</h5>
              <p>There
              are three Italy v England ties in the last 16 of the tournament with
              Chelsea up against Juventus and Arsenal tackling Roma.</p>
              <p>And Mourinho feels that the side from the Eternal City have the easiest opponents in the shape of Arsene Wenger's Gunners.</p>
              <p>He added: "They are three 50/50 matches, anyone can win.</p>
              <p>"Roma,
              however, will meet an opponent a little easier than ours or Juve's
              because Arsenal are neither Chelsea nor Manchester United."</p>

              <p>Somehow Mourinho's relationship with Fergie seems very good... They are like friends now with huge mutual respect. Can't say the same with Ben and Wenger...</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">ALEX FERGUSON is relishing his clash with Jose Mourinho. The pair will come face-to-face once more after Manchester United were paired with Inter Milan in the Champions League last 16 draw.</h2>
              <p class="article">Fergie and Mourinho have a big rivalry dating back to when Porto knocked United out of the 2004 tournament. And the Scot today said: “It will be interesting to come up against Jose again.</p>
              <p class="article">“He is a character with a good personality and I have always got on well with him. “He knocked us out of the competition when he was at Porto, so I hope we have the luck they had in that tie this time around.”</p>
              <p class="article">Fergie is under no illusion over the task they face when they meet the Italian champions. He added: “They have had a tremendous domestic record in recent years. “They have also got a lot of experience in their team which includes quite a few South American players. In fact I think they have only got two Italians in their team.</p>
              <p class="article">"That in itself represents a tough challenge because you know that South American players defensively are always very tough and resilient players. “Hopefully we can do the job there in the first game and give ourselves a platform to take back to Old Trafford.</p>
              <p class="article">“The San Siro is a great stadium to play in. We’ve lost two semi-finals to AC Milan there so we want to go there and do better. “This is the stage when the competition gets going and I think all the English teams have a good chance.</p>
              <p class="article">"I’m happy with our draw.” Mourinho later admitted that he was happy to be facing United. He said: “I am satisfied, I wanted the best and I have got the European champions, who maybe in two days will be world champions.</p>
              <p class="article">“It is a team with the current Ballon D’Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, a great coach in Alex Ferguson and a stadium with a fantastic atmosphere. "It will be unforgettable returning to Manchester. Some say I have a good record against Alex Ferguson but the record isn’t mine, it’s Chelsea’s.”</p>
