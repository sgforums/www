            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Louis Saha is hoping his side can inflict more psychological pain on Chelsea in the race for the title with victory over Liverpool on Saturday.<br><br>The Red Devils are currently nine points clear at the top of the table and would widen the gap to 12 should they be victorious at Anfield this weekend.<br><br>However, with Chelsea due to play the first of what would then be two matches in hand over Sir Alex Ferguson's team at Portsmouth on Saturday, Saha knows three points against Liverpool would put serious pressure on their rivals.<br><br>"It is going to be a massive, massive game at Liverpool," said the United frontman.<br><br>"If we get a win at Anfield it will open up a big gap and give us a great psychological advantage for us over Chelsea.<br><br>"It would be great to have that gap before Chelsea play but we have to make sure that we concentrate on ourselves and play with confidence."<br><br>United have not lost at Liverpool in the Premiership since 2001, though they failed to score on two of their trips to Anfield last term.<br><br>Liverpool however have been in excellent form of late and have not conceded a league goal on home turf since October.<br><br>And although many believe a win at Anfield would surely clinch the title for Ferguson's side, Saha remains sceptical.<br><br>"There will still be nine games left, which represents a huge amount of points," he said.<br><br>"We have to keep our concentration because we saw at Reading on Tuesday how quickly gaps can close. The team are playing well and we have to maintain that."<br><br>Saha netted his first goal since December in the win against Reading earlier in the week, taking his tally to 13 this season.<br><br>The French forward will be fighting it out with Henrik Larsson for a starting place on Saturday, with Wayne Rooney looking almost certain to start.<br><br>Saha is hoping his impressive performance in the tie against Reading, which saw three goals inside the opening six minutes, will secure him a place alongside Rooney.<br><br>"It was an amazing opening but sometimes, when everyone is in good form at the same time, things like that do happen," he reflected.<br><br>"You work hard in training every day to improve yourself, so it was really nice to see those goals go in."</span></div>
