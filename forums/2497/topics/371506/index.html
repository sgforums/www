              </span></p><p>Frank Lampard claims even Brazil must wish they had some of the talent that England coach Fabio Capello can call on.</p>
              <p>England take on Holland in a friendly in Amsterdam on Wednesday
              and Lampard believes the Italian coach's pool of players looks strong.</p>
              <p>England need only two more points to be certain of qualifying
              for the World Cup finals and there is a growing belief that 2010 could
              be their year for glory.</p>
              <p>The good news for Capello is that, unlike with club managers,
              he does not have to worry about rival bosses lining up moves for his
              players.</p>
              <p>"It's certainly a relief not to have to worry about that,"
              admitted Lampard, who was speaking at an event organised by England
              team sponsors Nationwide Building Society.</p>
              <p>"All teams want to hold onto their best players and that's the
              same at Chelsea - we're very pleased to be holding on to John Terry.</p>
              <p>"With England it's nice to be settled. The last year has been
              very settled as a group, the squad has stayed mainly the same and we're
              becoming more comfortable with each other. We should believe in
              ourselves because individual-wise our players have got the talent to
              match anyone."</p>
              <p>Spain are the European champions and Brazil continue to produce the kind of flair that wins them fans all over the world.</p>
              <p>But Lampard has no doubts that Brazil would be reaching for
              their chequebook and trying to buy England players if international
              rules allowed.</p>
              <p>"I think they would," Lampard said. "I'm certain they would
              look at some of the players because we've got top, top players who
              perform in Champions League and are some of the best in the world.</p>
              <p>"You're talking about Wayne Rooney, Steven Gerrard, John Terry,
              Rio Ferdinand. Those guys could be compared to any player in the world
              and I'm sure teams like Brazil would want them in their teams.</p>
              <p>"That's the big plus we have got to take from outside and try
              and make sure we play to our potential and play together and do well as
              a group."</p>
