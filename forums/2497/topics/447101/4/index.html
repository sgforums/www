              <p><br>Let me provide a thought experiment... Let's say we have two countries coming close to war, basically very high tensions... and here we have the presidents of the 2 countries coming together... their actions have implications to what happened next... if they choose to make peace, then tensions reduced/save lives... if they choose to go to war, then tensions increased/people lose their lives...</p>
              <p>Now, does it matter whether they personally like or don't like to go for peace? If it's for the greater benefit beyond that 1 individual, then it matters. If it's a selfish individual who only cares about himself, then it doesn't matter. Selfish individual mentality is like North Korea Kim where his life is good but he never care about the suffering North Koreans.</p>
              <p>So whether it's geniune or pretend to shake hands, as long as he did it, it reduced tensions and close the issue. It's beneficial to both sets of fans and players whether to geniunely or pretend to do it, but that 1 individual only thinks of himself.</p>

              <p><br> Let me provide a thought experiment... Let's say we have two
              countries coming close to war, basically very high tensions... and
              here we have the presidents of the 2 countries coming together...
              their actions have implications to what happened next... if they
              choose to make peace, then tensions reduced/save lives... if they
              choose to go to war, then tensions increased/people lose their
              lives...</p>
              <p>Now, does it matter whether they personally like or don't
              like to go for peace? If it's for the greater benefit
              beyond that 1 individual, then it matters. If it's a selfish
              individual who only cares about himself, then it doesn't matter.
              Selfish individual mentality is like North Korea Kim where his
              life is good but he never care about the suffering North
              Koreans.</p>
              <p>So whether it's geniune or pretend to shake hands, as long as he
              did it, it reduced tensions and close the issue. It's beneficial to
              both sets of fans and players whether to geniunely or pretend to do
              it, but that 1 individual only thinks of himself.</p>

              <p>you are more deluded, more like self deluding. look, who is the aggressor here? then what is suarez's role in this? victim? oh my goodness, playing the victim card again when he is the transgressor. in my opinion, he should be hauled up to court and be charged. I dunno why Terry is hauled up to court to explain when suarez isn't. beats me.</p>
