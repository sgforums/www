              <p>With Fergie's uncalled for statement to the media calling Suarez a disgrace to Liverpool, he should be reminded of certain players formerly from Man U who had committed disgraceful acts in the past such as Cantona, Roy Keane, Gary Neville etc. So what now if Liverpool has the fair share of similar players? Totally a non-diplomatic act by long serving manager....</p>
              <p>At the final whistle, Evra engaged in a prolonged and exaggerated 
                                      celebration, at one point right in front of Suárez, which even Ferguson 
                                      conceded he should not have done.</p>
              <p>The pathetic part was when Rio Ferdinand too refused to shake Suarez's hand. Well, what goes round comes around, Rio got his piece when he collided with Evra....ouch!!</p>
              <p>Apparently, the main attraction was the pre-match handshake. Most people who against Suarez may concluded that he is the pain in the arse by not accepting Evra's handshake. Was that really happening? Most would say yes.</p>
              <p>But let's look at it in other perspective where most people have overlooked. I believed Reina was the closest witness to that. Go to the video link below and judge for yourself:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80Oed8OT4vw&amp;feature=related"><strong>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80Oed8OT4vw&amp;feature=related</strong></a></p>
              <p>It was not a famous result for Liverpool but who cares Man U won when all the attention went to Suarez and Evra and Rio?</p>
              <p>At least the Kop fans will be looking forward to the Carling Cup final and still in the run for the FA cup. An excellent consolation for all Kop fans..... YNWA!!</p>

              <p>Do
                       you think by typing those "Liverpool - Defending Racism" would change 
                      anything...pleeeeeaaasssseee. Go on read up the history of racism in 
                      England or at least in EPL history. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/sunglasses.png" alt="sunglasses.png"></p>
              <p>Liverpool
                       has been forthcoming towards anti-racism movement for years. John 
                      Barnes was the most abused player in the EPL those days. The same fans 
                      in Old Trafford shouted racist remarks along with banana skins thrown at
                       him those days (FA don't do anything) and now the same Old Trafford fans trying to educate the world about racism???!!!! You silly boy...if you aren't then please don't be one. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>This
                       racism call is England's national issue where sooner or later the FA 
                      would realised that they have shot themselves at their own foot. They 
                      are trying to teach foreigners how to behave with regard to racism 
                      whilst under their nose their countrymen are doing it. They try to 
                      dictate everyone internally but again failed to defend their national 
                      team being abused whilst in Spain years ago. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>The reason this topic was created because it seemed biased for 
                      not having Kop's space for consolation. Definitely not for firing squads.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>You could have just gone to contribute inputs to the 
                      topics created by <em>zocoss</em> or yourself where all Man U supporters like you belonged. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
