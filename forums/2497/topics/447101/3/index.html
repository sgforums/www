              <p>yes but then he was still unrepentent and kenny was still defending him. how could you defend the indefensible. racism is a serious problem blighting our societies, not to mention in a football match.</p>
              <p>how does it feel when you are a black and someone insulted you a negro or black?</p>
              <p>and from your comments, you are just like kenny, defending the indefensible and attack Evra for his acting? look, who is playing the victim here?</p>
              <p>anyway the black players in EPL, would target Suarez. by saying Evra is a negro, he insulted all the black players in EPL and the world playing the game.</p>

              <p>I am truly sorry for your soul....dude. God have mercy!!</p>
              <p>You are the one that have been missing out on all the post. You brought up the post which I've already put to rest.</p>
              <p>Firstly, have you really checked my first post which is the FIRST reply post with regard to this thread? Which I would quote below:</p>
              <p><strong>"The reason this topic was created because it seemed biased for not having Kop's space for consolation. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Definitely not for firing squads. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>You could have just gone to contribute inputs to the topics
                                                      created by <em>zocoss</em></strong><strong><em> </em>or yourself where all Man U supporters
                                                      like you belonged.</strong>"</p>
              <p>I really appreaciate how <strong><em>omgukilledkenny</em> </strong>and  <strong><em>zocoss</em></strong> for his understanding and sportsmanship and for giving the space for consolation. But I don't see why <strong>Jacky Woo</strong> failed to read it.</p>
              <p>Referring
                                           to your concern on the racism blighting our societies. I feel fortunate
                                           to have lived in Singapore and I don't get you by saying it as if all of
                                           us are living in UK. Unless this instigating stop, the virus could 
                                          spread in Singapore too by irresponsible instigators.</p>
              <p>Why instigate Liverpool fans? Man U is far better than Liverpool in current state which I as a hardcore Liverpool fan could not be intimidated even by how successful Man U could be. It's all in the traditional rivalry and so I will let it take its own course.</p>
              <p>As a Liverpool fan defending their players regardless of what they did, it's pretty norm and which hardcore fans doesn't. But why need to instigate when Man U is far from Liverpool current situation. Why? Why still there's inferiority? Why?</p>
              <p>If inferiority does not exist, then you ought to let it take its own course and be proud of being Man U fan...that's all.</p>
              <p>I've said it and I say it again....I just leave it and let nature takes its course
                                                                  rather than trying to be the one acting as if we are in direct control
                                                                  of each others' club. I am not even having 1% of Liverpool profit sharing and what can I do.....definitely not instigating.</p>
              <p>Funny it is as funny as one does it dude...</p>
              <p>All the best dude. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>

              <p><br>i never go and read, coz so long... i only extremely against racism because to some people, it's just racism, small thing... but racism has involved lives before, not just in soccer in uk but also in Singapore, we used to have racist fights which many people have died and suffer in (this one u need to check sg history). Racism doesn't belong in a good world.</p>

              <p>let's all kick racism out of soccer. racism does not have a

                  a better person but unfortunately suarez took the low ground and

              <p>Yes I was very young that time when there was racial riots in Singapore and one my distant relative was killed and dragged by a bus. Yes of course racism do not have the space in our society. Thank you for a refresher. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>But for EPL, there's nothing currently justifies racism being smartly handled so much of the (PFA) intelligence is concerned. It takes two to tango and I would prefer not to judge that "bastard" you called racist just because of his misadventure. He may be the nastiest player as he has the nerve of steel as some fans may claimed but with all his wrong doings in the past, one can't judge him by making him an auto racist just by one emotionally striked incident. Even one can prefer to argue more on that but I would insist that there's more than meets the eye.</p>

              <p>I am truly sorry for your soul....dude. God have mercy!!</p>
              <p>You are the one that have been missing out on all the post. You brought up the post which I've already put to rest.</p>
              <p>Firstly, have you really checked my first post which is the FIRST reply post with regard to this thread? Which I would quote below:</p>
              <p><strong>"The reason this topic was created because it seemed biased for not having Kop's space for consolation. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Definitely not for firing squads.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>You could have just gone to contribute inputs to the topics created by <em>zocoss</em></strong> <strong>or yourself where all Man U supporters like you belonged.</strong>"</p>
              <p>I really appreaciate how <strong><em>omgukilledkenny</em></strong> and  <strong><em>zocoss</em></strong> for his understanding and sportmanship and for giving the space for consolation. But I don't see why <strong>Jack Woo</strong> failed to read it.</p>
              <p>Referring to your concern on the racism blighting our societies. I feel fortunate to have lived in Singapore and I don't get you by saying it as if all of us are living in UK. Unless this instigating stop, the virus could spread in Singapore too by irresponsible instigators.</p>
              <p>Why instigate Liverpool fans? Man U is far better than Liverpool in current state which I as a hardcore Liverpool fan could not be intimidated even by how successful Man U could be. It's all in the traditional rivalry and so I will let it take its own course.</p>
              <p>As a Liverpool fan defending their players regardless of what they did, it's pretty norm and which hardcore fans doesn't. But why need to instigate when Man U is far from Liverpool current situation. Why? Why still there's inferiority? Why?</p>
              <p>If inferiority does not exist, then you ought to let it take its own course and be proud of being Man U fan...that's all.</p>
              <p>I've said it and I say it again....I just leave it and let nature takes its course rather trying to be the one acting as if we are in direct control of each others' club. I am not even having 1% of Liverpool profit sharing and what can I do.....definitely not instigating.</p>
              <p>Funny it is as funny as one does it dude...</p>

                      Patrice Evra. He has not only let himself down, but also Kenny Dalglish,
                       his teammates and the Club. It has been made absolutely clear to Luis 
                      Suarez that his behaviour was not acceptable.</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool striker Luis Suarez has today issued
                                      the following apology:</strong></p>
              <p>"I have spoken with the manager since the game at Old Trafford
                                      and I realise I got things wrong.<br> <br> "I've not only let him down, but also the Club and what it stands
                                      for and I'm sorry. I made a mistake and I regret what
                                      happened.<br> <br> "I should have shaken Patrice Evra's hand before the game and I
                                      want to apologise for my actions.<br> <br> "I would like to put this whole issue behind me and concentrate on
                                      playing football."</p>
              <div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool Managing Director Ian Ayre has today
                                      released the following statement.</strong></p>
              <p>"We are extremely disappointed Luis Suarez did not shake hands
                                      with Patrice Evra before yesterday's game. The player had told us
                                      beforehand that he would, but then chose not to do so.</p>
              <p>"He was wrong to mislead us and wrong not to offer his hand to
                                      Patrice Evra. He has not only let himself down, but also Kenny
                                      Dalglish, his teammates and the Club. It has been made absolutely
                                      clear to Luis Suarez that his behaviour was not acceptable.</p>
              <p>"Luis Suarez has now apologised for his actions which was the
                                      right thing to do. However, all of us have a duty to behave in a
                                      responsible manner and we hope that he now understands what is
                                      expected of anyone representing Liverpool Football Club."</p>
              <div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish today insisted
                                      Luis Suarez is right to apologise for failing to shake Patrice
                                      Evra's hand at Old Trafford.</strong></p>
              <p>"Ian Ayre has made the Club's position absolutely clear and it
                                      is right that Luis Suarez has now apologised for what happened at
                                      Old Trafford," said Dalglish.</p>
              <p>"To be honest, I was shocked to hear that the player had not
                                      shaken hands having been told earlier in the week that he would
                                      do. </p>
              <p>"But as Ian said earlier, all of us have a responsibility to
                                      represent this Club in a fit and proper manner and that applies
                                      equally to me as Liverpool manager.  </p>
              <p>"When I went on TV after yesterday's game I hadn't seen what had
                                      happened, but I did not conduct myself in a way befitting of a
                                      Liverpool manager during that interview and I'd like to apologise
                                      for that."</p>

              <p>That's about it to sum it up...though seriously. Good for Man U then.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>Well, as for the Kops, we got to sort things out bit by bit. Not all Kops are happy with the team performances but we shall support the club through thick and thin. With the bullshits here and there, no Kops going to commit to any statement until it is clearly comes from the top management itself. And it just did.</p>
              <p>So it's interesting to see the next development. And that's what I called let the nature takes its own course. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>

              <p><br>You don't understand... it's EPL and watched by millions all over... their actions have serious consequences... their actions can incite hatred and increase violence between the 2 sets of fans... very simple, if Suarez had shaked hands, we weren't even be here debating or arguing about the whole issue... in UK with those punks, they would probably be stabbing each other... it's serious consequences because those sets of fans look up to their idols in soccer... so heavy responsbilities comes about because they should be role models and they have to take the high moral ground... remember how "someone" criticise the referee so badly that his life was threatened and then he quit refereeing altogether? this is an example of how ones action, given their position, has serious impact after the game... and racism has to be removed at that level.</p>
