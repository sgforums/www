              <h3>ARSENE WENGER has threatened to quit Arsenal if Russian oligarch Alisher 
              Usmanov wins the battle to seize control of the club.</h3>
              <p>I understand Wenger has made it plain to the Gunners board he will not work 
              under Usmanov and would move to Real Madrid instead.</p>
              <p>And that is one of the reasons behind Stan Kroenke's stealthy takeover at 
              the Emirates. The American billionaire has taken his stake in the club to 
              just less than the 30 per cent needed to spark a takeover bid, leaving 
              Usmanov puzzled at his motives.</p>
              <p>However, senior Arsenal sources believe Kroenke's attempt to push Usmanov out 
              of the picture is to help protect Wenger's position.</p>
              <p>The Gunners boss has no interest in the lavish promises Usmanov has made in an 
              attempt to win his battle for power. The Russian has said that if his Red 
              and White group seizes control of the club he would inject over £100 million 
              to strengthen the Arsenal squad.</p>
              <p>After Arsenal were knocked out of last season's Champions League by Manchester 
              United, Usmanov went public - insisting Wenger should buy big.</p>
              <p>But the Arsenal boss remains convinced his policy of developing a new team 
              based on nurturing young players rather than importing expensive superstars 
              is the way ahead.</p>
              <p>An Arsenal insider said: "If somehow Usmanov managed to take control then 
              Arsene, who is otherwise utterly loyal to the club, would quit.</p>
              <p>"He doesn't want any owner interfering with the way he is developing the team. 
              He has long been resistant to bringing big money signings in.</p>
              <p>"He has a plan and everyone is seeing it come to fruition. That's not to say 
              along the way he won't bring in some players but he will only do so on his 
              terms. Arsene has made the board very aware of that and that he couldn't 
              work with an owner who insists on spending big money on new players.</p>
              <p>"As it stands Arsene is happy working with Kroenke on the board because he has 
              shown no interest in interfering. The same can't be said for Usmanov."</p>
              <p>Last summer Wenger turned down a firm offer from Madrid to move to Spain.</p>
              <p>It was not the first time Madrid had come calling but Wenger remains adamant 
              he won't break his contract.</p>

              <p><br>I think Fergie was one of the most happiest man when the Glazers took over from his former horse racing buddies turn enemy after their lawsuit... They gave him lots of problems while they were the majority shareholders... He is still the only manager on a rolling contract probably in the whole premiership... And this is largely due to the former horse racing owners at United...</p>
