              <p><span></span></p>
              <p><strong>Avram Grant may have been "hurt and upset" at being sacked by his close friend Roman Abramovich but he has also been made very, very rich.</strong></p>
              <p>The Israeli, dismissed on Saturday afternoon after being summoned to the Chelsea owner's London mansion, is understood to have rejected an invitation to become the club's Director of Football and instead demanded that his contract was paid up in full. Grant reputedly complained to friends that he was "betrayed" by Chelsea and felt "hurt and upset" by his ousting, yet he cannot deny he was well paid for his troubles: With his compensation package believed to exceed £5m, Grant's eight-month stint as Chelsea manager will have earned him around £8m.</p>
              <p>'Grant's £980,000-a-year contract as director of football was upgraded to £2.8 million last December after he had become first-team coach. Two days of negotiating with Peter Kenyon at Stamford Bridge on Friday and Saturday proved even more lucrative. Grant received a payoff of £5.2 million, which, although that is less than half of what Jose Mourinho was awarded, it still represents riches beyond the wildest imaginings of a man whose most high-profile job before joining Chelsea was managing Israel, where he earned £100,000,' reports The Times.</p>
              <p>Upon leaving Abramovich's London residence, Grant returned to Chelsea's training ground to clear his desk. He has since returned to his homeland where he continues to be feted as a hero.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, Grant leaves Chelsea with his reputation, as well as his bank balance, significantly enhanced. According to reports, Manchester City are considering the Israeli as a replacement for the doomed Sven-Goran Eriksson.</p>

              <p>Actually, what he said was quite true, he took on the Chelsea job at a difficult time but then again, I think a lot of people would not mind taking on the job either. Probably Chelsea management felt they should let someone from within do the job first, and now that the season is ended and they can start anew, they just give him a chance to move on and have someone start over.</p>
              <p>It's actually a very corperate approach to it all but end of the day, it should be for the best interests of the club and the team.</p>
