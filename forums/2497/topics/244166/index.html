            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/Real_madrid.gif"><br><br><strong>The question is... Is Real Madrid Losing its attraction?</strong><br><br>Real Madrid has not won the Spanish title in the last 3 yrs, and during this time they didn't even came close to Barce in the league...<br><br>As we saw from last season... Players like Fabregas and Kaka have turn them down or are not interested to join them when they came calling...<br><br>Now we are hearing that their no. 1 target for next season Ronaldo is also not interested in joining them... And if you thought that it couldn't get any worse... Rafael Benitez, a Spaniard himself who they had put right at the top of their wanted list as manager today stated that he is 'completely committed' to the Anfield club and wasn't interested on taking up the managerial job there.<br><br>Seems like lately, players are refusing to join them that they ended up buying players that their clubs wanted to get rid off... Players like 33 yrs old Fabio Cannavaro, highly paid but was getting on in years... Juventus got rid of him for roughly 20 million euros at the same time reducing a huge chunk in their salary budget after being relegated to the lower league... Next, Ruud van Nistelrooy... another 30 yrs old player also on a very high salary with his previous club. His previous club wanted to get rid off him too after arguments with its manager... Then there is David Beckham... Real had a new 2-4 yrs contract on the table for him but the former England captain decided to go to the USA instead... He choose LA Galaxy over them... what more can you say... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Real is probably going through what Barce went through during the late 90s and early 2000 when they were winning almost everythings while Barce stand and watch. They seem to be in decline over the last few years... But now there appear to be a silver lining... Barce are beginning to look not as great this season as they were over the last 3 years and should they lose Frank Rijkaard for next season... Who knows, could be Real's best chance for a comeback.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>players power is the cause for real's decline.<br><br>i feel they need to get rid of raul asap cos he plays too much politic in locker area. any managers go there will have to stand raul's air and not forgeting others' yaya attitude.<br><br>kinda think of it, fake ronaldo might consider moving there since all the luxury playing in spain is a dream. but he will rot if he leave manure since he is out of control of ferguson's hand.<br><br>just look at beckscum, he look more like a star than being a player there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the Galacticos policy they implemented earlier sold them the decline. Youth players would choose elsewhere becos they know that no matter how well you play.<br><br>Players like Pavon, Meijia, Borja, de la red, Portillo etc,  didn't have any chance to impress at all.<br><br>The players superstar treatment isn't helping the club at all. The demand for higher salary will be ongoing as egos grow bigger.<br><br>The good thing is the Galacticos are moving on. Figo left for Inter. Zidane retired. Ronaldo moves to Milan. Roberto Carlos announced that he's leaving and Becks went to Galaxy.<br><br>The only one left is Raul. I think he has already outgrown the club, just like Totti and Shearer. Their influence on their respective club is huge. That's why they're always in the starting 11 no matter how badly they're playing.<br><br>Raul started his career well but i suspect he is slacking in the recent years. His goal-scoring form is not as good as before and he seems to be putting on more weight.<br><br>I guess it's time for yet another Madrid re-suffle:<br><br>1. Capello isn't suitable for madrid's job cos he's unfogiving: Cassano, Emerson and Becks suffered under his hands.<br>2. Give youngster more chance to impress. They have talented youngsters mind you.<br>3. Abolish Galactico policy (I think it's already taking place)<br><br>Cheers.<br>CK</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>None of the managers after Del Bosque were given time to settle, they were fired almost as soon as there was a losing streak. I'm not surprised that they can't win anything with that much instability.<br><br>Perhaps they should look to Capello's experience at Roma. He also had a bad season there in 02/03, when they were as low as 12th at one point in the Serie A. However he was allowed to redeem himself the next season, when the team finished runners-up to Milan.</div>

Years ago, you can imagine that Figo, at the top of his game demanded to leave Barcelona so that he could join Real... That alone was something that the Barce fans could never accept as they pride themselves to be equal with Real. But when their top player asked to leave so that he could join their only rival... that speaks volume... Its like today Ronaldinho asking to leave Barce so that he could join them kind of thing...<br><br>Then a year later, Zizu also asked to leave Juventus to join them for a then world record transfer fee. The following year, Ronaldo then the current European Footballer of the Year as well as the FIFA World Player of the Year left Inter Milan too so as to join them.<br><br>These are not your ordinary players... These were the best players at that time and they could have gone to any club they wanted but instead choose Real. I guess one thing that came out of the Florentino Perez years was the club Real Madrid became more attractive to players... (Big players too).<br><br>The Galactico policy, tho some feel there are flaws to it, it did bring them some success as well as a better reputation. Initially the strategy was successful and Real Madrid won the La Liga titles but as time passes, it probably created an imbalance in the team.<br><br>Over the last few years we have seen them losing their attractiveness to players... Players no longer seem to jump at the first chance they get like Nicolas Anelka did yrs back when he heard that Real were interested on him... He created so much trouble at Arsenal until they had to let him leave. These last 2, 3 yrs, we are seeing player like Patrick Vieira rejecting them... Fabregas and Kaka have turned them down as well last season... and now its reported that their No.1 target for next season Ronaldo is also not keen on them even tho a new world record transfer fee is being mentioned... If that isn't bad enough, even Managers like Benitez are not jumping at the chance to manage what was once to some people the most glamourous club in world football.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>The Galactico system is about getting the biggest names so that more merchandise can be sold, more money can be made. So the players' style of play and all aren't really being put into consideration thus the decline of RM's power onfield.<br><br>Despite all his flaws, Cassano is a victim of the Galactico policy. Some of his best years have been wasted in RM while achieving nothing. Then he got shut in the freezer.<br><br>I'm not sure about Fabregas but Kaka sure isn't going to leave AC Milan even if it's Barca knocking on the door. I'm sure of that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote>1. Capello isn't suitable for madrid's job cos he's unfogiving: Cassano, Emerson and Becks suffered under his hands. </blockquote>Ronaldo suffered too.<br><br>I think it totally rocks that Ronaldo's performing so well in AC Milan now. It's like a tight slap to Capello and RM's face.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote>2. Give youngster more chance to impress. They have talented youngsters mind you.<br>3. Abolish Galactico policy (I think it's already taking place)</blockquote>I think Capello is actually trying to eradicate that policy out... But at the same time he's simply kicking out some of the wrong people.<br><br>He got rid of Ronaldo as he wished but the guy is now performing really well, kicking in goals for AC Milan nonstop. Capello also tried his best to torment Beckham but Becks turned out to be the person who saved his ricebowl, at least temporarily.<br><br>He also got in promising kids like Gonzalo Higuain and Marcelo. But the team's not-so-good performances isn't going to ensure his reign. Not to mention that Real fans never wanted him back in the first place.<br><br>Overall and all, I think Capello stinks.<br><br>Also, do I sense a tinge of jealousy around here when it comes to Beckham? Although he does have many other commitments outside of football, some people speaks as if he doesn't go for training in favour of those commitments, and as if he's lacking in professionalism which isn't true at all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Real Madrid a smaller club than Arsenal? I can't believe someone actually said that. Look at Arsenal's league position. I think that most gunners or even the liverpool fans would actually want to swop positions with Real in terms of league position.<br><br>The other thing I still don't understand is why people are still calling Real players Galacticos, while this term has been abandoned long long time ago? Anyway, the so much criticisied galacticos policy had brought Real a Champions League and a league trophy. Something Wenger would have dreamed of.<br><br>Ramos rotting? He has been performing well enough, thank you. Robinho is playing well now, but he is not a consistant player. His small size is always a disavantage as defenders could easily take him down with physical presence alone. And Cicinho? Oh please, take him away. Torres is better than him, in terms of consistancy and versatility. I remembered watching him play his first match this season. It was a torture, as he can't pass and cross properly. What about Ronaldo? He is a total crap this season,<br><br>Real's backline is going through a complete makeover, in view that cannavoro and carlos might be leaving Real. We would have one of the youngest defence in la liga. The team is undergoing a transition phase. I am sure they would improve.<br><br>I guess that most people here don't watch La Liga. Reading most comments here make me laugh.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>real madrid is still rebuilding their squad. i suggest they build a squad around a good player maybe kaka or somebody else. secondly, too little midfielders for the cause of concern... guti, de la red, becks (leaving), gago and emerson, diarra. they need a more attacking midfielder like zidane. the purchases of gago and higuain injects more youth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>all the stars player which Real Madrid bought are flops, except for Zidane.<br>look at Becks and Ronaldo, they all became flops and i think that Real Madrid is too difficult to coach, maybe because of the star players, they are all ego-manics to me. the Real Madrid board is also impatient, to me, Capello is a great coach, who coached several teams to glory, but once he is at Real, the team keeps losing, its not Capello's fault, maybe the team does not have enough respect for him, and with the board keep threatening his job, it will just lower down their morale</div>
