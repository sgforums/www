              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">MANCHESTER CITY last night clobbered Carlos Tevez with an £800,000 fine and are ready to let him rot for three years.</h2>
              <p>The Premier League leaders found their ex-skipper guilty of misconduct when he refused to warm up in Munich last month.</p>
              <p>Tevez last night vowed to <strong>SUE</strong> Roberto Mancini for defamation.</p>
              <p>He argues the City boss publicly accused him of refusing to play when the club have only found him guilty of not warming up.</p>
              <p>Tevez, who will immediately lodge an appeal with the Premier League, was told there had been five breaches of contract during the Champions League tie in the Allianz Arena.</p>
              <p>As well as the fine — four weeks' wages at £198,000 a week — he was given a two-week ban, which has already been served.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile Mancini has been told by chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak that the Abu Dhabi owners are furious with the actions of the Argentine.</p>
              <p>Owner Sheikh Mansour believes Tevez has disrespected them, the club, the fans and Manchester.</p>
              <p>Mancini has also been assured it will be up to him to treat Tevez however he wants for the remaining three years of his contract.</p>
              <p>City insist they will not be selling him on the cheap.</p>
              <p>A spokesman said: "I can confirm there was a call between Roberto and the chairman on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>"The club's formal position is no offer for Carlos Tevez will be considered unless it reflects his true value."</p>
              <p>Corinthians, who tried to sign Tevez in the summer, claim they are close to agreeing a deal for him again.</p>
              <p>President Andres Sanchez said: "I can assure you Tevez is about to sign with Corinthians, our fans can't imagine how close it is."</p>
              <p>Tevez is likely to appeal against the club's verdict and has 14 days to do so — then he will have a month to put it before the Premier League.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">CARLOS TEVEZ is set to sue Roberto Mancini for defamation of character as his feud with Manchester City grows increasingly bitter.</h2>
              <p>The ex-skipper will appeal the club's decision to fine him four weeks wages — around £800,000 — for his conduct in Munich.</p>
              <p>Tevez is unhappy with City boss Mancini for claiming he refused to play in the Champions League tie.</p>
              <p>The Tevez camp say the formal charges levelled at the Argentinian do not refer to any refusal to play. And they take that as proof City accept he had not gone on strike.</p>
              <p>The striker, 27, received a short letter at 8pm last night from City's chief operating officer Graham Wallace.</p>
              <p>It read: "You refused to carry out an instruction given by Roberto Mancini and fitness coach Ivan Carminati to resume warming up with a view to playing. You are guilty of misconduct."</p>
              <p>The letter contained no mention of the five breaches of contract mentioned in a club statement on City's website.</p>
              <p>However the Premier League leaders are convinced the actions of Tevez in Munich were premeditated.</p>
              <p>Sources at the Etihad revealed the ex-United hero had been told six days prior to Munich he would not be entitled to £6million loyalty bonuses.</p>
              <p>His transfer requests in December and July meant those payments would not be made. That decision was ratified and confirmed to the striker on September 21. City had also agreed to sell Tevez in a £40m deal with Brazilian club Corinthians only for it to fall through.</p>
              <p>However in agreeing to the player's wish to return to South America, they made it clear he would not be offered a new deal.</p>
              <p>Tevez stayed but hardly featured in the opening weeks and three days before Munich, he was an unused sub in a 2-0 win over Everton.</p>
              <p>He realised that day, backed up by comments from Mancini, he was now fourth in the pecking order of strikers.</p>
              <div class="float-right padding-left-10 width-300 padding-bottom-10">Club officials also noted how the forward did not warm up with the rest of the subs prior to the Bayern clash.</div>
              <p>All this leads them to believe Tevez's actions were premeditated.</p>
              <p>That suggestion was last night dismissed by sources close to Tevez who vowed "to fight it to the earth".</p>
              <p>City say they will not sell Tevez, due back in training today, on the cheap but his camp will challenge the idea the club will demand £40m for a player not even in the reserves.</p>
              <p>Mancini is expected to make several changes tonight to the team that beat United with Saturday's league clash with Wolves and next week's Champions League trip to Villarreal taking priority.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Manchester City owner Sheik Mansour has told manager Roberto Mancini he will personally pay his legal bills if he is sued by his former captain Carlos Tevez.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>City are involved in an increasingly ugly dispute with Tevez over Mancini’s claims that the 27-year-old refused to come on as a substitute in Munich in the Champions League four weeks ago.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The Barclays Premier League leaders revealed on Tuesday that they were fining Tevez four weeks’ wages — in the region of £1million — after finding him guilty of five charges in relation to the incident at the Allianz Arena.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Tevez has immediately struck back by claiming he will sue Mancini for defamation, maintaining that the Italian’s suggestion that he had refused to play was untrue and therefore slanderous.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>However, it is understood that Sheik Mansour is so furious at Tevez’s conduct over recent weeks that he has told Mancini he will foot any legal bills out of his own personal fortune.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>City do not privately believe that Tevez will take Mancini to court. Such a move would risk harming the South American’s reputation even further. </span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Yet the club are ready for anything and have told Mancini they are fully behind him. Mancini spoke with City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak by telephone on Tuesday night moments after City announced that their internal inquiry had found Tevez guilty. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>In that telephone call Khaldoon told Mancini the sheik was determined to do whatever it took to punish the Argentina striker.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>It is understood that City’s Arab owners are totally serious when they say Tevez will be banished to the sidelines for two years rather than be sold for a penny less than his £40m value when the transfer window opens in January.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>City will also consider launching a damages claim against Tevez if they cannot sell him at the start of next year. They believe his actions have contributed to a severe drop in his transfer value and may yet seek compensation from the player for this through the civil courts.</span></p>
