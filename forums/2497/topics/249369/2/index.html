The first leg of the Champions League semi-final between Chelsea and Liverpool will be the 14th time the two sides have met since the two men arrived in England within 12 days of each other in June 2004.<br><br>Since then a cordial relationship has deteriorated into a slanging match that hints at a bitter and mutual dislike. Spaniard Benitez recently offered the following explanation when he said: "We were good friends until Liverpool started winning, then he started changing his mind." Benitez might just have a point. Mourinho's Chelsea won their first three meetings with Liverpool's Benitez - twice in the Premiership, before coming from behind to triumph 3-2 in the 2005 Carling Cup final.<br><br>The talk around these games centred on tactics and adjustment to life in England. The managers preferred to talk about their own team rather than the opposition. The controversial Champions League semi-final at the end of the 2005 season changed all that. Luis Garcia's solitary and controversial goal at Anfield after a goalless draw at Stamford Bridge settled the tie - but Mourinho was not happy. He claimed "the linesman scored the goal" after Roman Slysko ruled Garcia's effort had crossed the line.<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42820000/jpg/_42820947_garcia203.jpg"><br><span class="small">Garcia's goal in the Champions League caused controversy in 2005</span><br><br>Mourinho's first season in English football ended with Chelsea being the worthy and deserving Premiership champions as well as Carling Cup winners. But his run of European success - Mourinho won the 2003 Uefa Cup and the Champions League the following season with Porto - was brought to an end by Benitez, whose team went on to lift the European Cup in 2005. The group stage of the 2006 Champions League pitted Chelsea and Liverpool against each other once again. But the events of the previous season were still nagging at Mourinho, who said in September: "They didn't score in the semi-final against us but I accept they beat us."<br><br>Mourinho, the self-appointed Special One, had already shown by this stage that he was not afraid to stir the pot, with many observers arguing it served the purpose of taking the heat off his players. Whatever, enough was enough for Benitez, who might lack the natural charisma of Mourinho but who has nonetheless shown he understands how to use the media. After their first group match ended in another goalless draw in September 2005, the Liverpool manager said the following month: "To me, Arsenal played much better football two or three years ago. They won matches and were exciting to watch. "Barcelona and Milan too. They create excitement so how can you say Chelsea are the best in the world?"<br><br>Two more Premiership wins for Chelsea - including a 4-1 thumping at Anfield - and yet another goalless draw in the Champions League suggested that even if the Blues were not the world's best they certainly had the measure of Liverpool. They clearly had a superior squad and, under the remarkable stewardship of Mourinho, again proved themselves comfortable Premiership champions last season.<br><br>However, their FA Cup semi-final meeting in April 2006 showed once more Benitez's ability to outwit his adversary on a one-off occasion. Liverpool won 2-1 and Mourinho was fuming. "Did the best team win? I don't think so," said the Chelsea boss. Mourinho tried to blame referee Graham Poll but, in a telling moment of how much the defeat had hurt, he continued: "In the Premiership Liverpool have no chance. "In a one-off game maybe they will surprise me and they can do it. In the Premiership the distance between the teams is 45 points over two seasons." Mourinho's team had gone into the match 15 points clear of Liverpool in the Premiership. But Mourinho selected a team without any of his wide players. Damien Duff, Arjen Robben and Joe Cole started from the bench while Shaun Wright-Phillips was left out of the squad entirely. Benitez did not have the luxury to be so bold with his selection but his team's victory caused one journalist to ask: "Whose will and ability to get the best out of his players will prove more enduring?"<br><br>Relations between the two men had broken down. Mourinho refused to shake Benitez's hand after the match - and again after Liverpool won the 2006 Community Shield. This season Chelsea and Liverpool shared the spoils in their Premiership encounters - with Liverpool's 2-0 win in January giving Benitez his first points against Mourinho in six attempts. And the duel will resume again on Wednesday when the teams meet for a remarkable fifth time in the Champions League in only three seasons. Mourinho wasted no time in proclaiming Liverpool as favourites, arguing that the Champions League is their only remaining chance of silverware, while his team are chasing trophies on several fronts.<br><br>The 43-year-old's latest salvo drew Benitez's response that Mourinho falls out with the managers of teams who beat his own. Benitez also threw a little dig Mourinho's way when he said: "We know Chelsea are a very good team, in the last five years they have spent big money on players." Mourinho desperately wants to win the Champions League with Chelsea, while it is the only chance for Benitez to continue his record of picking up silverware in each of his seasons at Anfield. The semi-final promises to be a keenly-contested affair, both on and off the pitch. Who knows, it could even be the last with Mourinho and Benitez managing Premiership clubs.<br><br>Benitez may have spurned the repeated advances of Real Madrid but Mourinho's future at Chelsea is still filling the newspaper columns, despite the insistence of the Chelsea hierarchy that their Portuguese manager will not be sacked. I wonder how Mourinho would feel about being second choice to Benitez in Madrid?<br><br></div>

Cristiano Ronaldo's fifth-minute header put United in front, only for AC Milan to draw level through Kaka's angled drive after 21 minutes. Kaka put Milan ahead from close range before the interval, but Rooney turned in Paul Scholes' cool pass on the hour. Rooney then lashed a glorious 20-yard finish past Dida in injury time. </strong><br><br>It was a moment of magic that gave United a precious lead to defend going into the second leg in Milan next Wednesday. United opened in sparkling fashion, and it took a desperate intervention from Alessandro Nesta to divert Rooney's shot over the bar. But they were soon ahead when Ronaldo met Ryan Giggs' corner with a firm header, which Dida palmed into the air and could then only divert into the net. United were firing on all cylinders up front - but all the time Milan, in the shape of Kaka, were waiting to probe their suspect and under-strength rearguard. And the strike they feared came after 21 minutes when Kaka took Clarence Seedorf's pass and accelerated away from Gabriel Heinze and fired a left-foot angled drive across Edwin van der Sar.<br><br>A high-quality encounter saw Rooney just fail to get on the end of Giggs' cross and Ronaldo bring a crucial block from Dida with a 25-yard power drive. But Brazilian superstar Kaka was an ever-present threat, and he took advantage of shambolic United defending to grab a crucial second away goal for Milan after 36 minutes. Kaka chased a long pass, and when Heinze and Patrice Evra collided, he moved smoothly into top gear to slide a perfect finish past Van der Sar. Evra was then booked for dissent - a yellow card that rules him out of the second leg at the San Siro, an inconvenience United did not need given their lack of defensive resources.<br><br>Michael Carrick wasted a glorious opportunity to put United level after 47 minutes when he side-footed wide of an open goal when he arrived unmarked at the far post on the end of another dangerous Giggs corner. Milan lost captain Paolo Maldini to a knee injury at half-time, then were robbed of Gennaro Gattuso with a knee problem - with the combative midfield man being replaced by Cristian Brocchi.<br><br>Kaka was giving a master-class, escaping the offside trap to shoot across the face of goal then playing a sumptuous one-two with Seedorf only to volley narrowly over. United desperately needed inspiration, and a moment of genius from Scholes provided it as they drew level after 59 minutes.<br><br>Scholes instinctively lifted the ball into the path of Rooney, whose finish was half-stopped by Dida but rolled in. United were suddenly buoyant again, and the unpredictable Dida saved brilliantly from Darren Fletcher after Rooney's cross was headed into his path. Fletcher forced Dida into a save at his near post as United pressed for what would be a crucial lead to take to Italy.<br><br>Dida then finger-tipped Ronaldo's dipping drive inches wide as United mounted a spell of sustained pressure in the closing stages. United's sheer courage was rewarded when Rooney ran on to Giggs' pass and fired past a startled Dida to send Old Trafford wild in celebration.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Man Utd: Van der Sar, O'Shea, Brown, Heinze, Evra, Fletcher, Carrick, Scholes, Ronaldo, Rooney, Giggs.<br>Subs Not Used: Kuszczak, Smith, Solskjaer, Dong, Richardson, Eagles, Lee.<br><br>Booked: Evra, Giggs.<br><br>Goals: Ronaldo 6, Rooney 59, 90.<br><br>AC Milan: Dida, Oddo, Nesta, Maldini (Bonera 46), Jankulovski, Gattuso (Brocchi 52), Pirlo, Ambrosini, Seedorf, Kaka, Gilardino (Gourcuff 84).<br>Subs Not Used: Kalac, Cafu, Inzaghi, Favalli.<br><br>Booked: Kaka, Bonera.<br><br>Goals: Kaka 22, 37.<br><br>Att: 73,820<br><br>Ref: Kyros Vassaras (Greece).<br></div>

The Liverpool boss was responding to suggestions from the Chelsea chief that the Anfield men would target players who are one booking away from a ban from the return leg on Merseyside next week.</strong><br><br>Didier Drogba, Joe Cole, Arjen Robben, Petr Cech and Lassana Diarra are all on two bookings ahead of the Stamford Bridge first match. But Benitez, who maintained that "I do not like playing these mind games", still managed the perfect put-down by saying: "It had not crossed my mind, but maybe it has Mourinho's because that is what Chelsea did two seasons ago to Xabi Alonso."<br><br>In the semi-final of 2005, Eidur Gudjohnsen was accused by Liverpool of diving to get Alonso booked, thus ruling him out of the second match at Anfield which Liverpool won 1-0 to go into the Istanbul final. Benitez said: "Maybe that is what Jose did to Alonso. But if that was a message to the referee (Markus Merk) then I can say that if it is a yellow card, that is what it should be. If it is red, then also that is what it should be. "I have confidence in Markus Merk, he is a very good referee and I am happy with the referees at this level."<br><br>Benitez also responded to Mourinho's persistent complaining about his injury worries. The Spaniard said: "I am learning many things I didn't know. That Chelsea have injury problems, but so do we. "That they are tired and we are playing less important games. They have spent a lot of money over the last few years and they have a big squad. "I also hear that he says Chelsea have got 60 more points than us over the last three years. Well to do that they have spent big, how much has each point cost them?"<br><br>Benitez, though, tried to get back to the game, saying: "We are confident, we have beaten them before and in important cup ties. "We feel we can do that again. We need to score and to keep a clean sheet, and we are confident that we can do that. If we do score at Stamford Bridge, it will give us a much better chance at Anfield, exactly like last time."</div>

The Blues take a 1-0 lead to Anfield thanks to Joe Cole's first-half strike in the first leg at Stamford Bridge. </strong><br><br>Mourinho was delighted with his players after their display in the first leg. "I thought our performance was top class," he said. "We had so many chances and we finally scored with chance number six.<br><br>"The second half was different from the first. Liverpool attacked more and had a chance with a great shot from Steven Gerrard." Mourinho was disappointed his side were not awarded a second-half penalty when Liverpool's Alvaro Arbeloa handled, although replays showed the incident took place well outside the area.<br><br>He said: "I don't understand why we don't have penalties when they are so clear. "I don't think anybody can say it was not a penalty. It's happening and happening and happening. It's a big chance for 2-0 - and 2-0 is a completely different game.<br><br>"I hope after the second leg we are not crying again about a big decision, like two years ago. I hope we do enough not to look back."<br><br></div>

There is a very simple reason why your posts are edited. They basically are offensive. Try to reflect on yourself for once. Even Chelsea fans dissapprove of your behaviour. And even non-Man U fans like allentyb and myself.<br><br>Stop blaming the whole wide world when the problem is with yourself. You are just so full of yourself that you think you can do whatever you want and the whole world must bow to your wishes.<br><br>The problem is not with you supporting Chelsea in itself. The problem is with your attitude.</div>

There are Chelsea fans and there are fans like you,<br><br>Although I feel to date, most of your posts do not warrant banning, no matter how inappropriate.

But then again, not counting the recent incidents and postsings, he's already had different negative threads dedicated to him in the past. If he didn't learn then, perhaps it's not all that surprising that he's not realising what he's doing.<br><br>Does he really not know the difference between posting and provokation? Or does he know but simply ignore because that is his intention anyway. To provoke people unnecessarily.</div>
