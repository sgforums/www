              <p>Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina has said that he does not believe an early European exit for the club would be a complete disaster.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Reina
              knows that his side must win their two remaining games and hope
              already-qualified Lyon can do them a favour against Italian side
              Fiorentina, but maintains that the Reds' rich European history makes up
              for this season's woes.</p>
              <p>"I do not accept that not going through
              will be a disaster for the club," he said. "We have been in the
              Champions League now for several years, one failure is not a disaster.</p>
              <p>"Not
              many teams have reached the semi-finals twice and two finals -
              including a title victory - in the last few seasons. It can happen
              again, we get closer to our real form with every game. Any team would
              miss the quality of the players who are injured at the moment, but we
              have others who can play and who can produce the right performances to
              get us out of this mess."</p>
              <p>Liverpool's next game in the tournament
              is a must-win trip to Debrecen on November 24, and Reina believes his
              team have to dig deep if they are going to pick themselves up.</p>
              <p>"We
              must show heart, passion and belief," he added. "If anyone can do this,
              Liverpool can. But now it (qualification) is not in our own hands, it
              does not only depend on what we do.</p>
              <p>"Now it is very, very
              difficult for us. But we must show strong character and fight right to
              the end. We know we have enough good players to sort this out."</p>

              <p>Liverpool last time also dropped to UEFA Cup. Then won it without any failure. There won't be any problem for them to win 1st Europa Cup, better than competing with strong elites in UCL.</p>
              <p>At least better than Man U if Kops cannot qualify last 16 and I am sure that Debercen won't overtake them. Because Man U was LAST in the UCL group stages 4 years ago after losing to Benfica 2-1 in last match. Villarreal, Benfica and another team, I really forgot, were ahead of Man U.</p>
              <p>And I think Kops can win last 2 matches due to their advtange (away to already eliminated Debercen and home against Fiorentina)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>There is no point winning the Europa cos the payout is so little that its better to be out of it earlier to save all the travelling and further injuries to your players... Even Aston Villa put out a reserved side last season so as not to lose further ground in their league table placing... One place lower on the league table probably cost as much as winning the Europa... lol.</p></div>

              <p>With the existing strength of the squad, Ah Ben is lost on which cup to fight for.</p>
              <p>It would be good that they focus on getting CL qualification for the next season.</p>
              <p>Or else they can start being the slaughter lamb for the mid table team.</p>
              <p>So, it is best that they get knocked out of all cup competitions and focus on BPL.</p>
              <p>When you have manager and players commenting that they dun care for silverware, then what is there to play for ?</p>
              <p>The greek center back have flopped for two matches.</p>
              <p>He was bought by Ah Ben.</p>
