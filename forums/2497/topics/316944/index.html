              <h1>Adebayor demands an £80,000-a-week deal from Arsenal and threatens to quit if he doesn't get it</h1>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/05_03/adebayor0805_468x680.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger fears his young Arsenal team are in danger of breaking up after it emerged that Emmanuel Adebayor has demanded £80,000 a week to stay at the club. The 24-year-old striker signed a new contract last summer worth a weekly £35,000, but he has told Wenger he wants to be paid in line with the top players in the Barclays Premier League.</strong></p>
              <p>The manager fears a salary and transfer explosion this summer, with Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool expected to spend upwards of £50m each on top-class signings.</p>
              <p>Despite claiming he can compete with United and Chelsea on the field over the next few years, Wenger has privately expressed fears that Arsenal will soon be too far behind the top teams in financial terms.</p>
              <p>Mathieu Flamini became the first to walk out when he agreed a move to AC Milan earlier in the week, turning down Arsenal's £55,000-a-week offer, and it is feared others may follow.</p>
              <p>Alexander Hleb is determined to move to Inter Milan in the summer and Jens Lehmann has played his last game. Adebayor, after suffering an initial knockback, is expected to make more noises following Sunday's final game of the season at Sunderland.</p>
              <p>His agent Stephane Courbis said: 'Now is not the time to talk about his contract. We'll wait until next week.' Hleb's agent Nikolai Shpilevski said last night: 'Alexander is preparing to make one of the most important moves of his life. He is leaving Arsenal even though they want to offer him a new long-term contract and better conditions. There's no way back now.'</p>
              <p>Wenger claimed his current team could eclipse the 2004 'Invincibles', but Arsenal are falling behind the top clubs in Europe in terms of transfer fees and salaries. Despite claims from former chief executive Keith Edelman that the manager has a pot of gold at his disposal, it is thought Wenger's hands are tied in the transfer market, largely due to the crippling cost of their two-year old Emirates Stadium.</p>
              <p>All that could be solved if the club were to accept the help of Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, but chairman Peter Hill-Wood and director Danny Fiszman say no.</p>
              <p>Arsenal, along with Chelsea, have been offered the chance to sign Thierry Henry, but Wenger has turned down the opportunity. Henry was deemed a 'special case' when he signed a contract worth £130,000 a week at the Emirates in the aftermath of the defeat in the 2006 Champions League final, but Arsenal are no longer in a position to pay that kind of figure.</p>
              <p>Chelsea, who bid £50m for Henry when Roman Abramovich arrived in English football, also considered taking him back from Barcelona but have decided against it.</p>

              <p class="story"><strong>Arsenal are preparing <span style="color: #000000;">to enter the race to sign Gareth Barry and</span> are also considering a bid for £12 million rated Roma midfielder Alberto Aquilani. Arsene Wenger has drawn up a shortlist of players he wants to add to his squad this summer and his priority is beefing up a midfield that has lost Frenchmen Mathieu Flamini and Lassana Diarra since the turn of the year.</strong></p>
              <p class="story">Wenger is searching for a central midfield anchorman to play alongside Cesc Fabregas, who has told the Arsenal manager that he will not be seduced by Real Madrid or Barcelona into a return to Spain this summer.</p>
              <p class="story">The Arsenal manager is weighing up bids for Aston Villa's Barry, who has been a mainstay of the England squad this season since moving to a more central, holding midfield role under Martin O'Neill, and 23-year-old Aquilani, who has won four Italy caps and is also attracting interest from Manchester United.</p>
              <p class="story">Wenger faces strong competition for Barry from Liverpool, who made a players-plus-cash offer of around £10 million for the England midfielder last week, and Chelsea. O'Neill and Barry will hold talks early next week to discuss the player's future and, while the Villa manager has been publicly bullish about the prospect of holding on to the 27-year-old, privately he accepts that Barry will move on to a club in the summer who can offer him Champions League football and the prospect of a significant hike on his £42,000-a-week salary.</p>
              <p class="story">Wenger was disappointed to lose Diarra to Portsmouth in January and Flamini to AC Milan this week and has accepted that he might have to spend the bulk of his £30 million summer budget on replacements for the pair, even though veteran Brazilian Gilberto is considering a U-turn and staying at the Emirates Stadium.</p>
              <p class="story">Such is Wenger's desire to strengthen his squad that even if he was able to steal Barry from under Liverpool's noses, he would still pursue a move for Aquilani, who impressed the Frenchman during Roma's last-16 Champions League defeat to United in March.</p>
              <p class="story">Wenger is also planning on buying a left-back to understudy Gael Clichy and a left-winger to provide competition for the injury-prone Tomas Rosicky. One player who the Arsenal manager is desperate to hang on to is Alexander Hleb, who has been linked with a move to Inter Milan.</p>
              <p class="story">"We want to keep Hleb, we want him to be part of our team next year," said Wenger. "It is as simple as that. We have lost one player [Flamini], we do not want to lose more." Wenger again refused to confirm who would captain the team next season.</p>
              <p class="story">William Gallas came in for criticism when he broke down in the centre-circle following the last-gasp draw at Birmingham"I don't share the view that Gallas is a bad captain. He is a captain who is very committed and tries to work hard for the team," said Wenger.</p>
              <p class="story">"He had an outburst at Birmingham, but I still believe today that, even if that was a mistake, that was not why we did not win the championship. "That would be too easy as an excuse because there are other incidents. That would be a cheap excuse. "At the time of the Birmingham game we were five points in front and everybody had been praising his captaincy. "I believe we all make mistakes and we had to come back as a unit and try to win the championship."</p>
              <p class="story">However, Wenger would not commit on just who would wear the armband come August. "It the captaincy issue has been raised by a lot of newspapers, but I must say I have not looked at the situation yet," he said.</p>

              <p><br>Not really lah... His reported salary at Milan is $65,000 a week, About $10 to $15,000 more from Arsenal's $50 to $55,000 offer...</p>
              <p>Since they can pay Fabregas $70,000 they can also pay Flamini $65k what...Afterall, compare to buying a new player will have to count the transfer fee of around $12m... And at present Barry is getting $42k a week you think he is going to expect the same salary with Pool also interested on him?</p>
              <p>Ok lah, Flamini go over for $65k include tax free... Arsenal's offer here $55k excluding tax yet... But still about $20k difference only what... 1 year extra $1m, 4 to 5 yrs only extra another $4 or $5 million only mah... still lesser than Barry's transfer fee already... and that one can drag 5 yrs payment somemore...</p>

              <p>Flamini has proven himself only 1season out of the 4 season he spent at arsenal, that why wenger did not renew his contract earlier.</p>
              <p>another reason which agent/player dont mention is looking for immediate trophy elsewhere. this is something AC/ Inter can provide but arsenal could not do so in the short term.</p>

              <p>Tho I agree with your point in principle, But i feel its quite difficult to apply it to Flamini who was a player out of contract... Moreover, many believed he was their most consistent player throughout the season... even more than Fabregas who seemed to have gone missing from Feb to April...</p>
              <p>I belief they should have classed him in the same group as Fabregas and Gallas if you call it a top level pay structure class... Perhaps they did not... But 3, 4 months ago Wenger came out and said confidently that Flamini will sign and he had no worries he will leave... My guess is either he was too confident Flamini won't leave his comfort zone at Arsenal just for a little bit more money... or he didn't have any idea what was going on... Coming out at the end to say he was disappointed he left won't do any good already...</p>
              <p>Having a pay structure is great but you cannot short changed your staff also right... Now we already heard Helb could also be leaving, and Adebayor demanding a new deal of £80,000-a-week...</p>
              <p>If they want to continue to attract good players, this kind of news can't be helpful... I belief the board need to re-think and change their policy soon or Wenger's won't be able to hold them together on his own...</p>

              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Gunners boss Arsene Wenger has been put on red alert by Marseille's admission they will sell the France midfielder.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Despite tying down Nasri to a new deal until 2012, the French club have admitted their star player has a clause in his contract that would force them to sell him for £12m.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Marseille president Pape Diouf revealed: "Samir could leave each season, if we receive an offer in between £12m and £16m.</p>

              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Wenger is a long-term admirer of Nasri and with Alex Hleb on the verge of quitting the club, he has signalled his intention to sign a creative midfielder.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Nasri, 20, has already played seven times for his country and claims he would be open to offers from Europe's top clubs.</p>
