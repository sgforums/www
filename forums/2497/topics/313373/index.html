              <p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Flamini: yet to put pen to paper on a four-year contract.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>While Arsenal have been buoyed by the news that both Fran Merida and Manuel Almunia have agreed new long-term deals with the club, concern is growing at the Emirates over their inability to reach a similar agreement with Mathieu Flamini.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After months of wrangling, the Frenchman has still yet to put pen to paper on a four-year contract extension believed to be worth in the region of £50,000-a-week. Time is certainly pressing with his current deal due to run out at the end of the season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even Cesc Fabregas, with whom Flamini has formed a formidable partnership this season, has joined Arsene Wenger in calling for the player to sign. "I keep telling him to sign it quick, because we need him, but he is concentrating on football at the moment," the Spaniard said. "We are still going for two titles, so right now everything else is not so important. Of course he wants to know where he will be next season, but we all hope he will be with us."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Both Inter and AC Milan have been linked with a move for Flamini this week, and his departure would be a nightmare scenario for Wenger who is expected to let Gilberto Silva depart in the summer after selling another midfielder, Lassana Diarra, in January.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Almunia, meanwhile, has expressed his desire to finish his career at Arsenal after committing himself to the club. "I am very happy. I have extended my contract and I hope to be here for a long, long time," he said. "I talked to my wife and I said I did not want to go back to Spain to play. Hopefully I can finish my career here."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Merida's contract extension was revealed by Arsene Wenger on Thursday with the Gunners boss describing the youngster, currently on loan at Real Sociedad, as "absolutely amazing player".</p>
