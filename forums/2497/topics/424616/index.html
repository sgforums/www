              <h1 class="h2">Wenger vows to attack Barcelona</h1>
              <div class="date">March 8, 2011</div>
              <div class="subhead"><span class="page-actions"><cite class="source">By ESPNsoccernet staff<br></cite></span></div>
              <p></p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=5"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Arsene Wenger</span></a> has outlined his tactical approach for Tuesday's highly-anticipated Champions League tie at Barcelona, insisting Arsenal are not set up to defend in numbers at the Nou Camp.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Arsenal carry a 2-1 advantage into the second leg on the last-16 clash after their come-from-behind win at the Emirates last month. Much of the pre-match discussion has centred on whether Arsenal will seek to simply protect their lead or try to extend it.</p>
              <p>Last season, eventual champions Inter beat Barcelona 3-1 at home then parked the proverbial bus at the Nou Camp and progressed to the final by restricting the then holders to a 1-0 victory. Arsenal will certainly need to be more solid than they were in the quarter-finals last year when they were defeated 4-1 in Spain to lose 6-3 on aggregate.</p>
              <p>Wenger, though, hinted Arsenal would not follow Inter's blueprint because his team is incapable of reproducing the Jose-Mourinho-masterminded defensive masterclass due to their wealth of attacking talent. Wenger is mindful of the fact Arsenal do not have the extra goal buffer that Inter had and that a 1-0 loss would see the Gunners eliminated on away goals. The manager said he would take a goalless draw but is not expecting the match to play out that way, so he will send out his men to attack.</p>
              <p>"It is a little bit of an illusion to go to Barcelona and think they will not score at all," Wenger said. "So you have to think we want to score at least a goal. Is it realistic to go there to try to play a 0-0 from the first minute on? First of all it would be considerably against our nature and even tactically I don't think it is defendable. We have not a team with 11 defenders who are happy to defend."</p>
              <p>Wenger believes a clean sheet is most likely unattainable on Tuesday night but he insisted he has total faith in his defence, pointing to their recent record in the Premier League as a sign of Arsenal's increased tightness at the back.</p>
              <p>"We have to fight against the preconceived ideas because the only way of thinking is that Arsenal cannot defend," said Wenger. "I will just remind you that in the last 11 games we have seven clean sheets in the Premier League, we have conceded less goals than Man United, who have a very good defence. We can defend when we have to but we prefer to attack that is for sure."</p>

              <h1 class="h2">Van Persie named in Arsenal squad</h1>
              <div class="date">March 7, 2011</div>
              <div class="subhead"><span class="page-actions"><cite class="source">By ESPNsoccernet staff<br></cite></span></div>
              <p></p>
              <p>Robin van Persie has made a shock comeback in training ahead of Arsenal's Champions League tie against Barcelona on Tuesday, but Arsene Wenger says he will not take a "gamble" on the striker's fitness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="mod-inline image image-right">
              <div style="width: 275px; margin-left: 10px;"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2011/0307/robinvanpersietrains20110307_275x155.jpg" border="0" alt="Robin van Persie" width="275" height="155">
              <div style="width: 275px;"><cite>GettyImages</cite>Robin van Persie trained on Monday.</div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Van Persie had been ruled out of the trip to Camp Nou after injuring his knee while scoring against Birmingham in the Carling Cup final last month. But pictures released on the club's official website showed Van Persie participating in full training on Monday.</p>
              <p>The player has travelled with his team-mates to Spain but Wenger, who said he was "very bad at mind games" when it was suggested the news could be a bluff, will give Van Persie a fitness test on Tuesday morning before deciding whether he will play any part in the tie.</p>
              <p>"He is here as a player and will have a test tomorrow," Wenger said. "Whether he has been included in the squad has not yet been decided.</p>
              <p>"He has made quick progression in the last three days. This morning he was unlikely to travel, but he wanted to go, so he had a test and it was quite positive.</p>
              <p>"We will not take a gamble in a game of such importance. It will be fit or not fit. Personally I would like him to play if possible, but I will only play him if he is 100% fit.''</p>
              <p>Cesc Fabregas, a former youth player with Barca, has also declared himself fit after suffering a hamstring injury that prevented him from playing in the 0-0 draw with Sunderland on Saturday, as well as the Carling Cup final defeat to Birmingham.</p>
              <p>Fabregas, who missed the second leg at Camp Nou last season due to a broken leg, had earlier on Monday been rated as 90% likely to play by his manager.</p>
              <p>"My fitness is good," Fabregas said. "For the last six days I haven't felt anything ... it was a very, very small thing that I had. I know that I am good if selected to play."</p>
              <p>News of Van Persie's possible availability has been welcomed by Barca boss Pep Guardiola, who also joked that perhaps the injured Theo Walcott and Alex Song could also return in time.</p>
              <p>"I would like Song to play; maybe there could be a private flight for Walcott to come in at the last minute - you never know,'' Guardiola said. "I want all the great players to play, everyone against everyone and see a great show tomorrow.</p>
              <p>"I hope they are all in the team - Van Persie, [Samir] Nasri, Cesc, because I would like to play the best possible Arsenal. If Van Persie plays, then no problem. It is good for the team and good for everyone. If he cannot, then Arsenal have a squad with players at a great level.</p>
              <p>"Arsenal have many alternatives, are very dynamic and can play in different positions, their counter-attack is great. We will try to prevent that."</p>
              <p>Van Persie has been included in a 19-man squad, which will be cut to 18 ahead of Tuesday's game at Camp Nou.</p>
              <p><strong>Arsenal squad:</strong></p>
              <p>Manuel Almunia, Wojciech Szczesny, Johan Djourou, Gael Clichy, Emmanuel Eboue, Kieran Gibbs, Laurent Koscielny, Bacary Sagna, Sebastien Squillaci, Cesc Fabregas, Andrey Arshavin, Jack Wilshere, Tomas Rosicky, Samir Nasri, Abou Diaby, Denilson, Nicklas Bendtner, Marouane Chamakh, Robin van Persie.</p>

              <p>Barce gave the an away goal...</p>
              <p>What more can they ask for? But they just shot themselves in the leg again... Fabregas was trying to be smart doing a back heel right infront of his penalty box ...</p>
              <p>Van Persie... what can you say, the guy deserved it. Already got away after scratching Alves in he face, he then pretend to be smart and kick the ball far away after an offside has been given...</p>
              <p>Arsenal really shot themselves in the foot...</p>
              <p>Fabregas and Van Persie together screwed Arsenal real bad cos this was winnable...</p>

              <p>I read the statistics:</p>
              <p><strong>Shots (Shots on Target)</strong></p>
              <p>Barcelona: 20 (12)<br>Arsenal: 0 (0)</p>
              <p><strong>Fouls</strong></p>
              <p>Barcelona: 8<br>Arsenal: 19</p>
              <p><strong>Possession</strong></p>
              <p>Barcelona: 76%<br>Arsenal: 24%</p>
              <p><strong>Yellow Card</strong></p>
              <p>Barcelona: 0<br> Arsenal: 3</p>
              <p><strong>Red Card</strong></p>
              <p>Barcelona: 0<br> Arsenal: 1</p>
              <p><strong>Saves</strong></p>
              <p>Barcelona: 0<br> Arsenal:9</p>
              <p>Do the statistics correctly reflect the match? I cant comment much because I only saw the highlights. If statistics don't lie, Arsenal really park the bus and played rough football instead of their usual passing game.</p>

              <p>Well, cos of Barce's short and quick passing, it was bound to happen. They were all so concentrated on defending in the middle, that Barce had a free run on the wings especially the right side... So often they were exposed on that side with no one covering... Strange, cos I never seen Arsenal open up like that before with such ease...</p>
              <p>But seriously, the blame has to be on Fabregas and Van Persie. Fabregas's mistake was really bad... cos it gave Barce hope and confidence... And Van Persie, had he stayed on the pitch, I think Arsenal had a really good chance of losing and yet win on away goals rule... cos <span lang="EN-GB">Bendtner had a really good chance towards the end but he fail to control the ball or took it first time and allowed the Barce defender Mascherano to clear it from his feet...</span></p>

              <p>i am arsenal supporters but they really suck against barca. watching the match boil my blood. the players lack conviction and motivation. instead of pressing the barca players hard, they let them pass the ball around and even near their penalty box. messi was allow to get the ball so often on the wide and make magic with it. where is clichy? he should have get close to messi and try best not let him get the ball. fabregas was nowhere to be seen? there was no leader on the field , they are dispirited. the worse match i had seen arsenal play.</p>
              <p>to add salt to injury, the best player on the night was almunia. without him, arsenal lose 6.7 goals.</p>
              <p>arsene wenger you should go. we dont want to be sacrifice for your stubbornese</p>

              <p>I think when Wenger said attack he meant to put more than 1 player in the opponent's half.</p>
              <p>Frankly speaking that's what Arsenal did for the whole match. Nothing much really happened. What they got are freak decisions including the red card. First half, they got a corner kick when VPN obviously roll the ball out himself and in the 2nd half they got a Nani like header in the direction of his own goal, the diff is only that this one went in directly. =D</p>

              <p>Set the alarm, woke up but didnt watch the match too tired lol. Anyway, I got a feeling that arsenal chickened out. Mentally fragile once again? How can a big attacking like the gunners not register a single shot on goal? Not even off goal? lol I find it hard to believe when i saw the stats this morning.</p>
              <p>Seemed like they were played around like schoolboys. This exit means they can focus on the fa cup and EPL but it's a heavy psychological blow, just like how chelsea and pool defeated man utd.</p>
              <p>This sat is a must win, if not, the deja vu feeling of "no trophies again" will come back to haunt them.</p>

              <p>Both men have been charged with improper conduct for "inappropriate language" directed at the match official in the aftermath of a 3-1 defeat at Camp Nou, according to UEFA.</p>
              <p>Arsenal were infuriated by Busacca's decision to show a second yellow card to striker <span style="color: #000000;">Robin van Persie in the second half of the Champions League last-16, second-leg tie.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Having already been booked for pushing Barca defender Dani Alves in the face, Van Persie was adjudged to have kicked the ball away in the second half, despite only a second elapsing between the whistle being blown and Van Persie taking a shot at goal.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">After two goals from Lionel Messi and a strike from Xavi</span> condemned Arsenal to an early exit from the competition, Wenger was involved in a heated confrontation with Busacca.

              <p>However, there is no indication that Van Persie himself has been charged, despite calling Busacca a "joke" in a post-match interview.</p>

              <p>Inter Milan also did that to win Barcelona. If the away initate attacking at Nou Camp, 1 thing for sure: Die because when Barcelona are counter-attacking, they will make use of the opponent's leaky defence, and their own power so as to score the crucial goals.</p>

              <p>The <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Arsenal</strong> </span>manager and midfielder Samir Nasri have been charged for "inappropriate language" towards Swiss referee Massimo Busacca after the final whistle at the Nou Camp, where Arsenal lost 3-1 after having striker Robin van Persie controversially sent off.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>Busacca caused uproar by showing van Persie a second yellow card for shooting at goal just one second after he had blown the whistle for offside - the Dutch forward claimed he had not heard it due to the noise of the 95,000-plus crowd.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>Wenger confronted the Swiss official after the final whistle over the sending-off and angry exchanges continued inside the tunnel.</p>

              <p>The disciplinary case will be heard by Uefa on March 17, where the Arsenal manager is sure to mount a staunch defence.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>The whole incident has overshadowed what was a fine performance by Barcelona, who dominated possession as Arsenal failed to muster a single shot on goal.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>Nevertheless, Wenger remains unrepentant and insists he has no case to answer.</p>
              <p>Speaking ahead of what is a crunch FA Cup quarter-final against <strong><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span></strong> on Saturday, Wenger said: "Who has been punished is Arsenal football club.</p>
              <p>"We are out of the Champions League, we have lost one of our big ambitions, we have been punished with a lot of damages and on top of that, we have to say sorry to Uefa.</p>
              <p>"We have done nothing wrong. They organised the competition, they named the referees who come to the games.</p>
              <p>"When you have a football game of that stature, you cannot come out with decisions like that and show a lot of arrogance on top of that.</p>
              <p>"We can all understand that we can make wrong decisions, but after that it becomes dictatorship. Its not any more common sense."</p>
              <p>Wenger is no stranger to confrontations with the authorities.</p>
              <p>Earlier this season, the Frenchman was fined £8,000 by the FA and served a one-match touchline ban after he sarcastically patted fourth official Martin Atkinson on the back following Darren Bent's late stoppage-time equaliser at Sunderland, as well as being critical in his post-match comments.</p>
              <p>However, on his latest disciplinary run-in, the Arsenal manager is adamant there should be no case to answer.</p>
              <p>"I deny completely any charge, I don't understand where that comes from," he said.</p>
              <p>"It is a shame the referee took the decision to send Robin van Persie off because it was the wrong decision.</p>
              <p>"The first game was a fantastic advert for football and the second game has been destroyed. The only thing that people remember is that the sending off killed the game.</p>
              <p>"A bit more humility would do Uefa some good, to apologise for what happened would be much better than charge people who have done nothing wrong.</p>
              <p>"This decision frustrated us and frustrated everybody who loves football.</p>
              <p>"You can check any statement I made on television after the game. If I have done anything wrong I am ready to be charged.</p>
              <p>"As for what is said in the tunnel, if you can get only one thing where I have come out on what has been said against me or against the referee during my 15 years in England, I will pay for you to have a big holiday."</p>

              <p>Aiyah.....arsene shd just suck it up la. His team had zero shots on goal. One person sent off and they think it is such a BIG deal. Other teams with 2 men sent off can manage a few shots on or off goal. Who did they think they were playing anyway?</p>
              <p>I often see wilshere tweeting these days. He shd just focus on his football instead of saying we are chasing this and chasing that. Whenever Arsenal says they are chasing this and that, better believe the opposite.</p>

              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>The lament of the sore loser never makes easy listening. In intensifying his criticism of Busacca and particularly Uefa, Wenger may genuinely be feeling persecuted.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>He may also be attempting to deflect scrutiny away from a squad shell-shocked by defeats to Birmingham City and Barcelona.</p>
              <p>An insight into his mindset came when asked whether Sir Alex Ferguson was right to order media blackouts.</p>
              <p>“I defend <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Arsenal</span></strong></a><span style="color: #000000;"> and Ferguson – don’t worry – is strong enough to defend </span><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span></strong></a><span style="color: #000000;">,”</span> he replied. Good managers defend their dressing rooms, especially when the inhabitants are at a psychologically low ebb.</p>
              <p>As diversionary tactics go, Wenger lobbed around some pretty spectacular verbal fireworks on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Speaking after training at London Colney, the Frenchman was in full Edith Piaf mode, regretting nothing, with a touch of Joan of Arc martyr’s defiance thrown in for good measure.</p>
              <p>“They do not punish me,” declared Wenger of Uefa’s charge. “It’s Arsenal Football Club that has been punished. We are out of the Champions League, we have lost one of our big ambitions, we have been punished with a lot of damages and, on top of that, we have to say sorry to Uefa.</p>
              <p>"We have done nothing wrong. They organised the competition, they named the referees.”</p>
              <p>Uefa can argue it named one of the best in Busacca, an official with experience of two World Cups, one European Championships, one Champions League final (2008) and one Uefa Cup final (2007). Yet his decision to dismiss Van Persie continues to chafe away at Wenger like a sharp pebble in a tight shoe.</p>
              <p>“It is a shame the referee took the decision to send Robin off because it was the wrong decision. The first game was a fantastic advert for football and the second game has been destroyed.</p>
              <p>"The only thing people remember is the sending-off killed the game. This decision frustrated us and frustrated everybody who loves football.</p>
              <p>"When you have a game of that stature, you cannot come out with decisions like that and show a lot of arrogance on top. We all understand we can make wrong decisions, but after that it becomes dictatorship. It’s not any more common sense.</p>
              <p>“I deny completely any charge. A bit more humility would do Uefa some good. To apologise for what happened would be much better than charge people who have done nothing wrong.</p>
              <p>"Uefa has to have a little bit lower profile after what happened on Tuesday; that would be much better and more sensible.”</p>
              <p>Uefa sources indicated it would be highly unlikely to charge Wenger for his “dictatorship” comments.</p>
              <p>The wreckage from a bad night in Catalonia lay around Wenger, who had to confront criticism by the likes of Xavi of Arsenal’s conservative tactics.</p>
              <p>“If I had played two full-backs on each flank in midfield you could say, ‘OK they just wanted to defend’,” countered Wenger. “But we played Rosicky, Nasri, Fabregas, Wilshere, Van Persie and Diaby. Not one defensive player.</p>
              <p>“How can people think I said to the players, ‘just stay in our half and wait’. We had no option, they closed us down so well in the first half, that we didn’t manage to get out. Look at the speed with which we lost the ball.</p>
              <p>“Barcelona had two shots on goal in the first half, plus the goal we gave away. Apart from that, they had a very sterile domination. We had more shots than Barcelona in the first game and we would have had shots in this game had it remained 11 v 11.”</p>
              <p>Wenger’s belief in his squad’s ability to recover sounded unshakeable. “Overall they can gain a lot of confidence. The attitude and quality we have shown in the two games against Barcelona was outstanding offensively and defensively. Since November, I feel this team has taken off.”</p>
              <p>Eventually he admitted that uncertainty stalked his players, that Arsenal needed victory over United in the FA Cup tomorrow for psychological as well as sporting reasons. “We need it, I must say, because we need help. We have been touched severely recently.</p>
              <p>“We lost one competition in the last minute [Carling Cup final]. We played the super favourite of the Champions League and lost under special circumstances. We want to deal well with the two psychological blows.”</p>
              <p>Cesc Fabregas’ hamstring injury precludes his involvement against United “and maybe for the next two games”. Wenger is looking for an “emergency keeper” on loan with Wojciech Szczesny having dislocated his finger.</p>
              <p>Theo Walcott, Alex Song and Thomas Vermaelen are all out although Van Persie is available.</p>
              <p>At the end of a bad week for the club, Arsenal have expressed their concern to Barcelona about the treatment of their fans in Nou Camp.</p>
              <p>Arsenal supporters spoke of over-aggressive policing before and after the match.</p>

              <p>Barcelona also played dirty  by making small fouls that were not noticed by Arsenal....</p>
