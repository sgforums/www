              <p><span>As international week puts the Premier League on the back burner, <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Sportsmail </span>has used the break to assess who could be named Player of the Season by the PFA this season.</span></p>
              <p><span>The award is for performances in the League, although outstanding displays in the cups or Europe are bound to have an impact in players’ minds. Before they make their choice, however, here (in alphabetical order) is our top ten.</span></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><span>The 25-year-old Scot has been at the centre of everything refreshing and enjoyable about Blackpool’s season so far. Able to ping a 50-yard pass or produce a clinical set-piece ball, he is the spark behind the majority of the Tangerines attacking play. He has demonstrated his cool head, too, with six crucial penalties.</span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Best moment:</span> A goal and a man-of-the-match performance against Liverpool at Anfield secured a win against all odds. It was the Seasiders' first victory at the ground since 1967.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffffff;"></span> </p>

              <p><span>As potent in attack as he is in defence, the left-back has shone in Everton’s stuttering campaign. Eleven assists is a mark of how much he gets forward and delivers quality crosses but he is also feisty in the tackle. Reliability is key to his game as well – he has played every minute in the Premier League so far.</span></p>
              <p><span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Best moment:</span> Arriving onto a Tim Cahill lay-off from the left wing, Baines curled a sumptuous right-footed shot to score the decisive goal as Everton beat Manchester City 2-1 at Eastlands.</span></p>

              <p><span>With blistering pace and a fearless attitude, the Wales  winger has terrorised opposing right-backs. A number of barnstorming, touchline-hugging runs have left fans breathless – he can do things no other player can.</span></p>
              <p><span><br><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Best moment:</span> On the domestic front, his delightful goal against Arsenal which sparked an improbable comeback win at the Emirates takes it. But the two jaw-dropping displays against Inter in the Champions League must be mentioned.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ff0000"><strong>DIMITAR BERBATOV</strong>                                     </span><br></p>

              <p><span>A talent who has so often flattered to deceive in a United shirt, Berbatov has stepped up this campaign to phenomenal goal-scoring effect.  He has a remarkable three hat-tricks to his name in the league and has looked unplayable at times, combining of trickery with ruthless finishing.</span></p>
              <p><br><span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Best moment: </span>Single-handedly won United’s match against Liverpool with a terrific hat-trick, the second goal of which was an ingenious overhead kick.</span></p>

              </div>
              <div class="artSplitter">
              <div class="splitLeft">
              <p><span>Finally fulfilling the potential which convinced Manchester United to splash the cash on him as a 20-year-old, Nani has been a fearsome player. The Portugal star has been consistent in scoring from distance with either foot and providing killer passes, illustrated by a fine return of nine goals and 16 assists.</span></p>
              <p><span><strong>Best moment: </strong>His strike against rivals City. The deft right-foot touch to control Ryan Giggs’ ball, followed by the calm left-foot finish beyond Joe Hart, all while running at pace, was sublime.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ff0000"><span style="color: #ffffff;">SAMIR NASRI</span></h2>

              <p><span>Being left out of France’s World Cup squad made the 23-year-old redouble his efforts for Arsenal and a series of stunning performances have followed. Many of his nine league goals have been scored with breath-taking skill and he has repeatedly produced game-turning moments.</span></p>
              <p><br><span><strong>Best moment: </strong>The Frenchman’s brace against Fulham included twists and turns of such incredible angles that the House of Stairs artist Escher would have been amazed.</span></p>

              <p><span>Mr West Ham may not be the club captain but he is undoubtedly the leader of the side. When lesser men would have given up he has dragged his team forward with dynamic displays and unflinching commitment. His best goal-scoring year to date has included some quality strikes.</span></p>
              <p><br><span><strong>Best moment:</strong> His half-time speech to a dejected squad when 3-0 down to fellow strugglers West Brom will go down in West Ham folklore as it inspired a 3-3 draw.</span></p>
              <p><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #00ccff"><strong>CARLOS TEVEZ</strong>                                               </span></p>

              <p><span>Welcomed with open arms by City fans two summers ago, Tevez has this year become the side’s talisman. Goalscoring is only one part of the Argentinian’s game, he harries and hassles and never allows defences to rest. Such unceasing energy brings life to a City side which can be pedestrian at times. </span></p>
              <p><br><span><strong>Best </strong><strong>moment:</strong> A wonderful solo goal against Chelsea displayed the best of Tevez and gave City all three points. It also made the rest of the Premier League sit up and take notice.</span></p>

              <p><span>The Real Madrid cast-off has brought class and a Continental nous to Spurs’ displays. The supplier of lovely free-kicks and the scorer of stylish goals, the Dutchman has defied those who doubted his top-level ability. What a bargain £8m looks now.</span></p>
              <p><br><span><strong>Best moment:</strong> His two goals away to Aston Villa were beautiful to watch and won the game for 10-man Spurs. It was the kind of match they would have lost without him.</span></p>

              <p><span>A colossus at the heart of United’s defence, the Serbian has put in some monstrous displays this season. As backline team-mates succumbed to injury, the captain has been there until recently keeping the team solid. His ferocious desire to win every header around the box is an ability that can’t be taught.</span><br><span><strong>Best moment: </strong>Blocks, headers, tackles, clearances, you name it, Vidic towered above everyone in the 0-0 draw at White Hart Lane.</span></p>
