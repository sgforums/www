              <h2>PORTUGAL UNHAPPY WITH CHELSEA</h2>
              <div><span id="intelliTXT"><img src="http://images.football365.com/08/06/240/LuizFelipeScolari_963734.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180"></span></div>

              <div><span>.</span></div>
              <div><span><strong>Portugal have lashed out at Chelsea for announcing during Euro 2008 that Luiz Felipe Scolari had accepted an offer to coach the Premier League side. Portuguese Football Federation president Gilberto Madail addressed the media on Friday following his team's elimination from the European Championship at the hands of Germany the previous night, and believes the timing of the announcement of Scolari's impending departure had a destabilising effect.</strong> </span></div>
              <div><span>.</span></div>
              <div id="articlebody">
              <p>"It wasn't the best moment for us for Chelsea to announce Scolari's appointment," said Madail. "I know Scolari had nothing to do with it and I was surprised not by the appointment, because Scolari is a great coach, but at the timing chosen.</p>
              <p>"I wish Chelsea would have consulted us before so that we could have chosen a better time." Madail conceded that Scolari's departure was inevitable. "I knew when we entered the tournament that Scolari would leave," he said. "We respected his wishes. His cycle with Portugal had ended because he wanted a new experience with a club.</p>
              <p>"There was nothing we could do. It was a financial issue and we couldn't match Chelsea's offer." Portugal have also had to deal with the distraction of Cristiano Ronaldo's club situation. The 23-year-old star is under contract at Manchester United but Real Madrid are hell-bent on bringing him to the Bernabeu for the forthcoming campaign.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo admitted after Thursday's 3-2 defeat that he would be discussing his future with United in the coming days. "I don't know what is going on in Ronaldo's mind and I don't think that contract problems would affect a player," said Madail.</p>
              <p>"It's normal for players to have to deal with these issues. I don't think it interferes and I didn't see any problem with Ronaldo." Leaving the competition at the quarter-final stage was a huge disappointment for Portugal, who had been one of the most exciting teams in the event.</p>
              <p>They had shown a lot of flair but ultimately came unstuck against a determined Germany. "I was very disappointed with the game yesterday," Madail said. "Everyone saw Portugal is a strong squad. "There is no way our elimination was fair but the result was fair on the night, Germany won 3-2 and we made mistakes and were made to pay.</p>
              <p>"Good luck for Germany but especially the best of luck to Spain." Now the Portuguese have the difficult task of finding a replacement for Scolari. "(The new coach) will have to speak Portuguese but not necessarily be Portuguese. "He has to have ambition and be a winner. He has to be someone who the players respect."</p>

              <h1>Portuguese accuse Chelsea of 'lack of respect' over Luiz Felipe Scolari</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="small"></p>
              <p class="story">The Portuguese Football Federation have accused Chelsea of "a lack of respect" for announcing the appointment of Luiz Felipe Scolari as manager while the national side were in the middle of their Euro 2008 campaign.</p>
              <p class="story">Before Scolari's appointment was made public, Portugal had won both of their games in flamboyant style. But they subsequently lost to Switzerland in their final group game and were eliminated by Germany on Thursday night.</p>
              <p class="story">The federation president, Gilberto Madail, admitted he had known about Scolari's move to Stamford Bridge before the start of the tournament, but felt the club had acted with arrogance in not even consulting the federation over the timing of the announcement.</p>
              <p class="story">"The moment, the opportunity, that Chelsea took to announce the contract was not for us very correct. Maybe they could have informed us first."</p>
              <p class="story">Portugal had been among the pre-tournament favourites, but crumbled to a 3-2 defeat against Germany in Basle, and despite Scolari's protestations that the result would have been the same either way, there is growing resentment in Portugal about the way their squad was destabilised.</p>

              <p>yes, just an imbalanced team! good attacking style doesnt mean will win after 90 minutes. would holland suffer the same fate? coz every match so far, holland scored big and conceded a few goals</p>

              <p>I am just surprise that the Portuguese team under Scolari didn't know how to defend against high ball and set pieces... And its not that he don't have the personnel to do it... They had Carvalho who was one of the best defender in the epl last season... and also Ferreira... But we could see from their game against the Czech they were very ill-prepared when it came to high balls into the area... Unlike Turkey who were also short but defended well against the Czech Repubic, Switzerland and Croatia...</p>
              <p>How ironic that they started their tournament playing very well and defeating Turkey and now Turkey are the one going through to the semis while they are out...</p>

              <h2>CHELSEA HIT BACK AT PORTUGAL</h2>

              <p><strong>Chelsea have hit back at Portugal's claims that they acted improperly in announcing the appointment of Luiz Felipe Scolari as their new manager.</strong></p>
              <p>The club made the news of Scolari's appointment public on the evening of Portugal's 2-0 win over the Czech Republic, a result that saw Portugal qualify for the quarter-final of Euro 2008.</p>
              <p>However, they then lost the next two games against Switzerland and then against Germany in the first knock-out round. President of the Portuguese Football Federation Gilberto Madail yesterday criticised the timing of Chelsea's announcement that Scolari would succeed Avram Grant at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>"The moment Chelsea took to announce the contract with Mr Scolari was not for us very correct," said Madail. "Maybe they could have informed us first.</p>
              <p>Now Chelsea have responded with an official statement, in which they deny any wrongdoing. The club claim they acted "above board and correctly", and added: "It was the appropriate time for both parties to announce and it had been agreed in advance. The FPF were informed."</p>
              <p>Scolari himself maintains that the timing of the announcement had no effect on Portugal's exit, but it isn't taking a huge leap of faith to suggest that it would not have helped.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>they lost to a better team no doubt but the timing of the announcement could have been better too, players does get affected by such stuff and will lost their concentration if its not being deal properly, Chelsea must have either been getting far too many rejects in the transfer market or their own players getting jiggy with their managerless position hence decided to make such an announcement.  </p></div>
