              <p><strong>Wales midfielder Aaron Ramsey has agreed a new long-term contract with Arsenal.</strong></p>
              <p>The 18-year-old arrived at Emirates Stadium from Cardiff last summer in what was understood to be a £5million deal.</p>
              <p>Ramsey
              made 22 first team appearances for the Gunners, which started with the
              Champions League qualifier against Steve McClaren's FC Twente.</p>
              <p>The
              former Cardiff youngster netted his first, and so far only, senior goal
              in the 5-2 European victory at Fenerbahce during October.</p>
              <p>Gunners manager Arsene Wenger is more than happy with Ramsey's progress so far.</p>
              <p>"Aaron
              made a very good contribution in his first season and he showed that he
              is a very intelligent player with great quality," said Wenger.</p>
              <p>"He is still only 18 and we are really looking forward to seeing him develop with us in the forthcoming years."</p>
              <p>Arsenal
              yesterday handed professional contracts to four members of their
              successful FA Youth Cup team, while confirming Portugal Under-21
              international Amaury Bischoff was one of eight players released.</p>
              <p>Defenders
              Luke Ayling (17), Craig Eastmond (18), Cedric Evina (17) and
              18-year-old keeper James Shea have all been signed on by the Gunners
              following an impressive campaign which also saw the youngsters win the
              FA Premier Academy League under the guidance of former centre-half
              Steve Bould.</p>

              <p class="story_panel_text"><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Arsenal have tied up promising teenager Jack Wilshere on a new long-term contract as the Gunners continue to look to the future.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Wales international Aaron
                  Ramsey, 18, on Wednesday agreed an extension to his deal, and the
                  Premier League club have been quick to also secure the potential of
                  Hertfordshire-born Wilshere, at the club since he was just nine.</p>
              <p>Manager Arsene Wenger rates the England youth international highly.</p>
              <p>Wilshere signed professional terms when he turned 17 on New
                  Year's Day and had became the youngest player to represent Arsenal in
                  both the league and in European competition when making his first-team
                  breakthrough last season.</p>
              <p>He was also an integral member of Arsenal's FA Youth Cup winning side, and looks set for a bright future at Emirates Stadium.</p>
              <p>Wenger said: "It is such great news that Jack has signed a new long-term contract.</p>
              <p>"Jack made great progress last season, playing at Under-18s,
                  reserves and first-team level and we all witnessed what a great young
                  talent he is."</p>
              <p>Wenger added on the club's official website: "At still 17 years
                  of age, the potential is huge for Jack and we are all delighted he has
                  committed his long-term future to Arsenal."</p>

              <p>will all these young players made good and repay Wenger?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I still believe that english and UK players are not as talented as the europeans, like spanish, italians or germans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>there used to be talented english players in the past, like John Barnes, Chris Waddle, Glen Hoddle, Paul Gascoigne, but there are none now. even Rooney, the current best english player, also are not as skilful as them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Glen Hoddle is a pass master, and barnes, waddle and gazza have the skills and ability to beat their opponent easily. it is a dying art these days.</p>

              have announced that promising teenage full-back Kieran Gibbs has signed
              a new long-term contract extension to keep him at the club.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Gibbs made his first-team
              debut in the 2007/08 campaign and last season the 19-year-old continued
              to demonstrate his talent with 21 appearances for the Gunners.</p>
              <p>The left-back's form earned him a place in the England Under-21
              squad for this summer's European Championship, where he helped his
              nation reach the final.</p>
              <p>Arsenal have now rewarded Gibbs with fresh terms, and manager Arsene Wenger has hailed the youngster's progress.</p>
              <p>Wenger told the club's official website: "Kieran made such a
              great impact last season and the progress he made throughout the year
              was fantastic.</p>
              <p>"Kieran is an intelligent player with huge quality and he proved last season with his performances that he has great potential.</p>
              <p>"We're delighted that Kieran has committed his future to Arsenal
              and we're all excited to watch his future development at the club."</p>
              <p>Gibbs follows Theo Walcott, Lukasz Fabianski, Aaron Ramsey and Jack Wilshere, in signing new long-term extensions with Arsenal.</p>
