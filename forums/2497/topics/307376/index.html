              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva has revealed he
              turned down an approach from Inter Milan to make the move to Anfield
              last summer.</span></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Liverpool fought off competition from a number
              of top clubs across Europe to land the Gremio star and Lucas says he
              has no regrets over his choice and now wants to knock Inter out of the
              Champions League next week.</p>
              <p>"I am the kind of person who likes a challenge," Lucas told the club's official magazine.</p>
              <p>"I was in a fortunate position at Gremio because I had achieved
              some success and I was made a lot of very interesting offers - offers
              which would have made a lot of money.</p>
              <p>"Some of them were in Spain and it's true I had an enquiry from Inter Milan too.</p>
              <p>"They were all famous clubs but the Liverpool option stood out from the first moment I heard of their interest.</p>
              <p>"I had heard of them back in Brazil and we saw a lot of Premier
              League matches so I was aware of what the manager was building here at
              the club.</p>
              <p>"I was interested in what they had to say from the first
              moment. My father and my agent came across here to speak to Liverpool
              and they were very impressed with everything.</p>
              <p>"For me it was only a sporting project and a club that would
              help me meet my ambitions and allow me to help them achieve theirs."</p>
              <p>"I could have gone to Spain or Italy and it would have been
              more like I am used to. But I want to make the most of my career and I
              want to challenge myself.</p>
              <p>"I have friends from the international team at Inter, Cesar and Maicon are great players and I will enjoy playing agaisnt them.</p>
              <p>"But I would much rather play for Liverpool than Inter. That was
              my decision then and it would be the same if I had to make it again."</p>
              <p>Lucas is confident Liverpool can overcome Inter when the two sides lock horns in the last 16 of the Champions League next week.</p>
              <p>"I think we have the tools to beat Inter, but it will be an
              exciting game and my first time - hopefully - playing at the San Siro,"
              added Lucas.</p>
