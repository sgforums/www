              <h1>Sunderland 3 Tottenham 1: Darren Bent gets revenge over former 
              employers to dent Spurs' Champions League hopes<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Sunderland striker Darren Bent dealt former club Tottenham's hopes of
               Champions<br>League football a major blow despite missing two 
              penalties.</p>
              <p>On a remarkable afternoon at the Stadium of Light, 
              Bent struck after just 34 seconds and then with a 29th-minute penalty to
               take his tally for the season to 23, 22 of them in the Barclays Premier
               League.</p>
              <p>However, he twice spurned the chance to complete a 
              hat-trick when Spurs keeper Heurelho Gomes saved further spot-kicks 
              either side of the break.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/03/article-1263282-08FCD76D000005DC-740_468x304.jpg" alt="Sunderland's English striker Darren Bent" width="468" height="304">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Off the mark: Bent fires his 21st League goal of
               the campaign</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The misses might have proved costly when Peter
               Crouch reduced the
              deficit with a 72nd-minute header just seconds after coming on, but
              fellow newcomer Bolo Zenden blasted home a superb volley four minutes
              from time to end Spurs' run of five successive Barclays Premier League
              victories and all but mathematically assure his side of another season
              in the top flight.</p>
              <p>Bruce admitted in the run-up to the game that the game would be all
              about Bent, who left Spurs last summer on less than friendly terms.</p>
              <p>He could not have known how prescient his comments were, however, as
              the England international put his former employers to the sword.</p>
              <p>The game was just 34 seconds old when his predatory instincts came
              to the fore, pouncing on the loose ball after Gomes could only parry
              Fraizer Campbell's header and firing into the empty net.</p>
              <p>Inevitably, his strike came in front of the travelling supporters
              packed in behind Gomes' goal, and they were given a second chance to
              witness his potency with the game just 29 minutes old.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/03/article-1263282-08FCF723000005DC-382_468x306.jpg" alt="Darren Bent of Sunderland" width="468" height="306">

              </div>
              <p>This time, it was Steed Malbranque who tested the keeper from the
              edge of the box, and although he was up to the task, full-back Kyle
              Walker handled as he attempted to mop up and referee Lee Mason pointed
              straight to the spot.</p>
              <p>Bent thumped the ball low to Gomes' right to establish a 2-0 lead,
              and he should have completed his hat-trick four minutes before the
              break.</p>
              <p>Campbell surged into the box from the right and went over Luka
              Modric's out-stretched leg, and again Mr Mason was convinced, although
              the penalty award looked generous.</p>
              <p>This time, Bent went to the keeper's left and Gomes got across well
              to turn his effort away, much to the delight of the beleaguered Spurs
              fans behind the goal.</p>
              <p>Sunderland were worth their half-time advantage after enjoying much
              the better of the opening 45 minutes with strikers Roman Pavlyuchenko
              and Eidur Gudjohnsen seeing little of the ball.</p>
              <p>Their only effort of any note came when winger David Bentley met
              Gareth Bale's cross with a downward header, but Sunderland keeper Craig
              Gordon was equal to the task.</p>
              <p>Spurs boss Harry Redknapp made a double change at the break when he
              replaced Benoit Assou-Ekotto and Bentley with Niko Kranjcar and Jermain
              Defoe.</p>
              <p>The changes would have paid dividends within five minutes had it not 
              been for Gordon's continuing run of excellent form.</p>
              <p>The striker broke free and attempted to beat the keeper with the
              outside of his right foot, but the Â£9million man stood tall to block
              his effort.</p>
              <p>Gordon then turned Bale's flicked header from the resulting corner 
              over the bar, but the impetus was firmly with the visitors.</p>
              <p>Defoe did beat the keeper, but also the far post, with a 54th-minute
              shot across the face of goal, and Luka Modric forced a good save six
              minutes later.</p>
              <p>But the home side should have had the points sewn up when they were
              awarded a third penalty for Wilson Palacios' trip on David Meyler.</p>
              <p>Bent, who was berated by Bruce earlier in the season for allowing
              strike-partner Kenwyne Jones to take a spot-kick, this time rejected
              Malbranque's appeals, only to see Gomes save again with the help of his
              right post.</p>
              <p>Crouch replaced Pavlyuchenko with 19 minutes remaining and made his
              mark within seconds, heading home Kranjcar's cross as the home side's
              appeals for a foul were waved away.</p>
              <p>Bruce replaced Bent with Jones 12 minutes from time, and the
              substitute should really have made it 3-1, but completely missed his
              kick in front of goal after being picked out by Campbell, and Zenden's
              follow-up was cleared off the line by Younes Kaboul.</p>
              <p>But the Dutchman, who had come on for Malbranque with 12 minutes
              remaining, was not to be denied a second time as he guided an exquisite
              late volley into the top corner.</p>
