            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Bolton turn to Knox<br><br>Bolton Wanderers have put Archie Knox in charge of first-team affairs following the departure of Sammy Lee by mutual consent on Wednesday.<br><br>Knox was appointed by Lee as coaching co-ordinator in August and will look after the team as they prepare for the hugely difficult trip to the Emirates Stadium to face Arsenal on Saturday.<br><br>It is thought the 60-year-old, who left his post as Scotland Under-21 coach, will be assisted by first-team coaches Jimmy Phillips and Ricky Sbragia.<br><br>Knox is a hugely experienced coach and was in charge of Scotland's youth set-up before joining Bolton. Prior to taking the Scotland role in July 2006, he had worked as an assistant to Walter Smith at Rangers and Everton and also to Sir Alex Ferguson at Aberdeen and Manchester United.<br><br>Lee left Bolton by mutual consent yesterday after a poor start to the season.<br><br>The Lancashire club have taken just five points from their first nine Barclays Premier League games, only goal difference keeping them off the bottom of the table.<br><br>Lee succeeded Sam Allardyce as manager at the Reebok Stadium towards the end of last season, with the latter later joining Newcastle.<br><br>General manager Frank McParland has also left the club.<br><br>Under Lee, Bolton progressed to the group stages of the UEFA Cup - but their league form has been a major cause for concern.<br><br>Former boss Allardyce returned to the club on the opening day of the season as Newcastle cruised to a 3-1 victory.<br><br>Defeats at Fulham and Portsmouth followed, before a 3-0 home victory over Reading briefly eased the pressure.<br><br>However, further losses to Everton, Birmingham and Chelsea, and a home draw with bottom side Derby, left Bolton in the relegation zone - and Lee's cause was not helped by off-field issues.<br><br>Last week, veteran midfielder Gary Speed was relieved of his coaching duties at the club - having been left out of the squad to face Chelsea.<br><br>Â• Meanwhile, Phil Brown admits he is relishing his role at Hull City after flatly dismissing speculation linking him with the vacant managerial post at Bolton.<br><br>Brown enjoyed six years as a player at Bolton before joining the club's backroom staff and briefly taking temporary charge of first-team duties in 1999.<br><br>The City boss, however, has played down the prospect of a return, saying: 'It's perhaps inevitable to be linked, but I am very happy with the job I'm doing here.'<br><br>Brown took charge at Hull in December 2006 and is intent on reviving the club's fortunes.<br><br>'It's flattering to say the very least,' he added to the Hull Daily Mail.<br><br>'It's always nice to get linked with another job, let alone a Premier League job, but I have a massive job on my hands at Hull City now.' </span></div>
