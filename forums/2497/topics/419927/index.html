              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It's old news, but one which Howard Webb - the one who makes "bad" decision agst Pool in FA cup...told Blackpool players to do on Liverpool.</span></span></em></p>

              <p><strong>Be more dishonest and you’ll win more free-kicks, referee Webb 'tells Blackpool' ahead of Liverpool clash</strong><br> <br> Britain’s top referee, Howard Webb, has given Blackpool a huge helping 
              hand for their Boxing Day clash with Liverpool – and allegedly told the 
              Tangerines to be more dishonest to win more free-kicks.<br> <br> Ahead of the Reds’ visit to Bloomfield Road, the 39-year-old, who 
              oversaw both World Cup and Champions League finals this year, has 
              instructed Ian Holloway’s players to go to ground more easily rather 
              than try to stay on their feet, it has been claimed.<br> <br> The shocking claims came as Webb lectured the Tangerines in an FA scheme
               which aims to ease the relationship and levels of understand between 
              the man in the middle and the players.</p>
              <p>Too honest: Howard Webb has told Blackpool's players to go down more easily to win free-kicks.</p>
              <p>Defender Ian Evatt lifted the lid on Webb’s lecture, and claimed: 
              ‘Howard was basically here just to go over some refereeing decisions. He
               showed a bit of honesty and told us where we were going wrong. <br> <br> ‘He spoke to me about why I didn’t get a foul against Manchester City 
              when Carlos Tevez caught me in the build-up to one of their goals.<br> <br> ‘He said I was too honest and stayed on my feet. He said if I had gone down it would make the decision easier to give.<br> <br> Fall guys: The Tangerines' centre-back Ian Evatt takes on Rooney/Didier Drogba - he's told his team to not be so naive<br> <br> ‘I think that is where we are too naive. Most of us have come through the Championship – a more honest game, so to speak.’<br> <br> The 29-year-old centre-back moved from Queens Park Rangers to Blackpool 
              four years ago and his Tangerines go in to the Boxing Day game in good 
              form – they have collected eight points in their last four games.<br> <br> In their first Premier League season Holloway's side have excelled, and 
              currently sit tenth in the table, only five points off fifth-placed 
              Tottenham.<br> <br> Evatt added: ‘In the Premier League, if you fall over you tend to get decisions. <br> ‘We are not talking about cheating, but sometimes we have to be less naive and go down under a challenge.<br> <br> ‘We’re not going to make a meal of it, just show there’s a foul. It makes the ref’s decision easier.’<br> <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1341375/Be-dishonest-ll-win-free-kicks-referee-Webb-tells-fall-guys-Tangerines-ahead-Liverpool-clash.html#ixzz1AaUvcy5e"></a></p>
