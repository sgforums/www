            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p><strong>SIR ALEX FERGUSON is ready to make a dramatic move for England star Micah Richards.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://blogs.notw.co.uk/photos/uncategorized/2008/05/03/200micahrichards.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="363"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The Manchester United boss has earmarked Richards as his No1 target — and the news will push Manchester City into even deeper crisis. Richards, 19, only recently signed a contract designed to keep him at Eastlands until 2013. But his future is now unclear as owner Thaksin Shinawatra plans a summer overhaul of the club.</strong></p>
              <div class="entry-more">
              <p>And Sport understands that a bid of around £25million would be sufficient for Shinawatra to sell Richards, who is one of those players said to be unhappy about the imminent departure of Sven Goran Eriksson. Bizarrely, Shinawatra has put all player business on hold for the foreseeable future. And I understand that could lead to the departure of key stars such as Richard Dunne and Joe Hart as well as the jewel in the crown, Richards.</p>
              <p>Dunne, with just one year of his current deal left, has been given the cold shoulder by Shinawatra even though the player's agents have tried to get round the table to secure the defender's future. And that looks certain to send Dunne, 28, into the arms of Newcastle's Kevin Keegan. Hart's situation is just as worrying. He signed a long-term deal when he joined from Shrewsbury less than two years ago. But his wages do not match his first team status and his progression to the fringe of England's senior team.</p>
              <p>But it is the possibility that Richards could move across the city that will outrage Blues most. Richards turns 20 next month and while City are realistic enough to know that one of the Big Four is likely to come calling, they had hoped he would stay for several years. And there are also some people within the City hierarchy who believe the club would be best served by selling Richards if they got an offer well in excess of £20million.</p>
              <p>From the player's point of view, a move to his club's bitter rivals would be difficult. And he would have to accept that he would be joining as a right-back - forming a dream back four for Fergie of Richards, Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra.</p>
              <p>But United would be able to almost double his £45,000 a week wages and Richards would be playing Champions League football. Ideally, Arsenal would be the favoured destination if Richards was to be sold by City but Ferguson rarely fails to land someone he has labelled his number one target.</p>

              <p>well, richards been also bit part player this season for man city. at such a age suffering from injury, he could be the next dyer who spent more time on the treatment table than on the field. 20 million? definitely overrated.</p>
