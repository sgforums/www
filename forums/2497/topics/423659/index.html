              <p><em>Football players Baihakki (left) and Shahril could be taking home about $16,000 monthly, not inclusive of other perks such as car and accommodation. (Photo: <span style="color: #000000;">http://www.fas.org.sg</span><span style="color: #000000;">).</span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Shahril Ishak and Baihakki Khaizan could be Singapore’s highest-paid footballers.</strong></p>
              <p>On Wednesday, the Lions duo inked lucrative two-year contracts — each believed to be worth US$300,000 (S$380,000) — with their new club, <span style="color: #000000;">Medan Chiefs,</span><span style="color: #000000;"> in the breakaway </span><span style="color: #000000;">Indonesian Premier League (LPI)</span><span style="color: #000000;">, which has not been sanctioned by the </span><span style="color: #000000;">Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI).</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">They joined the North Sumatran side after quitting </span><span style="color: #000000;">Indonesia Super League (ISL)</span><span style="color: #000000;"> club </span><span style="color: #000000;">Persib Bandung</span><span style="color: #000000;"> on Monday.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The new contracts work out to each player taking home about $16,000 monthly. This is not inclusive of other perks such as a car and an apartment, as well as match bonuses of up to $900 — a marked increase from their previous salaries with Persib.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The new deals for Shahril and Baihakki far outstrip the pay of footballers in the S-League, where the highest salary is believed to be $10,000.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Baihakki, who is a former Geylang United defender, declined to confirm the reported salary figures, but he admitted that it was a “very attractive offer”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">“An opportunity like this might not come again so I had to make the choice in the best interests of myself and my family,” he added. The 27-year-old has a 22-month-old son and his wife Norfasarie is due to give birth to their second child soon.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">But the move to Medan Chiefs might jeopardise their future in the national team.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Since the LPI is not an officially-sanctioned league, both players risk losing their spots in Singapore”s national squad.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">PSSI’s secretary-general Nugraha Besoes told <em>The Straits Times</em> that FIFA, football’s world governing body, considers the LPI an “illegal” league. Currently, Indonesian players plying their trade in the LPI are not eligible to play for the national team, in accordance with FIFA regulations.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The same rule is expected to apply to foreign players although the </span><span style="color: #000000;">Football Association of Singapore (FAS)</span><span style="color: #000000;"> is waiting for a final decision from FIFA on March 1.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">A spokesman reiterated that the FAS will “seek input from FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation before any decision is taken on any Singaporean players who play in this league”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">However, Baihakki has not given up hope of donning the Lions jersey in the future.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">“My heart and soul are still with the Lions but, due to the recent AFF Suzuki Cup failure, I’m not sure if I still have a future. All I can do now is to give my best for my new club and prove that I’m worthy of a call-up,” he explained.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">National captain Shahril, 27, could not be reached for comment.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The LPI is bankrolled by a consortium of businessmen headed by self-made oil tycoon </span><span style="color: #000000;">Arifin Panigoro</span><span style="color: #000000;">, </span>who with his brother Hilmi, is worth US$985 million, according to Forbes.</p>
              <p>It was formed last year because Mr Arifin believed football in Indonesia was stagnating and plagued by corruption. The country has not claimed a major trophy since winning the 1991 South-east Asia Games gold.</p>
              <p>Mr Arifin is also one of four candidates vying for the PSSI presidency in the March 26 elections and if he wins, the LPI could yet end up being “sanctioned”.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, local players supported their national teammates’ decision to move to the rival league even if it means being barred from the national team.</p>
              <p>Said Singapore Armed Forces FC goalkeeper Shahril Jantan, “They’re going to earn almost four times what most players earn here, who can blame them for snapping up the opportunity?”</p>
              <p>“I’m happy for them. The career of a footballer is very short and they’re doing what they can to earn a living. There’s nothing wrong with that,” said veteran striker Aleksandar Duric.</p>
