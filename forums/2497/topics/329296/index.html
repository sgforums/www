              <h2>Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fàbregas has chipped in on the now-settled
              Robinho soap opera by condemning the way the Brazilian acted prior to
              his transfer out of Madrid.</h2>
              <p>Long-time Real Madrid target Cesc Fàbregas has come out to criticize
              former Los Blancos superstar, Robinho for the stunt that he pulled
              several days ago in a desperate attempt to force his exit from the
              Santiago Bernabéu.</p>
              <p>“I do not know him, but I would not have liked it if a teammate of
              mine did what he did, especially just hours before an important game,”
              Fàbregas commented to <em>Marca</em>, referring to how the
              Brazilian organized his own press conference on the same day Real
              Madrid kicked off their campaign at Deportivo La Coruña.</p>
              <p>“It is not the right thing to do, no matter how bad the situation
              was, because they are your teammates and they would not have liked it,”
              he added.</p>
              <p>Fàbregas then admitted that he does not know much about the entire
              saga that has transpired over the summer as he does not keep up with
              the silly rumours, but he warned Robinho that the “Premier League is
              getting more difficult as the standard keeps going up every year”.</p>
              <p>Fàbregas’ comments, ofcourse, were made before he or the rest of the world found out that the Brazilian will now be playing for Manchester City instead of Chelsea, and the pair can now look forward to a pleasant face-off when the two teams meet.</p>

              <p><img src="http://www.setantasports.com/upload/Sport/Football/2008-2009/Spain/Valencia/villa_point.jpg" alt="" width="358" height="191"></p>
              <p><strong>David Villa has joined Robinho’s list of disapproving onlookers,
              insisting he could never spit his dummy out like the Brazilian
              reportedly did at Real Madrid. </strong></p>
              <p>In an increasingly sinister football world, Villa has been the model
              professional this summer – ignoring the lure of Madrid to sign a new
              contract at Valencia, despite their failings at club level last season.</p>
              <p>The 26-year-old was arguably the most sought-after property in
              Europe after his goalscoring exploits at Euro 2008, yet Villa
              consistently stated he would stay at Los Ches.</p>
              <p>Robinho’s move to Manchester City has not sat well with the
              Spaniard, despite the Brazlian’s explanation that he had been made to
              feel unwanted by Madrid</p>
              <p>"I would never do to Valencia what Robinho has done to Madrid,
              because I'm grateful to the club for everything they have done for me,”
              Villa told AS.</p>
              <p>"I don't want to criticise Robinho because I don't know his situation, but I wouldn't have done it.</p>
              <p>"I was never going to force Valencia to let me go. I feel great
              here, I owe so much to Valencia and it was always the club's decision.
              I stayed out of the way.</p>
              <p>"I was really happy when Valencia rejected the offer, not for not
              going to Madrid, but because it was a sign of the confidence they had
              in me and I felt very valued.</p>
              <p>"They chose to keep me instead of taking the money. Valencia valued me more.”</p>

              <p><strong>"Real did not want to retain me. They even used me as a potential exchange to sign Cristiano Ronaldo. "But as that negotiation fell through, they wanted to retain me then. If they didn't want to count on me, I didn't want to stay there either, so that is what I told the president."</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Robinho admitted his first intention was to move to Chelsea to link up with his former international boss Luiz Felipe Scolari, but a number of factors led to Real Madrid cancelling negotiations with the Blues, allowing Manchester City to sign him instead.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: "My first goal was to go to Chelsea as it was the only club to have made a formal offer. "But Real did not like Chelsea shirts with my name on being sold before sorting out the negotiations. "Also, they did not reach the value Real demanded so then Manchester City came in at the last minute to sign me."</p>
              <p class="article">The former Sao Paulo ace conceded one of the main reasons behind his decision to quit the Bernebeu was due to Real’s refusal to allow him to play at the Olympic Games.</p>
              <p class="article">The Primera Liga giants denied the forward the chance to play in Beijing last month, with president Ramon Calderon claiming the player had an injury. Robinho added: “I cried when he didn't let me play at the Olympics and you can check that by asking him.</p>
              <p class="article">"I didn't cry to quit. I just told him I didn't want to stay there any longer so I asked to be transferred."</p>

              <p>I don't think he wasn't aware what club he was signing for lah... Thats quite unbelivable... Reports that Scolari even called him before the deadline time to persuade him to sign for Chelsea instead and not for City can't leave him not knowing what he was doing... And the extra money he would get from the City deal... Surely he will want to know what $ he would be getting right...</p>
              <p>Some people are unhappy with him but I actually think he has made a brilliant choice in the long term... cos not only did he get paid more, City are going places with their new owners... And he will be a pioneer member to their bright new world... Had he gone to Chelsea at this time, he would have just been one more of their good players and maybe play as a sub more often than not... Now at City, is will be their biggest star. And being only 24, he is still very young... Given another 2 to 3 yrs... City could be bigger than Chelsea... So if it was really a mistake, then I would say he made a lucky mistake... lol</p>
