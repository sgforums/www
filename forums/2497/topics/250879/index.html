            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Obviously Giggs wins hands down... Giggs has been doing this since he was 17... And how old is Robben? 22, 23... Robben only came to notice when he was about 20 or 21... So actually Robben has only been around for 3 yrs...<br><br>Those of you who are comparing the present Giggs with Robben are probably not aware that Giggs has change his game by alot. I have watch many old repeat or classic matches of past EPL games to say that Giggs was far better than Robben on the left wing... Just watching his goal in the FA Cup Semi-Finals against Arsenal will tell you that. Gunners had the best defence at that time and probably one of the best keepers too yet he manage to run through the whole of it and finish it with a great strike.<br><br>As age caught up with him, now with lesser speed he has still manager to keep his usefulness by changing his style of play and also taking up a different position... Not many good players on the wing could do so... Players like David Ginola, Marc Overmars, Fredrik Ljungberg all good players around the same age as him probably stayed on the wing for most of their careers and they probably didn't last to his age. Even Harry Kewell, once a great left winger who is only 29 seems like his career at the top is over. Giggs has still manage to maintain at the high end of his game and has also done well in the central of midfield.<br><br>Robben still has a long way to go as he is only 20+... Can he last to 33 going on to 34 its hard to say, Can he even stay as good as present when he reach 29, 30 when most players loses their speed is another matter altogether... Another thing is, Robben looks rather weak, a good player he is but maybe better off in La Liga or another league to prolong his career at the top where the tackling isn't as heavy as in the EPL.<br><br></div>

Basically because Giggs has that little bit of touch that Robben lacks. Maybe not refined. To illustrate, if I compare Robben with Ronaldo, Ronaldo is also better at those deft little touches than Robben.<br><br>But like I said, Robben gets more power and height on the ball at times.</div>
