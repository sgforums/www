              <p>The England team hotel was infiltrated by two of Britain's most 
              notorious pranksters last week, <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>can reveal, leading to concerns about the effectiveness of the 
              FA's security arrangements.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/10/article-1257072-08AAF505000005DC-202_306x423.jpg" alt="Dunn" width="306" height="423">

              </div>
              <p>Questions will be asked about how Tommy Dunn and his son, also named 
              Tommy, were among three men who not only executed a secretly filmed 
              sting operation on John Terry but also gained access to an accredited 
              area of the hotel where players attend media commitments.Â </p>
              <p>Dressed
               in suits, the hoaxers spent much of Monday in and around the grounds of
               the five-star Grove Hotel in Hertfordshire without detection. The FA 
              have been informed of their presence and will explore the security 
              breach.</p>
              <p>Earlier this week, Fabio Capello and his staff were 
              shocked to discover that a meeting room they used in the build-up to the
               friendly against Egypt last Wednesday was bugged. It is understood a 
              potentially embarrassing six-hour recording, which is now in the hands 
              of a national newspaper, was made. The FA are trying to obtain a copy 
              and their investigation has so far failed to uncover the identity of the
               spies.</p>
              <p>However, the presence of the pranksters
               will lead to further questions for security chief and former police 
              officer Ray Whitworth and his team. The FA declined to comment last 
              night.</p>

              <p>Last Monday the Dunns and an associate waited for Terry to alight 
              from the team bus after training and asked him for an autograph.</p>
              <p>Dunn
               Jnr asked him to address it 'to Wayne' with a note saying 'sorry'. 
              Terry obviously realised it was a reference to Wayne Bridge and after a 
              brief four-letter exchange wrote 'To Wayne, best wishes'.</p>

              </div>
              <p>The recording of Terry quickly appeared on the internet. Sportsmail 
              contacted the FA yesterday to inform them that the Dunns are best known 
              as close associates of hoaxer Karl Power, who first made headline news 
              in April 2001 when he strolled on to the pitch at Munich's Olympic 
              Stadium and took up position alongside Andy Cole for Manchester United's
               team photograph just before their Champions League match against 
              Bayern.</p>

              <p>In the past Dunn Snr has managed to gain access to a packed 
              Manchester United dressing room while carrying camera equipment, and a 
              limousine taking Sir Alex Ferguson away from a Champions League match.</p>

              <p>Dunn Jnr is best known for joining Power on Centre Court at Wimbledon
               before a Tim Henman match in July 2002. The pair played a short game 
              before leaving of their own accord because they ran out of balls.</p>

              <p>Yesterday the Daily Mail spoke to Power and Dunn's wife at their 
              homes in Manchester. Mrs Dunn had no comment, but Power said: 'Tommy has
               pulled off a lot of stunts in the past but I didn't know anything about
               the John Terry one.'</p>
              <p>The FA have launched an investigation 
              into last week's security breach and were grateful for the information 
              Sportsmail passed to them yesterday.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/10/article-0-00428BA500000258-911_306x423.jpg" alt="Karl Power " width="306" height="423">

              </div>
              <p>The bugging is a serious breach of privacy laws, and FA lawyers have 
              so far been successful in stopping the contents of the tape being 
              published.</p>
              <p>Yesterday they were still in discussions with the 
              lawyers representing a national newspaper in a bid to get a copy of the 
              recording.</p>
              <p>In an interview in 2002, Power and Dunn Snr 
              discussed their various pranks. 'We grew up together,' Power says of 
              Dunn. 'I've known him since I was three weeks old... he's not changed.'</p>
              <p>In 1999 Dunn followed United around Europe videoing the team. 'I'd just
               go to United games in Europe and end up in the changing rooms while the
               players was in there,' he said.</p>
              <p>Passing himself off as a 
              journalist, he also gained access to official Champions League press 
              conferences and memorably asked United's manager: 'Is it true you have 
              been approached to manage Manchester City, Mr Ferguson?' 'I think I 
              started relaxing him in press conferences,' said Dunn.</p>
              <p>In 
              Valencia, after a Champions League quarter-final clash, Dunn followed 
              Ferguson into the limo taking him away from the stadium. 'I just got 
              in,' said Dunn. 'The security guy thought I was with him.'</p>
              <p>Dunn
               continued: 'So I'm in the limousine with him now. It's him, me and the 
              driver and his minder. He turned round and said, "What are you doing?" 
              So I said, "Can you give us a lift to town?" I thought, I better be 
              quiet, I've upset him here, but he broke the ice with me. "Who d'you 
              want in the semi-final?" and all that lot. The other two guys couldn't 
              speak English, so I was the logical choice to speak to.'</p>
