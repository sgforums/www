              <h1>Cech: Lampard Would Be Hard To Replace</h1>
              <h2>Petr Cech is keeping his fingers crossed that his Chelsea teammate Frank Lampard ultimately decides to resist the lure of a big money move to Inter Milan.</h2>

              <p><strong>With The Sun claiming that former Blues boss Jose Mourinho has urged Lampard to hand in a transfer request immediately to fast-track negotiations, which were opened yesterday when Inter reportedly faxed a â‚¤6.5million bid to the Blues, Cech says that the England man's goal contribution would be sorely missed.</strong><br><br>"It is always difficult to replace someone who scores more than 20 goals a season from midfield for four years in a row," Cech told Czech media.<br><br>"He (Lampard) is still negotiating so hopefully that goes well because you always welcome players with that sort of quality. He has been a key player for Chelsea since he joined."<br><br>The move has been mooted for several weeks in the press, as Mourinho has made the signing of Lampard one of his top priorities after taking the reins at Inter.</p>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>INTER MILAN want Frank Lampard to tell Big Phil Scolari: I’m off. Scolari faces a nightmare start to his reign as Chelsea boss as the Italian giants step up their bid to lure Lamps to the San Siro.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">A senior Inter source told SunSport: “We will do whatever is necessary to sign Lampard. "Jose Mourinho has informed the president he wants Lamps at the club by the time the players return on July 16. “We are confident we will fulfil the coach’s wish.”</p>
              <p class="article">Inter officials are employing the same kind of guerrilla tactics Real Madrid have used in their efforts to capture Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo. Lampard, 30, reported back for Chelsea’s pre-season yesterday but did not speak one-on-one with the manager. But Scolari did call a team meeting in which he vowed to bring trophies to the club next season.</p>
              <p class="article">The former Portugal chief remains keen to keep Lampard even if it is only for the last year of the midfielder’s deal. A meeting between the two is now scheduled for tomorrow and Inter will apply pressure on the England man to request a move to Italy.</p>
