Northern Ireland manager Lawrie Sanchez will take over on a caretaker basis for the remainder of the season.</strong><br><br>The Cottagers lie four points above the Premiership drop zone after a seven-game winless streak, but the sacking still comes as a surprise. Fulham issued a statement thanking Coleman for his "fantastic service during his 10 years at the club".<br><br>"It is disappointing that the club has no alternative but to part company [with Coleman]," the statement continued.<br><br>"As a team and organisation Fulham Football Club has goals to attain and success to achieve and by no means can this be compromised. "As part of the restructure, Steve Kean will also be replaced with immediate effect.<br><br>"After consultation with the Irish FA president Jim Boyce, it is agreed that Lawrie Sanchez will join as caretaker manager for the remaining five Premiership games of the season."<br><br>Coleman joined Fulham as a player in 1997 in a Â£2m move from Blackburn, but injuries suffered in a car crash in 2001 led to his retirement less then two years later. He took over as manager in April 2003 following the departure of Jean Tigana.<br><br>Sanchez has led Northern Ireland to the top of their European Championships qualifying group with victories over Spain and Sweden. He also oversaw a famous 1-0 win over England in the last World Cup qualifying competition.<br><br></div>

Coleman last night broke his silence about the revelations wife Belinda bugged his car as she suspected an affair. The Craven Cottage chief warned the coupleÂ’s son and three daughters to expect ugly headlines about him when he took his job four years ago. But he expected them to be professional rather than personal.</strong><br><br>Fans taunted him with chants of Â‘You donÂ’t know what youÂ’re doingÂ’ during last weekendÂ’s 1-1 home draw with Ports-mouth. But Coleman, 36, insists he is strong enough to cope with the intense interest sparked by the story about his marriage.<br><br>He said: Â“My wife doesnÂ’t see a lot of me because of my job but whatever is going on with my private life, no one wants to read about themselves like that. Â“ItÂ’s not easy. WeÂ’ve got four children and IÂ’m away a lot. Â“You wouldnÂ’t go into this job if you never thought you were going to get some bad headlines. I had some bad ones Â— football-related ones Â— last year but nothing on this scale.<br><br>Â“Luckily, I primed my children when I took the job four years ago that Â‘This is daddyÂ’s new job and sooner or later something will happen and we wonÂ’t like what we are readingÂ’. Â“The kids will be all right. My youngest daughter is seven, my other daughters are nine and 12 and my boy is 14. "He is away skiing this week and the girls are off school. But this is what I do for a living and you always run the risk of your private life becoming public.<br><br>Â“I was surprised when I heard the allegation of the intrusion. But when you are in a high-profile job, there are lots of good things that come with that and thereÂ’s also going to be some interest into your private life. Â“But you have to take the rough with the smooth. ItÂ’s as simple as that. Â“Sometimes, it doesnÂ’t make for good reading. But I have to get on with it. ItÂ’s my turn, Â“WeÂ’ve got to get through it as a family and hope it goes away because it doesnÂ’t last forever. Â“It might last a few days or a week and there may be uglier stories coming out. But weÂ’ve just got to accept itÂ’s the nature of the game.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m surprised people think my private life is more important to the public than football games but I canÂ’t do a lot to stop that. Â“It surprises me people could be interested in my marriage. I never thought IÂ’m invincible or untouchable, that nothing is ever going to happen to me.Â”<br><br>Coleman admits he was the subject of training-ground banter from his players when the story emerged his wife had a listening device and electronic tracker fitted to his car. He said: Â“My staff are absolutely magnificent but when I stepped on to the training ground, some of the players ripped me to pieces. Â“ItÂ’s the worst place to be, with professional footballers when thereÂ’s a bit of p***- taking to be done.<br><br>As for pressure from fans, Coleman admits he has a Â‘sickÂ’ streak which makes him thrive on proving others wrong. He added: Â“I do still enjoy it, sick isnÂ’t it? Last week, I took off Brian McBride and the fans sang Â‘You donÂ’t know what youÂ’re doingÂ’. Â“But thereÂ’s a streak in me that says Â‘I do know exactly what I am doingÂ’. You have to be brave and a bit arrogant and make decisions that either come off or donÂ’t. I love it.<br><br>"Last year there was a picture in one paper of me and my coaches Steve Kean and Dave Beasant with big axes above our heads. Â“We had lost four in a row Â— but then we beat Chelsea.Â”<br><br>Â“IÂ’ve maybe kicked myself in the b***s saying we are going to be in the top 10 and built it up more than I should have. Â“It would take a lot of money to establish ourselves in the top 10, probably about Â£20million. Â“The chairman will chew my ears off or give me praise but heÂ’s never told me Â‘YouÂ’ve got to get a result or elseÂ’. Â“And IÂ’ve never gone to him and said I want Â£15m or IÂ’m off, IÂ’ve never spat my dummy out Â— and I wouldnÂ’t.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Chris Coleman has done alot for his team. I think is the team and the management let him down. Sell away Saha, Malbranque. If you keep selling away your best players you where got chance? They also suay, Bullard their best player kena injured for so damn long.<br><br>Still I think its time to move on and is good for both of them. But to do so at this time is suicide for Fulham. I think Sheffield united and Watford will be going down. The other slot depends.</div>
