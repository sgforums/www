              <p class="imageCaption" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson is determined to remain Manchester United manager for at 
              least one more season, disappointing Jose Mourinho, who hopes to succeed him at 
              Old Trafford.</strong></p>
              <p>The United boss emphasised his continuing enthusiasm for the job with his 
              touchline celebrations yesterday after Paul Scholes’ 93rd-minute winner against 
              Manchester City pulled his team right back into the title race.</p>
              <p>With Chelsea stumbling to a 2-1 defeat five hours later at Tottenham — where 
              captain John Terry was sent off — United’s 1-0 victory lifted them just one 
              point behind with three games to play.</p>
              <p>There have been reports that Sir Alex was considering ending his career at 
              United, following the club’s exit from the Champions League. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/17/article-0-092CBB8D000005DC-111_468x341.jpg" alt="Manchester United Manager Sir Alex Ferguson celebrates as Manchester City Manager Roberto Mancini looks on" width="468" height="341">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Victory dance: Sir Alex shows his vim and vigour at

              <p><strong>But the 68-year-old Scot intends to be in charge at least to see out the new 
              one-year contracts handed to Scholes and his fellow veteran Ryan Giggs last 
              week. </strong></p>
              <p>Former United skipper Steve Bruce, now in charge at Sunderland, poured scorn 
              on any suggestion that his old manager would retire imminently. ‘It’s a load of 
              rubbish. He’ll be around for a long time yet,’ he said last night.</p>
              <p>Ferguson feared his team’s challenge for the Premier League would have ended 
              if they had not secured a victory yesterday. </p>
              <p>Asked if the title race was over without the Scholes goal, he said: ‘It 
              looked that way. It would have made it very difficult. There’s no doubt that we 
              deserved to win the game,<br>but I couldn’t see a goal coming.</p>
              <p>‘I think Paul was man of the match. He was absolutely fantastic. Such a 
              skilful player. ‘It was an amazing finish. We have had three last-minute goals against City 
              now this season, but deserve it.</p>
              <p>‘We had the best chances but it did not look like anyone was going to win. 
              The game became very open in the last 10 minutes.’ </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Ferguson’s decision to stay at United is bad news for Mourinho, who would 
              dearly love to be the one to follow the Scot — and sooner rather than later. </strong></p>
              <p>Any move by Mourinho from Inter Milan would spark a managerial merry-go-round 
              this summer which could see changes at top-flight clubs in England, Italy and 
              Spain.</p>
              <p>The Portuguese boss heads Real Madrid’s wish list to succeed Manuel 
              Pellegrini, who will be fired at the end of the season.</p>
              <p>If he does decides to stay at Inter and wait until the United job becomes 
              available, the<br>Spaniards will make an effort to lure England manager Fabio 
              Capello. </p>
              <div class="thinCenter">Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez does not even appear to be on Real’s radar but 
              coveting the coaching role at the Bernabeu might well have cost him any chance 
              he had of taking over at Juventus. </div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><br></div>
              <p>The word from Turin is the Italians have tired of waiting for an answer from 
              Benitez and have now targeted City’s Roberto Mancini.</p>
              <p>Mourinho has always insisted he will honour his Inter contract, which has 
              another two<br>seasons to run. But he has also made no secret of his ambition to return to Premier League 
              management. Having turned down City, he still wants the United job more than any 
              other.</p>
              <p>The big question is whether he would be prepared to wait and take his chances 
              of<br>inheriting Ferguson’s chair at Old Trafford.</p>
