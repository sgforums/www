              <p><strong>When Rafa Benitez welcomed his friend and fellow Spaniard Roberto Martinez to Premier League management during the summer, it was hard to imagine that within weeks the master would be studying the pupil.</strong></p>
              <p>Yet, that is what has happened ahead of <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool</span></a>'s first Big Four confrontation of the season, against Carlo Ancelotti's <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span></a> at Stamford Bridge today.</p>
              <p>Liverpool's players spent part of yesterday at Melwood looking at a DVD of the way Martinez's <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/wigan-athletic.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Wigan</span></a> dismantled Chelsea 3-1 last weekend.</p>
              <p>'I watched a recording of the game and my staff compiled clips for my players to analyse,' said Benitez.</p>
              <p>'Wigan had a very good gameplan and made it difficult for Chelsea. Yes, we can learn from it even though our players are different to Wigan, more technical and not as physical.</p>
              <p>'I know Roberto, so I knew what he was thinking for that match. We have looked at the way Chelsea defended, how they attacked, how they were at set-pieces. And we have used it in our training.'</p>
              <p>Benitez has made it a priority to make sure his side are not overrun by the Chelsea machine headed by Michael Essien and Didier Drogba.</p>
              <p>The canny Liverpool manager, who masterminded Chelsea's first home defeat since 2004 last October, is putting huge importance on the return of Javier Mascherano from a hamstring injury after missing the Champions League defeat at Fiorentina and may also use Steven Gerrard in a deeper role.</p>
              <p>'This game is ideal for Mascherano,' said Benitez. 'Chelsea likeo pass the ball along the floor and Mascherano is a worker. He can regain a lot of the ball.</p>
              <p>'We have used Stevie close to Fernando Torres in away games as we thought they could be dangerous. But we have to look at what happened against Fiorentina.</p>
              <p>'It won't be a problem for Stevie. He is pleased to play as a second striker or a midfielder.'</p>

              <p>Fergie is visiting a school. In one class, he asks the students if anyone can give him an example of a "tragedy." <br> <br> One little boy stands up and offers that, "If my best friend who lives
              next door is playing in the street when a car came by and killed him,
              that would be a tragedy."<br> <br> "No," Fergie says, "That would be an ACCIDENT."<br> <br> A girl raises her hand. "If a school bus carrying fifty children drove
              off a cliff, killing everyone inside...that would be a tragedy."<br> <br> "I'm afraid not," explains Fergie. "That is what we would call a GREAT LOSS."<br> <br> The room is silent; none of the other children dare volunteer.<br> <br> "What?" asks Fergie, "Isn't there anyone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?"<br> <br> Finally a boy in the back raises his hand. In a timid voice, he says:
              "If an airplane carrying Fergie and Wenger was blown up by a
              bomb, *that* would be a tragedy."<br> <br> "Wonderful!" Fergie beams. "Marvelous! And can you tell me WHY that would be a tragedy?"<br> <br> "Well," says the boy, "because it wouldn't be an accident, and it certainly would be no great loss!"</p>
