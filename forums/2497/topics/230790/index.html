Real's sporting director Predrag Mijatovic was reported to have said: Â“Beckham will leave us, we will not renew his contract.Â” But the player's spokesman has since claimed Real's offer is Â“still on the tableÂ” and that talks will resume on a two-year contract extension tomorrow.<br><br>With his deal coming to an end, Beckham can talk to interested clubs to discuss a Bosman free transfer. Inter Milan head a list of top European clubs who want to sign the ex-Manchester United star, although he is understood to be tempted with a move to the United States.<br><br>Only yesterday Mijatovic said: Â“Several months ago we presented an offer to renew his contract due to his importance not only from a sporting sense but from an image one. Â“He wanted some time to think about it but we are in a situation where we lack time and we have to react now.Â”<br><br>MijatovicÂ’s alleged announcement ties in with Real coach Fabio CapelloÂ’s stance for tomorrowÂ’s Copa del Rey game with Real Betis. Beckham was one of six senior players left out, along with Ronaldo, Antonio Cassano, Michel Salgado, Francisco Pavon and Alvaro Mejia.<br><br>It follows MondayÂ’s emergency meeting where the coach met with Real president Ramon Calderon, Mijatovic and technical secretary Franco Baldini to discuss the clubÂ’s poor form.<br><br>Mijatovic revealed after the meeting that the problems facing Real had been pinpointed and solutions devised that would be implemented over time.<br><br>Capello said: Â“Tomorrow we are going to see some small changes, we are going to put out some different players. Â“In the last two games, we have lost the character and desire which we had up until that point.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>DAVID BECKHAM is at war with Real Madrid and is today expected to tell them: IÂ’m off.</strong><br><br>Goldenballs has been axed from the squad in the Bernabeu bloodbath, while Real yesterday let slip they will not renew his contract. BecksÂ’ advisors face showdown talks today with Real chiefs Â— and it now seems certain his 3Â½-year reign in Spain is coming to an end.<br><br>Madrid coach Fabio Capello has clearly run out of patience with the former England midfielder, who has been stalling over signing a new deal since October.<br><br>Comments made yesterday by Predrag Mijatovic revealed BeckhamÂ’s future is not at the Bernabeu. The Real sports director was quoted on Italian TV as saying: Â“Beckham will leave us. We will not renew his contract.Â” That put Premiership clubs like Bolton, Spurs, Blackburn, West Ham and Newcastle on red alert Â— along with Inter Milan.<br><br>MijatovicÂ’s words were later dismissed as mis-translation but the signs are Beckham, 31, will go to America Â— and LA Galaxy Â— in the summer. But the Americans are refusing to cough up the Â£4m Real want for Becks.<br><br>LA Galaxy are happy to wait until June when they can sign the player for free Â— even though he will have missed the first half of the US season.<br><br>The situation will become clearer after BecksÂ’ advisor, Terry Byrne, meets Real bosses today.<br></div>

"I think the one thing it's done has got rid of the stigma. Ever since Pele and Beckenbauer and all those other guys came over here, it put a stigma on our league. Not only among journalists but among players.<br><br>"Quite frankly that stigma should have been gone a long time ago but Beckham coming while he's still at the top of his game - it's only a few months ago that he was captain of England at a World Cup - will help.<br>"What it will do is encourage other players to come here, and not at 34 or 36 when they're past it.''<br><br>Beckham's move though, has seen Nicol being transformed from a struggling recruiter into a coach in demand from across the Atlantic.<br><br>"In the past, players have said to me: 'I'll come and play for you but in a couple of years when I'm done at my club'. But now, even since Beckham's announcement, I've had players on the phone, I've had agents on the phone wanting to come and play in MLS.<br><br>"Before Beckham signed his contract they'd never have dreamed of coming."<br></div>

"David will be received as a superstar over there," he said. "He has the looks, the whole thing. IÂ’m sure people this side of the pond were upset when he decided to join the Galaxy, but he will be welcomed with open arms.<br><br>"He'll bring tremendous interest and support to the sport. Twenty per cent of America is Latino, and they just live for soccer. With Beckham there, it'll really take off. "I haven't met him yet, but I might just put him in my next Rambo film and chase him round the jungle for a couple of months!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>LEGAL OPTION FOR AXED BECKHAM</strong><br><br>David Beckham would have a strong legal claim for loss of image rights if Real Madrid boss Fabio Capello refuses to pick him on non-footballing grounds, according to sports lawyer Mel Goldberg.<br><br>Capello stated at the weekend the former England captain would not play at the Bernabeu before joining LA Galaxy in the summer, and although he appeared to soften his stance slightly ahead of the Copa Del Rey clash against Real Betis, Beckham's immediate future appears in limbo.<br><br>The 31-year-old is not in the squad for Thursday's Betis clash and if he continues to be overlooked for reasons other than football, Beckham could build a legal case.<br><br>"He would have a good case because it damages his image rights," said Goldberg. "In turn, Beckham has to turn up and play to the best of his ability. If he refused then he would be in breach of contract."<br><br>A legal case from a player against a club would be rare, but Beckham is in a unique position as his huge deal to move to America is likely to be his final contract.<br><br>Meanwhile, Real president Ramon Calderon has apologised for the controversial comments he made about Beckham during a student conference.<br><br>Calderon criticised several Real players including Beckham, who he said "will be an average cinema actor living in Hollywood".<br><br>Calderon issued a statement, which read: "I want to apologise a thousand times to anyone that might have been offended. "But I want people to know that everything I've done since I got here has been for the good of the club."<br><br>Calderon added: "Beckham has changed his approach because his attitude is not going to be the same when he moves outside of Europe. "Beckham is an elite footballer and he has always shown exemplary behaviour."<br><br></div>
