              <p>Manchester United have accepted an £80m offer from Real Madrid for Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/PH2/cron2750527.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="275" height="200">
              <div style="width: 275px;">
              <p class="photoCredit">GettyImages</p>
              <p class="photoDesc">Cristiano Ronaldo's last game for United was the Champions League final defeat to Barca</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>A statement on the United website confirmed that a deal for the 24-year-old should be completed by the end of the month.</p>
              <p>''Manchester United have received a world-record, unconditional offer of £80million for Cristiano Ronaldo from Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>''At
              Cristiano's request - who has again expressed his desire to leave - and
              after discussion with the player's representatives, United have agreed
              to give Real Madrid permission to talk to the player.</p>
              <p>''Matters are expected to be concluded by 30 June. The club will not comment until further notice.''</p>
              <p>Ronaldo
              has long been a target for the Spanish giants, whose president
              Florentino Perez vowed earlier this week to do ''everything possible''
              to take the 24-year-old to the Bernabeu.</p>
              <p>It is now certain that a
              second era of "Galacticos" has begun at Madird, with news of Ronaldo's
              £80m deal coming in the same week Perez agreed a £59m, deal to sign
              Kaka.</p>
              <p>The news is bound to be greeted with some scepticism by
              United fans who have repeatedly been told no deal had been agreed for
              the sale of FIFA's world player of the year in the face of regular
              statements from Spain the former Sporting Lisbon star was bound for the
              Bernabeu.</p>
              <p>It was even suggested Ronaldo would be due a £20m
              compensation fee from Real if the deal did not go through by June 30,
              the date United now state themselves is when they expect matters to be
              concluded.</p>
              <p>As it now seems a matter of when, rather than if a
              world record transfer will be completed, Sir Alex Ferguson might wish
              to explain why he has gone back on his famous comment in December last
              year that he would not ''sell that mob a virus''.</p>
              <p>It is the first time for many years United would have allowed a player to leave they were not happy about losing.</p>
              <p>Yet
              some supporters may be pleased that at least another drawn-out transfer
              saga, such as the one 12 months ago, is not played out in public.</p>
              <p>At
              least the money could be reinvested in a squad that almost, but not
              quite proved good enough to win back-to-back Champions League trophies,
              in addition to a hat-trick of Premier League titles.</p>
              <p>In reshaping
              a squad that looks almost certain to lose Carlos Tevez as well,
              Ferguson might be able to offer Wayne Rooney a more permanent central
              striking role and fulfil the promise he has shown on the international
              stage this season.</p>
              <p>The name of Bayern Munich's Franck Ribery is
              bound to crop up as a potential replacement, although the 27-year-old
              seems hugely overpriced at the £40m figure being bandied about in some
              quarters, with Wigan's Antonio Valencia also in the frame.</p>
              <p>Ferguson
              will certainly be making plans already to ensure his new faces are on
              board before United head to Asia for their pre-season tour five weeks
              from today.</p>
              <p>Amid the frenzy over Ronaldo's impending departure,
              it is bound to be asked whether the current debt hanging over United of
              almost £700m has played any part in the decision to accept Real's huge
              bid.</p>
              <p>While Ferguson has always backed the Glazer family for the
              backing he has received, supporters will now be interested to see
              whether their manager is handed all the funds received from Spain, plus
              an annual transfer kitty said to be around £25m.</p>
              <p>With Edwin van
              der Sar, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Gary Neville all reaching the end
              of their careers, it promises to be a far more testing summer than
              Ferguson might have realised.</p>
              <p>And, for all the petulance and
              pouting for which Ronaldo is so famed, filling the void created by the
              loss of his immense talent may prove difficult.</p>

              *Barcelona finance director Xavier Sala i Martin is bewildered as to how Real Madrid are funding their summer spending spree. With a reported transfer budget of 300million euros at their disposal, Madrid president Florentino Perez has this week set about creating a second 'galacticos' era.*
              
              The Spanish giants had a world-record bid of Â£80million for Portugal winger Cristiano Ronaldo accepted by Manchester United on Thursday, hot on the heels of Monday's 68million euros acquisition of Brazil playmaker Kaka from AC Milan. 
              
              And Sala i Martin, whose team finished nine points clear of Madrid at the Primera Division summit last month, is puzzled by how the purchases are being financed. 
              
              He told Radio Station RAC1: "I don't know where the 300million euros that Florentino Perez expects to invest on signings are coming from. "He says he will recover that money by selling shirts but, in order to do that, he will have to sell 30million shirts. That is impossible." 
              
              Sala i Martin is stunned Madrid are able to spend so much money in such a difficult economic climate. He added: "I guess someone will have to give him that money and it would be good for him to explain where it will come from. 
              
              "How can it be that a football team is loaned so much money, considering the current financial crisis in the country and the policy of restricting credits that banks are currently following? 
              
              "I can assure you that we will not pay 65million euros for a player. "For that amount we would buy the whole Barcelona team that won the Champions League in Rome."

              Will RM be like Leeds in a few years time? maybe the King of Spain has something to do with RM having 300m euros to spend on players.
              
              Maybe the Banks lend RM money with little or no interest charges, or the Banks involved were given shares in RM and given board seat, who knows?
              
              Or Perez is using his own money since he is a billionaire, or a consortium coughing up silly money 300m euros. At the rate RM is spending, even Man City has difficulty spending this type of money even with Sheik's money :)

              he didn't exactly do much this season.............in fact, his contribution in terms of goals or assists isn't that prolific.....you get the occasional flash but no consistency....not in the league of gerrard or lampard...
