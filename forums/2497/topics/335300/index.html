And Arsenal ace Cesc Fabregas taunted them further by claiming they are not good enough to beat Arsenal’s ladies! </h2>
              <p class="article">The two sides clash in the big North London derby tonight — a baptism of fire for new Tottenham chief Harry Redknapp. Gunners boss Wenger believes Ramos, who was fired on Saturday, should be in the visiting dugout at the Emirates this evening. </p>
              <p class="article">Wenger said: “I don’t think he’d have been sacked if he had only arrived at Tottenham in July. "But the fact is he arrived in the middle of last season and people were less patient with their league position. </p>
              <p class="article">“What sometimes happens in this league is when a team doesn’t go for Europe and wins the Carling Cup, they suddenly switch off. </p>
              <p class="article">“Without anyone noticing, slowly you lose results. And then, if you don’t start the next season well, which is what happened to Ramos, his environment slowly lost confidence in him. </p>
              <p class="article">“I am very surprised it didn’t work for Ramos and I feel sorry for him because I rate him as a coach and as a man.</p>
              <p class="article">Fabregas also took a pop at Spurs when he teased them about playing Arsenal’s ladies. He told lads’ mag Loaded that Vic Akers’ all-conquering women’s side would give the White Hart Lane men a tough game. </p>
              <p class="article">Fab said: “They would do really well. I’m sure they would get a point!” The last time the two sides met Spurs beat Arsenal 5-1 in the Carling Cup semi-final, second leg in January — that was Spurs’ first win in 22 games against their rivals.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The Football Association have urged supporters to behave at tonight's north London derby after admitting to concerns over the level of crowd violence creeping back into stadiums.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal </span>take on <span style="color: #003580;">Tottenham </span>just four days after 29 arrests were made as Sunderland and Newcastle fans clashed at the Stadium of Light. Five arrests were made at Arsenal's last home match against Everton when fans fought inside the ground.</p>
              <p>A section of Spurs supporters were also condemned after directing homophobic chants towards Sol Campbell during their visit to Portsmouth last month. The north London derby is always a high-profile fixture and has been given added spice with Spurs being rooted to the bottom of the table and Harry Redknapp's appointment as manager. </p>
              <p>The game is also being screened live on Sky TV and the FA are keen to avoid more trouble as two fierce rivals clash at Emirates Stadium. </p>
              <p>An FA spokesman said: 'We have seen some incidents in the last two weeks which are completely unacceptable and have no place in football. The FA, clubs and police have been working hard to identify those involved.</p>
              <p>'Our message to any fans planning on causing trouble is that there will be a joint approach between the football authorities and the police to deal in the strongest possible way with any troublemakers.'</p>
              <p>Local police are not anticipating any trouble and have not increased the number of officers on duty in and around the stadium, a presence in excess of 400. </p>
              <p>But a police source said that Arsenal fans started the trouble against Everton 11 days ago with a section of the upper tier above the visiting support throwing objects at those below them.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Arsenal striker Emmanuel Adebayor admitted feeling pity towards rivals Tottenham. The Togo striker told talkSPORT: 'I think every player feels sorry for them. At the moment Tottenham are really bad, they lack confidence and when you lack confidence it's always difficult to win games.'<br> </p>

              <p><strong>Emmanuel Adebayor admits the R-word is very much in the air at the Emirates Stadium. That’s revenge not Redknapp.</strong> <br><br><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal</span></a> have stewed for nine months on the 5-1 thrashing they took at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Tottenham</span></a> in the Carling Cup semi-final. It was a night when the Gunners lost the plot, leaking goals and fighting among themselves, but Adebayor is determined to make amends and what better way than to cut Harry Redknapp’s Spurs revival dead in its tracks? <br><br>‘My last memory of Tottenham was very bad and I’m looking to change that and give them something special,’ said the striker who took his frustrations out on team-mate Nicklas Bendtner during the humiliation at White Hart Lane.</p>

              <p><em>Screamer: David Bentley unleashes the shot which gave Spurs the lead at Arsenal</em></p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/10/30/article-0-024B0E41000005DC-218_468x488.jpg" alt="After watching his stunning strike go in, Bentley celebrates" width="468" height="488"></p>
              <p><em>Cue celebrations: after watching his stunning strike go in, Bentley celebrates</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>David Bentley scored a stunning 40-yard goal for Tottenham in a stunning derby draw at his old club Arsenal and then declared: ‘I feel like Superman, I could fly home.’</strong> <br><br>The north London rivals slugged it out in dramatic fashion as Harry Redknapp’s Spurs came from 4-2 down to snatch a breathtaking draw with an Aaron Lennon equaliser deep in injury-time at the Emirates Stadium.<br><br>Redknapp, only in the job since Saturday night, must have felt like Harry Houdini after the game but already Spurs are beginning to show the bulldog spirit epitomised by the wily old campaigner.</p>
              <p>He said: ‘We pulled an amazing result out of the bag. Coming back tonight, they showed what they are made of. I said to them I’d work on their confidence. Everything in life comes down to confidence.<br><br>‘I haven’t experienced many games like that. It looked all over. It was great to come back, an amazing finish.’</p>
              <p>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger was left looking for the positives after dominating the game. ‘I believe that we produced an excellent match,’ he said. ‘With two minutes to go, there was no Harry Redknapp factor. It’s very difficult to prove scientifically why that happened. At 4-2, they had given up but we got them back into the game. On the positive side, we were really superior to Tottenham.’ <br><br>Yet, former Arsenal youth product Bentley was left to savour the occasion and he said: ‘We showed character and spirit. We showed we are a top team willing to fight for every point. You’re going to get criticised when you’re not performing and certain things have gone on, but we have sorted them out and we’re going in the right direction now.’</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Impressive is because of the endurance they displayed as a unit, not their performance... To be down by 2 goals and come back 2 times deserve some kind of respect.

              <p>Like i said, lots of side 2 goals down, last 5 mins would just kick the ball around waiting for the end but their spirit were impressive if not their performance... Moreover, how many sides come to Arsenal and score 4 goals...</p>
