              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">MANCHESTER UNITED will look a bit of all white this season — thanks to their sparkling new away kit.</h2>
              <p>Alex Ferguson's Red Devils will adopt their pasty new colours for trips outside of their Old Trafford home for the forthcoming campaign.</p>
              <p>The latest top features a black and red trim with a bold chevron print on the sleeves.</p>
              <p>United captain Rio Ferdinand told The Sun: "The white shirt looks traditional and retro like the ones worn in the late 1970's, but the pattern on the sleeves makes it look modern too."</p>
              <p>Using their 'Considered Design' programme, Nike created the shirt with minimal environmental impact by reducing waste during the design and development process.</p>
              <p>The sportswear giant used discarded water bottles destined for landfill sites, chopped them into tiny flakes and melted them down into a yarn which was then spun to make the fabric for the jerseys.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">MICHAEL OWEN admits he is coming round to the idea of a career in management.</h2>
              <p>The 30-year-old is about to start his second season at Manchester United but says he has no intention of dropping down the leagues to prolong his playing days.</p>
              <p>It was thought Owen would commit his time to his wife's horse-breeding operation and his own interest in the racing game once his time in football is finished.</p>
              <p>But it seems that having initially distanced himself from the possibility of becoming a manager, Owen is now having second thoughts.</p>
              <p>He said: "Until three or four years ago I was still thinking about whether I should stay in the game, through management or media.</p>
              <p>"At that point I would probably have said no chance. Now it is almost a case of 'why not'.</p>
              <p>"We will have to see whether I will have a shot at it."</p>
              <p>Owen freely admits he looks at the game differently now and is benefiting from working with United boss Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p>The striker added: "When he says something I think 'what is he trying to do with that?'</p>
              <p>"I look at how he motivates his players. The management side of it is definitely starting to intrigue me."</p>
              <p>Owen certainly counts playing for Ferguson as "ticking a box" in his career, just as winning a Premier League or Champions League-winners medal would be.</p>
              <p>He said: "To have not played under one of the most successful managers of our time would have left a little gap.</p>
              <p>"If I do end up managing I don't have to look any further than what Sir Alex's team-talks are like."</p>

              <p>The Serbia defender was at the centre of speculation for most of the summer.</p>
              <p>He was linked with a move to Jose Mourinho's Real Madrid and United's big-spending rivals Manchester City.</p>
              <p>But United chief executive David Gill recently revealed Vidic was on the brink of signing a new long-term contract.</p>
              <p>And Vidic confirmed that his heart was always set on remaining at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>He said: "I don't know why people think it was a difficult decision. I always said I am happy here.</p>
              <p>"I never spoke about my future. I know there was all this speculation but I never said I wanted to go.</p>

              <div class="small bold"><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">GOAL-DEN BOY ... Tom Cleverley has an impressive scoring record from midfield</span></em></div>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">TOM CLEVERLEY'S eye for goal has persuaded Alex Ferguson to keep him at Old Trafford this season.</h2>
              <p>And that is bad news for Wigan and Newcastle who had both hoped to take the 20-year-old midfielder on loan.</p>
              <p>Cleverley hit 11 goals in 33 games on loan at Watford last term before being crowned their player of the year.</p>
              <p>He followed that with several eye-catching displays on United's recent tour of America.</p>
              <p>And Ferguson admits the prospect of Cleverley replacing Paul Scholes as their chief goalscorer from midfield played a huge part in deciding to let him fight for a first-team spot.</p>
              <p>He said: "Tom's an exceptional young player in the sense of his ability to play in different positions.</p>
              <p>"He is such a mobile boy who can play wide on either side and in central midfield.</p>
              <p>"Also, which he has showed at Watford last year, he is a goalscorer.</p>
              <p>"The days of expecting Scholes to score 15 goals a season have gone now.</p>
              <p>"We have to look at that area of the team because we must get goals from midfield.</p>
              <p>"Tom has got outstanding qualities as far as goalscoring is concerned, so he is going to stay."</p>

              <p>And Senegalese ace Mame Biram Diouf has agreed a move to Sam Allardyce's Blackburn to get some valuable experience.</p>
              <p>Fergie has been tipped to buy a new hitman all summer to take some of the heat off Wayne Rooney.</p>
              <p>But he insists he is happy to go with what he has got.</p>
              <p>He said: "We're pleased with the young strikers we have. So much so we've allowed two to go on loan.</p>
              <p>"It leaves us with five strikers - the experienced ones in Rooney, Berbatov and Owen, along with Macheda and Hernandez. Five is sufficient."</p>

              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></em></p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United coach Sir Alex Ferguson came here on Tuesday to back former assistant coach at Old Trafford Carlos Queiroz, the Portugal coach who faces disciplinary sanctions for allegedly insulting anti-doping officials.</strong></p>
              <p>Ferguson arrived at the headquarters of the Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) in the early afternoon, an AFP journalist reported, and was due to lend his support to Queiroz, with whom he worked for five seasons, along with eight other character witnesses.</p>
              <p>Ferguson, under whom Queiroz has twice been assistant from 2002-03 and then from 2004-08, said he had flown over to testify on Queiroz' behalf because he was a man who had his total respect.</p>
              <p>"I'm here to support him (Queiroz) because I know him well and he's a man of great dignity," said Ferguson, who watched United outclass Premier League champions Chelsea on Sunday 3-1 in the Community Shield.</p>
              <p>"It's not an easy situation for a man of his reputation, because reputation is important in football.</p>
              <p>"In the world we're in today, doping control has been so demanding in terms of access to footballers. It puts a terrible strain on football coaches.</p>
              <p>"He should stay (in the Portugal job) because he's good enough."</p>
              <p>The other character witnesses include the respective chairmen of Benfica and Porto, Luis Filipe Vieira and Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa, as well as former international star Luis Figo.</p>
              <p>The FPF's disciplinary commission opened a procedure against Queiroz last month, alleging he insulted anti-doping officials who had come to test Portugal players on May 16 before the squad flew out to the World Cup in South Africa.</p>
              <p>Media reports suggested that if the commission finds against Queiroz he could be forced to step down from his post just days before the Portuguese start their Euro 2012 qualifying programme against Cyprus on September 3.</p>
              <p>Secretary of state for sport Laurentino Dias has dubbed as "serious" the accusations against Queiroz. </p>

              <p>
              </p><p><strong>Werder Bremen on Tuesday denied reports that the Bundesliga club have reached agreement with Barcelona for the transfer of their German international Mesut Ozil.</strong></p>
              <p>"Reports on a agreement with Barca are false. We have not received any offer," Werder director general Klaus Allofs told the SID sports agency.</p>
              <p>Spanish daily El Pais had reported that agreement had been reached in principle for the 21-year-old to join the Spanish champions on a four-year deal worth 10 million euros.</p>
              <p>Ozil has been the recent target of clubs including Primera Liga rivals Real Madrid and English clubs Arsenal and Manchester United.</p>
              <p>The midfielder, who joined Werder Bremen in January 2008 for 4.25 million euros and was under contract until June 2011, impressed during the World Cup this summer in which Germany finished third.</p>

              <p>Reports in Spain claim Barcelona have reached an agreement to sign the 21-year-old, who starred at the World Cup.</p>
              <p>But it is understood the club's hierarchy are waiting for Pep Guardiola to give the green light to the deal.</p>
              <p>The Barca boss is yet to decide whether to finalise the move for Ozil or promote one of Barca's youth team players into the first team set-up.</p>
              <p>Manchester United are waiting in the wings if the deal with the Spanish champions falls through.</p>
              <p>United boss Alex Ferguson a keen admirer of the midfielder's talents.</p>
              <p>And Bremen's director of sport, Klau Allofs, confirmed a deal with United or Barcelona is edging ever closer.</p>
              <p>He said: "It is possible that there is now a bit of movement in the issue.</p>
              <p>"But I am not running backwards and forwards to the fax machine or getting sweaty palms when I check my emails to see if maybe an offer has arrived."</p>
              <p>Since Ozil has turned down a new contract with Bremen, the German club are expected to sell him rather than risk losing him on a free transfer next year.</p>

              <p>For five years Manchester United's new £7million striker found refuge in an orphanage but recalls: "I was largely living on my own. I remember so many nights sleeping on the streets.</p>
              <p>"When I look at what's happened, it's like sport's Cinderella.</p>

              <p>His transfer has seen Portuguese third division team Vitoria Guimaraens make a killing on the kid they plucked from amateur football and actually signed only 45 days ago.</p>
              <p>Portugal coach Carlos Queiroz recommended Bebe to United, who swiftly closed the deal when Real Madrid also became interested.</p>
              <p>And United chief executive David Gill insists Bebe will not be sent out on loan to gain experience.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">REAL MADRID have had an offer for Werder Bremen midfielder Mesut Ozil turned down.</h2>
              <p>The German World Cup star has been the focus of intense transfer speculation after refusing to sign a new deal with the Bundesliga club.</p>
              <p>Manchester United and Barcelona have both been linked with the 21-year-old, but Real have stolen a march on their rivals by launching the first bid for his services.</p>
              <p>However, Bremen director of sport Klaus Allofs revealed the Germans have rejected the proposal.</p>
              <p>He said: "We have received an unacceptable offer that does not even provide any basis for negotiations."</p>
              <p>Bremen make their Champions League debut against Sampdoria next Wednesday and, should Ozil take part in that game, that would rule him out of appearing in the competition for another club this season.</p>
              <p>Real boss Jose Mourinho is therefore preparing to ask Valdano to return to Bremen with an increased offer.</p>
              <p>The ex-Chelsea manager said: "Ozil is a very good player and I would be delighted were he to come to us.</p>
              <p>"Bremen have said 'no' so we will have to see how things develop.</p>
              <p>"If he comes, it would certainly be excellent. Ozil would definitely help us."</p>
