              <h1>Alan Hansen’s Premier League Preview: Liverpool v Aston Villa</h1>
              <p></p>
              <p><img src="http://community.footballpools.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/alan14.jpg" alt="Alan Hansen" align="left"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My
                      old club Liverpool bounced back from their disappointing opening day
                      defeat at Tottenham to rout Stoke 4-0 in midweek. Next up is an Aston
                      Villa side who still seem to still be suffering from a hangover from
                      last season’s poor end to the campaign. Rafa Benitez’ will be pleased
                      to see how his team responded in midweek and they should be strong
                      favourites this weekend as Villa look a weaker side than they did last
                      season.</p>
              <p><img src="http://community.footballpools.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/fernando-torres-run-fist-240.jpg" alt="Torres Opens his Account for the Season" align="right"></p>
              <p>I
                      was surprised at Villa’s defeat by Wigan but I wouldn’t be surprised if
                      they were beaten at Anfield as their record against the Reds is not
                      great. Aston Villa haven’t beaten Liverpool in their last 15 league
                      clashes dating back to September 2001. This is a run of 9 defeats and 6
                      draws.</p>
              <p>From what I’ve seen of both teams so far this season, I can’t
                      believe that poor run is about to come to an end. Liverpool won this
                      fixture 5-0 back in March after a Steven Gerrard hat-trick and he will
                      be the man Villa need to watch out for again. After all, he has scored
                      more goals against them (9) than any other team.</p>
              <p>Villa need to recapture their early season form of last season when
                      they produced some superb away results. However, the Villans have not
                      won any of their last six away trips after previously winning seven on
                      the bounce. The loss of Martin Laursen and Gareth Barry has left the
                      team far more open defensively as both were key players in Martin
                      O’Neill’s side. They were also two of the more experienced members of
                      last season’s squad which suggests they may lack leadership and
                      presence on the field.</p>
              <p>Liverpool’s record at Anfield is very good; it’s been nearly 5 years
                      since they last lost a home Premier League game to any team other than
                      Chelsea or Manchester United and that was against Villa’s fierce rivals
                      Birmingham. They’ve also been scoring goals for fun at Anfield too with
                      23 goals netted in the last six Premier League games so Villa face a
                      real stern test particularly from Fernando Torres. The Spaniard has now
                      scored six goals in his last 4 games at Anfield.</p>
              <p>The momentum is with Liverpool so I’m backing Rafa’s team to win this match on Premier 10.</p>

              <p>Aston Villa manager Martin O'Neill has reminded his squad about the
              past, claiming that they can set the tone for the rest of the season
              with a positive result against Liverpool at Anfield.<br><br>Villa
              have made a disappointing start to the season after crumbling to a 2-0
              defeat at the hands of Wigan Athletic on the opening day, but the
              gaffer has reminded his charges of their loss to Stoke City last
              season, which was followed up by a goalless draw against the Reds.</p>
              <p>"Last
              season we beat Manchester City at home, we then went to Stoke and got
              beaten by a very late goal and that was dispiriting to lose it," O'Neill is quoted by <em>The Birmingham Mail</em> as having said. "Then we
              fought back against Liverpool and drew at home with them... We’re capable of getting over it."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the former Celtic manager confessed that he felt let down on the opening day of the season.<br><br>"It just wasn’t good enough," he grumbled. <br><br>Villa visit Anfield on Monday to play their second league fixture of the season.</p>
