              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">GUUS HIDDINK has given the first glimpse of his blueprint for Chelsea success. </h2>
              <p class="article">At an open training session yesterday, the new Stamford Bridge boss dropped a hint of how he intends to get the Blues’ stumbling season back on track. He also addressed 5,000 fans like an old pro, telling them: “I’m not here to entertain you. But it’s my job to make the players entertain you.” </p>
              <p class="article">After some of the dross which has been seen at the Bridge this season, an hour with the Dutchman felt like carnival time. Mostly kids on half-term break, the crowd cheered their favourite players’ better touches and the ad-hoc comedy routine provided by Ray Wilkins’ warm-up. </p>
              <p class="article">For the more observant, there was a clue as to just how Hiddink intends to change the team, as well as a defensive scare ahead of the weekend. </p>
              <p class="article">Brazilian stopper Alex missed the session because of an ankle injury, giving the new manager a possible crisis at the back for Saturday’s trip to Aston Villa. Left-back Ashley Cole is suspended while Ricardo Carvalho’s hamstring injury means he is still not in full training. </p>
              <p class="article">Hiddink did nothing to hide his contingency plans, playing Paulo Ferreira at left-back in a practice match. Michael Mancienne also swapped places with Branislav Ivanovic to partner John Terry during the 30-minute game. </p>
              <p class="article">More significant though was the change in shape and formation of the team Hiddink clearly considers his first choice. With fourth-placed Chelsea gunning for third-placed Villa, it seems the manager is pinning his hopes on a 4-4-2. </p>
              <p class="article">Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka played as striking partners. A little further back, John Obi Mikel traded places with Deco, who then anchored a midfield diamond, with Michael Ballack and Frank Lampard deployed just ahead and wide of him.</p>
              <p class="article">Watching carefully from the touchline was none other than Roman Abramovich. After reports that the Chelsea owner has lost around £6billion of his personal fortune, he seems to be finding solace in football. </p>
              <p class="article">Hiddink said: “I hope to make a very good end of this season. We need your support. I’ll give you everything I have to make the team work.” </p>
              <p class="article">The PA announcer also tried to lighten the mood. </p>
              <p class="article">He quipped: “Arsene Wenger is planting potatoes in the Emirates’ goalmouth so he’ll have something to lift come May.” </p>
              <p class="article">The crowd groaned at the gag. </p>
              <p class="article">Hiddink, though, has a much better chance of putting a smile back on Chelsea faces.</p>
