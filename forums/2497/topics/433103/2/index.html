I don't think Newcastle could even imagined they would be so lucky Pool agreed to their ridiculous quotation... Henderson, Sunderland got what they wanted... Blackpool too, they got their max valuation of £9m on a player with less than a yr contract and whose club has just been relegated... From $6 to $7.5 and finally Blackpool's first valued amount...</p>
              <p>And finally Downing... From a bid of $12m, they let themselves be pushed to $15m and than finally to $20m...</p>
              <p>It seems to me Pool doesn't know how to walk away from ridiculous valuation...

              <p>i believe liverpool will do well in the new season.  but then whether will they win the premiership is another thing.</p>
              <p>it'll definitely make the title challenge more interesting.</p>

              <p>Ashley Young has 1 year left on his contract while Downing still have 2 years..that's the difference, no? The club basically buying the players out base on the duration left in their contract with their current club.</p>
              <p>Well, i admit a few of them are overpriced..Do you think Torres was overpriced as well at 50million? If Torres can bang in 25 goals in a season over the next 3 years, he is not overpriced IMO.</p>
              <p>You buy a player to see what and how he can contribute to the team...what is their resale value 3-5 years down the road. Depends on team whether they want an instant success or building the success.</p>
              <p>but lets see how they perform next season. I know not all will perform but its abit early to judge any of them now. Most liverpool fans are quite happy to see Liverpool has this spending power...got the player they want, better than G&amp;H era..</p>

              <p>Well, on Ashley Young, you can say that as a reason but not necessary so too... Cos today we see Nasri is left with a yr too but his value has gone up from last year so how do you explain this? </p>
              <p>How about Phil Jones? He had about 4 yrs contract to go and United got him at $16.5m, no? Had he gone to Liverpool, he would probably cost $22m which was the price Pool were well known to have bid for him... I think the problem may lay in the Pool's transfer negotiation team... They seem to be paying at higher than normal valuation easily... Like I mentioned earlier, Suarez, Henderson, Carroll, Adam and now Downing... Don't get me wrong here, I am not saying they are lousy players... Just Pool overpaid for them at the time of their purchase thats all...</p>
              <p>Take the case of Carroll, Now it has come to be known that in Newcastle's book where Mike Ashley put them on sale... Their prospectus valued Andy Carroll as only $500k compare to what Kenny paid $35m... That's a $34.5m excess. Not saying he should go for $500k lah but $35m? Maybe $20m sounds more reasonable cos what has he done to be valued that sum serious, agree?</p>
              <p>If we talk about having 1 last year contract players should be cheap... The priced Pool paid for Adam isn't low either though it's only $9m... Cos he came from a club who has been relegated, who will be keen to cut his higher salary from their club, but they still got their initial valuation of $9m no?... This when we see in the backdrop <span style="color: #000000;">Clichy</span><span style="color: #000000;"> going to City for only $7m and his club didn't even get relegated...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Carlton Cole was mentioned to be valued at $9m last season... Ironical, Pool were the club that was linked to him... Now he is on offer at between $3m to $5m... </span></p>
              <p>How the players go on from here isn't the point... All I am saying is Pool is naive paying the selling club's ridiculous valuations one after another...</p>
              <p>On Torres, honestly... I still don't think he is overpriced to date... Cos we all have seen what he is capable of, so his valuation will naturally be higher... My frank view is I would be more concern of a Pool with all its new purchases with a Torres than a Carroll up front... Cos you can put tall defenders on him or crowd him out and he could be easier to neutralize... Torres score goals from difficult angles and his speed and know how of getting in front of defenders is more unpredictable... I have not seen Vidic having so much difficulty with any other striker, not even Drogba in his best days... And Carroll has still not reach Drogba's level in my opinion... That's why I said Pool over paid for him...</p>
