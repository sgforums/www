              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">STEWART DOWNING will get his dream move to Liverpool - once they match Aston Villa's £20million price tag.</h2>
              <p>But if the Reds continue to try and land him on the cheap, the England winger faces having to try and force the transfer himself by slapping in a demand to go.</p>
              <p>Kenny Dalglish is desperate for an out-and-out wide man to provide the ammunition for giant striker Andy Carroll next term.</p>
              <p>Yet Liverpool's valuation falls around £5m below Villa's - and has so far left Downing in limbo.</p>
              <p>Now the 26-year-old could find himself forced into asking for a move if the two clubs fail to reach an agreement.</p>
              <p>Villa are quite prepared to lose the player even though he has two years left on his contract.</p>
              <p>They are determined to avoid a repeat of the sagas which accompanied the sales of Gareth Barry and James Milner to Manchester City in recent seasons.</p>
              <p>And new boss Alex McLeish wants time to bring in his own players ahead of the new season, having already lost Ashley Young to Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Kop chief Dalglish, despite having cash to spend, knows he must offload several stars simply through sheer numbers.</p>
              <p>SunSport revealed yesterday how one of them could be Juventus target Raul Meireles while the likes of Milan Jovanovic, Joe Cole and Maxi Rodriguez could also leave.</p>
              <p>Dalglish has so far spent nearly £20m on Sunderland rookie Jordan Henderson but is also chasing Gael Clichy and Connor Wickham.</p>
              <p>And his interest in Blackpool skipper Charlie Adam, who he failed to sign in January, has never dipped with another bid also expected over the next few days.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Liverpool are hoping to conclude an £8million deal for Blackpool midfielder Charlie Adam over the weekend. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Anfield director of football Damien Comolli and Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston have already held tentative talks but hope further negotiations can finalise one of the most protracted deals in recent Premier League history. </span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The clubs are still some way apart on valuation, with Blackpool optimistically banking on £10m for a player who has one year left on his contract. Their position could be strengthened if Aston Villa manager Alex McLeish steps into the battle, while Blackburn's Steve Kean also maintains an interest.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Liverpool are more likely to open the bidding at about £6.5m, which they still believe is a fair valuation for the Scotland international. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Tottenham, who made a move for 25-year-old Adam in January, are holding back as they consider other options and do not want to encourage further bidding for Luka Modric. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Liverpool still have four other deals pending - Adam, Ipswich striker Connor Wickham, Arsenal left back Gael Clichy and Aston Villa winger Stewart Downing. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">They were prepared to pay £8m for Adam in January but Blackpool wanted £12m for their talismanic midfielder. Oyston had hoped his resolve to keep Adam would pay off as Blackpool looked to stave off relegation, however, his goals and performances failed to save them as they went down on the last day of the season at Manchester United.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Liverpool could turn to Sochaux's Ryad Boudebouz, 21, should they fail to strike a deal but hope negotiations can prove easier this time round. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">McLeish knows Adam well from their time together at Rangers and the Villa boss need to add bodies to his midfield Ashley Young's move to Manchester United and uncertainty about whether Nigel Reo-Coker wants to re-sign. They have the funds to compete but know Adam's preference is for Anfield. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Meanwhile, Alberto Aquilani will rejoin Liverpool after failing to attract suitors in Italy. The former Roma playmaker enjoyed a successful season-long loan with Juventus last term but the Serie A side's new coach Antonio Conte refused the option of signing him permanently.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Franco Zavaglia, the 26-year-old's agent, said: 'Aquilani is going back to Liverpool.'</span></p>

              <p><strong>Stewart Downing is set to hand in a transfer request as he attempts to force through his move to Liverpool.</strong></p>
              <p>The England winger is closing in on the switch to Anfield as he bids to follow Ashley Young out of Aston Villa.</p>
              <p>He has been the subject of summer interest from Liverpool boss Kenny Dalglish, but Villa's £19million asking price has put a block on negotiations.</p>
              <p>Liverpool are refusing point blank to do business at that price, and have already looked at alternatives in the form of Wigan's Charles N'Zogbia and Dimitri Payet of St Etienne.</p>
              <p>Downing, 26, realises the onus is now on him to revive the potential transfer, by making clear his desire to leave.</p>
              </div>
              <p>It is not a new tactic for the player, who submitted a formal transfer request when a player at Middlesbrough, and eventually provoked his £12million move to Villa Park.</p>
              <p>Now he is faced with the same situation, after refusing to accept the offer of a new contract which has been put on the table by the Midlands club.</p>
              <p><em>MirrorFootball</em> understands Villa would like to keep Downing but reluctantly accept they may have to sell because they need to help boost new boss Alex McLeish's transfer budget.</p>
              <p>Darren Bent's shock £24m move to Villa Park in January was financed by cash expected from the anticipated sale of Young and McLeish would use funds from Downing's departure to bolster his squad with a new keeper and centre-back as he is happy with his attack.</p>
              <p>McLeish has several targets, including two from former club Birmingham who are demanding £10m for keeper Ben Foster and £12m for stopper Scott Dann.</p>
              <p>Downing, who has 27 caps, has two years left on his contract at Villa but has refused to pen a new deal.</p>
              <p>His agent told Randy Lerner in an end of season meeting he was interested in joining Liverpool and Villa are keen to avoid a repeat of the drawn-out transfer sagas surrounding Gareth Barry and James Milner in successive summers.</p>
              <p>Liverpool are also attempting to persuade Blackpool to part with Charlie Adam, and talks will continue this weekend as Director of Football Damien Comolli meets Tangerines chairman Karl Oyston to thrash out a fee acceptable to both parties.</p>
              <p>Dalglish will finance the moves by cutting much of the deadwood at Anfield, and he is hoping to tie up deals for Raul Meireles and David Ngog within the next week.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Liverpool have cranked up the pressure in their pursuit of Stewart Downing after making a £15million bid for the England winger. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Downing is Liverpool's No 1 summer target but Aston Villa rebuffed the offer from Anfield. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Villa are determined to hold out for their £19m asking price for the 26-year-old, who was the club's Player of the Year last season.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">However, Downing has his heart set on a move to Merseyside and has made it clear that he has no plans to extend his current contract, which has two years left to run. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">
              </span></p><p> </p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>The next move will be down to Liverpool but Villa will be bracing themselves for a renewed offer. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">One possibility would be for Liverpool to include David Ngog as part of the deal, given that new Villa manager Alex McLeish is an admirer of the French striker and wants cover for Darren Bent. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Clearly, the Midlands club would prefer straight cash to bring in reinforcements, having just lost Ashley Young to Manchester United. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Ngog saw a move to Sunderland fall through last month after they baulked at the £4m fee but he could be an attractive proposition for Villa.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Having missed out on a number of targets in recent weeks, Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish is anxious to change the fact that Jordan Henderson has been his sole signing of the summer so far. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Henderson, however, will have to wait a little longer before launching his Anfield career, as his involvement in the European Under 21 Championship with England will prevent him travelling to the Far East on Liverpool's pre-season tour.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Steven Gerrard will also miss the games in China and Kuala Lumpur after it was decided he would be better served by staying at the club's Melwood training base. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Dalglish said: 'Steven and the medical team have done fantastically well so far and they are in the final stages of getting him back to full training.</span></p>

              <p>McLeish spoke to Downing last week and more detailed discussions are planned for Friday. A truce appears improbable, however. Downing, who has two years remaining on his contract, has his heart set on Anfield but may have to force the issue by handing in a transfer request.</p>

              <p><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Aston Villa manager Alex McLeish wants to tie up a deal for Wigan's Charles N'Zogbia this weekend. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">McLeish is resigned to losing England winger Stewart Downing, despite rejecting Liverpool's initial £15m offer. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Downing will tell his new manager he wants to quit Villa Park ahead of an improved Liverpool offer and McLeish wants owner Randy Lerner and his chief executive Paul Faulkner to snap up £10m-rated N'Zogbia quickly. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Sunderland and Newcastle have both enquired about the midfielder but the fee and his £60,000-a-week wage demands have put them off.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">McLeish hopes money from the Downing sale, and Ashley Young's departure to Manchester United, will be released to fund moves for N'Zogbia, West Ham's Scott Parker and Manchester City's wantaway keeper Shay Given.</span></p>

              <p>England winger Downing is the Kop chief's most wanted man but Aston Villa have steadfastly refused to budge from their £20m valuation.</p>
              <p>The Reds have already had two bids turned down, with Villa knocking back their latest offer of £15m a week ago.</p>
              <p>But now Anfield sources insist they are poised to return with a package that will reach the asking price - and take the spending since Dalglish returned in January to that magic £100m figure.</p>
              <p>Six months ago, owner John W Henry splashed out £58m for Luis Suarez and Andy Carroll.</p>
              <p>This summer, Jordan Henderson and Charlie Adam have cost another £25m.</p>
              <p>Liverpool are prepared to cough up after Arsenal entered the race for Downing a week ago.</p>
              <p>Brazilian stopper Doni is set to arrive as back-up to Pepe Reina, on a free from Roma.</p>
              <p>But it is the imminent arrival of Downing, 27 next Friday, which has raised hopes of a genuine charge for honours this season.</p>
              <p>The England star could even complete a deal this week, despite Liverpool being in Asia for their pre-season tour.</p>
              <p>Downing has his heart on a move to Anfield. He refused to sign a new deal at Villa Park and insiders at the Midlands club believe he may have a medical within the next 48 hours.</p>
              <p>Villa boss Alex McLeish is already lining up a cut-price replacement for Downing.</p>
              <p>Inter Milan winger McDonald Mariga, 24, will cost just £2.5m.</p>
              <p>Italian sources say that the deal for the Kenyan international 'is the very next piece of business for Milan'.</p>

              <p>With Arsenal and Spurs not doing too well in the transfer window and add to that they will probably lose some of their star players as well as they don't have much money to spend... Pool has to at the very least get into the top 4 if not challenging for the title having spent all that money... I can't wait to see Kenny under pressure again... lol.</p>

              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Aston Villa" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/aston-villa"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Aston Villa</strong></span></a><strong> have accepted a £20m bid from </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Liverpool" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong> for Stewart Downing after the England international submitted a written transfer request, effectively forcing through a move to Anfield. Villa had previously insisted that Downing was not for sale but felt that they had little option but to sanction his departure when the 26-year-old made it clear that he was desperate to join Liverpool.</strong></p>
              <p>Downing becomes Liverpool's third major recruit this summer, following Jordan Henderson and Charlie Adam, and takes Kenny Dalglish's spending during that period to close to £50m. Villa, in contrast, have lost their two most creative players, Downing and Ashley Young, in the space of a month. The £36m that has been raised in the process will be small consolation for their supporters.</p>
              <p>Villa have started the process of bringing in a replacement for Downing, with Charles N'Zogbia set to join<strong> </strong>from Wigan Athletic for £9m. N'Zogbia could become a Villa player by the end of the week and the club also hope to conclude a deal with Manchester City for Shay Given within the next 24 hours.</p>
              <p>Downing's exit, however, is a major blow and one that will be viewed with disappointment by the club's more ambitious players, in particular Darren Bent. The England striker had cited the presence of Young and Downing as a key reason for his decision to move to Villa from Sunderland in January. With both players having since moved on it would be understandable if Bent had doubts about the direction in which Villa are heading.</p>
              <p>There was a sense of inevitability that Downing would leave once he made it clear at the end of the season that he had no intention of signing an extension to his Villa contract, which had two years remaining. Liverpool tabled a £15m bid this month that Villa rejected, and although Alex McLeish responded by saying that Downing was "not for sale", the manager had little option once the player submitted a transfer request. Liverpool's improved £20m bid met Villa's valuation, which is £8m more than they paid when they signed him from Middlesbrough two years ago.</p>
              <p>Paul Faulkner, Villa's chief executive, said: "I can confirm that we have reached an agreement with Liverpool following an improved offer received earlier today and the submission of a formal transfer request by Stewart Downing, and have subsequently given them permission to speak with the player.</p>
              <p>"We believe there are replacements available in the market who can strengthen our squad ahead of the coming season, and we are in discussions as such. We are also working hard to conclude a deal for a goalkeeper who we believe can also strengthen the side."</p>

              <p><strong>It was April Fool's Day, which, in hindsight, was a clue that it would be dangerous for the reporters gathered at Bodymoor Heath to take everything that Stewart Downing was saying at face value. "Yes, I am happy here," replied Downing when asked whether he would stay at the club irrespective of what division they were in next season. "There is speculation that players are going to clubs all the time but I am happy here."</strong></p>
              <p>Downing went on to talk about the debt of gratitude he felt towards Villa because they had paid Middlesbrough £12m for him, two years ago, when he was on crutches and had no chance of playing a game until four months into the season. "A lot of faith went into me when Martin [O'Neill, the former manager] paid a lot of money for me when I was injured," he said. "It was a serious injury but I was over the moon."</p>
              <p>A little more than a month later, and on the back of a thoroughly deserved clean sweep of the club's end-of-season player-of-the-year awards, Downing gave an interview to the Birmingham Mail, when he spoke with excitement about the prospect of signing a new contract at Villa. "I think there's been a couple of conversations already with my agent," Downing said. "I've already spoken to the manager who has said he'd like to keep me. I'm enjoying my stay here. I've enjoyed it since the first day I came. It's a terrific football club. It's fantastic they want me ... The important thing in football is, if you're happy, then why change it? I know it's been a disappointing season, but I can see the bigger picture."</p>
              <p>Those Villa supporters who expressed their relief on various message boards, describing Downing, quite rightly, as the silver lining in a dreadful season, were in for a shock two weeks later. "My agent had a recent meeting with our chief executive," said Downing in an interview with the Northern Echo. "However, I am 26, and at a major crossroads in my career, so I won't be committing to a new deal at the moment."</p>
              <p>Downing might as well not have bothered uttering the last three words. He was never going to sign a new contract. The writing was on the wall and it also appeared on the paperwork submitted to Villa yesterday afternoon, when Downing submitted a formal transfer request. Neither Gareth Barry nor James Milner had felt the need to take that course of action. Villa were left with little option. After all, what is there to be gained from holding on to a player against his will?</p>
              <p>Villa did that for 12 months with Barry, who also pined for the chance to move to Anfield, although the circumstances were very different back then. First, <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Liverpool" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><span style="color: #005689;">Liverpool</span></a> failed to meet Villa's asking price for Barry, which made it easier for the club to dig their heels in. Second, Villa were starting off the season with genuine ambitions of trying to qualify for the Champions League. Third, Barry had a long affinity with Villa and could be trusted to perform even if he was denied the move that he coveted. None of the above applies in relation to Downing.</p>
              <p>It is, of course, easy to see why Downing is attracted to moving to Liverpool. As well as the chance to line his pocket, he is joining a club that appears resurgent under Kenny Dalglish. They have spent close to £100m since the start of the year and are genuine contenders for a top-four finish. Villa, on the other hand, are sliding in the opposite direction. The appointment of Alex McLeish as manager lacked imagination and top-six finishes are a thing of the past.</p>
              <p>Whether Villa could have done anything about Downing's departure or not, the reality is that the former Middlesbrough winger has become the fourth England midfielder to leave the club in the last two years. Villa, in other words, are a selling club that serve as a stepping stone for players with greater ambitions.</p>
              <p>As long as that remains the case, players like Downing will continue to move on and it is difficult to criticise them for doing so provided they are honest about their position. Downing, however, was happy to lead supporters up the garden path, saying all the right things until the moment he left Villa Park on the final day of the season. It is something he might be reminded of when he returns with Liverpool in the middle of December.</p>
