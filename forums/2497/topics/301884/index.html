            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/01_01/BerbatovCeleL_468x518.jpg"><br><br>Dimitar Berbatov has had a bust-up with his agent Emil Dantchev and insisted that he does not want to leave Tottenham.<br><br>Berbatov was interviewed on Bulgarian television last night and claimed he was angry over Dantchev's comments that he wanted to sign for a bigger club.<br><br>Dantchev was quoted last week as saying the 26-year-old striker was desperate to leave White Hart Lane in order to win silverware and that Tottenham should accept any big offers for him this month.<br><br>Spurs manager Juande Ramos has since put a British record transfer fee of Â£31million on the Bulgarian's head if Chelsea and Manchester United, his two main admirers, want to buy him.<br><br>United are prepared to wait until the summer to make a move, while Chelsea, who also want Nicolas Anelka, are considering making a bid of around Â£25m.<br><br>But Berbatov maintains he is not interested in a move away from Spurs and is adamant Dantchev's comments do not represent what he feels.<br><br>He said: "There are too many speculations around my name, but most of them are foolish. It's absurd and I'm tired of seeing my name in the newspapers. I want to live in peace. It is getting too much.<br><br>"I am a Tottenham player and I'm trying to give my best, so I can help my team. I'm happy when we play well and I'm miserable when we lose our games.<br><br>"I'm happy at the moment. You can win titles and medals with every team and I can win with Tottenham too."<br><br>Spurs have grown frustrated themselves with Dantchev. Only in August, the agent claimed they had turned down a large offer from Manchester United.<br><br>Berbatov insisted that he enjoys playing under Ramos, although he believes the Spaniard's Â£31m valuation of him is not realistic.<br><br>He added: "It's ridiculous, I don't think that I'm worth so much money. I just have to do my job and score goals. I'm not a one-man team. Everybody in the team supports me and I've never heard a reproach or felt envy.<br><br>"Juande is very good, both as a man and as a coach. He sees even the small details that remain hidden from most people."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That's why I don't like those agents... They always talk too much, and I have the impression they are pushing for the deals (even when against the player's wishes) for the tidy sum of commission they will receive.<br><br>All hail to Paul Scholes again for not having an agent.</div>
