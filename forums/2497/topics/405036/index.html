              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger is said to have voiced his anger about Barcelona's pursuit of Cesc Fabregas in a brief face-to-face meeting with Nou Camp president Sandro Rosell.</strong></p>
              <p>The Barcelona chief had failed to track down Wenger for talks in the run-up to the World Cup final, but managed to find the Frenchman before the exodus from South Africa on Monday, according to Catalan newspaper Mundo Deportivo.</p>
              <p>However, Rosell failed to make a breakthrough in his desire to sign the Spain midfielder as the Gunners boss apparently confirmed his club's frustration with the way negotiations had been conducted through the media.</p>

              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">The Spanish champions' new president, who replaced Joan Laporta on July 1, suspected as much and has since halted public statements in an attempt to build bridges.</p>
              </div>
              <p>However, the signing of Fabregas is still a priority and Rosell is said to have respectfully confirmed as much to Wenger.</p>
              <p>Barca had expected to agree a transfer for the 23-year-old within days of Fabregas admitting he wanted to return to Catalonia back in May.</p>
              <p>However the club now recognise there will be no quick resolution and have set a longer deadline of the end of this month as an ideal time to strike a deal.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ANDRES INIESTA is the latest Barcelona star to urge Spain teammate Cesc Fabregas to join him at the Nou Camp next season.</h2>
              <p>The two linked up to win the World Cup for the Spaniards on Sunday, but Iniesta's words will provoke fresh anger at Arsenal, who are already furious at Barca's attempts to lure Fabregas away.</p>
              <p>Barca are determined to sign the Gunners' captain and have already had one bid turned down by the Londoners this summer.</p>
              <p>But Iniesta — who spent several years with Fabregas in Barca's youth team — is desperate to link up with him at club level next term.</p>
              <p>Iniesta said: "Let's hope so. Everybody has come out and spoken of the desire we have for him to be with us next season. We would be delighted.</p>
              <p>"Not just because he is a team-mate and a friend, but because it would be great for the club.</p>
              <p>"His arrival would give us a huge jump up in quality and he would play his part to help us stay up there competing in the big competitions. We would love him to be here."</p>
              <p>Fabregas was pictured in a Barcelona shirt following a practical joke by several of his team-mates at Spain's celebrations in Madrid yesterday.</p>
              <p>Barca defenders Carles Puyol and Gerard Pique were the instigators, forcing the shirt over their Spain team-mate's head with the collaboration of Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina.</p>
              <p>But Iniesta says he had nothing to do with the prank. He added: "It wasn't anything to do with me — it was the other two, Puyol and Pique, who carried out the joke.</p>
              <p>"Cesc is my team-mate and my friend and I wish him the best, and if he comes, we will all be delighted."</p>

              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger will be back at his desk today determined to fend off Barcelona's continued interest in Cesc Fabregas and push ahead with his own summer recruitment plans.</strong></p>
              <p>Wenger has spent the past few weeks working for French television at the World Cup. His presence in Johannesburg following Spain's victory over Holland afforded new Barcelona president, Sandro Rosell, the chance to broach the subject of Fabregas' future with the Arsenal manager.</p>
              <p>The message from Wenger was loud and clear: Fabregas is not for sale, and the manner of Barca's very public pursuit of the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal </span></a>skipper has left him infuriated.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">In fairness to Rosell, the open and arrogant nature of Barca's courtship of Fabregas was down to his predecessor, Joan Laporta. In addition, there was nothing Rosell could have done to prevent Barca defenders Carles Puyol and Gerard Pique forcibly pulling a Barca shirt over Fabregas' head as the Spain squad celebrated their World Cup triumph in front of 200,000 people not to mention the world's media.</p>
              </div>
              <p>While obviously embarrassing for both Arsenal and Fabregas, the club have absolved their skipper of any blame for the prank. Rosell was also likely to have left cringing as he tries to calm the waters between the two clubs.</p>
              <p>Even so, Rosell is understood to have politely told Wenger that Barca's pursuit of Fabregas will continue even if a ceiling price of £37.5million falls well short of anything that could hope to attract Arsenal's attention.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/14/article-1294516-0A69F121000005DC-573_233x423.jpg" alt="Pals: World Cup hero Iniesta (right) talked up Fabregas's potential move to the Nou Camp" width="233" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Pals: World Cup hero Andres Iniesta (right) talked up Fabregas's potential move to the Nou Camp</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Meanwhile, despite Rosell's attempts to take their pursuit of Fabregas out of the public domain, the questions to his Spain and potential Barca team-mates continue.</strong></p>
              <p>Spain's goal hero Andres Iniesta yesterday became the latest Barca player offer his opinion, saying: 'Everybody has come out and spoken of the desire we have for him to be with us next season. We would be delighted. Not just because he is a team-mate and a friend, but because it would be great for the club.</p>
              <p>'His arrival would give us a huge jump up in quality and he would play his part to help us stay up there competing in the big competitions. We would love him to be here.'</p>
              <p>With the uncertainty surrounding Fabregas' future sure to rumble on, Wenger has little option other than to concern himself with his own transfer targets.</p>
              <p>The Arsenal manager is eager to land Fulham goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer after having had an initial offer in the region of £2m rejected. An improved bid in the region of £3million will be forthcoming but given Schwarzer's advancing years, he turns 38 in October, Wenger does not intend to be held to ransom.</p>
              <p>Having lost defenders William Gallas and Mikael Silvestre and with Sol Campbell mulling over a move to either Celtic or Sunderland, Wenger is also in the market for another centre-back despite the capture of Laurent Koscielny from Lorient for a fee close to £10m.</p>
              <p>Udinese's 22-year-old Colombia international, Cristian Zapata, is understood to be Wenger's radar as is Stuggart's Germany defender Serdar Tasci.</p>
              <p>Wenger also remains in the hunt for free-agent Joe Cole but a move depends on offloading either Tomas Rosicky or Eduardo first.</p>
              <p>The plan is to have all the new recruits on board in time for The Emirates Cup at the end of the month while Koscielny and fellow new boy Marouanne Chamakh are expected to be given a run out at Barnet on Saturday. </p>

              <p>Andres Iniesta then reiterated his desire for the 23-year-old to join the club at a press conference on the same day and the lobbying has even reached Panama, where Messi is for a charity match.</p>
              <p>"I would be delighted if he came," Messi said at a press conference on the eve of the game.</p>
              <p>"We played together as kids (in Barca's youth team) and he knows the club."</p>
              <p>Barca have already signed one player this summer, David Villa, and Messi believes the Spain striker will be a big hit at the Nou Camp.</p>
              <p>"He will be really good for us. He has already shown what he can do at Valencia and in the Spanish national team. Let's hope we can be together soon to start preparing for the new season," he said.</p>
              <p>Messi also gave his backing to under-fire Argentina coach Diego Maradona.</p>
              <p>"It's up to him to decide whether he stays or not," he said. "For me, he should stay."</p>
