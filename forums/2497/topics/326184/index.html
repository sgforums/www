              <p><strong>Indian mobile operator Reliance Communications has issued a
              statement suggesting reports of an imminent takeover at Newcastle are
              ‘completely false and baseless’.</strong></p>
              <p>Newcastle owner Mike Ashley is reportedly
              looking to attract investment in the club after accepting his side
              cannot compete at the top of the table without extra funds, but it is
              thought he is keen to remain in charge.</p>
              <p>And it had been reported that Reliance
              Communications chairman Anil Ambani, worth an estimated £23bn, was in
              talks with Ashley about investing, but it now appears the speculation
              is wide of the mark.</p>
              <p>An official statement read: “The news report is completely false and baseless. There are no such plans.”</p>
              <p>Ashley moved to play down speculation during
              Newcastle’s 1-0 defeat at Real Mallorca on Sunday night, telling
              supporters he was enthusiastic about the coming season.</p>
              <p>However, he failed to give any assurances and his plans for the club remain unclear.</p>
              <p>“I’m loving it,” he said. “I’m excited by the new season – of course I am.</p>
              <p>“I’m excited by Kevin, seeing the team play – all of it. I think we’re going to have a bit of fun.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Diao..bloody report anyhow bomb. </em></p>
              <p><em>-.- Not even a SG company.</em></p>

              <h1>McMahon: No takeover bid for Toon</h1>
              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Former Liverpool midfielder Steve McMahon has
              denied he is part of a bid to buy Newcastle - but is helping them forge
              'commercial ties'.</span></strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/08/01/330/SteveMcMahon_626796.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>McMahon was at St James' Park on Wednesday
              night to watch the Magpies' friendly against PSV Eindhoven with
              associates from the Singapore-based Profitable Group, sparking rumours
              of a takeover bid.</p>
              <p>Newcastle chiefs have consistently denied rumours they are
              looking to sell, and McMahon insists the group are only targeting a
              deal to promote the club in the Far East.</p>
              <p>"We are forging a commercial tie-up with the club," he told the
              Evening Chronicle. "We are hoping to be a strategic partner of
              Newcastle United in the Far East.</p>
              <p>"I can categorically say I am not involved in buying the club and will not become director of football.</p>
              <p>"I would love to be. It would make good sense because there is always something happening there, but I am not.</p>
              <p>"What we want to do is turn Newcastle into Asia's favourite club
              and if we were going to target any club outside of the top four, it
              would be Newcastle because of the history, the fan base and, like I
              said, there is always something happening here."</p>
              <p>Profitable Group operations director John Nordmann echoed McMahon's comments and played down the financial value of the deal.</p>
              <p>"Our job will be to increase the club's profile and get United
              better commercial deals," he added. "We will do our best to make the
              club better but buying it, no.</p>
              <p>"The reason we came here was because we were finalising our
              deal and we expected it to be completed in the next day or two, but
              then the stories came out. It is not a big deal - it wouldn't even buy
              you a full-back."</p>

              <h1>McMahon: No takeover bid for Toon</h1>
              <p><strong><span>Former Liverpool midfielder Steve McMahon has
              denied he is part of a bid to buy Newcastle - but is helping them
              forge 'commercial ties'.</span></strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/08/01/330/SteveMcMahon_626796.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p><span>McMahon was at St James' Park on Wednesday night to watch
              the Magpies' friendly against PSV Eindhoven with associates from
              the Singapore-based Profitable Group, sparking rumours of a
              takeover bid.</span></p>
              <p>Newcastle chiefs have consistently denied rumours they are
              looking to sell, and McMahon insists the group are only targeting a
              deal to promote the club in the Far East.</p>
              <p>"We are forging a commercial tie-up with the club," he told the
              Evening Chronicle. "We are hoping to be a strategic partner of
              Newcastle United in the Far East.</p>
              <p>"I can categorically say I am not involved in buying the club
              and will not become director of football.</p>
              <p>"I would love to be. It would make good sense because there is
              always something happening there, but I am not.</p>
              <p>"What we want to do is turn Newcastle into Asia's favourite club
              and if we were going to target any club outside of the top four, it
              would be Newcastle because of the history, the fan base and, like I
              said, there is always something happening here."</p>
              <p>Profitable Group operations director John Nordmann echoed
              McMahon's comments and played down the financial value of the
              deal.</p>
              <p>"Our job will be to increase the club's profile and get United
              better commercial deals," he added. "We will do our best to make
              the club better but buying it, no.</p>
              <p>"The reason we came here was because we were finalising our deal
              and we expected it to be completed in the next day or two, but then
              the stories came out. It is not a big deal - it wouldn't even buy
              you a full-back."</p>
