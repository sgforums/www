              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Barcelona defender Gianluca Zambrotta feels he
              was "betrayed" by former club Juventus in the wake of the Calciopoli
              scandal in 2006.</span></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The 31-year-old left the Turin outfit
              following the discovery of match-fixing and was criticised by many Juve
              fans for walking out at a time of need.</p>
              <p>"I was called a traitor but I was the one who was betrayed,"
              Zambrotta said in an interview with GQ magazine. "All of us who gave
              our all in training and games just to have two Scudetti taken away were
              the ones betrayed.</p>
              <p>"And with my sale the club cleared a lot of their debt so we gave a big hand to the club."</p>
              <p>Zambrotta transferred to Barca for a reported 14million euros on
              a four-year contract and defended his decision to leave Turin after
              clinching the World Cup with Italy in July 2006.</p>
              <p>"Us footballers are painted as only being interested in money," he said.</p>
              <p>"Of course, compared to a few years ago conditions are better for footballers, but the economy in general has evolved.</p>
              <p>"I would like to see what professional would turn down a top job with double the pay.</p>
              <p>"People think we just kick a ball and take the money, but I know I have earned everything.</p>
              <p>"At school I rose at 6.30am and with lessons and training I was
              not home until 7pm and then I had to do homework. Many times my mother
              found me asleep in my books."</p>
              <p>Zambrotta did not rule out a return to Serie A one day.</p>
              <p>"I have a sense of nostalgia every time I go back and have to
              leave again," he added. "It is the most beautiful country in the world."</p>
