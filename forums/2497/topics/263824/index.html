            <div class='col-md body'><strong>West Brom are bracing themselves for an approach from promoted Sunderland for defensive duo Paul McShane and Paul Robinson.</strong><br><br>Reports from the Black Country have suggested Roy Keane is ready to make a Â£5million bid for the pair as he attempts to strengthen his squad for life in the Premier League.<br><br>There was no comment from either club on Tuesday, although it is understood no offer has yet been tabled by the Black Cats.<br><br>However, Keane's interest in 21-year-old McShane, who arrived at The Hawthorns on a free transfer from Manchester United last summer, is long-standing.<br><br>The Wicklow-born Republic of Ireland Under-21 international emerged from the ranks at Old Trafford and was a member of the 2003 FA Youth Cup winning team.<br><br>He had loan spells at Walsall and Brighton before joining the Baggies.<br><br>Robinson joined West Brom from Watford for Â£250,000 in October 2003 after more than six years as a professional at Vicarage Road.<br><br>The player's agent, Robert Segal, has admitted the 28-year-old feels he needs to be playing in the Premier League, although he signed a three-year contract only last summer.<br><br>There have been suggestions that Republic of Ireland striker Stephen Elliott could be used as a make-weight in any deal, but the Black Cats may need to employ their powers of persuasion if they do make their move.<br><br>The Baggies have so far resisted attempts by potential buyers to cash in on their play-off final misery, turning down Fulham's Â£4million bid for striker Diomansy Kamara and Birmingham's joint Â£5million offer for Kamara and Jason Koumas.<br><br>In addition, they last week rejected defender Curtis Davies' transfer request amid speculation linking him with a series of top-flight clubs.<br><br>Manager Tony Mowbray is desperate to keep his squad together, and if that is not possible, the club are determined to hold out until their valuations of their assets are met.<br><br>The Black Cats are also being linked with a Â£1million move for Aberdeen defender Russell Anderson, who has also been trailed by north-east rivals Middlesbrough.<br><br>He is yet to give up hope of persuading Bolton goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen to rethink his decision to see out the final year of his contract at the Reebok Stadium, and is awaiting the outcome of his approach for Preston's David Nugent.<br><br>The 22-year-old striker flew out on a week's holiday after speaking to the Wearsiders on Friday, although his destination remains unclear with Everton, the club he supported as a boy, yet to declare their hand.</div>
