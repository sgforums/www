              <h1>Fernando Morientes Exclusive: Rafael Benitez will always be wanted by Europe's biggest clubs</h1>
              <h2>Former Red reflects on Anfield career and praises old boss Benitez</h2>
              </div>
              <p></p>
              <div id="article_detail_block">
              <div id="small_article_image_container"><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/57192_news.jpg" alt="Champions League : Fernando Morientes (Olympique de Marseille) vs Xabi Alonso (Real Madrid)"></div>
              </div>
              <p><br>Fernando Morientes was part of the Liverpool team that won the 2005 UEFA Super Cup and the 2006 FA Cup, however, he
                  only managed 12 goals in 61 appearances for Liverpool, before Rafa
                  Benitez transferred the Spaniard back to his homeland to play for
                  Valencia.<br><br>However, Morientes bears no ill feeling towards his
                  former manager, and is quick to praise his fellow Spaniard. The
                  Olympique de Marseille forward believes he will not only continue as
                  Liverpool manager, but will continue to be linked to several high
                  profile managerial jobs throughout the continent.<br><br>“He [Benitez] will always be linked with big manager jobs,” Morientes told <strong>Goal.com UK</strong>.<br><br>“Liverpool
                  fans should be pleased that he is being linked with jobs all over
                  Europe. That means that he has a very good reputation. The staff and
                  players all want success and even though it is difficult for him, he
                  will say that he is the right man for the job. <br><br>"When Gerrard and Torres come back, Liverpool will be fine again. Liverpool is a historic team with a great tradition.”</p>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/28120_hp.jpg" border="0" alt="" align="baseline"><br><strong>Star men|</strong> Return of Gerrard and Torres will make Reds tick </p>
              <p>I ask Morientes how much he appreciates the support Benitez and his team mates gave him during his spell at Liverpool.<br><br>He
                  retorts by saying Benitez always plans ahead meticulously and has  the
                  team's best interests at heart. Morientes insists the Liverpool manager
                  always pushed him to give to the Liverpool cause his very all.<br> <br>He
                  added: “I heard many negative comments towards me when I was at
                  Liverpool, but Mr Benitez and his staff gave me all the support I
                  needed. <br><br>“They know what I was like in training and how hard I
                  worked. That gave me a lot of confidence. I expected to deliver much
                  more for him than I did. My own expectations are high and when you
                  don’t reach that level you feel down. I have been a footballer for many
                  years and I know how it all works. You don't turn into a bad player
                  overnight; some times things just don’t go according to plan.”<br><br>Despite
                  having his Liverpool dreams dashed when he was sold on to Valencia,
                  Morientes says he does not regret a single moment, singling out
                  Liverpool’s supportive fans for giving him memories that he will never
                  forget.</p>

              <p>“I don’t regret coming to Liverpool. When I left Madrid
                  I didn't just come to any club; I came to a club with illustrious
                  history. <br><br>He continued: “Everyone knows about Liverpool
                  supporters. It was great to play in Liverpool. The fans appreciate good
                  football and even if you are playing for the opposition, and you play
                  fair play well, they will also be appreciated. You don’t often see that
                  in football. The fans are very special. But the fans here in Marseille
                  are also very nice. <br><br>“I also know a lot about Hillsborough from
                  my time there and you can never feel the pain of those people who lost
                  family and friends during the tragedy, your heart just goes out to
                  them.”</p>
