              <p>David Beckham could soon be playing in Serie
                              A for Italian giants AC Milan if the club are successful in a bid to
                              land the Los Angles Galaxy star on loan.</p>

              <p class="photoDesc">How David Beckham might look in the red and black of Milan.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>The
                              former England captain is determined to keep his place in the national
                              team and a spell on loan in Europe during the Major League Soccer close
                              season could be beneficial.</p>
              <p>On Wednesday Milan vice-president
                              Adriano Galliani said he was confident that Beckham would arrive at the
                              San Siro, however it is understood the 33-year-old has yet to commit to
                              the deal, which if confirmed is expected to begin in January.</p>
              <p>Questioned
                              by reporters at Milan's Malpensa airport, Galliani said: ''We are
                              speaking with his agent but we believe he will arrive for some months
                              on a free loan.''</p>
              <p>''Beckham has chosen Milan. Our squad is
                              ultra-competitive and it will remain this way, but Beckham is something
                              different and intriguing.''</p>
              <p>Beckham is under contract with LA
                              Galaxy but their regular season finishes on Sunday after the club
                              failed to reach the MLS's end of season play-offs, however Beckham
                              would not be available immediately because of his key role in Galaxy's
                              forthcoming promotional tour of Australia and New Zealand. Even so,
                              with the transfer window closed Milan are unable to sign Beckham until
                              the turn of the year.</p>
              <p>Last weekend Galliani said that Beckham
                              would be invited to train with Milan during the coming months in order
                              retain his fitness and remain part of Fabio Capello's plans for the
                              England national side, much as he did last season when he trained with
                              Arsenal.</p>
              <p>However, while Arsenal never sought to field Beckham
                              in a competitive game, Milan are hoping to capitalise on the
                              availability of the dead-ball specialist.</p>
              <p>It is not the first
                              time Beckham had been linked with the Rossoneri, with contact thought
                              to have been made between the player's representatives and Milan before
                              the player left Real Madrid for the United States in 2007.</p>
              <p>Milan
                              head coach Carlo Ancelotti has given the blessing for the former
                              Manchester United midfielder to join up with his squad to provide more
                              competition for places and is looking forward to working with Beckham,
                              who won his 107th England cap in the World Cup qualifying victory over
                              Belarus last week.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti told the club's website:''For me it
                              will be a pleasure, Beckham is a serious athlete, a great professional.
                              If he is available for four months with us, we will be very happy.''</p>
              <p>England
                              boss Fabio Capello has been pleased with Beckham's contribution this
                              year, although he has recently been a fringe member of the squad.</p>
              <p>If
                              Beckham moves to Milan - Capello's former club - then he will have the
                              chance to demonstrate in Serie A that he remains a world-class player.
                              Regular club football would almost certainly help his England prospects.</p>
              <p>England
                              have a busy start to 2009. They have a probable friendly against Spain
                              lined up for February, a home friendly against Slovakia in March, plus
                              World Cup qualifiers against Ukraine in April, and Kazakhstan and
                              Andorra in June.</p>
