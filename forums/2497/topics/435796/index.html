              <p><strong>Arsenal have signed Southampton winger Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for a reported fee of £12 million - a deal that breaks the Championship club's transfer record.</strong></p>
              <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain moves to Emirates Stadium after agreeing personal terms and passing a medical on Monday. He follows in the footsteps of former Saints academy graduate <span style="color: #000000;">Theo Walcott</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></p>
              <p>Walcott joined the Gunners in a revised £9.1 million deal in 2006 and Arsenal could pay a total of £15 million for England Under-21 international Oxlade-Chamberlain, with an up-front fee of £12 million plus a possible further £3 million in add-ons.</p>
              <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain, 17, is regarded as one of England's most promising young footballers. He played a key role in helping Southampton secure promotion to the Championship last season, firing nine goals in 34 appearances.</p>
              <p>Known for his pace and ability to beat defenders, he can operate on either side of the pitch. His style has invited comparisons with Walcott, though Oxlade-Chamberlain is a better defender who is comfortable in central midfield as well as out wide.</p>
              <p>Arsenal manager <span style="color: #000000;">Arsene Wenger</span><span style="color: #000000;"> is also rumoured to be close to signing Costa Rican striker Joel Campbell as a replacement for </span><span style="color: #000000;">Nicklas Bendtner</span><span style="color: #000000;">, who is expected to leave the club this summer.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Arsenal are also keen to bring in at least one experienced Premier League defender as </span><span style="color: #000000;">Thomas Vermaelen</span><span style="color: #000000;"> limped off against Benfica at the weekend, with Birmingham's Scott Dann, Everton's </span><span style="color: #000000;">Phil Jagielka</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and Bolton's </span><span style="color: #000000;">Gary Cahill</span> all possible targets.</p>

              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger finally got Arsenal's chequebook out on Monday - but left some Gunners fans raging over who he <em>hasn’t</em> signed. </strong></p>
              <p>Wenger tied up a £15million deal for talented Southampton teenager Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. But fed-up Arsenal supporters want to know why he is prepared to spend big on a rookie but <em>not</em> on proven Premier League players.</p>
              </div>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>The Gunners' last trophy came in the 2005 FA Cup final and manager Wenger has repeatedly insisted he is building for the future.</p>
              <p>But Pete Wood, who runs Arsenal fans’ website Le Grove, said: “It’s just amazing that we’ve spent the whole summer trying to buy Gary Cahill or Chris Samba but have been told that we won’t pay over the odds. “But we will pay top dollar for a young talent who has been playing in League One?</p>
              <p>“I’m sure Oxlade-Chamberlain is going to be a good player, but it leaves you wondering: ‘Where are Arsenal’s priorities?’</p>
              <p>“They’ve got a lot of talented young, fast players already - and they <em>need</em> a centre-back. Fan expectation has never been so low.</p>
              <p>“Finishing fourth will seem like winning a trophy. It leaves you thinking this will be Wenger’s last season.”</p>
              <p>Season-ticket holder Darren Epstein added: “I hope it will be followed by other signings for the squad. The club has said they would be active, so let’s hope they are true to their word with at least <em>one</em> defender.”</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Wenger is likely to further upset Arsenal supporters by admitting defeat in the battle to keep Samir Nasri.</p>
              <p>The Gunners boss is bracing himself for Manchester City to come in with a new offer for the contract-rebel midfielder this week.</p>
              <p>City manager Roberto Mancini is expected to bid in excess of £22m, which will give Wenger a huge dilemma.</p>
              <p>Unhappy Nasri wants to leave Arsenal and has only one year left on his contract. Wenger must decide whether to cash in now or risk losing him for nothing next summer.</p>
              <p>It is understood City are ready to more than treble Nasri’s current wages and give him a five-year deal worth £180,000-a-week. The incredible money on offer has left the player, who had been linked with Manchester United, wanting to move to the Etihad Stadium.</p>
              <p>Mancini sees Nasri as the missing piece of his jigsaw at City and has made it plain that he wants to sign two new players before the transfer window shuts on August 31.</p>
              <p>Losing Nasri will leave Arsenal devastated, as they are already set to lose Cesc Fabregas to Barcelona, who are promising a new, improved bid this week.</p>
              <p>Wenger insisted last month that Arsenal dare not sell both Nasri and Fabregas this summer, or else they could “no longer be called a big club.”</p>

              <p>The highly-rated Southampton superkid, 18 next Monday, finally completed his move to the Gunners.</p>
              <p>He said: "I'm so excited to be joining Arsenal. It's a fantastic club and I'm really looking forward to the opportunity of playing at the highest level.</p>
              <p>"Arsenal have a great manager in Arsene Wenger, top quality players and an attractive style of play.</p>
              <p>"These were all important factors in me choosing to sign for Arsenal.</p>
              <p>"I'm proud to be joining Arsenal but I would also like to thank everyone at Southampton for their help and support during the early part of my career, for which I will always be grateful.</p>
              <p>"I'm now looking forward to giving absolutely everything in an Arsenal shirt."</p>
              <p>Gunners boss Wenger, who has been after the player for eight months, said: "We are delighted.</p>
              <p>"He is an exciting young player who will provide us with creativity and offensive quality."</p>
              <p>Wenger had a £5m bid for the youngster turned down by Saints in January.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The South Coast club's chairman Nicola Cortese then proved he is no pushover by rejecting a £7m offer from the Gunners last month, forcing Wenger to more than double the bid.</p>
              <p>Arsenal will pay an initial £12m up front with the remaining £3m based on appearances and 'add-ons'.</p>
              <p>The Ox follows in the footsteps of England winger Theo Walcott, who joined Arsenal from Southampton in 2006.</p>

              <p><strong>Arsenal have opened talks with Birmingham City over the potential transfer of centre-back Scott Dann, according to <em>Sky Sports News</em>.</strong> </p>
              <p>The Arsenal defence came in for much criticism last season and manager <span style="color: #000000;">Arsene Wenger</span><span style="color: #000000;"> has been linked with a number of targets - including Bolton's </span><span style="color: #000000;">Gary Cahill</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and Everton's </span><span style="color: #000000;">Phil Jagielka</span><span style="color: #000000;"> - as he seeks to strengthen his back four.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">However, Wenger now appears to have set his sights on Dann, who has been linked with Chelsea, Liverpool, Aston Villa and Stoke, as his main target to play alongside </span><span style="color: #000000;">Thomas Vermaelen</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Dann, 24, formed a formidable partnership with </span><span style="color: #000000;">Roger Johnson</span> at the heart of Birmingham's defence last term but was ruled out of Blues' Carling Cup final victory over the Gunners through injury.</p>
              <p>The former Walsall youngster moved to Birmingham in a £3.5 million deal from Coventry in the summer of 2009.</p>
