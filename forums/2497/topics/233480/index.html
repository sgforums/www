Platini wants the big countries like England, Spain, Germany and Italy, to lose one place which would be allocated to other countries.<br><br><span style="color: red;">JOHANSSON:</span> "I'm not going to make any changes to a competition which is praised by the players, the clubs and the small nations. I see no reason why we should change such a success story that is broadcast all over the world and that many sports try to copy."<br><br><span style="color: blue;">PLATINI:</span> "Italy, England, Germany and Spain should have three clubs each in the Champions League so that teams from other leagues that are not in the same financial bracket can compete with them on the pitch. There are not enough champions taking part in the competition. Yes to an open Champions League, no to a closed pseudo-NBA (America's basketball association).<br><br><strong>Arsenal and Liverpool better start fighting hard for that 3rd place just in case... or they may end up playing in the Uefa cup... </strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

The 51-year-old Frenchman is now the favourite to beat current incumbent Lennart Johansson, the 77-year-old who has ruled European football's governing body unchallenged since 1990.<br><br>Most of the 52 national associations who make up UEFA are keeping their vote in Friday's election secret but some have gone public: Denmark, Poland and Serbia in support of Platini, with Germany, Ukraine and Spain backing Johansson.<br><br>The four home nations are among those keeping their vote private rather than risk being seen to back the loser, but it is believed Platini has the edge here as well.<br><br>The English FA are also thought to be leaning towards the Frenchman despite his promise to limit the Champions League to three clubs from any one country.<br><br>FA chairman Geoff Thompson is a friend of Platini's, and though he may come under pressure from top-flight clubs to back Johansson he could argue that he would be in a better position to influence the Frenchman over the Champions League if he is seen as an ally.<br><br>Generally, Johansson has support among the bigger footballing countries - but in this election San Marino's vote carries as much weight as Italy's. Johansson's age continues to be a factor among some associations - particularly as UEFA have a rule stating committee members must now retire once they reach 70.<br><br>One national association president told PA Sport: "Denmark have publicly declared for Platini because they are unhappy their officials have had to retire from UEFA committees when they reach 70 yet a 77-year-old is standing for president, and other national associations feel the same way."<br><br>However other senior football figures reckon the vote will be too close to call. Another leading association member said: "I have one person tell me Platini is in front and another that the tide is turning back to Johansson."<br><br>FIFA president Sepp Blatter's barely-disguised hint that he is backing Platini could yet decide some waverers. The head of another association said: "One the momentum gets behind one candidate he attracts support from all those associations who are keen to be seen to back the winner, and the momentum is now behind Michel Platini."<br><br>Platini is claiming to have won over almost the entire eastern European bloc apart from Ukraine and the Frenchman may also have benefited from a perception that Johansson is only standing to stop him getting in rather than from a positive desire to remain as president.<br><br></div>
