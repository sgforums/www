              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Opening old wounds: Mancini's
              English is now good enough for
              him to joke about the time
              Ferguson kicked a boot that hit
              David Beckham on the head after
              an FA Cup defeat against Arsenal</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Nine months into his time at Manchester City and Roberto Mancini's
              improving English has begun to translate into a sense of humour.</p>
              <p>Asked again after his team's Europa League win on Thursday about
              suggestions that he is too tough with his players, it was suggested he
              should try to become a 'father figure' to his squad in the manner of Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p>The City manager smiled and pointed to his eyebrow.</p>
              <p>'I don't know, but remember when David Beckham had his problem...'
              he said. 'Every manager has his own behaviour but I think that I have a
              good relationship with my players.'</p>
              <p>In referring to the famous incident when Ferguson kicked a
              dressing-room boot which struck the head of Beckham after an FA Cup
              defeat by Arsenal in 2003, Mancini demonstrated a firm grasp of English
              football history - and a growing self-confidence.</p>
              <p>The former Inter boss's English has certainly improved at a far
              greater rate than that of England coach Fabio Capello, and he used it
              once again ahead of tomorrow's trip to Sunderland to stress that he
              does not fear the wrath of unhappy players.</p>
              <p>Former City midfielder Stephen Ireland marked his arrival at Aston
              Villa, in part-exchange for James Milner, by criticising Mancini's
              man-management last weekend.</p>
              <p>But the Italian responded: 'It's normal when one player doesn't play
              that he isn't happy. Normally in a team the players who play are happy,
              the players who don't aren't. I have a good relationship with all
              players.</p>

              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p>'If one player deserves to play because they play well, he will play. If they don't deserve to play it's difficult.</p>
              <p>'But
               this is the same for me and the other managers. I played football for 
              20 years. I know all the problems that one can have and if a player has a
               problem he can speak to me every day.</p>
              <p>'I have a good 
              relationship because I don't have any problem with the players. The 
              problem is when one player doesn't play. I have a good relationship with
               11 players, with the others it can be harder.</p>
              <p>'If a player 
              has a problem he can come into my office and speak with me. I can help 
              him every time, but I don't go with the players and say, ''Let me be 
              your friend''.'</p>
              <p>Mancini made a point of wishing Ireland well 
              as he begins his career at Villa and also said he was pleased that Craig
               Bellamy had scored on his debut at Cardiff, where the Welshman has 
              recently gone on loan.</p>
