              <p>Two men have been taken into custody after a Premier League footballer was stabbed in both legs.</p>
              <p>A
              25-year-old man was arrested in Derby on suspicion of attempted murder
              following the attack on West Ham player Calum Davenport, 26, at his
              family home in Bedford.</p>
              <p>Bedfordshire Police said the man was due to be escorted to Bedford for questioning.</p>
              <p>A spokeswoman for the force said a 19-year-old man arrested earlier remains in custody in the town's Greyfriars police station.</p>
              <p>Davenport
              was taken to Bedford Hospital by ambulance with his mother, 49, who was
              also injured in the attack in the early hours of this morning.</p>
              <p>Their injuries are not thought to be life-threatening, according to police.</p>
              <p>Davenport,
              who was a multi-million pound signing and an England Under-21
              international, underwent emergency surgery on Saturday morning.</p>
              <p>A spokesman for the hospital said: "His condition is serious but stable and his mother is in a stable condition."</p>
              <p>Neighbours on leafy Springfield Avenue described "noisy" scenes before emergency services arrived.</p>
              <p>Ann
              Desics, who lives in Springfield Avenue, said she was woken up by
              people arguing in the road outside the footballer's mother's house
              shortly before 5am.</p>
              <p>"I just thought it was people passing by but
              then the ambulances came," she said. "I didn't see the incident, I just
              heard all this shouting.</p>
              <p>"The main person shouting had a very strong Caribbean accent.</p>
              <p>"It's an awful thing to happen - I hope he's okay."</p>
              <p>Mrs Desics, 61, said the road was cordoned off for some time after Davenport was taken to hospital while the scene was examined.</p>
              <p>There was "quite a lot" of blood on the road, she added.</p>
              <p>Davenport cost the East London club Â£3 million when he joined them from Tottenham during the summer of 2007.</p>
              <p>He
              did not figure in West Ham's first game of the season, at Wolves last
              week and, after struggling to hold down a first-team place, has been
              linked with a move away from the club.</p>
              <p>The Hammers said the club's thoughts were with the family.</p>
              <p>A
              statement added: "His mum is recovering while Calum underwent surgery
              this morning and his injuries were described as serious by doctors.</p>
              <p>"The club's medical team are in contact with hospital staff.</p>
              <p>"The thoughts of everyone at West Ham are with Calum and his family."</p>
              <p>A
              spokeswoman for Bedfordshire Police said: "Police were called to
              Springfield Avenue in Kempston at 5am after a report of a person being
              stabbed.</p>
              <p>"A 26-year-old man was taken to hospital for treatment
              for serious injury which is not thought to be life-threatening at this
              time.</p>
              <p>"A 19-year-old man was arrested shortly after the incident in connection with the assault.</p>
              <p>"But
              the investigation is still ongoing and house-to-house inquiries, scenes
              of crime officers and a cordon are at the scene at this moment in time."</p>
              <p>The
              spokeswoman later confirmed a 49-year-old woman was also injured and
              taken to hospital, with officers planning to speak to her tonight.</p>
              <p>She added: "A further man, a 25-year-old man, has also been arrested.</p>
              <p>"He has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.</p>
              <p>"He was arrested in Derby and he is due to be escorted back to Bedfordshire for questioning this evening."</p>
              <p>Bedford-born
              Davenport spent a spell on loan at Premier League rivals Sunderland
              last season and has also been loaned out to Watford.</p>
              <p>The centre-back started his career at Coventry and has also played on loan at Southampton and Norwich.</p>
              <p>A resident of the quiet suburban street where the stabbing took place said: "We are all a bit shocked to tell the truth.</p>
              <p>"You just don't expect something like this to happen here, it's a peaceful, quiet spot normally."</p>
              <p>Davenport
              was a "mad keen" footballer from a young age, according to Mrs Desics,
              who had known him when she worked as a dinner lady at his primary
              school, Camestone.</p>
              <p>Mrs Desics said she had not seen him "for
              years" until his mother moved into the street around a year ago and
              Davenport became a regular visitor.</p>
              <p>Gary Sanderson, spokesman for
              the East of England Ambulance Service, said two ambulances and a fast
              response car were sent to the scene.</p>
              <p>He said: "We were alerted to Springfield Avenue in Kempston shortly after 5am this morning to a report of an assault.</p>
              <p>"Two
              patients, a man and a woman, were treated and stabilised by paramedics
              before being taken to Bedford Hospital (South Wing) with non life
              threatening injuries."</p>
