              <div id="printsaveline"><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/10/01/240/Sir-Alex-Ferguson_2413928.jpg" border="0" alt="Sir Alex Ferguson - Rooney was unbelievable."></div>
              <p><br></p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson watched his Manchester United side demolish Arsenal at the Emirates and then invited Arsene Wenger to go to Stamford Bridge next Sunday and "batter" Chelsea.</strong></p>
              <p>United's 3-1 win against the Gunners cut Chelsea's lead at the top of the Barclays Premier League to just one point.</p>
              <p>It also saw Wayne Rooney notch his 20th league goal of the season and his 100th overall in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>Ferguson singled out Rooney as the main difference between the teams and also insisted he was confident the striker was happy at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: "Rooney was unbelievable. He was the key player and they couldn't handle him.</p>
              <p>"He's very happy at the club. He's popular among the players and couldn't be a better lad. He's down to earth and won't change because that's who he is.</p>
              <p>"That's refreshing in this day and age of celebrity-type footballers with lots of money, but he never changes when some people do change with success."</p>
              <p>Rooney still has more than two years on his Old Trafford contract but has been linked with interest from Real Madrid and United are thought to be preparing a new improved deal.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: "I'm sure that David Gill (United chief executive] is working with (Rooney's agent) Paul Stretford. Hopefully something does happen."</p>
              <p>Rooney's goal came after a sweeping move involving Nani. Park Ji-Sung added another after Nani had set United on the way with a brilliant solo run which culminated in his chip being palmed into the net by Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia.</p>
              <p>Arsenal scored a late consolation when Thomas Vermaelen's shot was deflected home off the unfortunate Wes Brown.</p>
              <p>Ferguson is banking on the defeat producing a spectacular backlash from the Gunners, who he insisted could still win the title.</p>
              <p>He said: "That was a great performance by us. I'm very pleased. It's at this time of year that you need to kick on.</p>
              <p>"The run-in is always a difficult period. We've handled it in the past and I trust the players to handle it again.</p>
              <p>"We need Chelsea to drop points, but Arsenal aren't out of it yet. I hope Arsenal go to Stamford Bridge and batter them next Sunday."</p>

              <p>hmm, was listening to what football focus was sharing, they were commenting on how adebayor was at gunners, he tend to drift to the left too, and then likes to cross the ball, thus negating the target man, but the very least, he holds up the ball.</p>
              <p>So y wenger let him go?</p>
