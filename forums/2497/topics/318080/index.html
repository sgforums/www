              <p>MADRID, May 19 (Reuters) - Barcelona president Joan Laporta has
              recognised that former World Player of the Year Ronaldinho needs to
              leave the club if he is to revive his career.</p>
              <p>'He (Ronaldinho) needs a new challenge. When a cycle
              finishes it is normal that the most emblematic pieces also come
              to an end,' Laporta told Catalan television station TV3 on
              Sunday night.</p>
              <p>'I would like Ronaldinho to be given a great send-off so
              that he is remembered for all he has given us and that if he
              didn't do any more it was because the circumstances wouldn't
              allow it.'
              Laporta admitted that the club might find it difficult to
              sell the 28-year-old Brazilian, who suffered a series of injury
              and fitness problems this season and made the starting line-up
              in just 13 of the club's 38 league matches.</p>
              <p>Ronaldinho last played for Barcelona in the 2-1 loss at home
              to Villarreal on March 9, but began complaining of muscle pain
              in his right leg soon afterwards and has been out of action ever
              since.
              AC Milan expressed their interest in signing Ronaldinho and
              the player's brother Robert De Assis said they had reached an
              agreement over personal terms.
              But the Serie A club later said they had been unable to
              agree a fee with Barcelona.
              <br>Ronaldinho joined Barcelona in 2003, immediately reviving
              the morale of a club that had not won a major trophy since 1999.
              He helped Barca win back-to-back league titles in 2005 and 2006
              and the Champions League.</p>
              <p>Laporta also said the club had decided to reject the
              possibility of appointing Jose Mourinho as coach and opted for
              former player Pep Guardiola as Frank Rijkaard's replacement
              because the ex-Chelsea coach would not have suited Barcelona.
              'We decided that if Frank did not continue then we would
              choose Guardiola because Pep possessed the necessary humility,'
              said Laporta.
              'We didn't think about coaches like Mourinho or (Rafa)
              Benitez, who are both great coaches, but they aren't right for
              Barcelona.</p>
              <p>So we told Rijkaard that when he left Guardiola would
              take his place.'
              Laporta denied that former player and coach Johan Cruyff had
              vetoed Mourinho's appointment, but admitted that he had given
              his opinion about the Portuguese.
              'They are private conversations between him and me and I'm
              not going to reveal them. What I can say is that Cruyff is a
              fervent supporter of Pep.'
              Barcelona have not won any silverware for the past two
              seasons. They finished third in the Primera Liga this season, 10
              points behind Villarreal and 18 adrift of champions Real Madrid.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>being consistency over a long period of time is what he is missing to be considered as a "great player", just like how he lop the England keeper in a match and was made to be termed as the player after Pele then fade away in Paris before his big money move to Barca then came a couple of outstanding season again before fading away now.. so to a certain extend he might really needs to have a new challenge to push himself forward</p></div>
