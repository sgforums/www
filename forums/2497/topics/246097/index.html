            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p143/zococl/chel1.jpg"><br><br><strong>Jose Mourinho's future at Chelsea has been cast into further doubt after Roman Abramovich chaired an impromptu board meeting at Vicarage Road on Saturday. The Russian billionaire owner convened in what the Mirror has described as an "extraordinary public referendum" with chief executive Peter Kenyon, chairman Bruce Buck and his right-hand man Eugene Tenenbaum following Chelsea's 1-0 victory at Watford.</strong><br><br>The club's powerbrokers sat in deep discussion for 15 minutes with Mourinho's future on the agenda despite the Blues still being in the hunt for a further three trophies this season, having already won the Carling Cup.<br><br>Abramovich also decided against visiting Chelsea's dressing room after the triumph to avoid bumping into Mourinho, even though his meeting was held just yards away from the celebrating team. If Mourinho is sacked in the summer Chelsea will look at Frank Rijkaard, Guus Hiddink, Roberto Mancini or Marco van Basten as possible replacements- but the management structure could be changed entirely.<br><br>The Independent reports that Chelsea 'are considering hiring two coaches - one of them English - to be overseen by a senior figure like Guus Hiddink. 'The plan to appoint two coaches under a more general manager would be attractive to Chelsea for many reasons, not least that it would prevent the kind of stand-off that has developed between Mourinho and Abramovich.'<br><br>The Independent stresses that 'appointment of an Englishman to a senior role at the club' is a 'major priority'.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Abramovich with his 3 wise men? </span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>JM is arguably the best manager in the premiership ... look at the changes he made ... the substitutions .... it always pays off ...<br><br>it will be unfair to sack JM in my opinion ... and as a chelsea fan .. i support JM all the way ...<br><br>if JM is to leave ... i will still support chelsea ... but i will be dissapointed ... because abra made a very wrong choice ....

So if any of them really wanted to go, they wouldn't sign a new contract at this moment...<br><br>At the end of the day... Its still money that these professional footballers will play for and not a single man. Same thing can be said of jose, if chelsea wasn't able to pay his current salary and another club was able to offer him more... He will go too.</div>
