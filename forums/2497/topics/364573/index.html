              <p><strong>Didier Drogba has been landed with a four-game European ban for his post-match antics against Barcelona last season.</strong></p>
              <p>Drogba has in fact been suspended for six Champions League matches
              having accosted referee Tom Henning Ovrebo after Andres Iniesta’s
              last-gasp equaliser denied The Blues a place in last season’s final.</p>
              <p>However, the last two games of his ban have been deferred for a
              probationary period of two years and are therefore unlikely to be
              enforced unless the Ivory Coast international steps out of line again.</p>
              <p>Jose Bosingwa referred to Ovrebo as ‘a thief’ after a match in which
              Chelsea felt they were denied four clear penalties and has subsequently
              been handed a four-match suspension, the last of which has also been
              deferred for two seasons.</p>
              <p>The club as a whole have also been heavily punished by Uefa.</p>
              <p>“Chelsea FC have been fined €100,000 for the improper conduct of
              their players and the throwing of missiles by their supporters at the
              match against Barcelona, which ended in a 1-1 draw,” read a statement
              on the governing body’s official website.</p>
              <p>“Either the club or the players may appeal against the decision within three days of the dispatch of the reasoned decision.”</p>
              <p>Michael Ballack avoided a charge for his over-zealous penalty
              appeals but Carlo Ancelotti will now be without both Drogba and
              Bosingwa for the opening throes of his debut Champions League campaign
              at Stamford Bridge.</p>

              <p class="storycopy"> </p>
              <p class="storycopy">Although the final two games of the ban are suspended, Drogba is set to miss most of Chelsea’s group games next season and will not be available for new coach Carlo Ancelotti until November.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">With Drogba also set to be absent for at least a month early next year on African Nations Cup duty, it means Ancelotti could effectively miss one of his main strikers for three months of the key competitions.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Drogba ran on to the pitch at the end of Chelsea’s defeat by Barcelona at Stamford Bridge, haranguing Norwegian referee Tom Henning Ovrebo, swearing into television cameras, then carrying on the confrontation with the official in the tunnel.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Chelsea, themselves hit by an £85,000 fine for failing to control their players- with full-back Jose Bosingwa handed a four-game <a class="iAs" style="background-image: none; border-bottom: medium none; padding-bottom: 1px; background-color: transparent !important; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; color: darkblue !important; cursor: hand !important; font-weight: bold !important; text-decoration: none !important; padding-top: 0px;" href="#">UEFA</a> ban, one suspended, for calling Ovrebo a “thief” – were left stunned by the punishments and look likely to appeal today.</p>

              <p class="storycopy"> </p>
              <p class="storycopy"><strong>Chelsea had hoped the punishments, handed out by Uefa’s Control and Disciplinary body after a hearing in Nyon, would be tempered by the fact both players apologised immediately and also admitted</strong></p>
              <p class="storycopy">their culpability. But last night it appeared those actions had carried little weight with Uefa.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">A statement by the European governing body said: “Drogba and Bosingwa were facing charges of being in breach of the principles of sportsmanship by insulting the referee by making offensive comments.”</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Chelsea were fined not only for failing to control their players - midfielder Michael Ballack also confronted Ovrebo on the field but escaped individual punishment - but for the throwing of missiles by their enraged fans at the final whistle.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">The club and players have three days to appeal, after receiving written explanations for the verdicts.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">A Chelsea spokesman said: ‘We’ve received the UEFA verdict and we’ll now take time to assess it in full and consider our response.”</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Chelsea were fuming at Ovrebo’s performance in the second leg of the semi-final, as he turned down four potential penalties, and Barcelona went through courtesy of Andres Iniesta’s injury-time goal.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Drogba’s fine and his absence from so many games next season is not expected to affect his status at the club. He is expected to sign a new three-year contract after talks in the coming weeks.</p>

              <p>woots appeal. nicetry. sure, the ref sucked. (manutd fan here, and its not cos we lost to barca tt im saying he sucked. really.) does that give a big name player like drogba the right to swear infront of a camera? does it give boswinga a reason to call the ref a thief? dude, refs make mistakes, just like how players make mistakes and end up cocking up sthn (eg paul robinson against croatia). yet there's no one shouting PAUL ROBINSON IS A (insert long list of swear words) USELESS SHIT in front of cameras.</p>
              <p>meaning drogba deserves it. and so does boswinga. appeal for what sia. wrong say wrong lah -.-</p>

              <p><strong>Chelsea captain John Terry has criticised the severity of the punishments handed out to Didier Drogba and Jose Bosingwa for their Champions League semi-final tirades.</strong></p>
              <p>The pair were banned by UEFA for, respectively, four and three European matches - with extra games suspended - this week for their part in the controversy which followed the Londoners' second-leg draw with Barcelona at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>A 1-1 scoreline sent the Blues crashing out to the eventual champions, but the Catalans' injury-time equaliser came after referee Tom Henning Ovrebo had turned down several strong penalty appeals from the English side.</p>
              <p>Drogba, in particular, caused controversy with his post-match reaction, when he swore while branding the Norwegian official a "disgrace" on live television.</p>
              <p>He apologised a day later, however, and Terry believes he deserved softer treatment from European football's governing body.</p>
              <p>"What happened with Didier and the comments made after the game took the hype away from the referee a little bit," the England skipper told talkSPORT.</p>
              <p>"It was a very bad performance from him [Ovrebo], we all realised that. There were three or four clear penalty decisions that we should have had that night and that's something as a fan and as a player you will never forget.</p>
              <p>"It was disappointing.</p>
              <p>I would like the people in charge to take these things in to perspective and realise that after the game Didier came out and apologised for his actions.</p>
              <p>"I think he realises that kids were watching and he deserves a ban. But to that extent? I really don't think so. Maybe a two-match ban."</p>
              <p>Bosingwa was punished for calling Ovrebo "a thief" in a post-match interview, and again Terry does not believe the right-back's misdemeanour warranted such a tough penalty.</p>
              <p>"Jose Bosingwa's ban, I don't know where that's come from," said Terry. "Obviously every player was feeling what Bosingwa felt and thankfully nobody else said what he said. But he said what every fan and every player was thinking.</p>
              <p>"Hopefully Chelsea can appeal and we can get that [the ban] down a little bit because we want those two players for the campaign next year."</p>

              <p>You all seem to forget its UEFA vs Chelsea here.</p>
              <p>How many match bans did the players involved in the InterMilan vs Valencia brawler bash get?</p>
              <p>How many match bans did Sinisa Mihajlovic get for the most vehement of racist comments against Patrick Viera?</p>
              <p>How many match bans did Henry get after claimed the ref that hosted the Arsenal vs Barcelona CL fixture was wearing a Barcelona shirt?</p>
              <p>And Drogba gets 6 (4+2) for mouthing off without any physical contact and Bosingwa who did no more than Henry gets 4 (3+1). Clearly something has gone wrong.....</p>
