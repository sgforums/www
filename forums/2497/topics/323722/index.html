              <p><br>Yeah i also think so but normally players coming directly from S America are cheaper... And also another thing is there is no guarantee if he can settle into life let alone football in Europe as quickly as another European player... There's always a risk...</p>

              <p><br>Personally, I never seen Veron as a flop... No doubt he came with a big price tag but United got more than half of it back from Chelsea... And also he wasn't a bit part player either during his time there... He was a regular in the first team and United did win the Premiership the year he was there... Although he wasn't the best player, but he still did contribute to them winning the title.</p>
              <p>On Kleberson, well... what can you say... a world cup winner but couldn't cope with the EPL i guess... Anyway, he came for only $6.5m and they recoup $2.5m for him so it isn't that bad...</p>

              <p>as far as remember, he wasnt as dominate player at united compare to his time in Lazio.

              <p><br>Well, lets just say he wasn't as outstanding as he was at Lazio this is true but he still manage to play a major team role which help them to recapture the Premier League title from Arsenal... It wasn't as though he was sitting on the bench while he was there... He was in the team most of the time while he wasn't injured...</p>
              <p>There are a few ways to be perceived as a flop... Individually, he wasn't as colourful as he was at his previous club but collectively, he was an important member to the squad that won the title back from an Arsenal side that had won the title by 10 pts the season earlier... So i don't think he qualify as a flop here...</p>
              <p>Veron's time at Chelsea would probably better qualify as a flop cos they paid $15m for him and even offered him a higher salary and he only played 1 season of 7 league matches and 7 other cup matches and scored a total of 1 goal only... He was loan out for the next 3 years cos they couldn't find another buyer who were willing to take on his hugh weekly salary. At the end they still had to pay part of his weekly salary while he was playing for someone else... This you can consider as a flop...</p>

              <p><br>Oh, why don't you then?</p>
              <p>I was so looking forward to hear your views on weather you are also one of those believers who felt they bought the title since you so clearly said "he was there just to show Jose that its Roman's money win them the 2 EPL title."</p>
              <p>You can vividly remember only me and yet forget hundreds or thousands of others including yourself subscribing to the same notion? And yet you questioned me on it? Man... what is that all about... Talk about calling the kettle black...</p>
              <p>Well, I certainly don't think we were watching from different channels... But perhaps from different prospectives... But I can understand cos your limited memory of United and the corner you stand...</p>
              <p>But seriously, just look at the 2 examples above and tell me which would more qualify as a flop to you?</p>
              <p>To put it in simplified terms :</p>
              <p>United paid $28m for him, got $15m back, won the league title back from an impressive Arsenal side and he wasn't a bench warmer while he was there...</p>
              <p>Chelsea paid $15m for him, increased his salary, played only 7 league matches, most other times he was a bench warmer, loan him out for the next 3 years, still had to pay part of his weekly salary while he was playing for others...</p>
              <p>Is this better to you?</p>

              <p>United paid $28m for him, got $15m back and that is already a flop. i think man utd is trying to cut loses before all value of him go spiralling down with his form.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>let say, he was a partial flop at mam utd but total flop at chelsea.</p>
