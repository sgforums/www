The Everton manager saw Johnson grab the late goal that secured a 1-0 victory over Arsenal and sixth place in the Barclays Premiership table on Sunday. </strong><br><br>Now Johnson joins up with England on Tuesday - ahead of the Euro 2008 qualifiers with Israel and Andorra - in top form and with a ringing endorsement from his club manager.<br><br>His 12th goal of the season, netted in a hailstorm against the Gunners, should have confirmed to England boss McClaren that he has the talent to be paired with Wayne Rooney in Tel Aviv on Saturday. And Moyes believes McClaren is getting a player right at the top of his game.<br><br>He said: "Andy is definitely up to the task of playing for England. If England have got the players who can put him into the box, he will get through and score. "He is so quick he is at his best played through the middle, he has been fantastic for us this season.<br><br>"He makes things happen, he chases everything and constantly gets behind defenders. England have the players to set him up, to thread the passes through for him and if they can do that for Andy he will score goals. "He will not let the team down, his effort is wonderful. Andy was terrific against Arsenal, he was always getting through their backline and always a threat. "He always puts defenders under pressure, and he did so many really good things. Hopefully it will send him off to England in the right frame of mind and full of confidence."<br></div>

Aston Villa left back Gareth Barry has also been drafted into the squad. If he plays Nugent would be England's first outfield player from outside the top flight since Michael Gray in 1999.</strong><br><br>Nugent has scored 16 goals this season and is the first Preston player to be called up by England since Sir Tom Finney in 1959. Nugent was playing for Bury in League Two only two years ago, but England coach Steve McClaren believes the player's form for the Under-21 team will enable him to cope with international football.<br><br>Full back Barry had been left out of the original party but earned a reprieve after Manchester United's Gary Neville was ruled out because of an ankle injury. McClaren's other defensive injury worry is Micah Richards' ongoing calf problem. Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher and Everton's Phil Neville will also be competing for the left-back slot.<br><br>Barry received his first call-up for nearly four years when England played Spain in a friendly in February and played for most of the second half. However, despite Ashley Cole's suspension for the game against Israel and an injury to fellow left-back Wayne Bridge, the 26-year-old was initially dropped for the games against Israel and Andorra. The decision was criticised by Villa boss Martin O'Neill.<br><br>Richards will join up with the squad on Tuesday and is calf problem will be assessed. Old Trafford captain Neville picked up an ankle injury against Bolton on Saturday and is set to be sidelined for three weeks.<br></div>

England face a crucial Euro 2008 qualifier in Israel on Saturday after a stuttering start to their campaign without ex-skipper Beckham.</strong><br><br>Former West Ham and Celtic midfielder Berkovic told BBC Sport: "He's their leader - there is no doubt about it. "England have a lot of good players at the moment but they don't have a leader on the pitch."<br><br>Beckham has been left out of the England squad since Steve McClaren took over as coach following the World Cup finals. A draw at home to Macedonia and defeat in Croatia has increased the pressure on McClaren and led to calls for a Beckham return.<br><br>Any chance of a recall for the Israel game was ended by a knee injury and his decision to leave Real Madrid for MLS side Los Angeles Galaxy is believed to have virtually ended his international career. But Berkovic, a hugely gifted midfielder who spent over eight years in British football with six different clubs, believes Beckham should still be a key part of McClaren's side.<br><br>"It was a big mistake to leave him out. Any England side will miss Beckham, he has been a big part of the team for the last 10 years," added Berkovic. "I think they miss his free-kicks and corners - they are the best in the world and in modern football it is very important to have a player like that on the pitch.<br><br>"Every time he gets the ball something is likely to happen." Berkovic, who will be honoured on the pitch on Saturday to mark his retirement from football, believes the Group E game in Tel Aviv is wide open.<br><br></div>

England last failed to reach the European Championship finals in 1984, but defeat in Tel Aviv would put their qualification for Austria and Switzerland in doubt. The two sides currently sit on seven points from four games in Group E, but lost their last competitive outings to Croatia.</strong><br><br>Israel were defeated at home by the odd goal in seven, while Paul Robinson's much-publicised blunder helped Croatia beat England 2-0 in Zagreb. Both sides will look to get back on track with recent form nothing to shout home about, Israel without a win in three and England having not tasted success in their last four games.<br><br>Israel enjoy an impressive home record, having gone 10 games unbeaten on home turf prior to their 4-3 defeat against Croatia last November. England have met Israel twice previously in friendlies, but the sides last played each other in 1988 - a 0-0 draw in Tel Aviv under Bobby Robson. McClaren is the England manager charged with getting a victory in the same Ramat Gan Stadium 19 years later.<br><br>However, he will have to field a makeshift backline, with Gary Neville ruled out through injury and Ashley Cole suspended. Micah Richards, Neville's automatic replacement, is a doubt with a calf injury so Jamie Carragher may start at right-back with Phil Neville and Gareth Barry vying for the left-back role.<br><br>Captain John Terry and Rio Ferdinand will marshal the defence in front of Robinson. Steven Gerrard is expected to move onto the right to accommodate the returning Owen Hargreaves. Frank Lampard and Aaron Lennon make up the rest of midfield.<br><br>Up front McClaren is expected to go with Wayne Rooney just in behind Everton striker Andy Johnson, who will go in search of his first international goal. Israel coach Dror Kashtan will be able to call upon some familiar faces against England, with Premiership trio Tal Ben Haim, Yossi Benayoun and Ben Sahar all eyeing starts.<br><br>But Bolton midfielder Idan Tal is suspended, as is striker Roberto Colautti. Captain Benayoun has missed West Ham's last two games with a knee injury but returned to full training this week and will lead Israel in Tel Aviv. Both sides are also in Euro 2008 qualifying action in midweek, with<br></div>

Steve McClaren's side drew a blank once more, and it was another lifeless performance from England.<br><br>Israel keeper Dudu Aouate twice saved well from Frank Lampard, with Jamie Carragher heading against the bar and Andrew Johnson just off target. Teenage striker Toto Tamuz posed a threat for Israel, forcing Paul Robinson into a save and heading wide. It was hardly surprising that some of the 4,000 England fans in the stadium chanted 'What a load of rubbish' in the closing stages of the bore draw.<br><br>England named the expected line-up, with Everton striker Johnson partnering Wayne Rooney up front. But he had little chance to shine in a dismal first 45 minutes in which few clear chances were created by either side. Lampard had England's best opportunity after he got in on the end of a neat build-up between Johnson and Steven Gerrard, but Israel keeper Aouate plunged bravely at his feet.<br><br>Israel's main danger in the opening exchanges came from youngster Tamuz, who forced Robinson to dive low to his right to save and then sent an angled header just wide from Ben Shushan's cross. Aaron Lennon's pace was a good outlet for England, but there was a desperate lack of real creativity from McClaren's side.<br><br>England had a scare after 54 minutes when Yossi Benayoun played in Pini Balili, but he shot wide on the turn. Lampard tested Aouate again just after the hour, and when the keeper fumbled his powerful volley, Rooney clashed with Tal Ben Haim as they chased the loose ball.<br><br>A bout of bumping and barging between the pair ended with both receiving the yellow card from Norwegian referee Tom Ovrebo. Lampard then flicked a header across the face of goal with Rooney only inches away from connecting.<br><br>As England's pressure mounted, Johnson directed a header off target from a superb Gerrard cross. Jamie Carragher almost emerged as the unlikely figure to break the deadlock after 68 minutes, heading Lampard's corner on to the bar. England made their first change with 19 minutes left, sending on the more attack-minded Micah Richards for Phil Neville. Jermain Defoe was then sent on in place of the hard-working Johnson as England attempted to fashion a breakthrough.<br><br>Defoe's introduction almost reaped instant dividends when he fired in a close-range drive, but once more Aouate was equal to the task. The Spurs' striker had a header in the net in the dying seconds, but it was ruled out because he was clearly offside.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Israel: Aouate, Ben Haim, Gershon, Ziv, Benado, Spungin, Badir, Benayoun, Ben Shushan (Alberman 87), Tamuz (Barda 75), Balili (Sahar 69).<br>Subs Not Used: Davidovitch, Golan, Toama, Antebi.<br><br>Booked: Benado, Ben Haim.<br><br>England: Robinson, Neville (Richards 72), Ferdinand, Terry, Carragher, Gerrard, Lampard, Hargreaves, Lennon (Downing 83), Rooney, Johnson (Defoe 80).<br>Subs Not Used: Foster, Barry, Carrick, Dyer.<br><br>Booked: Carragher, Rooney.<br><br>Att: 35,000.<br><br>Ref: Tom Ovrebo (Norway).<br><br></div>
