              </div>
              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> Wayne Rooney is thought to have told Manchester United that he does not wish to sign a new contract at Old Trafford.<br><br>The
               forward has had a difficult relationship with manager Sir Alex Ferguson
               in recent times, as he openly rubbished the 68-year-old's comments 
              concerning an ankle injury.<br><br>It has also been reported that this 
              may have led to the forward starting from the bench during the club's 
              2-2 draw with West Bromwich Albion.<br><br>Now The Guardian claims that 
              the differences between the manager and the striker have prompted the 
              England international not to proceed with negotiations over a new 
              contract, telling them he has no intention of signing a new deal.<br><br>Only
               recently United came out pouring cold water on speculation that the 
              forward could leave the club, but it is thought that the current 
              situation could see the club having no choice but to sell the player.<br><br>With
               less than two years left to run on Rooney's contract, there has been a 
              fair amount of speculation that he could be sold for a fee believed to 
              be in the region of £50 million.<br><br>Spanish giants Real Madrid and 
              Barcelona have both been reported to be interested, whereas there has 
              also been some speculation concerning a shock move to rivals Manchester 
              City.</span></p>

              <p>The <em>Mirror</em> says <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> striker Rooney’s poor <abbr><span class="glossary-term">World Cup</span></abbr> showing for England in South Africa, after Fergie rushed him back too 
              early from injury towards the end of last season, has not diminished his
               value in the transfer market.</p>
              <p>And City are understood to be prepared to pay whatever it takes to land 
              Rooney, who could earn a staggering £300,000-a-week by defecting across 
              Manchester to United’s local rivals.</p>
              <p>With Rooney determined to force through a move, the unthinkable could 
              happen for United - being forced to sell their star striker to City or 
              risk losing him for nothing when his contract expires at the end of next
               season.</p>
              <p>United could use that scenario to their advantage, but forcing as much 
              money out of City as possible for Rooney, perhaps even eclipsing the 
              world record fee of £80m <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Real Madrid</span></abbr> paid for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Cristiano Ronaldo</span></abbr>.</p>

              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden"></div>
              <p>Real Madrid have warned they won't rescue Wayne Rooney from his Manchester United misery.</p>
              <p>The
               Spanish giants have been mooted as the ideal destination for the 
              England striker, who has intimated that he won't sign a new contract at 
              Old Trafford after falling out with boss Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p>But 
              Madrid's prime dealmaker - director general Jorge Valdano - insists his 
              side don't need another striker and has ruled out any moves in January.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/10/18/article-1321489-0BA9CA8D000005DC-351_468x270.jpg" alt="Wayne Rooney" width="468" height="270">

              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/10/18/article-1321489-0B422692000005DC-647_233x391.jpg" alt="Manchester United's Wayne Rooney" width="233" height="391">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Unwanted: United striker Rooney</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Asked specifically about Rooney, Valdano said: 'Madrid have two great
               strikers: (Gonzalo) Higuain and Cristiano (Ronaldo), who already showed
               last season that they are capable of scoring 60 goals between them.</p>
              <p>'As
               well as that there are (Angel) di Maria and (Mesut) Ozil, who are going
               to help these two goalscorers. The question is, who would we move aside
               if we signed another striker?</p>
              <p>'In January there will be neither ins nor outs. June is a long way away.'</p>
              <p>Jose
               Mourinho said very much the same thing last week, insisting his current
               squad would remain until the end of the season. However, it is also 
              understood that the former Chelsea boss does feel short up front and is 
              not convinced by France striker Karim Benzema. </p>
              <p>A move this winter might not be an option, but Mourinho recently told Madrid-based newspaper <span style="font-style: italic;">AS </span>that
               he would love to work with Rooney in the future and former Old Trafford
               darling Ronaldo would also love to work with the striker again.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Rare joy: Rooney scores against West Ham earlier this season</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Madrid may have to re-think their strategy if others move in January,
               but Barcelona fans seem lukewarm to welcoming a player who's star has 
              fallen so dramatically since being talked about in the same breath as 
              Lionel Messi earlier this year.</p>
              <p>A poll of nearly 30,000 visitors to the website of Catalan newspaper <span style="font-style: italic;">El Mundo Deportivo </span>finds only a small majority in favour of snapping up the 24-year-old.</p>
              <p>Benzema
               could be used to tempt United into a deal. Ferguson has long admired 
              the Frenchman and was disappointed to miss out when Madrid signed him 
              from Lyon before the start of last season.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/10/18/article-1321489-0B8C9632000005DC-495_468x340.jpg" alt="Karim Benzema (second left) has attracted United in the past" width="468" height="340">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Back on the radar? Benzema (second left) has attracted United in the past</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The 22-year-old has his critics in Spain and is already being linked 
              with a January move to Juventus after a meagre return of 10 goals in 40 
              appearances.</p>
              <p>The most sensational prospect for Rooney - and the one United will want to most avoid - is for Manchester City to make an offer their rivals can't refuse in January.</p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/10/18/article-1321489-00673CF100000258-732_233x343.jpg" alt="Real Madrid chief Jorge Valdano" width="233" height="343">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>No deal: Madrid chief Valdano</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>For Madrid, Rooney is not even their only option. Mourinho has been 
              linked with a number of more physically imposing strikers and recently 
              talked up City's Emmanuel Adebayor and his old Chelsea man
              Didier Drogba.</p>
              <p>Athletic Bilbao's 6ft 5in striker Fernando Llorente
               is the most recent to appear on the radar, especially after scoring 
              three for Spain this month when standing in for Fernando Torres.</p>
              <p>And
               Valdano admitted: 'I like him (Llorente), but from that to finding him a
               place in Madrid, that won't be easy. Every season there will be a new 
              player, but it doesn't always have to be a centre-forward.</p>
              <p>'Llorente
               is improving a lot and he is ready for new experiences, but often the 
              media are discussing things that are not happening in the club.</p>
              <p>'It's
               not a debate in Madrid (whether we need a new striker). Mourinho had to
               come out and stop these types of rumours. And as well as that, Benzema 
              has not had the last word.'<span><span style="color: #003399;"></span></span></p>

              <p><span>The
               United striker is considering his options after telling the club that 
              he will not be extending the 18 months of his current contract. </span></p>
              <p><span>It emerged last night that there is real interest from City, who will have to pay Rooney £230,000-a-week to broker a deal. </span></p>
              <p><span>That would make him the highest paid player in the Barclays Premier League. United are unlikely to offer more than £150,000.</span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span>United’s players believe this
              contract row is purely about money — not about the breakdown of his
              relationship with manager Sir Alex Ferguson. </span></p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/10/18/article-0-04768F340000044D-431_306x595.jpg" alt="Staying put: Coleen Rooney won't leave England" width="306" height="595">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Staying put: Coleen Rooney won't leave England</em></p>
              </div>
              <p><span>Rooney’s wife Coleen has already
              told her husband she will not move abroad, especially while her
              12-year-old sister Rosie is seriously ill. </span></p>
              <p><span>That leaves Rooney with just two options in England as only City and Chelsea can afford both fee and wages.</span></p>
              <p><span>Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti
              yesterday suggested he would consider a move for Rooney, while City
              manager Roberto Mancini is monitoring the situation.</span></p>
              <p><span>News that Rooney would consider following Carlos Tevez to the blue side of Manchester will stun United fans.</span></p>
              <p><span>It is understood Rooney has become
              so fed up with life at United — in particular what he feels has been
              the club’s half-hearted approach to new signings — that he has told
              team-mates he would not baulk at a move to City and is keen to force
              the issue before the January transfer window. </span></p>
              <p><span>United are under pressure because
              under FIFA’s ‘Webster ruling’, Rooney could buy out the last year of
              his contract for as little as £5million in the summer.</span></p>
              <p><span>Last night, City sources would not rule out a move for the England forward while</span></p>
              <p><span>Ferguson and chief executive David Gill were coming to terms with the fact that their</span></p>
              <p><span>star player’s intention to leave had become public. </span></p>
              <p><span>Chelsea boss Ancelotti was asked
              about the issue yesterday and said: ‘Now, Chelsea is not interested
              because he is theirs and I think they will still be able to resolve

              <h1 class="titlestory">Man Utd boss Ferguson fed-up with Rooney attitude</h1>
              <p><span class="db-wrapper db-clear db-large"><span><span class="db-container db-submit"><span class="db-body db-large"><a class="db-anchor"></a></span></span></span></span></p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> isn't upset with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Wayne Rooney</span></abbr> over his vice girl scandal, it has been claimed.</p>
              <p>The <em>Daily Mail</em> says when United rejected his contract demands, 
              made through Paul Stretford, Rooney saw it as yet further evidence of a 
              club in decline, a club no longer competing with the top sides in the 
              transfer market and no longer prepared to pay what he considers the 
              going rate.</p>
              <p>This, according to sources close to Ferguson, is not about Rooney 
              sleeping with prostitutes. Ferguson knows these things can happen and he
               was not about to hold it against his striker.</p>
              <p>But when it is combined with tales of excess and photographs of Rooney 
              smoking, Ferguson is quite within his rights to question whether the 
              player is worth quite as much as he thinks he is; whether he should even
               be thinking about his next payday when he needs to focus first on 
              sorting out his life and rediscovering his best form.</p>
              <p>Despite Rooney’s importance to United — since 2004 they have won 72 per 
              cent of games when he has played and only 56 per cent when missing — the
               mood in the camp was surprisingly relaxed yesterday.</p>
              <p>"For the manager, this would not be like losing Ronaldo," said one 
              insider, and there was even a sense among some that they would almost be
               glad to see the back of Rooney.</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Carlo Ancelotti</span></abbr> is monitoring Roo's crumbling relationship with Alex Ferguson, which could see the striker quit Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti said: "We have to wait to see if <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Wayne Rooney</span></abbr> really wants to leave <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr>, if they really want to sell him.</p>
              <p>"And also if Rooney is on the market, not only <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> would be interested but a lot of other teams as well."</p>
              <p>Blues owner Abramovich recently ordered spending cuts. But a source close to the billionaire last night told <em>The Sun</em>: "If the money was right then Mr Abramovich would definitely be interested in Rooney."</p>
              <p>Rooney, 24, who has 18 months left on his current deal, is understood to want around £200,000 a week to re-sign for United.</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Wayne Rooney</span></abbr> wants to leave <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> because he believes the club is in decline.</p>
              <p><em>The Sun</em> says Rooney was unhappy at the sale of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Cristiano Ronaldo</span></abbr> to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Real Madrid</span></abbr> last year and also the lack of spending since.</p>
              <p>He does not want to commit himself to a five-year deal with a club that 
              are financially struggling and no longer in the market for the world's 
              best players.</p>
              <p>Rooney remains fiercely ambitious to continue landing the biggest 
              titles, having won the Premier League and a European Cup with United.</p>
              <p>But he fears that is no longer a possibility at the cash-strapped club.</p>
              <p>United's £750million debt under the Glazer regime is seriously restricting Fergie's spending power.</p>
              <p>Rooney, 24, and his advisors cannot see that problem improving and talks on a new deal have now stalled.</p>
              <p>United would be unwilling to sell Rooney to bitter rivals <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> but the prospect of a £50m transfer to Real in January is seriously on 
              the cards. The England striker, who has just over 18 months left on his 
              contract, has fallen out with Fergie.</p>

              been there as a harbour for him. Any time he’s been in trouble, the 
              advice we’ve given him – I’ve even been prepared to give him financial 
              advice, many times. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>'But
               you do that for your players, not just Wayne Rooney. That’s Manchester 
              United. This is a club which bases all its history and its tradition on 
              the loyalty and trust between managers and players and the club. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>'That
               goes back to the days of Sir Matt. That’s what it’s founded on. Wayne’s
               been a beneficiary of this help, just as Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and 
              all the players have been. That’s what we’re there for.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Ferguson
               insisted he had never had an argument with his star striker and 
              insisted that Rooney had suffered an ankle injury against Rangers in 
              September - despite contradictory comments by the 24-year-old.</span></p>
              <p><span>The
               68-year-old kept the door open for contract talks to resume but 
              conceded: 'There’s no offer on the table for Wayne because they’re not 
              prepared to listen to an offer. But there’s always an offer there for 
              Manchester United to negotiate with a player. That’s still there.'</span></p>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p><span>Clear signs that all was not 
              well came in explosive comments from Rooney last week when he claimed he
               had not been injured all season - despite Ferguson earlier citing ankle
               problems as the reason for the player missing games this season.</span></p>
              <p><span>Rooney's
               comments, after playing for England against Macedonia, not only 
              contradicted his club boss - but also his own statements shortly after 
              hobbling out of the Champions League game against Rangers last month.</span></p>
              <p><span>'He
               was injured,' said Ferguson. 'We sent him for a scan and while he was 
              able to train, he was still carrying traces of his injury. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>'He
               got an ankle injury in the Rangers game. He was seen clearly hobbling 
              at half-time. He confirmed it himself in an interview with Sky.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>'Why
               he was saying he wasn’t injured, you can only guess yourself. It’s 
              disappointing. When it came to the Sunderland game, I felt I would leave
               him out and give him a complete break so he could be fit for England. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>'I
               thought if he went and played for England, at Wembley, we would get his
               form back. That was my intention, that was my idea, to galvanise him. 
              Take a break from the games, get the training done, get his fitness 
              back. Get rid of the traces of the ankle injury away and play for 
              England. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>'So why he’s come out and said that, I’ve no idea.'</span></p>
              <p><span>'We’ve
               never had any argument, not a bit. I think you have to understand the 
              mechanics of these situations when people want to leave the club.'</span></p>
              <p>And
               it seems the injury has not gone away. Rooney looked relaxed in 
              training today - laughing and joking with team-mates - but he ended the 
              session on a stretcher and will not play against Bursaspor because of an
               ankle injury.<span><br></span></p>
              <p><span>Rooney will seek a monster pay day if he
              moves elsewhere, but Ferguson has rejected the idea that United can't 
              compete financially with the likes of Real Madrid or Manchester City.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I
               had a meeting with him, and he intimated to me, in his own way, that he
               wanted to leave,' explained Rooney. 'I did say to him, as David Gill 
              intimated, that there was an offer there if he was prepared to accept 
              it. It was an offer that never got to any financial discussions.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I know that David was prepared to offer him a contract that would be difficult to better elsewhere.</span></p>
              <p><span>'That
               is what you do with top players. There is no big problem with that. We 
              have been doing this kind of thing for quite a while now.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>'Contract issues, over the last 10 years, have accelerated to a degree where they are quite phenomenal.'</span></p>

              <p><br>imo, he looks ordinary, yes..he's young and fast, he's hot headed and bad temper...if he goes, he's giving others a chance to shine at man u.  I am sure many players in man u are eager to say bye bye to him. Means more opportunities for them to shine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No lah bro, I am not hurting...being man u fan for many years liao, only recently, stop following man u and lately come in again.</p>
