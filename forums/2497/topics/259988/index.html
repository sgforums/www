I felt it was the right time, and if he had been fit for Andorra and Israel it might have been earlier - in October he wasn't in the Real Madrid side.<br><br>"I just know that what we are seeing now is David Beckham the player that everybody knows."<br><br>McClaren insists it came as no surprise to him to see Beckham respond strongly and earn back his place.<br><br>Asked why it had taken a shock to the system for Beckham to respond, McClaren said: "Believe you me it doesn't matter whether you have the best talent in the world or the lowest talent in the world, in all walks of life, in business or in sport, it just becomes more evident and more plain in sport.<br><br>"It has taken a shock, both individually and as a team, to change things and that is what has happened.<br><br>"David has reacted exactly as I thought he would when that decision was made, he's taken a conscious effort and since the new year he has looked fitter and stronger."<br><br>Source: Sky Sports<br><a href="http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=471078&amp;CPID=219&amp;clid=114&amp;lid=2&amp;title=Mac:+I+was+right+to+drop+Becks&amp;channel=football_home&amp;" rel="nofollow">http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=471078&amp;CPID=219&amp;clid=114&amp;lid=2&amp;title=Mac:+I+was+right+to+drop+Becks&amp;channel=football_home&amp;</a><br><br>This old man is bloody annoying.

He claimed that dropping Becks is to improve his form so now that Becks is in great form, there's no point in him doing so.<br><br>His story has got a major loophole. Becks actually did perform okay for England during World Cup. Without Becks, will England ever get that far? Without Becks they seems quite set to get out of the tournament even before the quarter-finals.<br><br>On the contrary, everyone knows how badly Frank Lampard did.
