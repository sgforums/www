            <div class='col-md body'>ANTON'S CAR ATTACKED BY VANDALS<br><br>Anton Ferdinand's car has been attacked by vandals but the defender doesn't think West Ham fans were responsible.<br><br>The Baby Bentley had a window smashed while it was parked outside his east London home and comes just a week after furious fans confronted striker Marlon Harewood following the 1-0 Premiership defeat to Watford.<br><br>Ferdinand was also to blame for the loss as he gave away the spot-kick that handed the Hornets the crucial triumph during the relegation showdown.<br><br>The 21-year-old said in the Daily Mirror: "It happened outside my house. I normally keep my car in a locked garage but on this occasion I parked up outside my house and I went upstairs only briefly to get something.<br><br>"I must have only left it for a few minutes, if that. But when I came down the window was smashed.<br><br>"There was no indication that it was West Ham fans, I have to say. As far as I was concerned it never even occurred to me that it might be West Ham fans.<br><br>"I really don't think it was. I think it might just have been kids or something. Harewood was confronted by finger-jabbing fans in his car as he was leaving Upton Park last Saturday. He too has sought to play down the incident.<br><br>With the Hammers third from bottom and without a win since their shock 1-0 victory over Manchester United in December, there are fears supporters are taking their frustrations too far.<br><br>Skipper Nigel Reo-Coker clashed with fans who criticised him at the end of the FA Cup fourth round defeat against Watford in January.<br><br>But West Ham are keen to play down a rift between the players and the fans. A spokeswoman said: "We do not believe the incident was connected with West Ham fans.<br><br>"We believe it was an isolated incident and we have treated it as such."</div>
