            <div class='col-md body'>JOSE MOURINHO has abandoned his promise to make Chelsea more entertaining and admits he is happy to leave the tricks to Barcelona.<br><br>The Blues coach shrugged off renewed claims his team sacrifices flair for results.<br><br>He agreed: Â“At Chelsea we donÂ’t have a player like Barcelona who can do tricks to leave people with open mouths.<br><br>Mourinho said: Â“If you guaranteed me a 1-0 win from this game I would go back to London right now.Â”<br><br>Mourinho insisted at the start of the season he wanted his team to be more attacking and entertaining. But after winning just one of their last eight away games in the Champions League, he is willing to settle for another three points in Bulgaria tonight.<br><br>Levski is the Group A whipping boys, they suffered a 5-0 thrashing by Barcelona on their Champions League debut two weeks ago.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jose won't take Levski lightly<br>By Tom Adams -  Created on 26 Sep 2006<br>CHELSEA TV ONLINE<br>Sign up for a yearly subscription during September for just Â£25<br><br>Related links<br>Team Pages:<br>Chelsea<br>Levski Sofia<br>Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho says he is expecting a 'difficult night' when The Blues visit Levski Sofia in the UEFA Champions League on Wednesday.<br><br>Few give the home side a chance against Mourinho's two-time Premiership champions, but Levski impressed in qualifying as they became the first Bulgarian team to ever reach the group stages.<br><br>The Blues will be aiming to build on their opening win over Werder Bremen, but their Portuguese coach says he will certainly not be taking Levski lightly.<br><br>"The first home game for a team making their Champions league debut is always special and we know it's going to be a difficult night for us," said Mourinho.<br><br>"We would be very happy to come away with a 1-0 win on Wednesday because we need the three points and so do Levski, who are better than their opening 5-0 defeat at Barcelona might suggest,<br><br>"It is more difficult to play away than at home and in Europe you face different cultures of football.<br><br>"It not the same playing Spanish, German or Italian teams as it is against English teams.<br><br>"We play English teams every weekend. We play teams from other countries and different cultures and philosophies of football less often.<br><br>"The squad is built for English football first because that's the priority.<br><br>"Then we see what we can do in European football."<br><br>Mourinho also responded to comments from Levski coach Stanimir Stoilov, who intimated that European Champions and Group A opponents Barcelona play a more pleasing form of the beautiful game.<br><br>"Chelsea and Barca are both very strong but Barca plays more attractive football and Chelsea is all about winning," said Stoilov.<br><br>"Chelsea is perfect in defence and they don't let other teams create too many chances.<br><br>"They also have magnificent midfielders and forwards and they can score from anywhere and from almost every situation.<br><br>"Of course, Chelsea has its weak sides but I doubt whether we can exploit them."<br><br>Mourinho was pleased with the comments from his opposite number, stating he was more concerned with winning matches than showboating for the crowd.<br><br>"In Chelsea we do not have a player like Barcelona have, to do a trick and leave people with open mouths," Mourinho added.<br><br>"We are not often on the Soccer AM show, where they show the best tricks.<br><br>"But, when Stoilov says we are a team about winning, I think that is a very, very good compliment. I'm happy with that."<br><br>"If someone offers me a 1-0 win, I will take it and go to London now."<br><br>Mourinho says he is prepared to play England captain John Terry against the Bulgarians, despite the accomplished stopper missing the 2-0 victory over Fulham at the weekend due to back problem.<br><br>"Since we knew it wasn't a big injury, we thought it would be possible for him to play.<br><br>"We were a bit afraid of the long flight, with him sitting in the same position but he was moving around and he looks okay.<br><br>"He always plays in the Champions League. We can't qualify with three points.<br><br>"Normally you need between nine and 12. We have three and we need to win matches.<br><br>"We will try to play with the best team and, if John is 100 percent fit, he will play."<br></div>
