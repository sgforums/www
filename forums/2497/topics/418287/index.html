A product of the Japanese High School soccer system, he hit the headlines worldwide for being praised by Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, the man who has convinced him to sign with Arsenal in January.<br><br>During the summer of 2009, at the age of 16, Miyaiichi visited Europe and played trial games with the Gunners and later with Ajax in The Netherlands. He impressed on both occasions, alas, during the tryout with the Amsterdam club, he was hit hard and suffered a double fracture to his leg.<br><br>Miyaichi has been often compared to Thierry Henry and Cristiano Ronaldo for his quick runs up the field, spiced-up by unpredictable feints and tricks with the ball.<br><br>While such comparisons are too often exaggerated, it is hard not to note similarities in the style of play and in the self-confidence boasted by the Portuguese superstar and the young Japanese.<br><br>Miyaichi has been summoned for Japanese national teams since the age of 13 and participated in the ill-fated adventure of the under-17s at the World Cup in Nigeria during an intense 2009.<br><br>In the tournament, Japan impressed at times, but lost three games out of three. Despite suffering a premature injury set-back, Miyaichi is now an integral part of the under-19 national team group.<br><br>Miyaichi is expected to sign a five-year deal with Arsenal and his full recovery from injury is expected by early 2011, when he will also graduate from school.<br><br>Wenger had some words for Miyaichi upon his visit to Europe, “Your home is here [at Arsenal,] get well soon and begin to learn English,” said the Frenchman, who enjoys great popularity in Japan, having guided Nagoya Grampus for a season and a half in the early 90s.<br><br>Watch a video of Miyaichi in action:</span></p>

              <p>But Park had to prove himself at PSV and at the World Cup stage before United moved in for him unlike this fellow who played University football.</p>
              <p>Didn't Fandi's sons impressed both Chelsea and Arsenal's scouts as well? The elder one even scored 5 times in a match but alas, they were skipped through. They are still young and there are rooms for development aren't there? Or was it because Singapore's market is small?</p>
