              <p><strong>Harry Redknapp is ready to make William Gallas captain on his debut for </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Tottenham </strong></span></a><strong>on Saturday.</strong></p>
              <p>The controversial move will stun many Spurs fans given that Gallas has only recently completed a free transfer from bitter rivals <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal</span></a>.</p>
              <p>In addition, his spell as Arsenal skipper ended in ignominious circumstances after he was stripped of the role by Arsene Wenger for a public attack on his teammates two years ago. That followed an infamous sit-down protest after a game at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/birmingham-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Birmingham</span></a>.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">But the Spurs boss has been hugely impressed with Gallas' character and attitude in training.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Redknapp said he was 'deadly serious' about handing him the armband for the trip to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/west-bromwich-albion.html"><span style="color: #003580;">West Bromwich</span></a> if, as expected, Ledley King is kept in reserve for Tuesday's Champions League trip to Werder Bremen.</p>
              <p>Discussing the impact that Gallas has made, Redknapp said: 'You have to be strong as a person to do that. It is easy not to have done that. He could have gone off and played somewhere else. Arsenal and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span></a> are part of his past.</p>
              <p>'You move forward. Who gives a monkeys in 20 years about who you play for?</p>
              <p>'He was a great signing. In the open market, he would have cost £8million or £10m I suppose. He played 70 minutes in the week and he was excellent. Just having watched him in training and a practice match, you can see how good he is.</p>

              <p><strong>'You don't play in teams that win championships like he did at Chelsea or play for your country (France) as many times as that unless you are a top player. He has pace and is a great defender. He'll be a big asset.</strong></p>
              <p>'I have been very impressed with him as a fellow. He could easily become a mainstay. I am even considering making him captain, I'm certainly thinking about it.'</p>
              <p>Pressed on whether he was really considering the controversial appointment, Redknapp responded: 'I'm deadly serious.'</p>
              <p>King's chronic knee complaint means he likely to be rested.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/09/10/article-1310934-0ACD3B80000005DC-195_468x315.jpg" alt="Take a break: Ledley King is expected to be rested by boss Harry Redknapp" width="468" height="315">

              <p><strong>'I have got to make that decision and it is a difficult one,' said Redknapp. 'Both competitions are important to me but we might just need Ledley's experience on Tuesday night in an away game in Germany in a Champions League game.'</strong></p>
              <p>Redknapp's injury concerns deepened yesterday when the club announced Jermain Defoe is likely to be out for three months following ankle surgery.</p>
              <p>Jonathan Woodgate will have an injection on Monday to try to relieve the groin pain which has seen him unable to kick a ball for 10 months.</p>

              <p><strong>Jermain Defoe is set to miss the next three months of the season - and likely Tottenham Hotspur's entire Champions League group stage - as he recovers from an operation on his ankle.</strong></p>
              <p>Defoe had already put off surgery on a troublesome groin problem but a knock received against Switzerland during England's 3-1 win in Basel required more urgent care and after seeing a specialist, the striker went under the knife on Thursday evening.</p>
              <p>A statement on Spurs' official website flew in the face of expectations that his absence will only be for six weeks: "Following a review by an ankle specialist, Jermain Defoe underwent surgery to repair torn ligaments in his right ankle yesterday evening.</p>
              <p>"The striker was forced off with the injury during England's European Championship qualifier in Switzerland on Tuesday and has been ruled out of action for around three months."</p>
              <p>He will also miss England's next Euro 2012 qualifier, at home to Montenegro in October, and leave Harry Redknapp without his frontline striker, opening up opportunities for the lesser-spotted likes of <span style="color: #000000;">Roman Pavlyuchenko</span> and <span style="color: #000000;">Robbie Keane</span>. That duo can now expect to face the likes of FC Twente, Inter Milan and Werder Bremen in Champions League Group A.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>What a blow: Modric suffers</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>A suspect broken leg for Luka Modric has left Tottenham's plans for their first big night in the Champions League in tatters.</strong></p>
              <p>Manager Harry Redknapp wanted to build his team for their debut in the group stages of Europe's premier club competition around the Croatian playmaker, but he may be forced back to the drawing board with the trip to Werder Bremen just two days away.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Modric scored in the 1-1 draw at West Bromwich Albion yesterday but received a kick on the fibula he broke last season and his manager is anxiously awaiting the results of a scan.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Redknapp, who has already lost England internationals Jermain Defoe and Michael Dawson to longterm injuries, said: 'He broke the leg last year and got a kick on the same spot. He's in a lot of pain.</p>
              <p>'It doesn't look great. If he has got another break, you're talking months again.'</p>
              <p>Modric lasted only 32 minutes at The Hawthorns before injuring himself in a challenge on defender Gonzalo Jara and he left the ground on crutches. His absence on Tuesday would be a major blow to Redknapp, who was planning to ditch his favoured attacking formation and rely on the 25-year-old to help provide a goal threat.</p>
              <p>The Spurs manager believes his team cannot afford to be too open on the road in Europe and will look for home wins to get them through a difficult group, which also contains holders Inter Milan.</p>
              <p>'Luka is a key player,' he said. 'When he plays, he opens the door. If he had played in our defeat to Wigan we would have won, he would have opened them up with a bit of magic. He is a fantastic player.</p>

              <p><strong>'He is comfortable with the ball and if you can handle the ball, can pass and keep it well, you have a chance. I am just hoping it is good news for a change. Defoe has had the ankle operation and he is out for 12 weeks and Dawson is another one.'</strong></p>
              <p>Defender Dawson is facing eight weeks on the sidelines with knee and ankle ligament damage and Spurs' first-choice goalkeeper, Heurelho Gomes, is another doubt for the trip to Germany because of a thigh injury.</p>
              <p>Carlo Cudicini deputised ably for Gomes at West Bromwich, where William Gallas and Rafael van der Vaart both made their Tottenham debuts, but the large squad Redknapp has assembled will be stretched.</p>
              <p>Ledley King should return in defence for the game in Bremen after being rested yesterday and the creative responsibility looks likely to be shifed to former Holland captain Van der Vaart.</p>
              <p>But the £8million deadline-day signing from Real Madrid 'ran out of steam' yesterday, according to Redknapp. 'Going to Germany will be a test for us,' he said. 'Werder Bremen are very strong. They go for it.'</p>
