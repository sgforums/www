with assistance from Bolton.<br><br>Ivan Campo's control was a shambles as he tried to trap a hacked clearance by Anton Ferdinand in his own half and although Speed should have tidied up, the home side grabbed possession again and Tevez looked up from the left to see Noble totally unmarked at the far side to volley sweetly home.<br><br>Skipper Nigel Reo-Coker, Yossi Benayoun and Noble dominated the midfield as Bolton gormlessly declined to refine their one-up, long ball approach.<br><br>Anelka looked an isolated figure at the front as both Davies and Nolan were too embroiled in helping stem the West Ham avalanche to support him.<br><br>New Bolton boss Lee must have given an Allardyce-style grilling to his side at half time because they made a fair fist of trying to turn things around in the second period.<br><br>Goalkeeper Green made a fine save turning Anelka's long-range blast round a post, but as Bolton stepped up their barrage and the game became broken up by a series of spiteful tackles, it was no surprise to see the visitors cut West Ham's lead with 23 minutes to go.<br><br>Bobby Zamora, a willing workhorse for the first hour, was taken off soon after reacting to a challenge and being shown a yellow card.<br><br>But within three minutes of Harewood's arrival as substitute, veteran Speed struck for Bolton.<br><br>Noble lost the ball to Davies, who found Anelka, and the Frenchman's touch was ideally into Speed's stride for a scoring shot.<br><br>For a while Bolton's big boot threatened a way back, but the Hammers saw off the threat and Harewood was twice close to adding to the score late on.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLMjCd2km4A" rel="nofollow">Tevez's First Goal</a><br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLMjCd2km4A" rel="nofollow">Tevez for 2nd</a><br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fajM8rZT2I" rel="nofollow">Noble adds a 3rd</a><br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0iqfTLmaJM" rel="nofollow">Evergreen Gary Speed gets a consolation</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by used:</div><div class="quote_body">i dont think manu will do them any favours</div></blockquote>I agree. Even if Man U have the title by then, they will field the fringe players who will be eager to prove themselves. It will still not be an easy match for West Ham, although probably better than facing a Man U needing the match for the title.</div>
