              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">
              </span></p><p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Stoke City have come out fighting in defence of their latest controversial ploy to make the most of their long-throw tactic.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Footage from the 2-1 win against Tottenham on Sunday showed Ryan Shotton drying the ball with a towel underneath his shirt before taking throw-ins.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The plan worked a treat as he caused havoc in the Spurs penalty area, but the novel idea was under scrutiny by the football authorities as Premier League rules state that both clubs must agree to using towels during a game. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The FA are looking to establish whether Stoke’s tactic leaves them open to disciplinary procedures, although it is unclear whether jurisdiction rested with the FA or Premier League. Clarification is expected on Tuesday, but Stoke are adamant that their innovative method of ensuring Shotton was able to dry the ball was within the rules.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>A club spokesman said: ‘It’s a towelling vest that is the same colour as the shirt. The only stipulation is that, as long as the undergarment is the same colour as the predominant colour of the shirt, then it’s not a problem. It does not stipulate what fabric it has to be.’ </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>During the home defeat to Queens Park Rangers on November 19, opposing manager Neil Warnock demanded equal use of towels, as Stoke usually supply matchday ball boys with them to ensure the balls can be dried before throws are taken. </span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Warnock’s intervention is likely to have triggered the decision to supply Shotton with his own drying device rather than having towels on the touchline against Spurs.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Whether Stoke are cleared to continue with the ploy remains to be seen, but it illustrates how the club are determined to reap maximum benefit from the throws that have become a major feature of their game. Manager Tony Pulis has been keen to make the most of the freakish throws into the box from Rory Delap and, more recently, Shotton. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Last season, Stoke’s pitch was one of the smallest in the top flight, measuring 100x64metres — the minimum dimensions permissible. That looked set to change this season after the club qualified for the Europa League, as pitches in UEFA  competition must measure 105x68m.</span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>However, to ensure that the club continued to make the most of Delap and Shotton’s potent throws, they have marked out two pitches at the Britannia Stadium — one for domestic competition and another for European games.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Stoke’s reliance on long throws has been widely criticised. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has been outspoken about the tactic and even suggested the idea of scrapping throw-ins altogether.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Speaking in 2008, he said: ‘(The rule I would change would be) maybe to play throw-ins by foot. Why not? I think it would make the game quicker.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>‘For example at Stoke, for Rory Delap it is like kicking the ball. It is a little bit of an unfair advantage. He is using a strength that is usually not a strength in football.’</span></p>

              <p>It is funny that the FA have to interfere into such small issues.</p>
              <p>Would rubbing a towel before throw-in lead to any advantage in scoring goal ?</p>
              <p>If the players at the receiving end are not good enough, how dry the ball does not make any difference.</p>

              <p>I think it's more like how far the player can throw the ball when it's dry rather than when it's wet.</p>
              <p>Hiding a towel under his shirt isn't a right thing to do but have to say it's quite ingenious whoever came up with it... Have to sew it onto the under side of the jersey... lol.</p>
