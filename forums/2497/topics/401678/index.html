              <p><br>Well, making Inter champions of Italy again should not be too difficult I think... With AC now broke, Juve in a poor state, and Roma, who may lose some of their last season's star players... Together with Inter said to have $100m to spend... It could be the club where Rafa prove he can win league titles again...</p>

              <p>whether he goes willingly or get the sacked doesnt matter. 6 seasons only yielded 2 trophies, CL and fa cup. if he is not the man to lead liverpool to its first league title, after 6 seasons at the helm, time to give the job to another person, next please. you can deem whatever you want if this is quit on his part or dismissal by the club.</p>

              <p>Although Ah Ben is not my favourite manager, I disagreed that he did not love Liverpool and left for greener pasture.</p>
              <p>If he is all for the money, he would have left a few seasons ago when Real Madrid was knocking on his door.</p>
              <p>He was brought in to win the league title and that is the mission that he want to achieve.</p>
              <p>But, he some how put himself in a self sabotage mode by selling the players that he placed faith and beginning to show the fruit of his patience.</p>
              <p>If he was in other club, he would have been booted three season ago.</p>
              <p>He left cos he know the relationship between him and his players have soured and staying further will not help the cause for Liverpool to recover.</p>

              <p>Massimo Moratti says the deal which will see Rafa Benitez take over at Inter Milan is "more or less done" and expects confirmation on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The Spaniard, who left his post at Liverpool by mutual consent last Thursday, has been strongly linked with the post after Jose Mourinho's departure for Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>And Inter president Moratti believes the last few details will be sorted out in the next 24 hours.</p>
              <p>When asked if Benitez could be proclaimed as the next Inter boss on Tuesday, the Nerazzurri chief replied: "Yes, I really think so."</p>
              <p>He added: "The deal is more or less done.</p>
              <p>"It's not sealed yet because you don't sign something before hearing what you're signing, but we decisively targeted Benitez from the beginning and he is the person we consider most useful for the continuity of Inter at the same level."</p>
              <p>Benitez may wish to take his Anfield assistant Mauricio Pellegrino, goalkeeping coach Xavi Valero and fitness coach Paco de Miguel with him to the San Siro, with Italian Amedeo Carboni - who played under Benitez as a midfielder at Valencia - also tourted as a possible backroom addition.</p>
              <p>Reports in Italy suggest Benitez will sign a three-year deal worth five million euros per season.</p>
              <p>However, Moratti insists that media speculation is wide of the mark.</p>
              <p>"Who wrote that is off the track," he continued. "For the duration and the amount.</p>
              <p>"We talked about everything but the transfer market. And the numbers of assistants that I read in the papers are also fortunately wrong.</p>
              <p>"I read frightening numbers but in reality they will be numbers which belong to the norm of other coaches we have contracted in the past."</p>
              <p>Benitez earned a place in Anfield folklore by guiding Liverpool to 2005 Champions League glory in his first season.</p>
              <p>He followed that with FA Cup success in 2006 and another Champions League final appearance 12 months later. After finishing runners-up in the Barclays Premier League in 2009, many expected a serious title tilt this year but it failed to materialise.</p>
              <p>Early elimination from the Champions League was followed by a failure to finish in the top four and to re-qualify for Europe's elite event.</p>
              <p>The 50-year-old had four years remaining on his contract but paid the price for a seventh-placed finish.</p>
              <p>He had previously been linked with both Real Madrid and Juventus, who last month appointed former Sampdoria boss Luigi del Neri as Alberto Zaccheroni's successor.</p>

              <h2>RAFA BENITEZ NEW INTER BOSS</h2>
              <p><br><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></p>
              <div id="articlebody">
              <p><img src="http://images.football365.com/10/06/240/Benitez2_2460589.jpg" alt="Rafael Benitez - Inter Milan boss."></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>  </p>
              <div>
              <p><span><strong>Inter Milan president Massimo Moratti has confirmed Rafael Benitez has agreed a deal to become the club's new coach.</strong></span></p>
              </div>
              <p>Moratti revealed negotiations with Benitez had not taken place in person and said the Spaniard was due to arrive in Milan this week ahead of finalising his move to the European champions.</p>
              <p>The Inter president revealed an announcement would be made on Wednesday to confirm when Benitez would be unveiled as Jose Mourinho's successor at the San Siro.</p>
              <p>"We have agreed the final details, which were not important things," Moratti said in a statement on the Inter website, www.inter.it. "All that is needed now is a counter-signature.</p>
              <p>"Tomorrow we will tell you when he will be presented."</p>
              <p>Benitez has been in talks with the European champions since his six-year spell as Liverpool manager was ended by mutual consent last week.</p>
              <p>Moratti revealed on Monday that a deal with the 50-year-old had been "more or less done" and had been confident the details would be finalised on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Reports in Italy had suggested Benitez would sign a three-year deal worth five million euros per season, but Moratti dismissed those claims as "off track" in terms of "duration and the amount".</p>
              <p>Benitez may wish to take his Anfield assistant Mauricio Pellegrino, goalkeeping coach Xavi Valero and fitness coach Paco de Miguel with him to the San Siro, with Italian Amedeo Carboni - who played under Benitez as a midfielder at Valencia - also touted as a possible backroom addition.</p>
              <p>Benitez still had four years to run on his Liverpool contract but left after the Reds could only manage seventh place in the Premier League last season.</p>
              <p>Liverpool also suffered early exits in the Champions League, FA Cup and Carling Cup.</p>
              <p>Benitez had previously been linked with Real Madrid, but they filled their managerial vacancy by wooing Mourinho from Inter after he took them to the treble last season.</p>

              <p>so Rafa also kana sacked from other clubs before and also led a couple clubs to oblivion before !</p>
              <p>no big deal leading Valencia to league titles since Valencia was very strong under Hector Cuper. Real and Barca were ''lost'' during those few years anyway !</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway, bet big on Juve winning the title next season !</p>
