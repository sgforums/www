              The Bosnia and Herzegovina international appears to be set for an early departure from the Premier League winners, but no agreement exists between the player and the Bavarians.
              
              The 26-year-old has fallen down the pecking order at City, who are eager to trim their wage bill. And with his client dissatisfied with his role at the club, agent Irfan Redzepagic has informed Bayern that Dzeko, who is highly-rated by Bayern CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, would be happy to move to the Allianz Arena.
              
               Dzeko joined City in the winter of 2011 for a fee of â‚¬32 million (Â£25.6m), penning a contract through to 2015. He scored 18 goals in 42 appearances last season, but now Sergio Aguero, Mario Balotelli and Carlos Tevez are rated higher by coach Roberto Mancini, leaving no room for the Bosnia and Herzegovina international.
              
              Reports on Tuesday evening claimed that Bayern and Dzeko had agreed personal terms on a deal to take the player to the Allianz Arena. However, the striker's agent vehemently denied these allegations.
              
              "Of course not! It's crazy even to comment on that," Redzepagic told Bosnian source SportSport.
              
              Dzeko is one of several candidates that Bayern have watched as they aim to sign two more attackers before the summer transfer window closes. Olivier Giroud was observed sevearal times before Bayern opted not to pursue his signing. However, Twente striker Luuk de Jong is now a candidate.
              
              Goal.com can confirm that the Bayern bosses have made contact with De Jong's agent, and that the player is enthusiastic about the opportunity to play in the Champions League alongside his compatriot, Arjen Robben. However, a deal for the 21-year-old is still far from being complete.
              
              De Jong scored 32 times in all competitions last season, and has a contract that will expire in 2014.
              
              Bayern have already signed a striker in the form of Claudio Pizarro, who will replace Wolfsburg-bound attacker Ivica Olic. However, with Nils Petersen likely to leave on loan, squad space has opened for the Bavarians to add another striker to their ranks - for now, their top choice remains a mystery. 
              
              ==========
              
              are city really selling dzeko?  he won the title for them.
              
              city should sell belatolli and tevez.  both are good but problematic.
