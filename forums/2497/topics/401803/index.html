              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsene Wenger</span></abbr> intends to spend big this summer.</p>
              <p>The <em>Telegraph</em> says before Cesc Fabregas dropped his <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Barcelona</span></abbr> bombshell, the intention had always been 
              to add two or three senior players and this was backed up by a transfer 
              budget of around £40 million.</p>
              <p>With debt having been slashed by more than £100 million, turnover 
              running at record levels and an estimated £45 million in profit 
              beginning to roll in from the club’s property investments, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> have never been more financially robust.</p>
              <p>“Our financial situation has greatly improved,” said Wenger. “We are 
              finally able to buy the players we think we need.”</p>

              <p>Wenger has always done a good job with minimum budget he have and lead them to the Champion league every years.</p>
              <p>Now they have to money to spend again, I believe they will give Arsenal a more respectable fight for title compare to last few years. Surely they will be the English Champion again one day. But I hope they can bring back the Champion league too, cause a manager like Wenger should win the title at least once : )</p>

              <p>The way I see it, Wenger have very little choice now... The last few years he could get by with his large squad of young players... But now, with City, Spurs, Pool and Villa all knocking on that last 2 spots, Arsenal have to buck up of risk losing out on even 4th place. But if people think Arsenal don't spend a lot on transfer fees, that is also partly b'cos they pay hell of a lot in players salaries alone...</p>
              <p>And to think most of their first team players are not on very high salaries but yet they have the 3rd highest overheads in the EPL... We must wonder where their expenses gone to? Probably to the many youth players they bring to the club on higher than usual terms and a lot probably won't make it to the first team at the end...</p>
              <p>So the problem of bring in 'start players' for Arsenal could post another bigger problem for them... Star players will demand star salaries too... and once those that have been there and done that see they are getting lesser than those new arrivals... They will start to expect more as well like in the case of Chelsea's... Lampard, Terry, A Cole and now Joe... Chelsea has learn a lesson and is doing something about it now... Will Arsenal go their way once they start bring in 'star players'?</p>
