              <p>Once again, the Clough family is 90 minutes from Wembley after Derby
              stunned Premier League champions Manchester United with a 1-0 Carling
              Cup semi-final first leg triumph at Pride Park.</p>
              <p>After four triumphs in the competition for the legendary Brian, now it is Nigel's turn to take the Carling Cup by storm.</p>
              <p>Derby's
              new manager has not even taken official charge yet. But he will have
              done by the time the Rams head to Old Trafford for a second-leg meeting
              with Manchester United in a fortnight, looking to defend the priceless
              advantage Kris Commons gave them with his 30th-minute winner.</p>
              <p>It
              might have been more convincing too as Clough watched on from the
              stands, with Rob Hulse wasting a glorious chance near the end after
              Tomasz Kuszczak had pushed another Commons effort into his path.</p>
              <p>Not
              that a capacity crowd were complaining as they celebrated a famous win
              on a night when the son of their most famous manager must have felt the
              footballing gods really were smiling on him.</p>
              <p>Although Clough's
              only involvement was a wave from the directors' box when he was
              formally introduced just before kick-off, the appointment, whether it
              be the family name or just a new man to impress, had a galvanising
              effect on Derby.</p>
              <p>Much like Manchester City, `going down with a
              billion in the bank' according to the Red Devils faithful, against
              Nottingham Forest at the weekend, United suddenly found a famous East
              Midlands club punching above their weight rather than below it.</p>
              <p>Derby carved out all the best early chances.</p>
              <p>Steve
              Davies must have thought he would score when, after Kuszczak had saved
              his initial close-range shot, he met the rebound with venom, only for
              stand-in captain Nemanja Vidic to slide in and make a magnificent block.</p>
              <p>Rio
              Ferdinand was one of the team-mates Vidic was standing in for and the
              England defender's presence was being badly missed, mainly for his
              skills at organising those in front of him.</p>
              <p>When Vidic strained
              to head away from the penalty spot, Mile Sterjovski was given far too
              much room to line up a volley which was flying towards the bottom
              corner when Jonny Evans stuck out a leg to turn it away.</p>
              <p>With the
              opportunities came the confidence Clough needs to instil in his players
              on a more consistent basis as Derby began to string passes together and
              United continued to struggle.</p>
              <p>There was a brief interlude, during
              which Paul Scholes screwed a couple of long-range efforts wide before
              John O'Shea, racing onto Nani's return pass, flicked an intelligent
              shot which would have had former team-mate Roy Carroll in trouble if
              Paul Green had not been on hand to turn it away.</p>
              <p>But largely it was Derby dictating the game, Derby who looked more assured. United making all the unforced errors.</p>
              <p>So it was no surprise and certainly well deserved when Commons struck.</p>
              <p>United
              did not heed the earlier warning about giving opponents too much room
              and failed to close the Scotland international down as he collected
              Sterjovski's short pass.</p>
              <p>With the visitors having invited the
              shot, Commons obliged by drilling a low effort into the right corner
              that gave Kuszczak no chance.</p>
              <p>Little was seen of Carlos Tevez, whose Old Trafford future has been a major subject of interest over the past few days.</p>
              <p>But
              the biggest disappointment was Nani who, since the arrival of Zoran
              Tosic from Partizan Belgrade last week, has the most pressing need to
              impress.</p>
              <p>A speedy charge out of his area by Carroll prevented the
              Portugal wing man seizing on a loose ball at the start of the second
              half. But entrusted with set-piece duties, Nani wasted the lot.</p>
              <p>Such
              was his fitful contribution that it was a surprise the men to give way
              were Paul Scholes and Danny Welbeck when Ferguson cashed in his hefty
              insurance policy after 63 minutes and brought on Wayne Rooney and
              Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>Not that it changed much as Davies flashed a shot narrowly wide.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo
              did the same at the other end, by which time Michael Carrick had been
              introduced as well, in time to see the brilliant Portugal winger send a
              free-kick whizzing just past Carroll's post.</p>
              <p>But if that was a near thing, Derby came even closer 10 minutes from time as Kuszczak pushed away Commons' low shot.</p>
              <p>To
              be fair to Hulse, the rebound came at him lightning fast. Yet if the
              striker had only been able to keep it down rather than scoop it over,
              the Clough family really would have had reason to rejoice.Once again, the Clough family is 90 minutes from Wembley after Derby
