              <p><strong>Newcastle manager Alan Pardew has made his second summer transfer breakthrough by finally landing Senegal striker Demba Ba.</strong></p>
              <p>The 26-year-old former West Ham frontman's move to St James' Park was rubber-stamped this afternoon, the Barclays Premier League club have confirmed.</p>
              <p>The arrival of Ba, who scored seven times in 13 appearances for the Hammers during the second half of last season, comes 24 hours after Magpies skipper Kevin Nolan headed for Upton Park in a deal believed to be worth in the region of £4million.</p>
              <p>Pardew said: "Demba made a great impression with West Ham last season and is a great signing for this club. He has pace, excellent technical ability, is good in the air and, it goes without saying, has the ability to consistently find the back of the net. Moreover he has a great passion to play for Newcastle United."</p>
              <p>Newcastle beat off competition from a series off other suitors to land the former Hoffenheim player as Pardew looks to increase his options in attack.</p>
              <p>The player seemed to be heading for Stoke in January until he failed a medical on a knee problem and was snapped up by the Hammers.</p>
              <p>Despite his best efforts to keep the Londoners in the Premier League, they were relegated at the end of last season, but not before he had proved both his fitness and his prowess in front of goal.</p>
              <p>Ba arrived on Tyneside on Thursday as the Magpies' dogged pursuit neared its conclusion, and was able to convince the club's medics that his knee will not be an issue.</p>
              <p>He joins Yohan Cabaye in heading for St James' this summer, although is not necessarily a direct replacement for Andy Carroll, who left for Liverpool in January, with Pardew running the rule over a series of other targets.</p>
              <p>Ba who was born in the Paris suburb of Sevres and is one of eight children began his career with Rouen.</p>

              <p>Newcastle totally seal the deal man... They sold Andy Carroll for £35m and got this guy for free... What kind of business is this! Mike Ashley must be smiling all the way to the bank... A good piece of business i must say...</p>
              <p>I don't rate this Demba Ba any worse to Andy Carroll honestly... Carroll may have an edge over him in the air only but Ba seems better on the ground and running at defenders too... Both are physically strong players only Carroll so far seemed a little injury prone though...</p>
              <p>I think many were very impressed by Ba for the 5 months he played at WH and he probably had a few clubs to pick from. So Newcastle really got a good deal out of this...</p>

              <p>Because WH was offering him a lot more $ and a longer contract. Something that maybe no other clubs were willing to risk...</p>
              <p>At his age (29), a long contract (5yrs) is security... And also they have Big Sam his Bolton days manager over there helps...</p>
              <p>Nolan is made for the next 5 yrs... Whether he continues to play well or becomes a shitty player when he reach 30, he is guaranteed a handsome weekly salary for 5 yrs courtesy of WH... lol...</p>
