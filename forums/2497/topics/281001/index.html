Mourinho at least knows that any prospective suitors won't be coming from London, as Chelsea have blocked attempts by Premier League rivals to snap up their former manager by forcing him to sign an exile agreement until next season.<br><br>The Portuguese agreed to the deal last night as apart of the pay-off for him and his coaching staff, which is worth at least Â£16million.<br><br>That scuppered an immediate approach by Spurs, who had privately declared their interest in securing his services in place of current boss Martin Jol.<br><br>Mourinho said: Â“I'm going to enjoy my life, I'm going to wait for the phone calls. I want to work. I'll take my time after what happened.Â”<br><br>Having handed the reins to Grant and Clarke in the short term, Blues are thought to be considering adding Jamie Redknapp to their backroom staff.<br><br>Of their former boss, the club said: Â“Jose has been instrumental in putting Chelsea among the leading clubs in world football.<br><br>Â“He will always be welcome at Stamford Bridge, whether as a guest or manager of another club.Â” thought to be headed on holiday to Brazil</div>
