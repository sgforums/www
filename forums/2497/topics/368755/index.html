              <p><strong>Manchester City</strong>’s hopes of signing Emmanuel Adebayor from <strong>Arsenal </strong>are in the balance, with the Togo striker believed to be pursuing a move to <strong>Chelsea</strong>. Although his apparent lack of commitment is a blow for City, they are still planning to hold talks with the 25-year-old this weekend.</p>
              <p>City will make an improved offer for Joleon Lescott after a £15 million bid for the defender was rejected by <strong>Everton</strong>. Matthew Upson, of West Ham United, is a possible replacement for Lescott, his fellow England defender.</p>
              <p>Liverpool will intensify their efforts to sign David Silva, the Valencia playmaker, with Xabi Alonso expected to complete a £32 million move to Real Madrid next week.</p>
              <p>The Spain midfield player is not expected to travel with the Liverpool squad for their pre-season tour to Asia tomorrow night. Real Sociedad, who sold Alonso for £10.5 million in August 2004, stood to receive 20 per cent of the transfer fee, but that agreement is scheduled to expire today.</p>
              <p>It was unclear last night whether Wesley Sneijder, Real’s attacking midfield player, would be used as a makeweight in the prospective transfer.</p>
