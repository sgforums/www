              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/07/03/article-0-01B326C500000578-207_468x300.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="300"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="story"><strong>Russia's star player in the Euro 2008 Championship, Andrei Arshavin, is expected to fly to London today to hold talks with Chelsea about a possible £12 million move.</strong></p>
              <p class="story">Barcelona have had a similar bid accepted, and had been thought to be Arshavin's preferred destination. But Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has identified his 27-year-old compatriot as one of the London club’s top summer transfer targets.</p>
              <p class="story">Former Stamford Bridge boss Jose Mourinho has questioned Arshavin’s maturity and consistency but Abramovich appears to have no such concerns and is expected to be present at negotiations.<br><br>A deal for the 27-year-old could be tied up by as early as this weekend but Chelsea’s summer spending is unlikely to end there, with new boss Luiz Felipe Scolari keen to add Brazil striker Robinho to the already confirmed signings of Portugal stars Jose Bosingwa and Deco for a combined fee of over £24m.</p>
              <p class="story">Chelsea are prepared to pay Real Madrid £27m for Robinho — £8m short of the asking price set by the Spanish champions. However, reports in Spain claim that such is Robinho’s anger at being offered as a makeweight in a deal to take Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo to the Bernabeu, he may be tempted to use FIFA regulations to buy out the remaining two years of his contract for just £10m.<br><br>Another option apparently being considered by Real is a swap deal involving Robinho and Didier Drogba, with Scolari understood to be ready to offload the Ivory Coast striker, who also interests AC Milan.<br><br>Sources in Russia suggest Arshavin’s family are trying to talk him into a move to the Barclays Premier League with his mother Tatyana and wife Yulia both said to believe it would be easier for him and his two children to settle in England rather than Spain.</p>

              <p><br>Precisely thats my point... who should care who buy the players correct? The player mentioned was a world class player, but when the team didn't win... The fans, or i will say most Chelsea fans laid the blame on Roman and not on Mourinho who was the team coach... But if they won, the coach gets the credit...</p>
              <p>The question is, Isn't it a coach job to manage whatever players he have in a team? Like now Jose take over Inter... He has to make do with most of the players that are already there right?</p>
              <p>So why does most Chelsea fans still blame Roman? Is it just because they love the other guy more?</p>
