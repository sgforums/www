              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Death knell: Arshavin's four goal haul surely put paid to Liverpool's title hopes</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Andrey Arshavin lit up Anfield with a stunning four-goal display last night and then admitted: ‘We have played into </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong>’s hands.’</strong></p>
              <p>A clinical show of finishing from Arsenal’s £11million signing looked to have kept alive <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal</span></a>’s slender title hopes until Yossi Benayoun forced home a <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool</span></a> equaliser deep into injury time to leave the teams locked at 4-4.</p>
              <p>The point was enough to lift Liverpool above defending Barclays Premier League champions Manchester United and into top place on goal difference. </p>
              <p>But, with United having two games in hand on Liverpool, one of the most thrilling spectacles of the season had succeeded only in strengthening United’s hold on the crown.</p>
              <p>Anfield boss Rafa Benitez admitted: ‘It’s a big chance gone for us.’ But, with Arsenal still to play United and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span></a>, Gunners boss Arsene Wenger vowed to revive Liverpool’s sagging title challenge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/21/article-0-04949C0E000005DC-652_468x286.jpg" alt="Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Benitez fumes at the basic errors that cost his side dear</em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Wenger said: ‘Liverpool should not worry too much, because we will be heading to Old Trafford full of confidence. It is still very open because we will go into that game with every intention of winning it.</strong></p>
              <p>‘We are half-happy at scoring four goals but half-unhappy at conceding four. Arshavin is a great player, and great players can play anywhere. He has such a short backlift when he shoots.’</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="lightboxPopupLink" href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/22/article-1172459-04948AA1000005DC-331_468x262_popup.jpg"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/22/article-1172459-04948AA1000005DC-331_468x262.jpg" alt="Short backlift: Arshavin strikes" width="468" height="262"> </a></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Short backlift: Arshavin (left) strikes</em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Benitez could hardly conceal his huge disappointment at his side’s defensive deficiencies. He said: ‘I can’t explain why we made so many errors at the back. </strong><strong>Many of them were so basic, and they cost us goals. It was not like us, and I don’t know whether it was a case of nerves creeping in and affecting us.</strong></p>
              <p>‘It was frustrating to make so many mistakes but there were a lot of positives. We showed character and that helped us to come back so strongly at the end and salvage a point. That was enough to put us in top place, so that is another positive. United may be in the driving seat, but there was a lot about our performance that should encourage us.’</p>
              <p>Liverpool co-owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett were in the directors’ box after<br>apparently holding meetings with financial institutions over loans that are still outstanding.</p>
              <p>Injured Steven Gerrard said: ‘There should always be a good togetherness at the club, it is one of our strengths. It was a good sign to see the two owners together. Hopefully, they will sort their differences out.’</p>

              <p>I didn't watch the match cos I was more or less expecting Pool to win easily as gunners was without Almunia, Clichy, Gallas, Adebayor, van Persie... And to top it all up, they have that poor keeper Fabianski in goal...</p>
              <p>I am not thinking had Almunia played, maybe they might even have won it... But overall still quite an unexpected result to me lah...</p>

              <p>This match seemed to be one with lots of mistakes from the defenders... lol</p>
              <p>Pool's first goal came from a mis-kick from an Arsenal defender that gave Torres the chance to strike... Their 2nd was even worse... That keeper what was he doing going inside the goal area, didn't he know even had he save anything in there its still a goal... lol... Pool's 3rd goal also, I thought that keeper could have done better leh...</p>
              <p>But Pool was also being generous lah... Who is Pool's number 20, I am not sure but his mistake gave Arshavin gunner's their first goal... Then you can see him kicking himself about it... lol</p>
              <p>Arbeloa and Aurelio both combine to gave away Pool's 2nd and 3rd goals needlessly... The 2nd one, Arshavin sneak up on Arbeloa from behind to steal the ball then score... The 3rd one Aurelio like playing a one two in the penalty box to set up Arshavin for his hat-trick... lol</p>
              <p>Both sides 4th goals were from good play lah... Arsenal showed their quick counter attacking threat and Arshavin's great finishing... The Pool players this time didn't seem to celebrate or too happy when Benayoun scored in injury time unlike against Fulham leh...</p>

              <p>But Pool was also being generous lah... Who is Pool's number 20, I am not sure but his mistake gave Arshavin gunner's their first goal... Then you can see him kicking himself about it... lol</p>
              <p>Arbeloa and Aurelio both combine to gave away Pool's 2nd and 3rd goals needlessly... The 2nd one, Arshavin sneak up on Arbeloa from behind to steal the ball then score... The 3rd one Aurelio like playing a one two in the penalty box to set up Arshavin for his hat-trick... lol</p>
              <p>Both sides 4th goals were from good play lah... Arsenal showed their quick counter attacking threat and Arshavin's great finishing... The Pool players this time didn't seem to celebrate or too happy when Benayoun scored in injury time unlike against Fulham leh...</p>

              <p><strong>Post match interviews:</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool manager</strong> <strong>Rafael Benitez </strong>cursed the "massive" mistakes which cost his side victory and handed the initiative back to Manchester United in the Barclays Premier League title race.</p>
              <p>"It is really disappointing because we conceded four goals and normally we were not conceding these kind of goals," he said. "We made massive mistakes. It is difficult to explain because it was different players in different stages of the game.</p>
              <p>"You don't remember any save from Pepe (Jose Reina), it is just four chances and four goals and all of them have been our mistakes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger </strong>had mixed emotions about the result. "It was a game at a frenetic pace of top quality technically, and you could see both teams created many chances," he said.</p>
              <p>"We are half-happy because we scored four goals and half-unhappy because we conceded four. "Also, 4-3 up with two minutes to go, the team is disappointed [to draw] but I give credit to my team for a great performance tonight."</p>
