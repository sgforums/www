            <div class='col-md body'><strong>BarcelonaÂ’s Ronaldinho has criticised team-mate Samuel EtoÂ’o after his refusal to come on as a substitute during the 2-0 win over Racing Santander on Sunday.</strong><br><br>The Brazilian grabbed the headlines with both goals but there was controversy surrounding his team-mate.<br><br>Barca boss Frank Rijkaard wanted to give substitute EtoÂ’o five minutes at the end of the game as he continues his comeback from a knee injury, but the Cameroon star did not want to play.<br><br>"Everything depends on the player and the particular situation, but it always is important to think about what's best for the team," said Ronaldinho.<br><br>Rijkaard himself revealed: "Eto'o was warming up (in the 69th minute), but later when it came to putting him on, he did not want to go. It is a pity, but I still have not been able to speak with him and I do not know the cause of his decision."<br><br>It is being reported that Eto'o had been told he would play for half-an-hour and by the end of the match he did not want to come on at all.<br><br>Eto'o will now meet with Rijkaard in training to resolve the situation.<br><br>President Joan Laporta says he is confident about Rijkaard's handing of the situation.<br><br>Â“Samuel has suffered during four months and to be happy he needs to play and to score," he said. "It is necessary to be at his side. And Rijkaard, a teacher in these things, will find the right solution for him."</div>

Rijkaard and Ronaldinho both accused Eto'o of refusing to come on as a late substitute during the clash with Racing Santander on Saturday.<br><br>Eto'o told Spanish daily Marca that he was 'hurt' by comments made in the post-match press conference on Saturday, and that Rijkaard was a 'bad person' for criticising him.. Rijkaard claimed Eto'o had refused to take to the field for the final five minutes with Barca cruising to a 2-0 win while Ronaldinho, who scored both of the goals, said the Cameroonian had to think more of the team and less of himself.<br><br>Eto'o said: "It is necessary to always think about the team and then about the money. To go to the press room to say that I have not wanted to play is of bad person." "The one who said that is the one that has to speak with you. I am not going to give an explanation to anybody. I will only give an explanation to the club if they request one".<br><br>He then revealed there are two groups within the camp, one loyal to president Juan Laporta and another faithful to ex-vice-president Sandro Rosell. "In Barcelona there are two sides, two groups, one is the one of the president and other related to another person. The others are those that are worried. The injury is not going to last all my life".<br><br>On Ronaldinho's comments, Eto'o did not mince his words. "If a colleague believes that I have to think about the team, he is the one that he has to think about the team. But I always think first about the team and then about the money. That is what it has hurt to me more".<br><br>Laporta, meanwhile,appeared unconcerned at the furore surrounding his star striker. "Samuel has suffered for four months and needs to be playing and scoring goals," he said. "We have to stand by him. Rijkaard is an expert in these situations and knows how to handle them."<br></div>
