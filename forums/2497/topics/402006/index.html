              <h1>Raymond Domenech's unhappy French stars are revolting as Thierry 
              Henry is axed</h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>France took their place in these finals only after Thierry Henry’s 
              handball allowed William Gallas to knock out the Republic of Ireland in a
               play-off game that will long be remembered. Now the 1998 world 
              champions are again grabbing the attention for all the wrong reasons.</p>
              <p>Rather
               than count their blessings that they are in this tournament at all and 
              cherish an opportunity to make good the wrongs of a wretched 
              qualification campaign, Raymond Domenech’s players approach Friday 
              night’s opener against Uruguay bickering as only they can.</p>
              <p>And
               Henry is again at the heart of it, for Domenech doesn’t intend to pick 
              him. At least, he doesn’t want to. But player power has come to the fore
               with influential members of the squad making it clear that their 
              one-time talisman should take his place in the starting XI.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/09/article-1285385-09EA20CC000005DC-459_468x533.jpg" alt="Pulling in opposite directions: Members of the France squad are

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Pulling in opposite directions: Members of the 
              France squad are refusing to pass to certain other players</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The French have never trusted Domenech. His players have long felt 
              they know better than a coach who always looks too downtrodden and 
              travel-weary for a man with one of international football’s plum jobs.</p>
              <p>And
               here in South Africa, the 58-year-old coach appears not to have the 
              support of his squad.</p>
              <p>Sources close to the French team 
              suggested on Wednesday night that the majority of Domenech’s players 
              would like to see Henry and Abou Diaby in Friday’s team at the expense 
              of Yoann Gourcuff and Sidney Govou.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/09/article-1285385-09F327DE000005DC-402_306x423.jpg" alt="Divisive: France boss Raymond Domenech is a hugely controversial 
              character" width="306" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Divisive: France boss Raymond Domenech is a 
              hugely controversial character</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>During their recent friendly against Costa Rica, it was suggested 
              that Nicolas Anelka refused to pass to Gourcuff while Franck Ribery is 
              also said to have been selective in his passing during the embarrassing 
              recent defeat by China.</p>
              <p>Domenech has not publicly acknowledged
               that these problems exist. It is, however, a familiar tale. He put up 
              with similar waves of mutiny while guiding France to the final against 
              Italy in Germany four years ago.</p>
              <p>Arsenal’s Bacary Sagna said: 
              ‘We can maybe give him some advice or help but even if we were to offer 
              it I don’t think he would listen. The most important thing is the team.’</p>
              <p>But
               Chelsea’s French striker Florent Malouda urged unity, saying: ‘We have 
              to create links between players, we can’t just think, “I’m not 
              interested in what others do”.</p>
              <p>'We are going to look 
              ridiculous if, as we did at Euro 2008, each player stays in his comfort 
              zone aiming only for good marks from the media to the detriment of the 
              team.’</p>
              <p>With Domenech having left players such as Karim Benzema
               at home and missing the influential Lassana Diarra through injury, he 
              faces a match of mighty importance here on Friday.</p>
              <p>The World 
              Cup will begin four-and-a-half hours earlier amid fanfare and jubilation
               as the host nation take on Mexico in Johannesburg but by the time 
              France kick off in Cape Town it will all have got very serious.</p>
              <p>If
               France don’t win against a capable Uruguay side at Green Point then 
              their extended participation in the competition could be in doubt. Their
               final group game is, after all, against South Africa and France would 
              very much like to have wrapped up their progress to the last 16 before 
              then.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Handy: France were fortunate to secure their 
              place in South Africa after Thierry Henry's infamous handball</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Group A should not scare the French but previous finals have begun 
              poorly for them and it is in danger of becoming a trend. They lost to 
              Senegal in Seoul in 2002 and four years ago a 0-0 draw with Switzerland 
              set the tone for a fretful passage through the group stages.</p>
              <p>Certainly
               few neutrals will be in their corner over the next two weeks.</p>
              <p>On
               Wednesday in Cape Town the media were looking back to the dramatic 
              events that saw the Republic disposed of in Paris last November.</p>
              <p>One
               columnist in the Cape Times wrote: ‘Law 12, Mr Henry, you damnable 
              cheat. On behalf of the fighting Irish, I wish you a miserable 
              tournament.’</p>
              <p>Temperatures in Cape Town will certainly not 
              trouble France. These are not rising above 60F during the day and are 
              expected to fall sharply during the evenings. It may be one of the few 
              things the French find in their favour.</p>
