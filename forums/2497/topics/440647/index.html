              <p><strong>The Merseyside club are unhappy they must travel to Stamford Bridge on Tuesday, Nov 29, two days after they face</strong> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Manchester City</span><strong> at Anfield.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>An appeal to both the tournament organisers and the Premier League to rethink the schedule to preserve the integrity of the cup competition has been rejected.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>City find themselves in the same position as <span style="color: #0000ff;">Liverpool</span>, as they must travel to London to face Arsenal in their quarter final immediately after their visit to Liverpool.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>However, Robert Mancini’s side — with a vastly deeper squad and other priorities — are understood to be more relaxed about honouring both fixtures within such a short period.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>Liverpool had expected to head to <span style="color: #0000ff;">Chelsea</span> for a Wednesday evening kick-off, but the Football League claimed it could not do so because of Metropolitan Police advice.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>There is a TUC rally in central London on that day and Spurs are playing at home to PAOK Salonika in the Europa League.</p>
              <p>These explanations hold little sway with Liverpool, who do not believe they should suffer as a consequence of other commitments in the capital city, especially with other dates available in the fixture calendar.</p>
              <p>Manager Kenny Dalglish is deeply concerned Liverpool will not have any time to train for a game ranked as one of the most important of their season.</p>
              <p>After a brief warm down on Monday after the City game, Liverpool will have to make their 200-mile journey to London and play with minimal preparation.</p>
              <p>Chelsea, in comparison, play Wolves at home on Saturday, Nov 26, giving them an obvious advantage. Liverpool appealed to the Football League for this to be taken into consideration. They asked for the quarter-final to be played in the week of the semi-final, commencing Jan 9.</p>
              <p>When that was refused, both Liverpool and City asked the Premier League to bring forward their league meeting by 24 hours. This was deemed impossible because of live television commitments.</p>
              <p>Liverpool are especially unhappy with their treatment given how they have supported the League Cup, not only throughout their history, but during the course of this season.</p>
              <p>They boast the record number of wins in the tournament and the record number of appearances in the final.</p>
              <p>Dalglish has played a strong side throughout the early rounds this season and it has become a major priority due to a lack of European competition. He is determined to lift the club’s first trophy since 2006.</p>

              <p>I think Pool put more importance to it cos it's the only realistic target for Kenny... Having said that, I think Chelsea may put out a reserved team as they have a more difficult fixtures and also more games to play... So the Carling cup match will probably not be high on their list and also considering they have a "bigger" match away to high flying Newcastle, it could be a good time to rest some over played legs especially when there could be a very important match against Valencia in the CL... If Chelsea cannot get 3 points away to <span style="color: #225fb2;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bayer Leverkusen, they might have a real fight to qualify in their final match against Valencia...</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #225fb2;"><span style="color: #000000;">The problem for Chelsea now is, they are quite ordinary unlike City who seems like the only side to have 2 quality players in every position... </span></span></p>

              <p>It does not really matter who play what on when.</p>
              <p>After seeing Liverpool struggling with Swansea tonight, I and Mr Henry should be wondering whether Kenny have wasted millions on UK made players who really cannot make it.</p>
              <p>So, it does not make any difference whether they play Chelsea 48 hours or 1 month later.</p>
              <p>They made Swansea look good with all monkey ball chasing, losing of ball possession and lack of vision and initiative in play.</p>
              <p>They have fallen far far behind.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">KENNY DALGLISH has amazingly told Liverpool fans NOT to buy tickets for the Carling Cup clash with Chelsea.</h2>
              <p>The angry Kop boss is ready to play kids in the quarter-final on November 29 in protest at the scheduling.</p>
              <p>It is just 48 hours after Liverpool's Prem crunch with Manchester City.</p>
              <p>Dalglish said: "It is disgraceful in this day and age players are being asked to play a key Premier League game on Sunday and then a League Cup quarter-final in London just 48 hours later.</p>
              <p>"If the Football League want to devalue their own competition, it's up to them.</p>
              <p>"But they shouldn't be upset if people use these games to help in the development of young players.</p>
              <p>"The one thing I will say to our fans is to think carefully before buying tickets for the League Cup game.</p>
              <p>"We do not want them spending their money and then we decide there is no other option but to use only young players.</p>
              <p>"It's understandable, with the Spurs v PAOK Salonika match and the TUC rally, that the Metropolitan Police have said our game cannot be played on the Wednesday.</p>
              <p>"But it's surely the duty of the football authorities to think of other solutions which consider the welfare of the players — and this clearly hasn't happened.</p>
              <p>"City are in a similar position to us with their game at Arsenal.</p>
              <p>"Here you have two clubs who have treated this competition with the utmost respect over the years and they are being treated like this.</p>
              <p>"I'd be interested to know what the sponsors think of the situation and what it does for the reputation of the competition.</p>
              <p>"It seems irresponsible the quarter-finals are scheduled in the same week as Europa League games.</p>
              <p>"Both ourselves and City were happy for the League game to be moved back to the Saturday. But we are told this is not possible either for TV reasons."</p>
              <p>A Football League spokesman said: "Despite extensive efforts, no alternative solution acceptable to all parties could be found."</p>
              <p>Liverpool vice-captain Jamie Carragher expects to return to full training next week after missing two games with a calf injury.</p>

              <p>To be honest, Chelsea don't have a very huge squad this season either unlike City. And are not in the best of form too. So to top these all up, they got more games to play somemore... I don't even understand what the fuss he is making?</p>
              <p>This guy ah... I think they must stop calling him KK (King Kenny)... Cos Complain King (CK) seems more appropriate for him... lol.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">
              </span></p><p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Isn't this the unimportant competition? The Carling Cup is usually regarded as a bane by managers, so that fact Kenny Dalglish erupted this week has told a highly significant story.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Liverpool’s manager has been seething for the past seven days about how the foibles of fixture list means his side must play their Carling Cup quarter-final at Chelsea 48 hours after they host Manchester City in the Barclays Premier League.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>At first glance some would view this to be sour grapes and, perhaps, getting excuses in early. Liverpool, after all, will not be favourites at Stamford Bridge. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Furthermore, sympathy is in short supply from most neutrals. Liverpool, after all, have a bigger and improved squad from last year. So what if they have to play twice in two days?</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Clearly it is not an ideal state of affairs. The Football League would have wanted this tie to be played on a Wednesday but Tottenham’s Europa League clash against PAOK Salonika, coupled with a TUC march in the capital the same, means the Met Police will not allow the game to be switched.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Liverpool and Manchester City – who are in a similar position – would have been happy to bring their league game forward by 24 hours but, again, that was not possible, with television scheduling among the number of reasons why the Premier League could not grant the request.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Irked by what he has perceived to be a damaging inflexibility, Dalglish delivered a broadside on Thursday, claiming that it is 'disgraceful' that players are being asked to play two important games so quickly and threatening to field a team of young players.</span></p>
              
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><br> </span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>He won’t do that, though. The reason why is the same reason is so angry – the Carling Cup represents Liverpool’s best opportunity to win a trophy this season and Dalglish is desperate to crown his second coming as manager with a piece of silverware.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Perhaps he will use the planning to Liverpool’s advantage, creating a siege mentality within in his squad. If Dalglish feels outside forces are making things difficult for his players, he will use the sense of injustice as a motivating factor.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>There is no way, however, that he will oversee a surrender at Stamford Bridge. Liverpool have come through potentially trick examinations at Exeter, Brighton and Stoke and are starting to believe a 15-year hiatus from Wembley can be ended.</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>The League Cup has been derided in the modern era but it remains a competition that is revered at Anfield. Dalglish won it four times as a player – he scored in the first victory against West Ham in 1981 – and later took Liverpool to the final as manager, in 1987 against Arsenal.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Liverpool’s haul of seven League Cup wins remains a record and this squad is aching to make that number eight. Take Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher. They have never been to Wembley with Liverpool and are desperate to banish that statistic.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Dirk Kuyt has been on Merseyside for more than five years but has no medals to show for his service, while Pepe Reina has failed to add to the Community Shield and FA Cup gongs he collected in 2006. Try telling them that the Carling Cup doesn’t matter.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>‘Here you have two clubs who have treated this competition with the utmost respect over the years and they are being treated like this,’ said Dalglish. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>‘It is for Manchester City to argue their case but it is my job to stand up for the interests of Liverpool Football Club.’</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Yes, he is furious. But do not disguise this as waving the white flag. The reason Dalglish is boiling is because he wants to win this tournament. That’s how much the Carling Cup has changed.  </span></p>
