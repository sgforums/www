              <p><strong>Mark Hughes insists his Manchester City job is safe, as he prepares to meet the club’s new owner for the first time. </strong></p>
              <p>Pressure is mounting on the City boss after six defeats in their
              opening 11 games left The Premier League’s big-spenders struggling in
              mid-table.</p>
              <p>Hughes is set for talks with club chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak and
              chief executive Garry Cook prior to Sunday’s clash with Tottenham and
              will fly to Dubai to meet owner Sheik Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan on
              Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Hughes said in The Mirror: “There have been some disappointing
              results, but the owners don ‘t strike me as the kind of people who
              would make a knee-jerk reaction.</p>
              <p>“They want to challenge for the top honours, but they know it has to be a long-term project.”</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Hughes issued a hands-off warning to Chelsea after
              reports emerged that Luiz Felipe Scolari was keen to lure Robinho from
              Eastlands.</p>
              <p>The Brazilian was a top-target for The Blues over the summer, but a
              deal could not be agreed with former club Real Madrid and City stepped
              in to steal his signature. </p>
              <p>Robinho has enjoyed a brilliant start to his Premier League career, and Hughes laughed off speculation he could quit the club.</p>
              <p>The City boss said in the Daily Star: “Good players will always
              attract attention. But Robinho has signed a long-term contract here.</p>
              <p>“This is where he will stay. They had their opportunity and could
              not do a deal. Now I don’t know whether they could afford him.”</p>

              <p><strong>Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak has rallied to Mark
              Hughes’ aid, insisting talk that they are looking to replace the
              Welshman is rubbish. </strong></p>
              <p>Hughes’ honeymoon period at the helm of City
              is well and truly over and Sunday’s home defeat to Tottenham saw them
              slip to within two points of the foot of the table.</p>
              <p>Reports in Monday’s press claimed Hughes was
              under intense pressure, amid suggestions he had lost the faith of Al
              Mubarak and the club’s Brazilian stars.</p>
              <p>Al Mubarak was in attendance for the defeat to Spurs and says it is nonsense to suggest they are eyeing a new manager.</p>
              <p>"We are calm and under control and we on the board have the highest regard for Mark," he told the club’s official website.</p>
              <p>"I am personally committed to him as I am committed to the partnership between executive chairman Garry Cook, Mark and myself.</p>
              <p>"This is a winning team that is going through a learning curve right now.</p>
              <p>"Thankfully I do not read the newspapers that are saying he is under pressure but I find it incredible.</p>
              <p>"I am told that there are reports that we are
              associated with two different coaches and that we are about to sign
              them. It is rubbish."</p>
