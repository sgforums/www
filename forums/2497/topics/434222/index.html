              <p><strong>SEVENTEEN years after a Singapore football team last participated in the Malaysia Cup, the Republic has decided to make a return across the causeway.</strong></p>
              <p>On Tuesday afternoon, the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) signed a memorandum of understanding with the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) at the latter's headquarters in Selangor, announcing a landmark partnership.</p>
              <p>It will see a Singapore team - called the Singapore Lions - take part in the Malaysian Super League, Malaysia and FA Cups in 2012.</p>
              <p>This team will comprise national players below the age of 23, five players above the age of 23 and will be complemented by the quota of foreign players allowed in accordance with the competition rules.</p>
              <p>In turn, a Malaysian team - the Malaysian Tigers - which also comprises mainly Under-23 national players, will join the S-League.</p>
              <p>Under the four-year agreement, two other key initiatives were also mooted, which includes an increase in friendly matches between the national teams of the two countries, as well as the birth of a new annual tournament which will see the winners of both leagues do battle over two legs.</p>
              <p>Said FAS president Zainudin Nordin: 'There is always a special romance between Singapore and Malaysian football. The key points of this partnership cannot be achieved overnight, but these are positive developments and it's a win-win situation for both parties.'</p>

              <p>I suspect that they are hoping that the current batch of youngsters (YOG, U15, U16 teams) will continue to play soccer and eventually send them to play in this league as a form of overseas exposure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, I can already predict that it will be an exercise in futility.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For all the good intentions, Sg is run by the people at the top who have this FT mindset.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Should these batches of youngsters start doing well, the top people will get all excited and will start thinking big in terms of getting in more and more FTs to complement the local team.  If the locals do badly, then it's always an excuse to bring in more FTs to replace them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Either way, local players will soon get discouraged by their treatment and drop out of the team sooner or later. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I would like to see us back in the Malaysia Cup. I was at the very last final at Shah Alam in 1994.</p>
              <p>But I seriously doubt that the good ol' days will be back anytime soon, for a variety of reasons:</p>
              <p>1. One whole generation of Singaporeans have grown up without it. Simply put, the kids won't understand what the hoo-ha is all about.</p>
              <p>2. Times have changed. Back in the early 1990s, Internet was a newfangled thing, and entertainment options were limited. The M-League was a cheap way to entertain yourself. But not anymore.</p>
              <p>3. We're putting in a U-23 team, not the senior team.</p>
              <p>4. Sports Hub is still being built. Where to host matches then.... Jalan Besar Stadium? With a capacity of only 6000? That's a far cry from the 60 000 who could watch at Kallang in the past.</p>
              <p>5. In the intervening 17 years, a lot of the generation that remembers the M-League and Malaysia Cup have 'moved on' to, say, the Premier League. It would take a hard sell to entice them back to the M-League.</p>
              <p>6. Don't even talk about the BPL... the S-League itself would be a competitor to the M-League. People would have to choose between the M-League and the S-League to follow.</p>
              <p>I'm not trying to be pessimistic; I'm just trying to be realistic here.</p>

              <p>I guess the FAS thinks this could be a big money spinner... Imagine the new stadium coming up would be a white elephant if got nothing to attract people to pay and attend... What better way to bring back the crowd than getting back into the Malaysia cup?</p>
              <p>I belief the crowd will still be there, it's just a matter of how many, 30k, 40k, 50k of full house? Cos there is nothing better than a stadium full of crowd cheering... The atmosphere will be interesting, like going to an opposition rally... lol.</p>
              <p>How well they do will depend on how they market it, the players isn't really relevant in the first 2 yrs... Cos people will still go just for old time sake and the fun atmosphere...</p>
              <p>If they collect $10 a ticket, 50,000 people will be another big money spinner...</p>
