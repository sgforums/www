            <div class='col-md body'><strong>No takeover bid for Magpies, insists Shepherd</strong><br><br>Newcastle United chairman Freddy Shepherd has insisted the club has not received a formal takeover bid amid claims that the Belgravia Group is ready to make its move.<br><br>A report on Friday claimed that the Jersey-based investment group is preparing a Â£235million swoop which will involve a lucrative property deal and up to 7,000 jobs.<br><br>However, Shepherd told Sky Sports News: 'If there was a bid put in I'd be obliged to report it to the Stock Exchange, but there's being no bid for Newcastle.'<br><br>A spokesman for Belgravia said: 'We are still in negotiations, but no formal offer has been made and we do not comment on press speculation.'<br><br>Shepherd has in the past challenged potential investors to make their move and his frustration was evident as he added: 'Any club, any business gets damaged by people constantly referring to bids. It certainly raises the profiles of these companies.'<br><br>Both Belgravia and US hedge fund Polygon have expressed an interest in the club, and former chairman Sir John Hall has confirmed he has held talks over his holding, which amounts to around 29 per cent with his son Douglas controlling another 12 per cent.<br><br>However, Shepherd owns further 28 per cent and has shown few signs of being ready to relinquish his interest in the club as he approaches nine years in the hot-seat.<br><br>The chairman became the target for angry fans following Newcastle's 1-0 Premiership defeat by Sheffield United at St James' Park on November 4.<br><br>He later vowed to continue his work to restore the club's fortunes and claimed that if a Geordie Roman Abramovich came forward, he would welcome him with open arms.<br><br>There have even been suggestions that Shepherd could launch his own takeover after gradually increasing his stake to take him close to the 30 per cent threshold at which he would have to make an offer to the remaining shareholders.<br><br>Should Belgravia make a move, both Shepherd and the Halls would stand to make sizeable fortunes from selling out, although the headline figure could be misleading.<br><br>If the total value of the project did amount to Â£235million, it is understood while that would mean a sizeable dividend for shareholders, it would also include the budget for whatever investment the new owners saw necessary in order to revive the club's fortunes.<br><br>The recent speculation, coupled with a Â£1million investment in shares by Isle of man-based equity fund Northcote (IOM) Ltd - Kapena Fund, has strengthened the club's share price, which stood at 70p earlier today, valuing Newcastle at significantly in excess of Â£93million.<br><br>Northcote bought 1,475,000 shares at 72.8p, costing a total of Â£1,073,800, but insisted their purchase was not part of a takeover bid.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Roeder refuses to be riled by sick taunts<br><br>Newcastle United manager Glenn Roeder has shrugged off claims he was taunted by Arsenal fans who called him 'tumour boy'.<br><br>The Magpies boss was reportedly targeted by a small number of supporters behind his dug-out during Saturday's 1-1 draw at the Emirates Stadium.<br><br>When Roeder, who had a brain operation in 2003 while in charge at West Ham, got up to give instructions from his technical area there were allegedly shouts 'Sit down, tumour boy'.<br><br>He suffered similar abuse on his return to Upton Park in September.<br><br>Roeder, however, claimed he did not hear the chants at the weekend and would not waste any time on them even if he had.<br><br>'If a supporter is critical of a brain tumour I had three and a half years ago, I wouldn't respect him anyway,' said the under-pressure Newcastle boss.<br><br>'It's not going to bother me. I didn't hear it. Lucky I'm deaf.'<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Newcastle warned off bidding for Huntelaar and Emanuelson<br><br>Newcastle have had to scratch two names from their January shopping list after being told to forget about Ajax duo Klaas Jan Huntelaar and Urby Emanuelson.<br><br>Manager Glenn Roeder had identified the pair among his potential targets for the winter transfer window as he attempts to strengthen his squad after seeing a relative lack of depth exposed in recent weeks.<br><br>However, the Dutch club have issued a hands-off warning to the Magpies over two of their most highly-rated performers.<br><br>Roeder said: "Like a lot of Premiership managers, Huntelaar and Emanuelson are two players I greatly admire, but Ajax are insisting they are not for sale."<br><br>Striker Huntelaar, a Dutch record Â£6million signing from Heerenveen, and 20-year-old left-back Emanuelson, both played for Holland in their 1-1 draw with England in Amsterdam last week.<br><br>The 23-year-old Huntelaar has already played at St James Park, where he was on the wrong end of a 2-1 scoreline when Heerenveen lost 2-1 on Tyneside in the second leg of a UEFA Cup third round tie in February 2005.<br><br>But he impressed in the first leg, putting his side ahead before goals from Alan Shearer and Lee Bowyer handed the Magpies the advantage in Holland.<br><br>However, while Roeders hopes of landing either man look doomed, his interest suggests the areas in which he will be looking to strengthen.<br><br>With Michael Owen and Shola Ameobi on the long-term injury-list and Â£10million summer signing Obafemi Martins struggling for goals, Roeder does not have a lot of options, while Celestine Babayaros fitness record has seen central defender Peter Ramage employed as an emergency left-back.<br><br>Roeder said: "We know which parts of our team need strengthening and we will be acting accordingly."<br><br>The club has already been linked with, among others, Manchester Uniteds Alan Smith, Aston Villa midfielder Steve Davis, central defenders Steve Gohouri, Patrick Kisnorbo and Valencias David Navarro, and former frontman Lomana LuaLua, although none are thought to be genuine targets.<br><br>Newcastle face Spaniards Celta Vigo in the UEFA Cup on Tyneside on Thursday knowing a win will clinch their place in the next round.<br><br>Roeder was able to call upon Martins for the first time in six matches for the creditable 1-1 draw Arsenal on Saturday and will hope the 22-year-old Nigerian can serve up a second dose of European magic.<br><br>The former Inter Milan star scored twice at the Gallowgate End to ease his side past Levadia Tallinn in the first round of the competition.<br><br>He has only one Premiership goal to his name so far, but team-mate James Milner is convinced he can have a bright future in English football.<br><br>Milner said: "I have played with some big-hitters in my career so far - people like Mark Viduka, Robbie Fowler and Alan Smith at Leeds and Juan Pablo Angel and Milan Baros at Aston Villa, and then you have Alan Shearer in the last few years here at Newcastle. I think Oba can be right up there with them. He is class and he is still only young as well. He has been playing for a massive club like Inter Milan at the San Siro in front of thousands. Everybody has witnessed how quick he is and he has got good feet. We have seen his finishing ability and hopefully he will score many goals at this club."<br><br>Meanwhile, Newcastle are awaiting the results of scans on Damien Duffs knee injury and Craig Moores hamstring problem.</div>
