            <div class='col-md body'>Portsmouth to fight Bayern for Diarra?<br><br>Portsmouth could add another expensive midfield star to their squad after reports Alou Diarra wants to quit French champions Lyon - now managed by former Pompey boss Alain Perrin.<br><br>Harry Redknapp, who replaced Perrin at Fratton Park when he returned from an ill-fated spell at Southampton in December 2005, has recently splashed a club-record Â£7million fee on Ghana midfielder Sulley Muntari.<br><br>And he would have to pay close to Â£5million for Frenchman Diarra, who is thought to have become disillusioned at Lyon since former Liverpool chief Gerard Houllier quit two weeks ago.<br><br>Bayern Munich are also thought to be interested in Diarra, 25, but Redknapp, who was scouting in France at the weekend, has confirmed: 'He has the type of presence in midfield I like.'<br><br>Redknapp admits he is also interested in Rennes' Â£4.5million-rated Nigeria striker John Utaka - and could need him to replace compatriot Kanu who insists on holding out for a straight two-year new contract at Portsmouth which the club will not offer.<br><br>Kanu, who scored 12 goals last season - but none since February after arriving last summer on a free transfer from West Brom, has been offered a new one-year deal, with an option for a second year if he makes 25-plus appearances next season.<br><br>But the 30-year-old is adamant he will only settle for two years without strings - even though Pompey chief executive Peter Storrie has told him he has had the club's final offer.<br><br>Meanwhile Redknapp has denied any knowledge of a reported Marseille interest in Pompey's previous record signing Â£4.4 million Benjani Mwaruwari. Redknapp is now making a new striker his priority having signed defenders Sylvain Distin from Manchester City and Hermann Hreidarsson from Charlton.<br><br>He admitted: 'People are going to pay fortunes for goalscorers but if you haven't got them you won't win matches in the Premiership.'<br><br>Redknapp admits missing out on Mark Viduka, who left Middlesbrough on a free for Newcastle, and fears Boro will want 'too much' for Ayegbeni Yakubu, the former Pompey striker who is said to be unsettled at the Riverside.<br></div>
