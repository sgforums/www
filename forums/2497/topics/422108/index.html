              <p>actually shd have been 5-4 to newcastle. This Best scored a goal when rosicky played him onside. Deja vu for fabregas. He cursed and swore last week for that saha goal and now he's on the receiving end of some good fortune. wtf.</p>

              <p>It's quite amazing that Newcastle actually can come back from this... After losing Andy Carroll and another one of their better striker <span lang="EN-GB">Ameobi I think, who scored their 4 goals? I thought morale would be low and motivation would be difficult considering what happen this last few days... But my goodness, I think we can built this as the "Mother of all comebacks"... lol.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Will try the catch the repeat later cos just curious who scored for Newcastle... lol.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">I guess Alan Pardew just love to irritate Wenger with their past history... Remember they almost came to blows on the touchline a few seasons back when Pardew was Charlton manager I think... I guess he must be loving it... lol.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">How do you come back from 4 - 0 down? Still finding it hard to belief... </span></p>

              <p><strong>As an incredible day of football produced a record 41 Premier League goals, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger vented his frustration over his team's astonishing four-goal collapse at Newcastle.</strong></p>
              
              <p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p><span>Wenger refused to condemn his midfielder, Abou Diaby, for the retaliation which earned him a match-changing red card and claimed that Newcastle's Joey Barton should have been sent off instead for his challenge on the French international midfielder.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I cannot measure how angry I am,' said Wenger, after seeing his side's 4-0 lead reduced to a 4-4 draw. 'I believe Barton was very lucky to stay on the pitch because of the tackle on Diaby. The sending-off was the turning point. We have to take it on the chin but it doesn't help our push for the title.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Diaby is very disappointed. It's better not to talk to him. It's a shame because he had a great first half. He has been injured so many times from bad tackles that he lost it a bit quickly. Certainly the tackle provoked his reaction.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Newcastle manager Alan Pardew defended Barton's challenge, saying: 'It was a proper, honest challenge. I've seen it two or three times and there is nothing wrong with it. He goes for the ball and he wins it clean. He's aggressive in the challenge and he takes a bit of the player after he's won the ball. This is football, guys. This is how it's played in the Premier League. I had absolutely no problem with the challenge.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Barton claimed the red card was deserved for Diaby's 'lack of disclipline'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He added: 'There was no need to him to react the way he did, especially with them 4-0 up. Arsene sees what he wants to see and doesn't see what he doesn't.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Both managers agreed that the game will be remembered on Tyneside for years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Arsenal built a 4-0 lead through Theo Walcott, Johan Djourou and two from Robin van Persie before Diaby saw red after the interval. Two penalties by Barton either side of a strike from Leon Best set Newcastle up for Cheik Tiote's long-range equaliser.</span></p>
              <p> </p>

              <div class="artSplitter"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/02/05/article-1354110-0D0DA1CE000005DC-314_634x400.jpg" alt="Arsenal's Robin Van Persie scores his second goal" width="634" height="400"></span>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Pardew said: 'This was our day. When you're 4-0 down after 26 minutes and you haven't made a challenge you have to fear the worst. And I did fear the worst.'</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Wenger added: 'It was a game the fans here will remember for a very long time. I was surprised by both penalty decisions but I'm not a referee.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The controversy at St James' Park was one drama and Newcastle's comeback will go down as one of the greatest in living memory.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">It might not have come in as important a game as Liverpool's in the 2005 Champions League final against AC Milan but the scale of their task at half-time was still on a par.</span></p>

              <p>actually this joey barton, prior to his tackle on diaby, was already flying in with tackles here and there. When the ref doesn't haul him up for dangerous play, the arsenal players got frustrated.</p>
              <p>It was surreal watching barton getting some rough treatment from opposing players if you fans know what i mean. He normally dishes them out, doesn't he?</p>

              <p>Caught the match just now and I thought this Joey Barton was fantastic... He and Nolan and that new striker made it happen... </p>
              <p>Joey have nerve of steel for the way he took those 2 penalties... He took them so coolly...  And I disagree that he should have been sent off too cos he tackles may have been tought but they didn't warranted a card cos they were good tackles...  And the guy kept his composure and didn't react unlike that Diaby...</p>
              <p>Another player that stand out for me was that Best guy... Where did he came from?  His disallowed goal should have been given too cos Rosicky played him onside... It was very unfortunate for him... No wonder they let Carroll go so easily... This guy seems like, his name... Best of the lot... lol.</p>
              <p>He he keeps playing this way, Newcastle won't miss Carroll...</p>

              <p>The 2nd penalty is 100% kelong, Arsenal have to learn playing against 12 men team.</p>
              <p>Barton use to be bad boys n he may have learn from his lesson, but his play is always gangster like.</p>
              <p>Many teams deploy tough tackle on Arsenal, time n time again it proof effective.</p>
              <p>So if Arsenal want to win EPL or even UCL, think it will take sometime.</p>
              <p>They take too long to learn, and being young is nolonger an excuse cos 6 years is too long. A 18 yrs old boy is now 24 at his peak with the team member come n go. </p>
              <p>Another 6 years, all his players will leave one by one before they reach 30yrs old.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Arsenal </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">are set to sue a French TV station after it reported the dramatic 4-4 draw against </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Newcastle </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">on Saturday was under suspicion of match-fixing.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The Gunners went 4-0 up at St James’ Park but only managed a draw after a stirring second-half comeback from the Magpies.</p>
              <p>And France 2 over the weekend reported the Barclays Premier League clash was being looked at by Interpol over allegations of ‘strange movements of money.’</p>
              <p>But Interpol this morning denied the broadcaster’s claims insisting there was no such investigation, while the Premier League have not been made aware of any betting irregularities in connection with the match.</p>
              <p>And now the furious north London club is seeking advice over the allegations with a view to starting legal proceedings against the channel. </p>
