              <p><strong>Angry Chelsea coach <span style="color: #000000;">Carlo Ancelotti</span><span style="color: #000000;"> labelled his side "frightened'' after a </span><span style="color: #000000;">shocking second half display</span><span style="color: #000000;"> cost them the chance to go back to the top of the Premier League.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea looked to be on course for three points thanks to </span><span style="color: #000000;">Didier Drogba</span><span style="color: #000000;">'s 42nd-minute penalty but Everton substitute </span><span style="color: #000000;">Jermaine Beckford</span> headed an equaliser four minutes from time.</p>
              <p>The Blues have now won just once in their last six league games and Ancelotti was clearly rattled by another sub-standard display from the Double winners.</p>
              <p>"I am disappointed and angry,'' Ancelotti said. "Not just because of the result. We played good football in the first half and the second half was totally different. We played the long ball. We were a little bit scared. I didn't like this.</p>
              <p>"We are working to play a particular kind of football and I don't understand why we have changed it. We have to look at it and I have to understand and change it. I don't think it is a problem of concentration. Everybody knew it was a very important game for us to move on from the difficult moment we are still in.</p>
              <p>"We have to do better day-by-day on the training ground, in the training sessions. We have to work harder than we are doing. This is the way I know to move on in a difficult moment.</p>
              <p>"The problem is on the pitch and we have to work to resolve this. First half the spirit was good. I saw the players in focus and concentrated with good tactical discipline. But in the second half they were scared, afraid and played the long ball.</p>
              <p>"We needed to play better from the back and in the second half, it was the wrong way to play football. I am worried yes, because we haven't won a lot of games. The second half was totally wrong. We have to do better.''</p>

              <p><strong>Everton manager <span style="color: #000000;">David Moyes</span><span style="color: #000000;"> was unhappy with a two-footed tackle by Chelsea full-back </span><span style="color: #000000;">Branislav Ivanovic</span><span style="color: #000000;"> as well as a booking for </span><span style="color: #000000;">Phil Neville</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Moyes accused Chelsea winger </span><span style="color: #000000;">Florent Malouda</span> of stamping on Neville but praised the response from his side following last week's 4-1 home drubbing by West Brom.</p>
              <p>The Everton defender's decision to get up immediately from the altercation almost certainly saved the Chelsea winger from a potential red card.</p>
              <p>"I have got to say Phil Neville did fantastic,'' Moyes said. "Malouda came in and stamped on him but Phil got up and ran away. But a minute later one of their players went and got him booked for nothing.</p>
              <p>"It was disgusting. He helped keep Malouda on the pitch and a second later one of their players goes down easy and gets Neville booked. Ridiculous. But you need to have a look at Ivanovic's tackle in the 31st minute as well and look where the referee was.</p>
              <p>"The second half we deserved the result. Chelsea had a few chances but then you expect that. It was tough for us in the first-half. The quality of our decisions in the final third probably cost us winning the game. But the players responded really well today. The players here tend to do that in the right fashion.''</p>
              <p>Chelsea's first half penalty was awarded after goalkeeper <span style="color: #000000;">Tim Howard</span><span style="color: #000000;"> brought down </span><span style="color: #000000;">Nicolas Anelka</span> but Moyes agreed with referee Lee Probert that it didn't warrant a red card.</p>
              <p>"The goalkeeper could not get out of the way,'' added Moyes. "If it was me, I would want a penalty kick for it. But it definitely was not a sending off.''</p>

              <p><span><strong>Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti - anger burning in his eyes if not in his voice - last night promised his players an uncomfortable reunion on the training ground today. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Judging by his mood, Chelsea's extravagantly paid and highly pampered players are not so much reporting for training as an inquest. </span></p>
              <p><span>Chelsea's slump is becoming contagious and Everton's thoroughly deserved draw brought more anxiety to Ancelotti ahead of upcoming matches with Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United. </span></p>

              <p><span>Those games, over 15 days this month, could define their season.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Of course I am worried,' said Ancelotti. 'There are no smiles around the club because there is no reason to smile. I explained tonight what I feel.</span></p>
              <p><span>'And tomorrow we have a training session to talk about this more. Tomorrow, we have to change our behaviour to training. We have to be more focused, show more concentration. This difficult moment has gone on too long. We have to change something about our behaviour.' </span></p>
              <p><span>The confidence and bravado that was the hallmark of Chelsea's play during their boisterous romp to the summit of the Premier League is now a distant memory. </span></p>
              <p><span>They have won only five points from their last six matches. Ancelotti was infuriated by the unexpected manner in which Chelsea abandoned the principles he demands, as Everton produced a second-half resurgence springing from the enterprise of left-back Leighton Baines. </span></p>
              <p><span>Ancelotti said: 'I'm disappointed, angry, not just because of the result, but because we played a poor second half. We are working to play a particular kind of football - and I don't understand why we changed this. We lost our ideas, we played long balls as I thought we were scared and afraid to play. I don't like this.' </span></p>
              <p><span>Ancelotti is at a loss to explain the disintegration of Chelsea's season. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Everton's belief and confidence on the ball ensured Chelsea became hesitant and reliant on striking the ball from one end to the other. And Everton manager David Moyes, smarting from his own discomfort with his team's slide towards the relegation zone, a condition exacerbated by last Saturday's 4-1 loss at home to West Brom, watched with growing pride as his men redeemed themselves at the home of the champions.</span></p>

              <p>anybody who watches chelsea play these last few weeks has to admit these are not EPL title winners material</p>
              <p>drogba and anelka are super off form.</p>
              <p>ramires does not belong to a squad of chelsea calibre.</p>
              <p>midfield is weak and unimaginative in attack.</p>
              <p>ivanovic cannot play as CB. defence is no longer rock solid. wont be surprised if they lose many more home games if they dont get a better CB, or use bruma for christ sakes.</p>
              <p>gone are the days chelsea used to play fast flowing football. now they tend to do slow build up play. their passing is no longer one touch but slow, lethargic and uninspired.</p>
              <p>ancelotti always uses the same squad, same strategy; all EPL opponents have managed to build good counters to it. too predictable</p>
              <p>only good news is lampard good chance returning next week. hes sort of a playmaker and pretty consistent.</p>

              <p>Honestly I thought Ivanovic played decently. At least better than a injuried Alex for now.</p>
              <p>Like I always say, Zhrikov and Ramires are money throw into the drains. I have no idea why Chelsea buy expensive players who have no experience in EPL nor the ability to adapt quickly.</p>
              <p>Malouda took 2 years to realise his form, so do we have to wait 2 years for Zhrikov and Ramires to hit their top form?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if Lampard is back, it is not as if it will be a easy win for Chelsea. Too much pressure on someone who is injuried so long.</p>
              <p>Yes Drogba and Anelka are both off form. Kalou is inconsistent and a eager Sturridge and Kakuta are kept on the bench.</p>
