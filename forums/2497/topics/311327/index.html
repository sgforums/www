              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>WILLIAM GALLAS last night questioned the mental strength of his Arsenal team-mates.</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The Gunners have surrendered their title lead to Manchester United and now skipper Gallas reckons they will have to win <strong>ALL</strong> their remaining games to become champions. They are also battling in the Champions League quarter-finals after dumping AC Milan but have now drawn their last <strong>FOUR</strong> domestic matches, including Middlesbrough on Saturday.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Gallas said: “I’ll tell you why there was a difference between the win in Milan and our next game. It was in the head. "It is human nature that after a huge game in Europe it is difficult to find the same level motivation for the following game. “In fact what we needed was an even higher level than we had in Milan. We all have to understand that. “And we have to understand it quickly because time is running out for us this season.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“We need to understand what it takes to become champions if we want that trophy. “If you look at the table now, I’m not saying we’re in trouble but we have lost our lead. “So from now on we just have to think about ourselves, not look at the table any more. And we have to win every game.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“We need to have a high level of motivation from now until the end of the season. “We have to give 200 per cent.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Martin Taylor will make his first appearance tomorrow night since his tackle broke Eduardo’s leg. Defender Taylor has been pencilled in to play for Birmingham’s reserves against Spurs after completing his three-match ban.</p>

              <p><strong>Robin van Persie has warned his Arsenal team-mates that their eye-catching football will mean nothing if they fail to win either the Premier League title or the Champions League.</strong></p>
              <p>"We have to win at least one trophy this season," he said. "At least. If we don't, then we would have played fantastic football for nothing. We need to win something because this is our moment. We all realise we are in a fantastic position and this has to be our year, and the years to come. We have something here."</p>
              <p>The club have earned plaudits for their free-flowing style while their victory at Milan, which set up a Champions League quarter-final against Liverpool, was hailed as one of their finest in recent times. But they were knocked from the top of the Premier League on Saturday, when Middlesbrough held them at the Emirates Stadium - their fourth successive league draw - and anxiety is beginning to creep in.</p>
              <p>Manchester United can move three points clear when they play Bolton Wanderers at Old Trafford tomorrow night, while Chelsea would draw level on points with Arsenal if they defeat Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. But Van Persie, whose season has been undermined by knee and thigh injuries, believes that his team can still win the title.</p>
              <p>"I'm not a daydreamer, I really think we can win it, and the Champions League, this season. Why not? We have the qualities. We have to stick together and believe in it, belief can take you very far. I still think we can do it and, hopefully, I can play a part in it."</p>
              <p>The frustration is almost audible in Van Persie as he assesses his personal contribution to the cause. Having scored seven goals in 11 games for Arsenal, the striker damaged his knee in October and was ruled out for two months. In his second game back he injured his thigh and when he rushed his return in early January the problem recurred and he was out for another two months.</p>
              <p>"I came back too early but it was all my fault - I was desperate to play," he said. "I had never had a muscle injury before so I didn't know what was normal. There was some pain but I thought perhaps it's nothing so I gave it a go. I was so disappointed about the whole situation and then that night I got really sick, because of the stress and everything, and I had a virus for five days.</p>
              <p>"For the first couple of days I didn't get out of bed. I was half-dead, I couldn't eat, it was really bad. Then the scan confirmed the muscle injury again."</p>
              <p>Van Persie's rehabilitation has been more paced this time, and he was eased back as a substitute at Wigan last weekend. He was a starter against Boro, but was withdrawn after an hour. "Although I can't play 90 minutes yet, I am getting there physically," he said. "It's just match fitness that I need. Mentally, I'm ready."</p>
