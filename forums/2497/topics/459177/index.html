              <p><strong>Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard believes Luis Suarez is being victimised by referees when the striker is seen going down in the penalty area.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Suarez, 25, has gained a reputation for simulation since joining Liverpool from Ajax for £23 million in January 2011, and Gerrard feels that stigma is now counting against his team-mate.</p>
              <p>The Uruguay international saw appeals for a penalty waved away by referee Mark Halsey after he went down under a challenge from Jonny Evans in the Reds' 2-1 loss to Manchester United on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Reflecting on that decision, Gerrard said in the <em>Mirror</em>: "I think even when Luis gets blatant penalties now, he's never going to get them. It's down to referees to not judge him. They have got to make their decisions based on what they see.</p>
              <p>"If it's not a penalty, they don't give him one. But if it's clear, give him it. It's only fair. He was booked last week at Sunderland when he went down in the box. This one was a penalty."</p>
              <p>Glen Johnson has echoed Gerrard's comments, expressing his belief that Suarez would not have been awarded a spot-kick had he been the man to be felled in the penalty area when Antonio Valencia won a spot-kick that decided last weekend's meeting at Anfield.</p>
              <p>"I almost guarantee that if you flipped the situation, if Luis was in the position of Valencia, he wouldn't get a penalty," he said.</p>
              <p>"We all know that. Reputations go in front of people at times and because Valencia is not someone who is known as a diver, he gets the decision."</p>

              <p>Not really. Since the start of the premier league and that is only 5 games old, i have seen him dived quite a number of times already. Some in the box and some outside it. As i said, there is not an honest Pool fan who will claim he isn't a habitual diver. He need to learn to stop those stimulation stuns before people will trust him again.</p>
              <p>Seriously speaking, there is not one PL player who goes down much more than him right now. So his reputation doesn't precedes him, cos he earned it with every match he plays.</p>
              <p>There are divers than there are habitual divers... There are those who goes down once in a while, but this guy goes down almost everytime the opportunity arises. Wasn't he yellow carded just last week for diving against Sunderland?</p>
              <p>So as the saying goes, you reap what you sow...</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Brendan Rodgers</span><span style="color: #000000;"> has issued a veiled warning that </span><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span>players could resort to unsporting means to win decisions having been denied "the rub of the green" from referees this season.</strong></p>
              <p>The Liverpool manager believes Luis Suárez has been refused legitimate penalties in the past two Premier League games, against Sunderland and Manchester United, and claims major decisions have gone against his team since the opening day of the season at West Bromwich Albion.</p>
              <p>Rodgers phoned Mike Riley, head of Professional Game Match Officials, to express his grievances on Thursday and afterwards made the stark admission that, in the absence of legitimate fouls, players will be tempted to exaggerate contact to sway referees in future.</p>
              <p>"I'm concerned that we've not had any sort of rub of the green from officials," Rodgers said. "We like to think we are a sporting team, I have always told my players to do the right thing, not to dive, to play fair. But the fairness we show, it seems the decisions pass us by because of it. There are so many decisions that have gone against us.</p>
              <p>"I spoke to Mike Riley and he admitted he expected me to call earlier. I didn't ring after the Manchester United game, I wanted to speak to the assessor first on that one, and he hasn't contacted us yet. But after the West Brom game, I had to call. Jordan Henderson got a horrendous tackle and the player wasn't even booked, while Andre Wisdom won the ball with a fair challenge and was booked. Things aren't going for us at all.</p>
              <p>"It would be a shame if players who respect the rules and managers who are asking players to stay on their feet and not dive are not getting the decisions because of it. I think it is important that referees understand that. It has been a criticism of the last few years of players going down too easy. It is not something we want to encourage but if you're not going to get decisions because of it players may do that."</p>
              <p>Steven Gerrard and Glen Johnson admitted Suárez's reputation for theatrics preceded him after an appeal for a penalty against United, following a tackle by Jonny Evans, was denied by the referee Mark Halsey on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Rodgers added: "Suárez has had a couple of good penalty appeals, he hasn't dived, they have been legitimate, and he's actually got booked. He went down at Sunderland and it looked a clear penalty and he ended up getting booked for it. Last weekend in the Manchester United game there was more contact in his case than there was in Antonio Valencia's and Valencia gets a penalty and we get nothing other than a hard-luck story.</p>
              <p>"I'm not sure [Suárez's reputation is influencing officials] – you'd need to ask the referees – but he is a wonderful talent and irrespective of whether he goes down, if it's a penalty, it's a penalty. What I have seen, he certainly doesn't ever look like he is going to get a decision and that is something which would bother me going forward."</p>

              <p>It's a simple tech and widely available for years... But this technology needs to be approved by Fifa before it can be used. Otherwise the league could face repercussions like its club getting ban from any match beyond it's shores. Or worse, the national team get ban from international tournaments.</p>
              <p>Anyway, Branda is beginning to sound like kenny, complaining about referee's decisions going against his team but fail to see his own side short-comings like putting the ball in the net.</p>
              <p>I pity their next opponent as the last time kenny complaint madly, they got the calls he wanted and the opponent suffered injusticed. Norwich better beware, you have been wared... lol.</p>

              <p><span><strong>It says much for the underwhelming nature of this afternoon that one of the most dramatic acts was saved until 30 minutes after the final whistle. <br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Asked for the second time about Luis Suarez’s apparent dive in the Stoke penalty area 15 minutes from time, visiting manager Tony Pulis invited the assembled media to draw their own conclusions and swept suddenly from the room rather like the diva we all know he isn’t.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>In the moments beforehand, however, Pulis had already said enough. </span></p>
              <p><span>‘I don’t know how many times he has fallen over but the one in the penalty box is an embarrassment and how he has not been booked I just don’t know. Retrospective  decisions are made on a Monday by the FA and they should be looking at this. Give him three games and he will stop falling over.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>‘He puts pressure on the referee and every time he goes down you’ve got 40,000 Liverpool fans getting after the ref and I don’t think that’s right.’ Pulis had a point. </span> </p>
              <div class="floatRHS art-ins sport"><span>On another difficult afternoon for Brendan Rodgers’ Liverpool, Suarez had given everything. Indeed he should have been awarded a penalty when Robert Huth shoved him in the back with a handful of minutes remaining.</span></div>

              <p><span>Who is ever going to award the Uruguayan anything when he falls over in the manner he did when challenged by Marc Wilson 10 minutes earlier? As acts of simulation go it wasn’t even well executed. It was so obvious that even some of the home supporters chuckled.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>‘I didn’t see it,’ said Rodgers afterwards. ‘Whatever Luis does will always be a problem, whether it’s with the media or refs, but I thought he was terrific today.’ <br></span></p>
              <p><span>One imagines that when Rodgers does see the incident on playback, he may speak to Suarez. The Liverpool manager has enough to contend with as he tries to get his team’s season off the ground.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Despite his team scoring five at Norwich a week earlier, Rodgers can’t find a Barclays Premier League win in front of the Kop and his team rarely looked like delivering one here. One step forward, two steps back.</span></p>
              <p><span>This was a poor game. Liverpool struck the frame of the goal four times and Stoke had six players booked. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>To suggest that Liverpool were unfortunate and Stoke too physical would not be accurate, though. The home team were no more deserving of three points than the visitors, while referee Lee Mason fell into the trap of believing that every time Pulis’s team make a tackle it had to be a foul.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Stoke were the happier side at  full time. Having enjoyed the better of the possession in the first  half-hour, they were gradually pushed back by Liverpool but looked fairly comfortable.</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>This unfamiliar-looking Liverpool team has some promising footballers in it. Joe Allen looks a good player, even in a modest team, but they rely too heavily on Steven Gerrard and Suarez for energy and drive. <br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Rodgers is still being hampered by Liverpool’s peculiar conclusion to the summer transfer window. His squad looks desperately thin and he will be glad to see January.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Stoke, on the other hand, continue to work to a clear strategy. They were very much in this game from the first moment to the last.</span></p>
              <p><span>Rodgers likes to encourage his players to pass the ball inside their own half but Stoke’s energetic pressing made that difficult and Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina twice had to save in the first half, from Charlie Adam and Michael Kightly, when his back four gave away possession. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>In the first half Liverpool found it hard to keep possession long enough to develop any momentum. Gerrard brought the best from Asmir Begovic in the Stoke goal in the 27th minute while Daniel Agger poked a chipped pass from Suso on to the outside of the far post two minutes later.</span></p>
              <p><span>It wasn’t until the  second half that Liverpool caused Stoke sustained problems. Twice full back Glen Johnson came close — once when working Begovic from distance and again when nudging a shot over the bar.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Occasionally, the game threatened to boil over. Liverpool were becoming agitated by what they thought was Stoke’s reliance on the physical, while Suarez’s dive did little for the atmosphere or his reputation. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Rodgers was sanguine. ‘Stoke are a team of big lads but we stood up to them,’ he said. ‘I have no complaints’<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Late in the game Raheem Sterling struck the post, Suarez hit the angle and Martin Skrtel hooked a shot across the face of the goal. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>It was a relatively rousing conclusion to an uninspiring afternoon.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Stoke winger Michael Kightly has waded into the diving debate by insisting that players like Luis Suarez are ruining the game.</strong></p>
              <p>The Uruguay international was <span style="color: #000000;">heavily criticised by Potters boss Tony Pulis</span><span style="color: #000000;"> after falling theatrically in </span><span style="color: #000000;">Sunday's goalless draw at Anfield</span><span style="color: #000000;">. </span></p>

              <p>But Kightly continued the attack saying: "When you get a little touch and he is screaming like he has broken his leg you do think 'is he hurt?'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"But nine times out of 10, he's not. It is something we are trying to get out of the game. Referees have to try to stamp down on it.</p>
              <p>"There is a difference between winning a penalty and just diving.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes players know a tackle is coming in and ride it and go down. That's good play, winning a penalty.</p>
              <p>"But sometimes, when you just dive with no touch at all, that's not good for the game."</p>

              <p class="storycopy">Suarez has spent the week under attack following his well-publicised dive against Stoke City. FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce branded such action “a little bit of cancer within the game” which in turn prompted the Uruguayan FA to write to FIFA president Sepp Blatter claiming his deputy had “encouraged and provoked hostility” towards their player.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">It is the latest rumpus to engulf Suarez, who is currently in Uruguay ahead of tonight’s high-profile World Cup qualifier with Argentina, and the forward appeared to accept that the responsibility for improving his image lies with him.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“As the years go by you realise what you have to correct,” he said. “I am 25 and there are things I must improve, like my attitude on the pitch.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“But that is how I have played since I was a kid. I try to correct it, but there are times when my anxiety makes me play that way. Everyone knows I gesture a lot, talk and protest, and those are things I must improve on.”</p>

              <p><span>The controversial Uruguay striker has attracted huge criticism for going down the penalty area in the stalemate at Anfield last Sunday.</span></p>
              <p><span>Pulis branded Suarez an 'embarrassment' while a host of other high-profile figures in the game have queued up to hammer the Reds frontman. </span></p>
              <div class="artSplitter"></div>
              <div class="artSplitter"><span>Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has leapt to his defence, however, insisting his man had been unfairly 'vilified' for his theatrics.</span></div>
              <div class="artSplitter"><br></div>
              <p><span>But Suarez, preparing for his country's World Cup qualifying double-header against Argentina and Bolivia, claims he is unaffected by the growing row and is focused purely on helping Liverpool improve on a poor start to the new campaign.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Any manager can say what he wants about me but it doesn’t affect me,' said Suarez.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I am not worried about what they say. Let them carry on talking.</span></p>
              <p><span>'In the meantime I will continue to play football and to concern myself with my team and with what I do. Nothing else matters.'</span></p>

              <p><span>Boyce, who is Great Britain’s representative on the FIFA board, said: ‘I have seen several incidents recently and I watched the latest Suarez incident two or three times. To me it is nothing less than a form of cheating.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘It is becoming a little bit of a cancer within the game and I believe if it is clear to everyone that it is simulation then that person is trying to cheat and they should be severely punished.'</span></p>

              <h3 class="padding-bottom-7">LUIS SUAREZ was under attack again last night after being branded “a cheat” by Arsenal’s Laurent Koscielny.</h3>
              <p>The French defender insists the Liverpool striker - <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/article4584192.ece"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">voted the Premier League's worst diver by Sun readers</span></span></a> - goes down incredibly easy.</p>
              <p>Koscielny said: “He is a cheat. He’s annoying to play. He grabs the shirt, gives some small kicks.</p>
              <p>“You always want to give some more but you have to be careful not to get a red card.</p>
              <p>“It’s a player who really likes to fall as soon as you touch him.”</p>
              <p>Suarez has left a trail of furious players and managers in his wake.</p>
              <p>Stoke boss Tony Pulis called him “an embarrassment” and demanded he be banned after appearing to dive during the teams’ 0-0 clash on October 7.</p>
              <p>And he was booked for diving during Liverpool’s 1-1 draw at Sunderland last month.</p>
              <p>But Anfield chief Brendan Rodgers said: “Luis hasn’t dived and yet he hasn’t got penalties and then he was booked for diving, while players have dived against us and got penalties for nothing.”</p>
              <p>Koscielny added: “On September 2 against Liverpool, we were in the penalty area, we jostled with each other a little, he fell.</p>
              <p>“He started talking to me in English, saying it was a penalty. I replied instantly but in French.”</p>

              <p><span>The Reds striker tried to win a penalty by going to ground too easily and FIFA vice president Jim Boyce was also quick to condemn him. <br></span></p>

              <p><span>The Liverpool manager stopped short of fining his striker but insisted he will not tolerate any behaviour that undermines the club. ‘It was wrong to say what he said,’ said Rodgers. ‘It was not acceptable. This club has always kept its matters in house and that’s what we will do. But diving is not something we advocate here.’</span></p>
              <p><span>The Northern Irishman spoke to Suarez (right) at the training ground after his admission that he dived to try to win a penalty against Stoke. Rodgers considered fining Suarez for his  ill-judged words on ESPN Argentina — a two-week sanction would have cost him £200,000 — but decided against it even though there was precedent when Everton manager David Moyes fined Phil Neville after he was booked for diving during the Merseyside derby in October.</span></p>
              <p><span>The FA are aware of Suarez’s comments but are unlikely to take the matter further.</span></p>

              <p style="text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;"><span>‘It’s something in the game that we are trying to clean up. My feeling as the manager of this club is that it (the dive) was wrong.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;"><span>‘I don’t think I’ve been put in a difficult position. I’ve only ever called it honestly. I have defended him when I feel it is right and will continue to do that. Luis and I have a strong relationship and he understands that and knows that. I don’t feel let down, I’ll just call it like it is. I said at the time it was the wrong thing to do. I need to protect the club and the group and if anything puts that in jeopardy I will deal with that. Luis is aware of my feelings.’</span></p>

              <div class="ins cleared xolcc bdrcc">
              <p><span>Liverpool forward Luis Suarez is back in the spotlight - and h</span><span>ere are some of the previous controversies surrounding the Uruguay forward.</span>..</p>
              <p><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">February 2007: </span>Suarez made his international debut against Colombia but was sent off in the final minutes after being shown a second yellow card for dissent.</span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">November 2007: </span>Joined Ajax from Uruguayan side Nacional but he was later suspended by the Dutch giants after a half-time dressing-room altercation with team-mate Albert Luque.</span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">July 2010:</span> During the 2010 World Cup quarter-finals, Suarez prevented Ghana's Dominic Adiyiah from scoring in the final minute with a deliberate handball on the line and was subsequently sent off. A penalty was awarded but missed by Asamoah Gyan and footage showed Suarez celebrating on the sidelines. Uruguay eventually went through to the last four on penalties.</span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">November 2010:</span> Suarez was handed a seven-match ban by the Dutch FA and fined by his club for biting PSV Eindhoven midfielder Otman Bakkal during an Eredivisie match.</span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">October 2011: </span>Following his move to Liverpool in January 2011, he was involved in a tackle with Everton's Jack Rodwell and went down with apparent minimal contact. Rodwell was then sent off.</span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">October 2011: </span>Suarez was alleged to have racially abused Manchester United's Patrice Evra during a Premier League match. Suarez was later found guilty by an independent regulatory commission and banned for eight matches and fined £40,000.</span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">December 2011:</span> Was seen making an offensive gesture towards Fulham fans. At this time he had already been charged by the Football Association over the racism incident, although not yet punished, but was handed a further one-match ban for the gesture.</span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">February 2012: </span>United and Liverpool met again at Old Trafford, but more controversy blew up as Suarez refused to shake Evra's hand before kick-off.</span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">October 2012: </span>Celebrated a goal against Everton by diving in front of Toffees boss David Moyes who had earlier claimed that 'divers' such as Suarez were putting fans off the English game.</span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">January 2013:</span> Handles the ball prior to scoring Liverpool's second goal in the FA Cup third-round tie at Mansfield.</span><span> </span></p>
