              <h2>The Robinho transfer soap opera has finally reached a conclusion
              after Real Madrid released an official statement announcing that they
              are willing to part company with their Brazilian superstar.</h2>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Chelsea</span><span lang="EN-GB">’s
              persistent pursuit of Robinho and the player’s constant plea to his
              present employers to be released have paid off after Real Madrid
              announced on their official website, <em>www.realmadrid.com</em> that they are prepared to let the Brazilian go if both parties can reach a unilateral contract resolution.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">The statement on the website reads:</span></p>
              <p><span lang="ES"><em>1. Real Madrid knows about the comments
              made by Robinho and deeply regrets them given the high personal and
              professional esteem that the Club has always held the player in, as he
              deserves.</em></span></p>
              <p><span lang="ES"><em>2. Real Madrid would never retain a
              player on the team against his wishes and would have no choice but to
              call for a unilateral resolution of the contract if the player willed
              it so.</em></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">It is believed that Robinho’s latest
              confession to EFE news agency yesterday, re-stating his desire to leave
              the Bernabéu for The Bridge has finally forced the Spanish champions to
              relinquish and accept defeat in the matter.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Chelsea chief executive, Peter Kenyon
              was reported to have flown in to the Spanish capital yesterday to make
              one final proposal for the 24 year old and the latest official
              statement from Madrid themselves should now pave the way for the Blues
              to complete the deal.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Real Madrid coach Bernd Schuster has given his clearest indication yet that he wants to keep Robinho at the Bernabeu.</strong></p>
              <p>He has included the wantaway winger in his 18-man squad for Sunday's Supercopa second leg against Valencia.<br><br>His inclusion comes despite the Chelsea target's declaration on Friday that he wanted to leave the club and Real's subsequent announcement that they would not stand in his way of the exit door.<br><br>But Schuster has clearly not given up the cause, saying: "I'm convinced that he will stay. Robinho has not told me he won't play tomorrow, he is an important player for us, and we've made that clear.<br><br>"I prefer to talk about tomorrow's game, there is no discussion about Robinho.</p>
              <p>His comments come after Madrid president Ramon Calderon confirmed the club would not keep any player against their will.<br><br>He wants Robinho to hand in a written transfer request if he wants to leave, but vowed that the club will not sell the player.<br><br>This could mean that Robinho would have to buy himself out of his contract to facilitate a move to Chelsea.<br><br>"No player will be kept here against their will. This does not mean that Madrid will not defend the interests of the club," Calderon told Spanish radio station Cadena Ser.<br><br>"I'm sure that Robinho has already weighed up the consequences of his decision and I'm sure that in the next few days he will give a letter to the club to announce that he wants to go. If he does not want to be here, he should leave as soon as possible."<br><br>But the president hinted Robinho would not necessarily have to pay the full £120million buyout fee.<br><br><strong>"I can tell you that Madrid are not going to transfer Robinho.

              <h1>Buy Out Your Contract, Calderon Tells Robinho</h1>
              <h2>In the latest twist in the Robinho-to-Chelsea saga, the Spanish champions have reportedly told the Brazilian that he should buy out his contract if he wants to swap the Bernabeu for Stamford Bridge.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/34273_news.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Having earlier announced that the club would not keep a player against his will, Ramon Calderon the Real Madrid president has now hinted that the forward should buy himself out of his contract and has urged Robinho to leave the club quickly if that is what he desires.</strong> </p>
              <p>Speaking to Cadena Ser, a Spanish radio station, he explained that the Brazilian must confirm to the club in writing that he wants to leave, as a first step. He said: “I'm sure that Robinho has already weighed up the consequences of his decision and I'm sure that in the next few days he will give a letter to the club to announce that he wants to go. If he does not want to be here, he should leave as soon as possible.”</p>
              <p>Both Robinho and the Chelsea manager Luiz Felipe Scolari have spoken of their desire for the Brazilian to move to West London however, Calderon explained that the club were not willing to sell the player, and as he is still under contract, he must buy himself out in order to leave.</p>
              <p>"I can tell you that Madrid are not going to transfer Robinho. We are not going to sell him. If he wants to go, then he should go now. Telling the press about it is not the right way to do things,” said Calderon before adding, “It's not necessarily that he will have to pay the £120m. He would end his contract but the courts will decide what he has to pay.”</p>
              <p>The Madrid president also indicated that the club were not willing to be dictated to by a want-away player who still has two years remaining on his deal. “Nobody is obliged to stay here, but we will defend our interests,” explained Calderon, “This is what we announced publicly on our webpage. He should leave as soon as possible, but he must accept the consequences of rescinding his contract when it has two years remaining. “</p>
              <p>Yet, despite this the Real Madrid president did confess that the club were keen to keep the 24-year old forward. “I hear that we wants to go, well he will have to give notice in writing,” said the Madrid president, “It's a lack of respect to the club, it's history and to the fans. We want Robinho to stay in Madrid.”</p>
              <p>Although Madrid clearly want to keep their player Calderon reiterated the fact that the wouldn’t prevent the Brazilian from moving on if that was what the player desires. However he did reveal he was hoping Robinho might just change his mind, he concluded: “If he says tomorrow that no, he doesn't want to go, that he was only raising the idea, then we can talk."</p>

              <h1>Madrid Tell Robinho To Pay €45m To Leave</h1>
              <h2>Robinho has been told that if he pays Real Madrid a staggering €45m to the club then he would be free to leave and complete his move to Chelsea this summer.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/33587_news.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The Brazilian star was told by the Spanish club's president, Ramón Calderón, that €45m was the price  that it would take for him to be able to rescind his contract, according to Spanish sports dailyMarca.<br></strong><br>Chelsea have made two hefty bids for Robinho and have seen both rejected, but in this manner they have finally been given a way to land the player without having to hold any negotiations.<br><br>With Madrid now keen to see the saga brought to a close, they have outlined exactly what is required in order for the troubled 24-year-old to leave the club.<br><br>A payment of €40m to cover the club's transfer valuation of him and a further €5m in compensation for the remaining two years on his contract at the Bernabéu would be required by Calderón’s men, athough it could be that an arbitration court sets the exact figure.<br><br>It is now down to whether Chelsea are willing to meet that amount and close the transfer via the back door in order to make Robinho their player. After stating that he wanted to spend many more seasons with Madrid earlier this summer, the former Santos playmaker quickly has become disillusioned with life in Spain over the past few weeks.<br><br>Madrid's refusal to meet his new wage demands was allied with rumours that he could be included as a makeweight in a deal to prise Cristiano Ronaldo to Manchester United, which annoyed him greatly. Furthermore he was banned from going to the Olympic Games with Brazil by the blancos, further fuelling his resentment.<br><br>Chelsea's interest then saw Robinho recognise that the Blues would pay him more than he was demanding at Madrid, and when Los Merengues refused to match those terms he made his mind up to leave.</p>

              <h1>Calderón: We Won't Imprison Robinho</h1>
              <h2>Revisiting the Robinho transfer situation, Real Madrid president Ramón Calderón has stated that, while Robinho won't be held at the Bernabéu against his will, he still deemed his recent comments to the press to be inappropriate...</h2>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Robinho said last week that he wished to depart for Chelsea, and while he bore Madrid no ill will he felt it was time to move on. Since then Calderón has come out swinging, saying that he will not be party to the sale of the Brazilian, and the only way that Robinho can leave will be if he pays a fee of around €45m to cover his wages and transfer valuation.<br></strong><br>Tonight he spoke to Telecinco to clarify his position. Calderón said, "His statements were unwelcome, but ultimately nobody will be at this club against their will.<br><br>"Another thing is that the president must defend the interests of the club." He appeared to backtrack slightly by declaring that the decision as to whether Robinho stays or goes "is down to the coach (Bernd Schuster) and the footballing manager (Pedja Mijatovic.)"<br><br>Robinho did not appear in the Supercopa for Real Madrid on Sunday evening.</p>
