              </div>
              <p>Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City all face the extraordinary
              prospect of being excluded from the Champions League and Europa League
              in two years because of the huge financial losses they continue to
              suffer.</p>
              <p>European football chiefs insist they will enforce a ban on those
              clubs unless they radically reduce their multi-million pound losses.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/27/article-1254277-02A7A2AC0000044D-101_468x286.jpg" alt="Steven Gerrard" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>In trouble: Liverpool's financial problems could see them fall foul of new UEFA regulations</em></p>
              <p>And though Manchester United will escape censure despite their
              £716million debt, because they are still making a profit at present,
              Liverpool's precarious financial state means they face a huge crisis if
              they wish to meet UEFA's tough new rules.</p>
              <p>The regulations
              will be published this summer in a bid to prevent further clubs going
              into financial meltdown, as Portsmouth have done this week, and will
              outlaw the kind of support that owners Roman Abramovich and Sheik
              Mansour have provided Chelsea and City.</p>
              <p>UEFA general
              secretary Gianni Infantino insists that the bodies set up to regulate
              the new rules will not baulk at throwing out clubs who cannot balance
              their books, whether they be Real Madrid or Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Infantino
              said: 'It is not our objective to exclude clubs, but if there are
              rules, it is our objective that those rules will be respected. For this
              reason we have established the club financial control panel, chaired by
              Jean Luc Dehaene, who is the former Prime Minister of Belgium. I don't
              think somebody like him would be afraid of anything.</p>
              <p>'They are
              independent to oversee the rules and pass any potential sanction to the
              disciplinary committee, which is also independent and which will decide
              the sanction.</p>
              <p>'But the rules will be the same for everyone and of course they will be enforced the same for everyone.'</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/27/article-1254277-0846244C000005DC-622_306x423.jpg" alt="Roman Abramovich" width="306" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Unable to help: Roman Abramovich</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>UEFA's drive for what they call financial fair play is the biggest
              shake-up of elite football since the formation of the Champions League
              in 1992 and represents a direct challenge to the Premier League's
              financial model, which has allowed excessive borrowing and rich
              benefactors to fund many clubs, factors which caused the demise of
              Portsmouth.</p>
              <p>The renewed threat from UEFA, who will finalise
              their new rules this summer, will wholly undermine Manchester City's
              plans to spend further millions this summer.</p>
              <p>City recorded
              a loss of £92.6m last year and that figure is likely to balloon still
              further after the extraordinarily expensive signings of Gareth Barry,
              Emmanuel Adebayor, Carlos Tevez, Joleon Lescott and Kolo Toure.</p>
              <p>UEFA
              are likely to demand that by the time the 2012 regulations come into
              force, City are on course to break even, which seems highly unlikely,
              unless they slash their wage bill and decline to enter the transfer
              market.</p>
              <p>Liverpool, too, are at huge risk given that last
              year they posted losses of £42m and had to pay £36.5m interest on their
              debts, which the Anfield club claim have now been reduced from £350m to
              £237m.</p>
              <p>UEFA will give clubs two years to put their accounts
              in order and will allow a transitional period in the first two years of
              the scheme, but they insist that clubs such as City and Liverpool
              cannot simply continue as they do now and expect to be cleared for
              competition.</p>

              <p>i think it is not about the debt, but the balance sheet at the end of year, but I do agree, MU should not be included if their debt is so big.</p>

              <p>I find it rather amazing why some people can't even understand a simple report / story like this one... Being rich or having rich owners has nothing to do with making a yearly financial loss... The rule being put in place is, clubs have to live within their means and not by financial assistance given from their rich owners... If a club spend more $$$ than what it makes over a financial year, then it's consider a loss, simple as that.</p>
              <p>UEFA is putting this new rule in place in order to ensure clubs doesn't get into financial trouble trying to compete with one another... </p>
              <p>This isn't new, this news have been going on for like a year now and it will only start to take effect in 3 to 4 yrs time... Therefore clubs still have time to get their act together... </p>
