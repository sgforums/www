              <p><br> </p>
              <p><strong>Emmanuel Adebayor welcomes his former club Arsenal back to Eastlands this Sunday, just over a year after he enraged their supporters by running the length of the field to celebrate scoring in Manchester City’s 4-2 win.</strong></p>
              <p>Adebayor sank to his knees to taunt the furious away fans, who started lobbing missiles at the man they once adored, and trying to storm the pitch. The ensuing scandal took some time to abate.</p>
              <p>While Roberto Mancini will be silently praying for better judgement this Sunday from the Togo striker, we look at five other players who who have had a torrid time when playing their old team.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption">Loyalties: Wayne Rooney angered Everton fans by kissing the United badge</p>
              </div>
              <p>England striker Rooney played for Everton's youth team from the age of 10, so when he transferred to Manchester United in 2004 after just two professional seasons, the fans turned on him.</p>
              <p>In October 2008, when United played at Goodison Park, the home fans jeered as Rooney was harshly booked for a foul on Mikel Arteta.</p>
              <p>He then pointed at the away fans and kissed his club badge, and was hurriedly substituted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 style="background-color: #00ffff;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Carlos Tevez: Manchester City - Manchester United <br></span></h2>
              <p>Tevez had a public altercation with former team-mate Gary Neville after moving across Manchester from United to City in July 2009.</p>
              <p>When the Argentinian striker equalised against United in January 2010, he made a 'be quiet' signal to Neville on the bench – and the defender responded with an obscene hand gesture.</p>
              <p>The row apparently came in response to Neville's earlier observations that United had been right to let Tevez go.</p>

              <p>The England midfielder has faced aggression from West Ham fans ever since leaving his father's club for London rivals Chelsea in 2001.</p>
              <p>In April 2009, after a radio phone-in presenter called him 'scum' over his personal life, Lampard hit back at Upton Park, with John Terry's backing.</p>

              <p>After smashing home the game's only goal he made a two-fisted salute at the fans, as they hurled objects back at him.</p>

              <h2 style="background-color: #ff6600;"><span style="background-color: #ff6600; color: #ffffff;">Luis Figo: Real Madrid - Barcelona</span><br></h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Figo was sold by Barcelona to bitter enemies Real Madrid in 2000.</p>
              <p>When the Portuguese midfielder returned to play Barca in November 2002, he endured jeers and whistles whenever he went near the ball.</p>
              <p>The home crowd lobbed golf balls and coins at him when he took corners and throw-ins - even throwing a pig's head at him - although Barcelona president Joan Gaspart claimed Figo was provoking the crowd by time-wasting.</p>

              <p>Left-back Cole made a dramatic exit from Arsenal for Chelsea in August 2006 for £5,000 extra per week, claiming that the Gunners had 'fed him to the sharks'.</p>
              <p>It prompted a heavy police presence when Arsenal visited Stamford Bridge that December, where 'Cashley' was booed and mocked, and fake Bank of Russia notes with his face on them were doled out.</p>
              <p>He was booked after 30 minutes for a challenge on Alexander Hleb.</p>
