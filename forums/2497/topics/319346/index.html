              <h2><img src="http://www.arsenalpies.tv/Steve%20Bould.JPG" alt="" width="271" height="400"></h2>
              <h2>Steve Bould - a key member of Arsenal's legendary back four of the
              1990s - is now manager of the Gunners' Under-18s, and says the emphasis
              is firmly on technique when it comes to developing the club's potential
              stars of the future.</h2>
              <p>Steve Bould emphasises tactics, positioning, attacking and defending
              when teaching his young charges as Arsenal's Under-18s manager - but
              insists that a instilling a strong technical foundation is the key to a
              player's development. <br> <br> Bould stressed to arsenal.com his belief that technical ability is not
              given enough attention in English football as a whole, but that it is a
              priority at Arsenal.<br> <br> “We are working more on the technical side of their game as they are
              younger and the more they get used to full-time training and the
              demands of the game, we add in defending and other aspects to their
              game," Bould explauned to the club's official website.<br> <br> “Tactics plays a big part but it is a next level. But, and it's
              something we actually get away from in this country, we try to make
              them technically better - we strive to do that constantly here, every
              day in fact.<br> <br> “In the middle of the season we [the Arsenal youngsters] were conceding
              a lot goals, but in truth we weren’t really working on a lot of
              defending. It wasn’t looked at in any great degree but I think that is
              right for their age. The tactical side of things gets added in as they
              get a little older and more technically efficient. That is the base we
              work from.”<br> <br> Looking ahead to next season, Bould revealed: “Now the season is over I
              have got my eye on next year and again I am looking down the age groups.<br> <br> “They are going to be a really young group next year, even younger than
              the last group that we had and perhaps, at this minute, not quite as
              technical.<br> <br> “So in terms of results it might be a bit more difficult but there are still some really talented lads within that group.<br> <br> “There are definite hopes that one or two can get themselves on that next rung of the ladder.”</p>
