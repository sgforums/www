And sources close to the Liverpool boss insist that the Spanish giants wanted Benitez before they turned their attention to Jose Mourinho.</strong><br><br>As the Anfield chief prepared his side for tomorrow's home Barclays Premiership game with Middlesbrough, it has become clear he rejected a huge offer from Madrid which could have virtually doubled his Anfield contract.<br><br>It is intriguing that the Benitez camp are happy to let it be known who was top of Madrid's wish list the week before their Champions League semi-final first leg against Mourinho's Chelsea. Madrid-born Benitez and chief executive Rick Parry have made no secret of the fact that the Anfield boss rejected an approach from Real last summer.<br><br>Now it has been confirmed that the club Benitez played for, coached the youngsters of and was assistant manager at, came back with another deal in the last few weeks. Benitez has previously been reluctant to be too specific about what has been going on behind the scenes. But he has now said: "I said no to Real when they offered me more money than I get here, even though there maybe were greater expectations.<br><br>"Madrid may be my town, but I am happy here and pleased with everything. We want to stay because of the new ideas and the new owners are very exciting.<br><br></div>

It has long been thought that Real wanted Benitez to replace Fabio Capello in the summer, with sources close to the Spaniard insisting he was their first choice before they turned their attention to Chelsea's Jose Mourinho. </strong><br><br>And as Benitez prepared his side for the clash with Middlesbrough, he suggested he had rejected a huge offer.

We want to stay because of the new ideas and the new owners are very exciting."<br><br>However Real have now issued a statement denying Benitez's claims. It read: "In regard to the statements attributed to current Liverpool coach Rafael BenÃ­tez...Real Madrid wish to deny any negotiations with said professional, or any other, concerning his possible incorporation to the Club next season.<br><br>"Real Madrid, as reiterated by the President and Board Directors, are counting on prestigious coach Fabio Capello, who still has two years remaining on his three-year contract."<br><br></div>

It's much more likely that Real Madrid is lying save themselves some face. Moreover, Benitez has no reason to want to come out and make Real look bad.</div>
