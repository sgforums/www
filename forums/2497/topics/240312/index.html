            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Chelsea defender Ashley Cole says The Blues' Carling Cup win over Arsenal was proof enough that his decision to move to Stamford Bridge was the right one.<br><br>Cole, who joined Chelsea from Arsenal in August last year, was part of the winning squad that beat The Gunners 2-1 in a dramatic Carling Cup final at The Millennium Stadium.<br><br>The on-pitch brawl may have been a strong talking point of the game, but Cole insists the win only underlined his decision to leave The Gunners for a move to Stamford Bridge.<br><br>"I feel a part of it at Chelsea now," Cole told Chelsea TV. "The fans seem to like me and I love the fans.<br><br>"I'm enjoying life, the manager's good and after six or seven months here I've already won a medal. That's why I came here."<br><br>Both clubs were handed misconduct charges in the aftermath of the final, which also saw Gunners pair Emmanuel Adebayor and Emmanuel Eboue both hit by three-match bans for their part in the incident.<br><br>Cole also admitted that it was a hard decision for him to leave Highbury, the club where he had spent his whole career, but he felt it was time to move on.<br><br>"Life moves on," he added. "I loved Highbury, I loved the fans but I've moved on.<br><br>"I've seen myself in a red shirt all my life and then I'm in a blue one. But it happens, players move from team to team and it doesn't mean I'm a traitor.<br><br>"For me it's been a move for the better."<br><br>Cole was also keen to heap praise on manager Jose Mourinho, adding: "He's a great manager.<br><br>"I didn't think he'd be so intense with the players and so focused on the welfare of players. He seems to be a very good manager and gets to know players on and off the pitch.<br><br>"If you're playing badly he'll tell you and you know if you don't improve you'll be off. He should keep on doing it because it seems to work."</span></div>
