              <p>I think it's confirmed. Spain will dominate world football the way brazil had done so before. They play with so much technique and flair, excellent ball control and incisive passing.</p>

              <p><strong>Spain's domination of the international football scene continued as their Under-21 side picked up the European Championship with a 2-0 win over Switzerland in Denmark. </strong> </p>
              <p>Having watched their senior side win the 2008 version, and follow it up with the 2010 World Cup, Spain's youngsters would have felt under pressure to deliver this summer, but were by far the best team in the tournament and walked away with the title after a headed goal from Ander Herrera and a stunning free-kick from Thiago. </p>
              <p>It only took five minutes for Spain to get their first chance as Javi Martinez showed his strength and pace in the middle of the park to exchange passes and release Adrian. However, the striker who had scored five goals already in the tournament, could not control the ball first time and was forced to cross to no-one in the centre as he was pushed wide. </p>
              <p>Spain quickly settled into their possession game and were faced with eleven Swiss players in front of them every time they got on the ball. </p>
              <p>As expected, most of Switzerland's attacking play went through the impressive Xherdan Shaqiri, but some tight marking by Herrera limited his early chances to a free-kick that was blasted well over the bar and a few runs that came to nothing. </p>
              <p>However, after half an hour, the first real chance came for Switzerland. A looping corner was not cleared and, after using his body to shield the ball well, Shaqiri stung the palms of Spain goalkeeper David de Gea with a shot that was arrowing into the top of the net. </p>
              <p>Not to be outdone, Spain's slick passing move almost opened the scoring at the other end, as Herrera flicked the ball on to Juan Mata, who slipped it sideways for Thiago to smash a shot just wide of the post. </p>
              <p>The former two then combined five minutes before the half for the game's first goal. Mata found space in the centre to clip the ball across to the left-back Didac, who curled a glorious cross onto the head of the advancing Herrera. Swiss goalkeeper Yann Sommer was left clutching thin air and then had to pick the ball out of the net for the first time this tournament. </p>
              <p>After the break, Admir Mehmedi and Innocent Emeghara combined well to create an opening that was quickly closed down by the backtracking Martinez and, with only eight minutes gone in the second half, Swiss coach Pierluigi Tami brought on Mario Gavranovic and Amir Abrashi for Emeghara and Fabian Frei. Playing a pressing game, the Swiss upped the tempo and looked to hurry the Spanish players when on the ball. </p>
              <p>Spain, though, continued to threaten and right-back Martin Montoya found space to take on Gaetano Berardi. As Montoya slipped the ball past his man, Berardi seemed to catch him from behind in the box, but the officials were unbowed despite pressure from the Spain bench. </p>
              <p>Only a few minutes later, Herrera's well weighted ball found Montoya again and Berardi hacked him down for the game's first yellow card. </p>
              <p>Martinez, key at both ends, sent Montoya free again down the right and his curling cross was headed away from Adrian at the last minute. And, from the resulting corner, Alberto Botia headed over from six yards out having lost his marker. </p>
              <p>Soon after, a clever free-kick from Shaqiri was helped on and found substitute Pajtim Kasami in a good position, but he was leaning back and saw his header fly over. Then Spain's aerial weakness was exploited again as Timm Klose got free and directed his header inches past the post. </p>
              <p>Switzerland were made to pay for not taking their chances. As they switched off with Thiago standing over an 81st minute free-kick, goalkeeper Sommer was caught off his line by the Barcelona midfielder as his incredible lob found the net from 35 yards. </p>
              <p>It was a moment befitting any final and the son of Brazilian World Cup winner Mazinho's goal was the last meaningful action of the game.</p>
