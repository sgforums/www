              <h2 id="post-30534" class="storytitle">Ten stories that haven’t been written yet, but you’ll read this summer</h2>
              <p>If there’s no football matches being played, then you have to fill the sports pages exclusively with transfer rumours.</p>
              <p>In the two months between now and the start of the 2009/10 season,
                  you’ll see plenty of formulaic guff written, and you’ll have to work
                  out to separate the news from the speculation. But for a bit of fun,
                  here are ten stories we predict you’ll see variants of in the papers
                  this summer - who knows how close we’ll be…</p>
              <p><strong>1) </strong><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo gets nasty about Manchester United</strong></p>
              <p>Look out for mysterious comments appearing in a Spanish/Portuguese/Brazilian outlet about how great United were <em>but </em>Alex Ferguson’s
                  tactics/the idea that Nani was my back-up/the weather in
                  Manchester/having to look at Wayne and Carlos every day was more than I
                  could bear. Despite the quotes being lifted from abroad, every tabloid
                  to claim it as a world exclusive.</p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>2) </strong><strong>A detailed analysis on Chelsea’s prospects for next season based on Ancelotti’s ability to answer questions in English during his first press conferences</strong></p>
              <p>“If Carlo can only describe the Champions League as ‘a beautiful
                  experience’ to an assembled group of journalists whose job it is to be
                  verbose and command language, then how can he possibly explain to
                  Didier Drogba to be strong and get into the box?”</p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>3) </strong><strong>The Joey Barton ‘looking to the future interview’</strong></p>
              <p>In which he admits to the mistakes he’s made in the past, and his
                  desire to get back to doing what he does best, which is playing
                  football. He’s totally committed to Newcastle, but will play for anyone.</p>
              <p><strong>4) </strong><strong>Arsene Wenger reaffirming Arsenal’s moral highground</strong></p>
              <p>“£80m for Ronaldo?” “Real Madrid
                  going crazy?” “Mountains of debt?” “Wealthier than wealthy benefactors
                  who can just go out and buy anyone?” “Well, it wouldn’t happen at
                  Arsenal - we’ll just scout and sign all the best 16 year-olds.”</p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>5) </strong><strong>Harry Redknapp being linked to three squads’ worth of players</strong></p>
              <p>The total list of players to include:</p>
              <p>(a) former players at Portsmouth
                  (b) former Spurs players (c) unknown foreigners (d) known foreigners on
                  the wrong side of 30 and (e) British starlets in the Championship</p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>6) The fruits of South American scouting</strong></p>
              <p>Count on reading about several South American wonderkids who’ve had great seasons on Football Manager 2009 who “Fergie sees as the next Ronaldo”</p>
              <p><strong>7) </strong><strong>Rafa Benitez to bemoan his limited resources before the start of the season.</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p>It’s best to get the excuses in early, as well as in a very polite
                  way point the blame for everything at the foot of Gilletts and Hick.<strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>8) </strong><strong>A barrage of “football’s gone mad” articles</strong></p>
              <p>Enough said. It hasn’t suddenly gone mad though, it’s just been
                  going slowly and predictably crazy for the best part of two decades.
                  The summer transfer dealings will only be the logical point on the
                  curve.<strong><br> </strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>9) On a similar theme, Sir </strong><strong>Alex Ferguson
                  complaining about the money in football which forced United’s hand in
                  the Ronaldo transfer, before signing a replacement for £40m+</strong></p>
              <p>And Wigan Chairman Dave Whelan to bemoan the sale of Luis Antonio Valencia before giving Roberto Martinez a giant transfer kitty which ruins Swansea’s squad.</p>
              <p><strong>10) “PREVIEW PULL-OUT 2009/10: The most exciting Premier League season in years”</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p>Because you wouldn’t buy our paper if we were predicting Manchester United’s cruise to a fourth Premiership title…</p>
