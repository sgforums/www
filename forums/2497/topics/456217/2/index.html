              <p>His passing complete rate is of course very good, but see game then you know liao, he dun take any risk in his passing which means very low threat to defence.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>he is better than Borini. Borini seem to be a dud buy at the moment. Allen is a good long term replacement for stevie G, but make no mistake, he is not in the same class as him when he was his age. I feel that Henderson should be given a chance to prove as he is still young. if he is no good, can always sell him later. as for stewart downing, seemed that liverpool paid over the price for him at 20m, maybe can give him a chance to shine, as he is still 27 and england international. Rodger ought to rid of Joe Cole, who is old and lack of pace, so as to take his wages off.</p></div>

              <p>Borini is a center striker, dunno why is he on the wing. Then opposite for Suarez.</p>
              <p>Allen is more like a replacement? partner for Lucas i think. Allen dun really go forward that much. Shelvy is more likely the replacement for Gerrard's role in the attacking midfield position. Henderson is always there but given no chance to show yet...</p>

              <p>yes of course. Alonso is a world cup and european cup winners too. Spanish players are technically better than UK players. UK players are traditionally brute players, hustle bustle, long balls for strikers to chase, corner kicks, free kicks style of play.</p>

              <p>It is all in the player attitude.</p>
              <p>If they want to play well, they can do it as what they have done against Man Utd.</p>
              <p>It is just that most of them have become complacent and forgot to work hard.</p>
              <p>All the top teams players gave 120% effort for every single match to push for a victory.</p>
              <p>Liverpool squad is pretty lean at the moment with all the injuries since the man utd match.</p>
              <p>Dun really expect Liverpool to win under such difficult circumstances.</p>
              <p>But, I guess they need some victory to boost their morale.</p>
              <p>There is so much a manager can do if the owner do not want to spend anymore.</p>
              <p>Even if Rafa comes back, he will also clash with Henry and leave the club eventually.</p>

              <p>Everton and Moyes has shown you don't need to spend alot to have a good fighting squad. Newcastle too in fact. The point is attitute. How the players react in a match can tell you their motivation levels, commitments and mental toughness. These are all instil by the manager if he is able to do it.</p>
              <p>Everton have proven that you don't need to spend really big pot of cash to be in the upper level in the league, in fact they may have surplus from players transfer almost every season.</p>

              <p><strong>Brendan Rodgers has warned the critics who suggest he overpaid for Joe Allen: “You’ll be calling him the bargain of the season in a few months”.</strong></p>
              <p>Unlike Rodgers, Newcastle legend Shearer does not think as highly of Allen's abilities. In a recent Match of the Day program, he criticised the Welsh midfielder for being too cautious in possession and urged him to attempt more attack-minded passes.</p>
              <p>Shearer's evaluation has angered Rodgers, Reds manager who brought Allen with him from former club Swansea in a £15million deal and <span style="color: #000000;">admitted he would have paid "many more millions" than that if required</span> - is staggered by that view.</p>
              <p>In response, he has branded Shearer a ‘so-called pundit’ who doesn’t understand the importance of keeping possession in the modern game.</p>
              <p>Liverpool chief Rodgers, who has drawn comparisons between Allen and Spanish great Xavi, blasted: “I saw something criticising Joe for not playing risk passes.</p>
              <p>“Unbelievable. Our so-called pundits who don’t know the dynamics of a team and how it functions. Joe will prove an absolute bargain.”</p>
              <p>“Joe’s role is to keep the ball. And that, in Britain, is a special talent. It is why Paul Scholes is still playing to his age. It is such a rare talent for a midfielder to rarely give the ball away.</p>
