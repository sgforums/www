              <p><strong>Liverpool believe their manager, Brendan Rodgers, is perfectly entitled to return to his old club Swansea City for players who wish to leave, despite the club's accusation that he has broken a promise with a bid for Joe Allen.</strong></p>
              </span>
              <div class="body ">
              <p>Swansea's position on the midfielder leaving had started to soften and it became clear last week that a £14m bid may be too good to refuse. But their chairman, Huw Jenkins, was infuriated yesterday when details of the release clause in Allen's contract – allowing him to leave if a £15m bid comes in from one of Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea or Arsenal – leaked out.</p>
              <p>Liverpool are understood to have bid £12.5m but yesterday's development has potential to cause friction when a likely second bid comes in for the player, who is expected to start Great Britain's match against Senegal at Old Trafford tonight. Swansea said yesterday evening that Liverpool had "expressed an interest" in Allen, despite "a written agreement with Liverpool not to approach any players within the 12-month period of former manager Brendan Rodgers leaving for Anfield."</p>
              <p>Their anger over the publication of release clause details was also obvious. "The club is not prepared to release any details on whether any formal bids have been made at this stage or details of Joe's contract, which are private and confidential," Swansea's statement said. "The club is extremely disappointed that speculation regarding certain aspects of his contract have been released to the media by parties outside the club. Fortunately the club is in a financial position where it does not need to sell any of its players."</p>
              <p>Swansea feel that Rodgers has an unfair advantage, in being privy to the minutiae of Allen's contract, and the view from South Wales last night was that the northern Irishman has lost the goodwill which he had retained after leaving the Liberty Stadium for Anfield. Rodgers' predecessor Roberto Martinez experienced the same backlash when he went back to take Jordi Gomez to Wigan Athletic. Rodgers said last week that if Allen was subject to bids from elsewhere he would make his move for the 22-year-old.</p>

              <p><strong>Swansea manager Michael Laudrup has warned Liverpool that Joe Allen will not be sold on the cheap.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="body ">
              <p>The saga over Allen's potential switch to join former Swans boss Brendan Rodgers at Anfield has rumbled on over recent weeks, and it is understood the Welsh club rejected an offer worth £12.5million last month.</p>
              <p>However, Allen's contract is believed to include a release clause of £15million.</p>
              <p>Laudrup is keen to hold onto the Wales international, and is set to have talks with the 22-year-old, who signed a four-year contract at the Liberty Stadium last summer, on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>But with Liverpool having paid big money to secure Jordan Henderson and Stewart Downing last summer, Laudrup has told the Merseyside club that Allen's value is on another level.</p>
              <p>"He is worth a lot of money because he's a good player," said Laudrup.</p>
              <p>"The manager knows him and knows if he wants to change the way Liverpool play he needs a player in the midfield like Joe Allen.</p>
              <p>"But he also knows he's very, very expensive. We saw they bought a couple of midfielders in the last few years for a lot of money, but with all due respect Joe is on a level above.</p>
              <p>"In my opinion, if one is worth £17m then Joe is worth more, perhaps over £20million. I'm talking as a football man not as a chairman but if the chairman asks my advice then I will tell him the same."</p>
              <p>It is understood the offer Swansea rejected last month included Jonjo Shelvey moving on a season-long loan to the Liberty.</p>
              <p>But Laudrup says he will not accept an offer that includes a player not considered first-choice at Anfield.</p>
              <p>When asked about the possibility of an exchange, he said: "If we could have (Luis) Suarez ... We have good players here and they have good players, but I can't see a player not in the starting 11 at Liverpool being in the starting 11 in our team.</p>
              <p>"They might want to do it because they can pay less money."</p>
              <p>While Allen continues to be linked with Liverpool, Laudrup is still looking to stregthen his squad, and the Dane says he is closing in on two more additions, believed to be a striker and a winger.</p>
              <p>"One is quite close but the other one is more difficult," he said.</p>
              <p>"But I hope he will be an important player for us. He is playing at quite a big club so it's not that easy. They are both offensive players. One can defend as well.</p>
              <p>"We are also working on other alternatives."</p>

              <p><span><strong>Joe Allen is set to be reunited with Brendan Rodgers after telling Swansea he wants to join Liverpool in a record-breaking move.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The 22-year-old midfielder was in the directors' box at Anfield to watch the Reds' Europa League 3-0 defeat of FC Gomel, which wrapped up a 4-0 aggregate success.</span></p>
              <p><span>And Rodgers said after the game: 'I hope to conclude the deal in the next 24 hours. It is imminent.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Allen has held meetings this week with chairman Huw Jenkins and new manager Michael Laudrup after returning from Olympic duty and spelled out his desire to leave for Anfield.</span></p>
              <p><span>Swansea are yet to receive a second written offer from Liverpool for the midfielder, who last month was the subject of a £12.5million bid from Anfield that also would have seen Jonjo Shelvey go to south Wales on a season-long loan.</span></p>
              <p><span>But Sportsmail understands Rodgers contacted Jenkins directly and indicated he is now willing to meet the £15m release clause in Allen's contract.</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Rodgers had agreed not to poach any Swansea players for 12 months upon leaving the club in June, but it is understood that clause would be made redundant should the Liverpool manager make an offer that meets the release fee in a player's contract.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The move, which is expected to be sealed in the coming days, will smash Swansea's previous record fee for the sale of a player - Jason Scotland's £2million move to Wigan in June 2009 - and Swansea have earmarked a large slice of the cash for Bolton midfielder Mark Davies.</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Brendan Rodgers has paid Joe Allen the ultimate compliment by declaring he would have paid 'many more millions' to sign him.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The Wales international became Rodgers’ second acquisition of the summer on Friday when he agreed a long-term contract at Anfield that will treble his wages after Swansea sanctioned his £15million sale.</span></p>
              <p><span>He is the one player Rodgers wanted to land more than any other before the start of the season and the Liverpool manager revealed the esteem in which he holds Allen, who has taken the number 24 shirt, when comparing his technique and ability to be akin to that of a Spaniard.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>Allen, who is match fit after playing for Team GB at the Olympic Games, could be handed an immediate Liverpool debut this weekend, when Rodgers’ side concluded their preparations for the new Barclays Premier League campaign against German team Bayer Leverkusen.  <br></span></p>
              <p><span>And Rodgers, who will now look to make further additions to his squad now to accompany Allen and £11million Italian striker Fabio Borini, believes the money Liverpool have paid for the young man from Carmarthenshire will prove to be astute business.</span></p>
              <p><span>'When you see this boy play you'd think he was a Spanish player, a real European player. I would have paid many more millions for this kid,’ enthused Rodgers, whose side have been handed a Europa League assignment against Hearts later this month.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘Joe is a unique player in that he's a British player who doesn't give the ball away. When he comes into this team, you will see the difference he can make.</span></p>
              <div class="artSplitter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/08/10/article-2186696-1477CCB9000005DC-862_634x434.jpg" alt="Done deal: Joe Allen watches Liverpool's Europa League tie on Thursday night" width="634" height="434">

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><span><strong>‘He's incredible on the ball; his intelligence for a 22-year-old is frightening. His game understanding is very, very good and he's in love with the football. He loves the ball.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>‘He wants the ball all the time – he has so much courage to get on the ball and play and I think he'll fit in really, really well with all the other clever players we already have here.’</span></p>
              <p><span>‘I'm excited about the prospect of Allen fitting in with our front four, because I think even at this early stage, their combination has been excellent.’<br></span></p>
              <p><span>The midfielder was at Anfield on Thursday night to watch the Reds' 3-0 Europa League third qualifying round second leg win over FC Gomel.</span></p>
              <div class="moduleHalf">
              <div class="sport item"><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/LiverpoolMail"></a><span>Allen told his new club's official website: 'I feel incredible.</span></div>
              </div>
              <p><span>'Everyone knows the history of this club, it's a massive club, and I'm delighted to have joined.</span></p>
              <p><span>'The passion that people here have for football is something I share and I want to be part of that.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>'I'm looking forward to being part of some great years ahead for Liverpool.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Rodgers added: 'I'm absolutely delighted Joe has made the decision to come with us on this journey.</span></p>
              <p><span>'He is a player whose profile will fit perfectly with the ideas of this group.</span></p>
              <p><span>'His ability to control and dominate the ball is an important ingredient in our attempt to gain success on the field.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Joe has had a fantastic education at Swansea and will now begin the next chapter in his exciting career, and I wish him all the very best in what I'm sure will be a long and distinguished career here at Liverpool.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Allen admitted the lure of working with Rodgers again was too much to resist.</span></p>
              <p><span>Having worked with the Northern Irishman in South Wales, he cannot wait to get started.</span></p>
              <p><span>'To join back up with him was definitely a big pull for me,' Allen said. 'Brendan is so passionate about his football. He works day in, day out to improve the team and everyone individually.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Everyone wants to work alongside someone who has that way about them.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>'One of his best things is his man management. He commands the respect of everyone.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>'I have a lot of faith that Brendan can bring success.<br></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>'I wanted to be part of this project and I've really got a good feeling this football club is going to go from strength to strength in the next couple of seasons.'</span></p>
              <p><span>The move completes a remarkable rise for Allen, who joined the Swansea academy as a nine-year-old.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Allen was part of Swansea's surge to the Premier League from League One, winning international honours at all levels along the way.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>He was one of the inspirations behind the club's return to the top flight, which earned him selection to the Great Britain Olympic squad.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Asked if he would have believed five years ago that this day would come, Allen replied: 'No, probably not.</span></p>
              <p><span>'It was hard to believe at first and very flattering to be linked to a top club like this. It shows you're doing something right, I guess.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>'I've always been ambitious and wanting to get to the top but getting there is a completely different thing. It's definitely hard to believe. It's been a quick rise for me.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Allen becomes Rodgers' second signing following the arrival of another former Swansea player, Fabio Borini, who scored the opener last night.</span></p>
              <p><span>And he believes that grounding in the lower league will help him in the months that lie ahead.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>'If you look at the amount of games I've played for someone my age, that would probably only happen at a team that's come through the leagues,' he said. 'That experience has been vital for me.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>'I blossomed and improved because of that and I wouldn't change it for the world.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>'I feel proud. I am really thrilled and looking forward to my time here.'<br></span></p>

              <p>The Anfield manager welcomed his £15million star signing to the club on Friday night by insisting Allen is so good that he could almost be mistaken for a Spaniard.</p>
              <p>Rodgers couldn't disguise his joy at securing the Wales international, admitting he would have paid even MORE for the 22 year old, because of the player's ability to get on the ball and dictate the tempo of the game.</p>
              <p>Allen completed his medical and - despite a late hitch at the Swansea end - eventually signed a £45,000-a-week contract, and immediately Rodgers was proclaiming he had brought a rising star to the club.</p>
              <p>"This boy, when you see him play you'd think he was a Spanish player, a real European player - I would have paid many more millions for this kid," the Kop boss enthused.</p>
              <p>"He has so much courage to get on the ball and play. he is in love with the football, he loves it, he wants it all the time. He's unique in that he is a British player who just does not give the ball away. You will see that and the difference he can make.</p>
              <p>"He's incredible on the ball, his work is very intelligent - for a 22-year-old it's frightening. His game understanding is very, very good and and I think he will fit in really, really well with all the other players we have here."</p>

              <p>He got rid of Adam, Carroll and Spearing.</p>

              <p>is Allen really that good from the past 3 matches he played?</p>
              <p>rodgers make wholesale changes too soon, like how AVB tried to implement changes too quickly and lost the dressing room.hmmm.....rodgers seem to go the way of AVB.........the predicament he is facing now, is all his own making, although it is not entirely his fault, but he is culpable. he sold kuyt, adams and released bellamy and send caroll on loan with no replacement and tried to trade stewart downing,  henderson, spearing.........I think he is fast losing the dressing room soon, with so  many discontented players at the dressing room. Joe Cole has no hope of playing in the team after his loan in france.</p>
