              <p><strong><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United</span> have defied the credit crunch crippling the nation by agreeing a British record £32million fee for striker Carlos Tevez. Sportsmail can reveal that the Barclays Premier League champions have reached a deal with Tevez's owners MSI that will turn his current Old Trafford loan deal into a permanent move within the next couple of months.</strong></p>
              <p>The incredible valuation shows that, even in the current harsh economic climate, English football continues to thrive at the very top level and it will eclipse the £30m paid by Chelsea to AC Milan for striker Andriy Shevchenko two summers ago.</p>
              <p>Tevez has been on loan at Old Trafford for 12 months and has been solely owned by Iranian businessman Kia Joorabchian's MSI company since they paid £2m to buy him out of a similar - and complicated - deal with West Ham last summer.</p>
              <p>United always knew that they would have to dig deep if they wanted to make Tevez's switch permanent but manager Sir Alex Ferguson has been so impressed with the 24-year-old's contribution during the club's double-winning season that he has implored chief executive David Gill to move swiftly.</p>
              <p>The club will now have to sort out a permanent contract with Tevez himself - in all likelihood for five years - before the transfer can be completed. 'We know what we have to do and what we have to pay. The only issue is that we would have to sort out a longterm contract for him. But it's not a problem. We can do it in September, October, November or December.</p>
              <p>'Sir Alex has explained it to him and he is very comfortable with it.' Tevez scored 14 goals for United last season and has quickly become a favourite with United fans who are impressed not only with his abilities but also his work-rate.</p>
              <p>The Argentina international will be offered an £80,000-a-week deal by United and has already indicated that he wants to stay. Tevez has been owned by MSI since Joorabchian bought him from Boca Juniors for £12m in 2004 and took him to Corinthians in Brazil. From there, he went on loan to West Ham in 2006.</p>
              <p>The £32m fee will not be paid up front by United. In reality, a sum of about £15m will be paid, with the rest following on in relation to Tevez's appearances and achievements. United's current record fee is the £29m paid to Leeds for defender Rio Ferdinand in 2002.</p>
