              <p>The Spanish striker began and ended the rout with goals in the 26th 
              and 77th minutes with Ryan Babel (28th) and Alberto Aquilani (32nd) 
              joining in before Pompey’s Nadhir Belhadj grabbed a consolation goal 
              with two minutes remaining.</p>
              <p>Reds boss Rafael Benitez was delighted with the showing and heaped 
              praise on a few key players including Aquilani, who scored his first 
              goal for the Reds since joining for £17million last summer.</p>
              <p>"We were expecting a good game, to play well and score goals. The most 
              important thing was to play with an offensive mentality and a lot of 
              quality,” Benitez told <em>ESPN</em>.</p>
              <p>"I think the team was doing well so the midfielders had a lot of 
              possession, so maybe it is easier for people to see (Aquilani).</p>
              <p>"I was very pleased for Ryan (Babel) as well, and Maxi (Rodriguez) did a
               good job."</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> goalkeeper Pepe Reina and midfielder Alberto Aquilani were delighted to
               get a vital win after defeating <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Portsmouth</span></abbr> 4-2 at Anfield on Monday night.</p>
              <p>Reina hailed his teammates for an incredible run where they netted three
               goals in seven minutes in the first half to set up the victory.</p>
              <p>"We knew that it was a must-win game. Fortunately we did it and 
              performed really well, hopefully we can do it again on Thursday,” he 
              told <em>ESPN</em>.</p>
              <p>"When the team is playing well we can score any time. For those 10 
              minutes we were incredible."</p>
              <p>Aquilani scored his first goal for the club which he admitted was a long
               time coming and targeted plenty more wins for the Reds this season.</p>
              <p>"I have waited a lot of time (for the goal) but I am very happy today 
              because we won the game,” the Italian added.</p>
              <p>"We need to win a lot of games to get in the top four and this is the 
              first."</p>

              <p>The Israeli tactician was unhappy with his side’s performance,

              <h1>Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard in another spat after swinging arm 
              fells Michael Brown in Portsmouth win<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Liverpool
               last night notched a much-needed win in their race for Champions 
              League qualification but the victory was overshadowed when Steven 
              Gerrard appeared to floor Portsmouth's
               Michael Brown with a swinging arm.</p>
              <p>The Reds' captain escaped
               a yellow card but was immediately substituted in the second half of the
               4-1 triumph at Anfield.</p>
              <p>Only a week ago Gerrard found himself in a similar situation for an
              alleged v-sign made at referee Andre Marriner in the defeat at Wigan.
               That went no further as the official said he had seen the incident at 
              the time and decided it did not warrant any action.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Liverpool's hero was Fernando Torres, who scored his 14th and
               15th goals in the Premier League this season, with Ryan Babel and 
              Alberto Aquilani - registering his first in English football - also on 
              target before Nadir Belhadj's late consolation.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/15/article-1258191-08BB37AF000005DC-758_634x437.jpg" alt="Steven Gerrard of Liverpool gestures as Michael Brown of 
              Portsmouth lies injured" width="634" height="437"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption">Flashpoint: Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard 
              gestures as Michael Brown of Portsmouth lies injured</p>
              <p>But Gerrard's apparent forearm to the back of Brown's neck was the 
              main talking point of the evening.</p>
              <p>Referee Stuart Attwell was 
              very close to the incident but took no
              action but it remains to be seen whether he will be asked to look at it
              again by the Football Association.  Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez is 
              confident, however, that Gerrard will escape retrospective action for 
              the clash.</p>
              <p>'I don't think so,' said the Spaniard when asked if he
               was worried about punishment against his captain. 'I haven't seen it 
              but I was asking and I think it was nothing.'</p>
              <p>Benitez also played 
              down the immediate substitution of Gerrard, adding: 'We were thinking of
               changing Torres, Glen Johnson and Gerrard and we did it.'</p>

              </div>
              <p>Portsmouth manager Avram Grant said he also did not see the incident 
              but felt Attwell should have spotted it.  </p>
              <p>'I
              didn't see it. I will speak with Michael Brown and then I will tell
              you,' he said. 'They told me the referee was four metres away from this
              so I think the referee needs to see from four metres what I didn't from
              40 metres,' he said. 'Personally I like Steven Gerrard. I think he is a
              good player and a fair player.'</p>
              <p>Benitez was more happy to talk 
              about his team's performance. 'It was a good game. We were trying to 
              play well for the fans and score goals,' he added.</p>
              <p>'It was an 
              important goal in an important week. It was really good for Aquilani and
               really good for the team. He has shown he has quality and he will have 
              more confidence and that is good.</p>
              <p>'We have seen a lot of 
              players playing well today and that is good for me because it gives me 
              more (selection) problems.'</p>
              <p>Grant refused to lay the blame on 
              goalkeeper Jamie Ashdown, whose clearance straight to Gerrard set up 
              Torres' first goal.</p>
              <p>'Jamie is a good goalkeeper. I will not
               speak about mistakes because it is part of the game,' he added.</p>
              <p>'We started the game okay, we played how we wanted to play and then 
              came the first goal and we lost our shape and they scored a second and 
              third goal in seven minutes and the game was finished.'</p>

              <p>fair enough, either Rio or Vidic can take on Torres one-on-one. tried last season, and got a 4-1 @OT.</p>
