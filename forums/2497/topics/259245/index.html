            <div class='col-md body'>Roberto Carlos snubs English clubs for FenerbahÃ§e<br><br>Roberto Carlos today signed for FenerbahÃ§e and revealed he had rejected offers from clubs in England and Italy before opting to join the Turkish champions. The 34-year-old Brazilian announced in March he would be leaving the BernabÃ©u at the end of the season, and has now accepted a new challenge with countryman Zico's side.<br><br>"I will play in Turkey at FenerbahÃ§e," Roberto Carlos confirmed. "They are the club who were most interested in signing me and I have been convinced of the plans which they want to develop. They have spoken with me a lot and what has been very important for me to take this decision is that Zico is their coach. I had other offers from teams in Italy, England and other countries, but FenerbahÃ§e want to grow as a club and I want to help them."<br><br>Roberto Carlos has spent more than a decade at Real Madrid since joining them from Italian side Internazionale in 1996. During that time he has won three league titles and three Champions League crowns with Madrid, while there could yet be more silverware on the way with his side on top of La Liga.<br>"I think that I am in good form and as I already said I want to leave the way open for Real Madrid so they can begin a new cycle and let other players come in," he added. "I thank Spain and Real Madrid. I will return to Spain because I feel connected to this country. In the future I want to coach and who knows if it will be at a Spanish team."<br></div>
