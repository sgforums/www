              <p><span><strong>Swansea defender Ashley Williams has launched an extraordinary attack on Luis Suarez, accusing the Liverpool forward of being a serial cheat and admitting he was so riled by him in one game last season that he wanted to 'knock him out'.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Writing in his book My Premier League Diary, published on Wednesday, Williams claims that Suarez dives more than any other player he has faced and slams his 'superior' manner on the pitch.</span> </p>
              <p><span>The comments were revealed on the eve of Liverpool's must-win Europa League match at home to Young Boys of Berne. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Swansea host Liverpool on Sunday, a fixture that marks Brendan Rodgers' first competitive return to the Liberty Stadium since leaving for Anfield in the summer. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Referring to Swansea's 0-0 draw with Liverpool at Anfield last November, Williams writes: 'Suarez has that aura about him that says, "I'm untouchable", and his manner and behaviour made me want to knock him out.</span></p>
              <p><span>'The manner in which he approached the game, with utter contempt for us all, means that he's streets ahead of any player I've truly disliked since we've been in the Premier League. </span></p>
              <p><span>'He dived more than any other player I've played against - it was so bad I was genuinely shocked. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>'Throughout the game, he just dived down and screamed at any given moment. A couple of times I'd hear the scream, see him writhing on the floor and for the life of me couldn't see where the contact could have been.' <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Although the book was sanctioned by Rodgers during his reign at Swansea, the Liverpool boss expressed surprise at the tone of what Williams had to say: 'When I saw the comments I was very surprised. I know Ash and he certainly wouldn't have meant it the way it came out. Everyone who comes up against Suarez will feel that his unpredictability and ability are incredible.' </span></p>

              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p><span>Rodgers also hailed the patience of Liverpool's owners following Roberto Di Matteo's sacking at Chelsea, as he described football management as now being a 'no-win business'. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>'I really respect that people have been lenient with me because this is a club that demands so much,' said Rodgers, who was told by principal owner John W Henry in July that he did not have to deliver a top-four spot this season.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I have also been respectful of how realistic people have been. Is it no-win being a manager? At some clubs. But this is a different club.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Michael Laudrup has cast doubt over whether Ashley Williams will shake hands with Luis Suarez tomorrow.</strong></p>
              <p>Swansea play host to Liverpool just four days after Williams launched a scathing attack on Suarez in his new book My Premier League Diary.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The Wales captain wrote he wanted to “knock out” Suarez </span>during last season’s game at Anfield and also accused him of diving.</p>
              <p>And Laudrup, Williams manager at Swansea, admits he is not sure if the pair will respect the pre-match Fair Play handshake.</p>
              <p>Laudrup said: “I really don’t know. Fair play is important for me, but again if two persons do not want to shake hands then I don’t know.”</p>
              <p>But Laudrup backed his commanding centre-back to keep his cool in the potentially heated atmosphere as Swansea welcome back former manager Brendan Rodgers to the Liberty Stadium for the first time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img title="Not bothered: Laudrup has not spoken to Williams about his book" src="http://i3.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article1364379.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/Swansea+City+v+Reading+-+Premier+League" alt="" width="615" height="409"></p>
              <p>Not bothered: Laudrup has not spoken to Williams about his book</p>
               
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Laudrup added: “I haven’t spoken to Ashley about what he said in the book.</strong></p>
              <p>“But I know him well enough and he’ll be focused on the game, whatever was said.</p>
              <p>“He will play by the book on Sunday! I don’t think he will lose his head because he won’t be sending any Christmas cards to Suarez.</p>
              <p>“But it’s nothing that will bother my sleep at night.</p>
              <p>“What is important for me is that I know I’ve got a player who I’m 100 per cent confident that he will do a great job, even if he plays against a player he doesn’t like because of certain things.”</p>
              <p>Swansea, who are one point and a place above Liverpool in 10th, are set to recall Ki Sung-Yueng in midfield with goal-scoring forward Michu expected to return up front to lead the line.</p>

              <p>Williams could get into trouble with the FA if he isn't seen to be trying to make up for this. Anyway, Rodgers have lesser to say considering he was the manager who  sanctioned his book in the first place...  I bet if he was still at Swansea, he would still be all for it... lol.</p>

              <p>Because of Suarez's behaviour since he join tem till recently before the Everton game was very poor sportsmanship.</p>
              <p>Pool fans obvious will find it hard to understand as they can't see his antics due to the jersey he have on. Most are blinded by it however there are still some who don't agree with his attitude too.</p>
              <p>But since that Everton game, his behaviour has improved a great deal. Ironically, so have his scoring abilities and form overall. Maybe it's something Rodgers has spoken to him about where Kenny was too shy to point out to him the whole of last season.</p>
              <p>Hope he don't return to his previous self again.</p>

              <p>Downing lousy piece of shit as usual....i dun even have to see the game to know he failed to have any impact on the game.</p>
              <p>Henderson a bit disappointing for me, but you cant play him and Allen together. Both of thems' favourite is to pass side ways. And you end up seeing the game of 2 teams making hundrsds of sideway passes and nothing came out of it.</p>
