            <div class='col-md body'>RAFA BENITEZ is planning a shock raid for Manchester UnitedÂ’s Gabriel Heinze.<br><br>Argentine left-back Heinze looked poised for a Â£5million move to Juventus. But Liverpool boss Benitez is set to hijack the deal.<br><br>Heinze, 29, said: Â“I know some clubs are interested in me. My head is with the Argentina team to play the Copa America.<br><br>Â“After that and a holiday, I will know better where I will play next season.Â”<br><br>Juve appeared to have beaten off Real Madrid, Barcelona and Milan to sign Heinze.<br><br>The defender is a cult figure at United and two years ago was voted the fansÂ’ player of the season.<br><br>He battled back from damaged knee ligaments to play a crucial part in last seasonÂ’s march to the title, skippering the side on the final day when they were presented with the trophy.<br><br>But his position at Old Trafford has remained in doubt and Patrice Evra is Alex FergusonÂ’s first choice left-back.<br><br>Clearly Fergie would prefer to sell to a foreign side, rather than a major domestic rival.<br><br>But if Benitez is prepared to cough up the cash, he has every chance of pulling off another coup after agreeing a Â£27m club-record swoop for Atletico Madrid hitman Fernando Torres.<br><br>It is one area where Liverpool have looked decidedly weak at times, with John Arne Riise not the best defensive left-back.<br><br>Fabio Aurelio, Alvaro Arbeloa, Stephen Warnock and Djimi Traore have all been used there during BenitezÂ’ reign.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Benitez To Snap Up Â£5m Heinze - Report<br><br>The Sun report that Rafa Benitez could move swiftly to snap up Gabriel Heinze from under the noses of Barcelona and Real Madrid.<br><br>Juventus and Milan have also been linked with the tough-tackling multi-purpose defender, though neither have made an official approoach just yet.<br><br>The player himself has made no secret of his plan to think about a move away from Old Trafford after the Copa America.<br><br>"I know some clubs are interested in me," he said. "My head is with the Argentina team to play the Copa America.<br><br>"After that and a holiday, I will know better where I will play next season."<br><br>According to The Sun, Liverpool - who are finally making some moves in the transfer market - are the ones looking to wrap up this deal without much ado, and willing to offer Â£5million for a quick resolution.<br><br>Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus are waiting to see how the Chivu and Milito sagas end before moving for Heinze, and the Reds could make the most of that.<br><br>The move could see John Arne Riise promoted into a permanent left-sided midfield role, with Rafa not confident about his defensive abilities. It could also bring about Fabio Aurelio's exit.<br><br>It remains to be seen, though, whether Sir Alex Ferguson will sell Heinze to another Premiership club, let alone to potential title rivals.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let Heinze go lah, I don't see whats the big deal about Heinze at all... The guy is already coming to 30, if they can get $5m for him why not? Its not as tho he was their best defender... They bought Evra and Vidic for only $6m and $7m... and they are still only in their mid 20s. If Heinze can get them as what is reported, it won't be a lost to lose him cos last season he wasn't that good anymore... He is much slower than when he first came. After that season long injury, he never seem like the old Heinze we knew that is why he lost his place in the first team.<br><br>If the $5m is really on the table, i say grab it before its gone and use the money to get someone else younger like that Reading guy who played for England recently...</div>
