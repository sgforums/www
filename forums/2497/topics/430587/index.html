              <p>West Ham's owners, especially this Sullivan fellow, are misers la. Now they pushed all the blame to Grant and mentioned something along the line "Hiring Grant is the biggest mistake". Blah Blah Blah. Zola screwed up the team last season which almost caused West Ham to relegate and the last person they should hire is the cup specialist who actually caused Portsmouth to relegate.</p>
              <p>Probably the young ones like Hines, Noble, Spector will stay to rebuild the team. The rest would probably leave especially Parker and Green.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Scott Parker has emerged as a target for Arsenal with Arsene Wenger set to buck his trend of signing young players.</strong></p>
              <p>Wenger only signs players in their thirties on rare occasions and usually only on short-term deals, but he sees Parker as a potential key player for the club.</p>
              <p>Parker, 30, will be at the forefront of a fire sale at West Ham after the club's relegation, with fellow England internationals Robert Green and Carlton Cole set for the exit door along with star striker Demba Ba and a whole host of high earners.</p>
              <p>Despite West Ham's relegation and Parker's age the England midfielder is expected to command a fee of at least £5million, but Wenger is determined to bolster his midfield after another trophy-less campaign.</p>
              <p>A move to The Emirates would see Parker play in a midfield trio alongside his England partner Jack Wilshere and Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas - if Barcelona fail to lure the Spaniard away.</p>

              <p><strong>To make way for Parker's arrival both Denilson and Tomas Rosicky are expected to leave - with the future of Alex Song also in doubt. </strong></p>
              <p>Arsenal's north London rivals Tottenham had a £7m bid for Parker rejected in January but their interest has cooled since the emergence of Sandro.</p>

              <p>The owners were the problem... They undermined his authority in the squad by getting his fellow, that fellow to come in to replace the manager half way into the season... Like this where the players will really respect him?</p>

              </div>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Martin O'Neill is expected to reject West Ham’s advances for the second time this year if the Upton Park board offer him the job that no leading manager seems to want.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Ulsterman is top of the club’s short list after their dismissal of Avram Grant on Sunday and they will try to persuade him to accept the task of guiding them back to the Barclays Premier League. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But Sportsmail understands that O’Neill has the same concerns about West Ham as he had when he declined the invitation to succeed Grant in January and sources close to the former Aston Villa and Celtic manager expect him to turn down any new offer.</span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">O’Neill is more focused on settling his dispute with Villa over his departure last August. A Premier League managers’ arbitration panel is due to hear the case this week. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Sources close to O’Neill point out that if he was not keen on West Ham when they were a Premier League club, he will be even less so now.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">However, Cardiff manager Dave Jones may enter the picture at Upton Park now he has failed to gain promotion in six seasons with the Welsh club.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Cardiff fans chanted, ‘You’re getting sacked in the morning’, after Reading’s third goal in the Championship play-off defeat.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Jones said: ‘I will take stock of my position  and decide whether I want to continue. It’s about what the owners want, what I want and what is best for this football club.’</span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>The problem facing West Ham co-owners David Sullivan and David Gold is that other leading candidates have publicly declared a lack of interest in taking the job. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Former England manager Steve McClaren has said he has no desire to succeed Grant and Gus Poyet said he would be remaining with the Brighton side he has just guided to promotion. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘No chance,’ said Poyet, his response apparently motivated by the way West Ham treated his close friend Gianfranco Zola.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The West Ham hierarchy are still expected to make an approach to O’Neill in the hope that they can persuade him to accept the challenge. Sullivan conceded that it had been a mistake to appoint Grant, who is now considering whether to return to Chelsea in some capacity.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But Grant’s agent, Pini Zahavi, claimed that the board did not make enough money available for transfers, particularly to bring in defensive reinforcements.</span></p>

              <p>No offence, but it will be a stressful post for the new Manager to bring West Ham back to EPL. Established Managers probably do not want to risk their reputation to work at a lower league.</p>
              <p>But I believe they should be able to bounce back like Newcastle with their younger generation players.</p>

              <p>Boss Pulis will target the West Ham striker in a bid to beef up his side ahead of their Europa League campaign next season.</p>
              <p>Cole looks certain to leave the relegated Hammers and will not be short of offers, with Newcastle also ready to make a substantial bid.</p>
              <p>The 27-year-old England striker has been on the Potters' radar ever since they were promoted to the Premier League in 2008.</p>
              <p>Potters chief Pulis is also a fan of West Ham midfield duo Mark Noble and Jack Collison.</p>
              <p>Pulis said: "We need to bring in more quality over the summer because we want to give it our best shot in Europe.</p>
              <p>"The chairman will make sure everything is sensible but we want to bring in better players.</p>
              <p>"Our aim is to keep progressing. Hopefully, we can add to what we've already got."</p>
              <p>Stoke want to increase their options up front after Achilles injuries to Ricardo Fuller and Mama Sidibe left them short of firepower in the final months of the season.</p>
              <p>Pulis will also make a decision on the future of John Carew next week, after the Norway international impressed on loan following a January switch from Aston Villa.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Harry Redknapp will hold talks with chairman Daniel Levy over Tottenham's summer transfer plans next week - and a move for Footballer of the Year Scott Parker will be top of his agenda.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Redknapp confirmed he wants to bring the West Ham midfielder to White Hart Lane but knows he faces competition from Arsenal and Liverpool.</span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Spurs manager also revealed that he watched Lille's highly rated forward Eden Hazard this week, while Didier Drogba, Emmanuel Adebayor and Pablo Osvaldo have all been mentioned as possible targets to spearhead the attempt to get back into the top four. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">His list includes goalkeepers Maarten Stekelenburg, Ben Foster and Shay Given, who have all been considered as replacements for the error-prone Heurelho Gomes. Redknapp said: 'I'm sure people are going to be interested in Scott. I know a couple of other clubs are interested, big clubs, but we'll wait and see.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Which clubs? Arsenal and Liverpool. I think they're big clubs in for him, so it will be hard.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The future of Jermain Defoe could be a hot topic when Redknapp sits down with Levy. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Spurs boss, whose team host Birmingham tomorrow, blasted Defoe yesterday after the England striker again spoke publicly about his frustration at the lack of first-team football.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'He hasn't played much this year because he hasn't played well enough to play regularly,' said Redknapp. 'No-one has more faith in him than me. I signed him at West Ham as a kid, then at Portsmouth and brought him back to Tottenham.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>'He's a fantastic player in my opinion but his form this year has not been anywhere near where it's been in the past.' </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Sportsmail can also reveal Tottenham have moved to sign Porto forward Falcao as they fear Manchester United may try to poach Luka Modric this summer.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Modric has been in dazzling form all year and Sir Alex Ferguson is known to be an admirer. The United boss picked the Croat as his choice for Player of the Year.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But Redknapp knows he will have to sell players before he can spend, with Sebastien Bassong, Jermaine Jenas, Jonathan Woodgate, David Bentley, Niko Kranjcar, Roman Pavlyuchenko and Robbie Keane candidates to move on. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Redknapp confirmed: 'Probably half a dozen will leave. They're all good players and no problem, but they want to play.'</span></p>
