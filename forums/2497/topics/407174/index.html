              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> midfielder Darron Gibson admits he risked being attacked by <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> fans as he celebrated Paul Scholes' injury-time winner at Eastlands last season.</p>
              <p>Speaking in <em>The Story of Our Season: The Official <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> Players’ Diary 2009-10</em>, Gibson recalled the dramatic derby finale.</p>
              <p>"I was going mad on the bench near the City fans," he said.</p>
              <p>"They weren’t happy and there were nearly a few punches thrown in there.
               When we scored a few of them leaned over to try and get to us, but 
              there's nothing you can do about that. To be honest, I wouldn't have 
              minded being punched, so long as we won!"</p>
              <p>United captain Gary Neville also said: "There was a lot riding on that game in the week leading up to it.</p>
              <p>"You could tell at the start of the game that it was carnival time for 
              them. There was a feeling around the place that it was their day, that 
              they were going to win, that they were going to get fourth place and we 
              were going to end up losing the championship.</p>
              <p>"What they weren't reckoning on was that they were playing United, and 
              it doesn't quite happen that way. They were up against 11 players who 
              were determined to make sure we won the game.</p>
              <p>"Paul Scholes was outstanding on the day and for him to pop up with the 
              winner was unbelievable. For me, it was the outstanding moment of the 
              season. We knew we were out of the league if we didn’t win the game.</p>
              <p>"We were the ones trying to win the game, whereas City were bringing 
              defensive midfielders on for forwards. Three times we’ve shown them that
               we go to the last second of every match.</p>
              <p>"The mentality of the team is always to try to win every match, so late 
              winners aren’t luck. We got the break we needed with a great cross and a
               great header.</p>
              <p>"It’s the hardest way to win, of course, but the best way. If you can 
              score in the last minute, there’s no comeback – they just don’t have the
               time."</p>
              <p>Neville celebrated by planting a congratulatory kiss on match-winner Scholes’ lips.</p>
              <p>"Nev did get some stick for that, but poor Scholesy couldn't do much, could he?" confirmed John O'Shea.</p>
              <p>"He was the poor victim who tried to push him off, but it was too late. 
              That’s Gaz for you. I don’t think it was for his benefit, mind you. I 
              think it was to make the City fans feel that little bit angrier!"</p>
