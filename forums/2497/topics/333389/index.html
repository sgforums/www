              <h1>CITY £100m SPREE</h1>
              <h2>Mark Hughes targets Kaka, Buffon and Torres</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img title="MARK HUGHES - money" src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00011/hughes_200x300_11208a.jpg" alt="MARK HUGHES - money"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>MARK HUGHES will embark on an epic £100million spending spree in January with Kaka and Gigi Buffon in his sights. </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Manchester City have alerted the most powerful agents in the world and told them to line up only the cream for Hughes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He flies to Abu Dhabi next month for a meeting with City’s owners but has already been told he is free to smash the world transfer record to sign the likes of Buffon, Kaka and Liverpool striker Fernando Torres.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Brazilian star Kaka was a target for Chelsea during the summer considered a move to England.</p>
              <p>But it would take an extraordinary bid in excess of £50m for AC Milan to consider losing the World Player of the Year — and City would only need to pay half that for Buffon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img title="GIANLUIGI BUFFON - target" src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00011/buffon_200x300_11209a.jpg" alt="GIANLUIGI BUFFON - target"> <img title="KAKA - target" src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00011/kaka_200x300_11207a.jpg" alt="KAKA - target"></p>
              <p><em>Italy's No 1 Buffon &amp;</em> <em>Kaka are targets</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Spotlight</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Juventus No 1 is unsettled and Italian sources claim he is desperate for a new challenge. Hughes knows he needs a top-class keeper in order to let England Under-21 star Joe Hart develop out of the spotlight.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hughes has also been tempted by the news Torres has yet to renegotiate his deal at Liverpool. The Spanish striker took a pay CUT when he moved to Anfield on the proviso that talks began on a new deal once he had proved his worth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>His advisors are looking for a £40,000-a-week leap to £120,000 but there is no sit-down in sight.</p>

              <p>why not man -.-<br>as long as BIG MONEY COMES IN, and big players slowly comes in too, im sure one day man city will rise, just look at how roman change chelsea, chelsea was worse than man city before roman comes in, but after spending for seasons and stuffs, look where chelsea is today. if man city can really offer 50m-60m for kaka, i don see the reason ac milan wont sell, if wages is like £200,000/week, kaka willl surely sign.</p>

              <p><br>Nobody want to be their coach? So many were interested to be their coach before Scolari was appointed... <span style="color: #000000;">Roberto Mancini, Frank Rijkaard, Mark Hughes all would have taken the job if they were asked too... Even Scolari who never like to announce that he would be taking over another team while still managing another during a tournament was willing to bend over this time... </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The prestige of managing a big 4 in the premiership and not to forget the record salary that come with the job... On average, managers earn around $1m to $3.5m a year... with the better ones like Fergie and Wenger around $5m. Mark Hughes is reported to be on $2.5m a year at City... So $6 to $7 million pounds a year for Scolari is alot compare to what he was getting previously of around $1.5m a year with the Portuguese FA. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">But of course there are those like Carlo Ancelotti and </span><span style="color: #000000;">Klinsmann also lah... But that doesn't mean others don't want it mah, they just have different plans.</span></p>

              <p>why not man -.-<br>as long as BIG MONEY COMES IN, and big players slowly comes in too, im sure one day man city will rise, just look at how roman change chelsea, chelsea was worse than man city before roman comes in, but after spending for seasons and stuffs, look where chelsea is today. if man city can really offer 50m-60m for kaka, i don see the reason ac milan wont sell, if wages is like £200,000/week, kaka willl surely sign.</p>

              <p>MC is just a few steps away from challenging the big 4. Imagine them getting in a few solid players, maybe not world-class, but good, hardworking players, and I bet they are going to be in the top 4's face. Attacking wise, they have enough talent just that some of their players are a bit old so it is natural for Hughes to want to get fresh, younger legs in. He did not have the luxury like Jose to come in and have a big budget to work with, but he does have his credentials.I would hope the Hughes also pour money into youth development, so City has a legacy to challenge and not just bang on one season wonders.</p>
              <p>At the moment, city is not in champions league and maybe not in the top4 this season, but who knows next season? I bet their aim this season is to at least get european qualification for next season and use that to recruit better players and then challenge the big four.They are not scary now, but with their owners' purse, their potential is frightening. Imagine this, Roman has 20B, while city's owner has 500B just to invest. And with 200-400% jump in salary, why would any players not bite? Club loyalty is one thing, but we all know life in football is just a tackle away.</p>
