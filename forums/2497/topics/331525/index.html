              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">A WAR of words has erupted between UEFA president Michel Platini and Arsene Wenger. The head of European football’s governing body has slammed the Arsenal manager’s calls for video technology to be introduced to rule on questionable refereeing decisions. </h2>
              <p class="article">Platini, who is strongly opposed to the idea, said: "It would make me happy that Arsene Wenger never sees it happen." </p>
              <p class="article">The UEFA supremo also accused Wenger of caring more about the business side of the game rather than what happens on the pitch. He added: "I like to talk about football, him (Wenger) about business." </p>
              <p class="article">Platini has even suggested Wenger has a problem with teams from weaker footballing nations competing in the Champions League. When asked about his thoughts on Romanian side CFR Cluj's unexpected victory over Roma last week, the Frenchman said: “That is what makes football so great. “It is what people like Wenger do not want, little clubs beating the big clubs, because they want their business." </p>
              <p class="article">But Wenger has hit back at his countryman and called on Platini to reconsider his opinions. The Gunners boss said: "I am stunned by the aggressive content of Platini's words. "I am effectively a supporter of video assistance for referees, like all coaches, and I believe UEFA have an important role to play in this. </p>
              <p class="article">"I am for sporting justice and UEFA must be the guarantor of it. "I am a supporter of good management of clubs, for financial equilibrium. "And UEFA must equally support this idea. I am fighting for the future of the game and of football. "I don't see why UEFA should take umbrage at ideas that are different from their own."</p>

              <p><strong>Uefa president Michel Platini has admitted having been 'too harsh'
              on Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger when declaring his fellow countryman was
              more interested in business than football. </strong></p>
              <p>But the former playmaker has slammed the
              Alsatian for ‘picking’ kids from smaller clubs, and declared he plans
              to create new rules in order to stop a system that The Gunners use so
              well.</p>
              <p>“I have been too harsh with Arsene,” Platini
              told Sud-Ouest. “I got told off by my daddy, who made him (Wenger)
              start his career (at Nancy).</p>
              <p>“But when I speak about business, I mean I do not like him seeking 13 or 14-year-old kids. I cannot stand it.</p>
              <p>“My plan is to work with the football family
              to fight for the kids’ education in order that the Arsenal people do
              not come and pick 13-year-old Bordeaux kids for example.”</p>

              <div id="articlebody">
              <p>Wenger was left "stunned" by his fellow Frenchman's comments, while the League Managers' Association leapt to the defence of the Gunners boss.</p>
              <p>And now Platini has admitted he might have been overly critical of Wenger, telling <em>Sud Ouest</em>: "I was too hard on Arsene.</p>
              <p>"My dad [Aldo Platini] told me off. He was the one who gave him [Wenger] his break (at Nancy)."</p>
              <p>However, Platini went on to express his dislike for clubs that sign emerging talent at a young age - a policy regularly adoted by Wenger at Arsenal.</p>
              <p>He added: "When I talk about business, what I am talking about is recruiting players when they are 13 or 14. I can't stand it."</p>
