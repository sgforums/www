              <h1>Telegraph Fantasy Football: Jose Mourinho selects his 'Special Ones'</h1>
              <h2>Jose Mourinho has made no secret of his desire to snap up Frank Lampard, but he has rejected one chance to sign his former Chelsea star – when he picked his team for next season's Telegraph Fantasy Football league.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/00780/mourinho3_780974c.jpg" alt="Showing the way: Jose Mourinho won the Premier League twice with Chelsea, now he's set his sights on the Telegraph Fantasy Football title - Jose Mourinho's Telegraph Fantasy Football selection" width="460" height="288"></p>
              <p><em>Jose Mourinho won the Premier League twice with Chelsea, now he's set his sights on the Telegraph Fantasy Football title.</em></p>
              <p><em></em> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The 'Special One', who is now the manager of Inter Milan, has joined up to pit his football wits against Alan Hansen, other Telegraph pundits and the thousands of players who </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>compete for a share of our £1.1million prize fund</strong></span></span><strong>.</strong></p>
              <p>Mourinho has snapped up three of his former Chelsea players: Ricardo Carvalho, Michael Essien and William Gallas. He opted not to select a single Manchester United player, but despite all his contentious battles with Liverpool, he did pick Steven Gerrard.</p>
              <p>The 45-year-old Portuguese, who won two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and two League Cup trophies during his three years at Stamford Bridge, has gone for a team with a formidable midfield of Lassana Diarra, Essien, Gerrard and Morten Gamst Pedersen, with hot-shots Fernando Torres and Jermain Defoe up front.</p>
              <p>Mourinho was blessed with Roman Abramovich's resources at Chelsea, but here he's had to work within our £50 million budget – and comfortably achieved the target, selecting his 11 players for a total cost of £49.6 million. It will be fascinating to see who comes out top in the Hansen v Mourinho battle. They share only two players: Gerrard and Torres.</p>
              <p>Mourinho has never been one to hide his considerable managerial talents – but this is the first time he has had to face the challenge of Telegraph Fantasy Football.</p>
              <p>John Ley<strong><em> </em></strong>assesses the Fantasy Football form of the starting XI.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Ricardo Carvalho £4.6m </strong></p>
              <p>CHELSEA</p>
              <p>He would, wouldn't he? After helping Jose win two League titles, the Uefa Cup and the Champions League, he quickly followed his manager to Stamford Bridge and was key to six trophy successes, in three years.</p>
              <p><strong>Alan Hutton £3.5m</strong></p>
              <p>TOTTENHAM</p>
              <p>Still an unknown quantity in Premier League terms, the Scot managed 26 points in 13 games after arriving from Rangers in January. This attack-minded right-back has the potential to make goals as well as prevent them.</p>
              <p><strong>Gareth Bale £3.4m</strong></p>
              <p>TOTTENHAM</p>
              <p>The Welshman can play either at left-back or left of midfield and his free-kicks produce goals, so his signing is a sensible one – provided he can keep clear of the injuries that curtailed his first Premier League campaign.</p>
              <p><strong>William Gallas £4.2m</strong></p>
              <p>ARSENAL</p>
              <p>Sometimes moody, often magnificent, he was a defender in the Chelsea side who won back-to-back titles under Jose, who will remember his adaptability; he played for some time at left-back and, at Arsenal, has also scored goals.</p>
              <p><strong>Steven Gerrard £5.6m</strong></p>
              <p>LIVERPOOL</p>
              <p>The second-highest midfield points scorer, behind Cristiano Ronaldo last term, with 197. He came close to joining Jose at Chelsea in 2005, but stuck with Liverpool. A must for most TFF managers.</p>
              <p><strong>Morten Gamst Pedersen £3.6m</strong></p>
              <p>BLACKBURN</p>
              <p>Anybody surprised at this choice should listen to new Chelsea full-back Jose Bosingwa. On signing for Scolari, he raised an eyebrow or two when he proclaimed Pedersen to be the player he most feared. A shrewd selection.</p>
              <p><strong>Lassana Diarra £3.4m</strong></p>
              <p>PORTSMOUTH</p>
              <p>Jose bought Diarra from Le Havre, but the Mali-born Frenchman had little opportunity in what was a strong side and moved to Arsenal. Again, his stay was short-lived, but he finished with an FA Cup winners' medal with Pompey.</p>
              <p><strong>Michael Essien £3.9m</strong></p>
              <p>CHELSEA</p>
              <p>The Bison is a formidable player. Outstanding in midfield for Chelsea last season, but more than capable at filling in at full-back, he scores goals as well. Jose broke the club record to sign him from Lyon.</p>
              <p><strong>Jermain Defoe £6.1m</strong></p>
              <p>PORTSMOUTH</p>
              <p>In the Premier League, Defoe will partner Torres' former team-mate Peter Crouch and can expect another healthy return now he has his confidence back under Harry Redknapp. He represents great value.</p>
              <p><strong>Fernando Torres £7.5m</strong></p>
              <p>LIVERPOOL</p>
              <p>The third-highest TFF points scorer last season, with 204, but the most expensive player in this year's game. Still, having scored 24 goals in just 29 League starts for the Reds, he is a must-have.</p>
              <p><strong>Pepe Reina £3.8m</strong></p>
              <p>LIVERPOOL</p>
              <p>The Spaniard was in the Barcelona B team coached by Jose. Some may presume he would go for Petr Cech, who arrived at Chelsea before the Special One, but Reina was the second-highest points scorer last season.</p>
