              <p><strong>Rennes playmaker Sylvain Marveaux has revealed he is close to agreeing a summer move to Liverpool. </strong> </p>
              <p>The 24-year-old, who has been watched by scouts from both Manchester United and Chelsea, was the subject of a £3m bid from West Ham last year. </p>
              <p>The left-sided midfielder was reportedly a guest at Anfield for the Reds' clash with Wolves in December and, despite watching an underwhelming 1-0 defeat, is apparently still happy to commit his future to the Merseysiders. </p>
              <p>Marveaux said: "I am very close to reaching agreement with Liverpool about joining them next season." </p>
              <p>The former France U21 star, who is currently recovering from groin surgery, is out of contract at the end of the season and the Rennes general manager, Pierre Dreossi, has already said he does not expect Marveaux to play for the Ligue 1 club again.</p>

              <p><strong>Rennes playmaker Sylvain Marveaux has denied reports he has signed a pre-contract agreement to join Liverpool in the summer.</strong></p>
              <p>Marveaux, 24, is out of contract at the end of the season and a report in English newspaper <em>The People</em> claimed he was close to a move to Anfield.</p>
              <p>"I am very close to reaching agreement with Liverpool about joining them next season," Marveaux was quoted as saying.</p>
              <p>But the former France Under-21 international has denied ever speaking to the newspaper and stressed that he has not yet made a decision about his future.</p>
              <p>Marveaux is currently recovering from groin surgery and has said he did not intend to commit his future to any club until he had returned to full fitness.</p>
              <p>"I never spoke to any English journalist and I do not understand why they wrote it,'' Marveux told <em>L'Equipe</em>. "Today I still have not decided which club I will play for next season.</p>
              <p>"I will soon be going to Clairefontaine to continue my rehab and when I have made my choice I will announce it.''</p>
              <p>Marveaux, who has also reportedly caught the interest of Marseille and Lyon, is keen to return to Rennes' line-up before the end of the season and help their push towards the Ligue 1 title.</p>
              <p>The Brittany club sit second in the table, three points behind leaders Lille, with 11 games to play.</p>
              <p>"Contrary to what some have said I hope to play again with Rennes before the end of the season,'' he said. "If all goes to plan I should be able to resume training and play in April or May. Returning with Rennes before the end of the season is my goal.''</p>
              <p>Rennes boss Frederic Antonetti shared his player's optimism about a return, insisting that Marveaux, who can play as a left winger or in a more central attacking position, could be back sooner than expected.</p>
              <p>"He could return in May," Antonetti said. "It could be good for him to show what he can do and it could be good for us as well."</p>
