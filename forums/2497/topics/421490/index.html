              <p>Liverpool have agreed a deal worth up to €26.5 million (£22.8 million) to sign Luis Suarez from Ajax.</p>

              <p>Liverpool
                   have been in negotiations with Ajax for some time and, with the last 
                  offer said to have been worth just half of Ajax's desired €30 million, 
                  it was believed the talks may have reached an impasse.</p>
              <p>Ajax had 
                  set a deadline of Saturday for the deal to be concluded and coach Frank 
                  de Boer said he believed the deal had a "50-50 chance" of going through,
                   but the move is now expected to be completed over the weekend.</p>
              <p>A
                   statement on the official Ajax website read: "Ajax and Liverpool have 
                  reached an agreement over the transfer of Luis Suarez. He will make the 
                  move to the English club immediately. The deal is worth up to a total of
                   €26.5 million."</p>
              <p>Liverpool will now seek to agree personal terms with Suarez, 24, and the player will undergo a medical.</p>
              <p>A
                   Liverpool statement added: "Liverpool Football Club announced this 
                  afternoon that they had agreed a fee of up to €26.5 million with Ajax 
                  for the transfer of Luis Suarez, subject to the completion of a medical.</p>
              <p>"The club have now been given permission by Ajax to discuss personal terms with the player and his representatives."</p>

              <p>Babel and Jovanovic are hardly used at all, what makes him think he's going to start? Furthermore what this lad needs is experience in other leagues. I seriously doubt he's going to make it though, not sure how the dutch league is like but it is a big leap for him.</p>

              <p><br>Well, if <span style="color: #000000;">Huntelaar, who was also a top scorer in the Dutch league before he went abroad went for something like $17 or $18 million... I would think Luis Suarez would at least cost a little lesser considering he created quite a storm not just in Ajax but also in the whole Dutch League after biting another player on the neck or somewhere...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I think that could be the reason Pool bid for only $12m... But I guess it could be who dares to win in a game of bluff... Pool who needed a 'big name' player or Ajax who risk having to keep Suarez a player they want to get rid off... But I guess the sudden Torres development may have forced Pool's hands and they gave in from a $12m offer to a jumped of $11m extra... It kind of seem a little desperate as on a day Torres made it known he wants to leave, moments later Pool agree to pay a club record sum very close to Ajax's $25m pounds valuation...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">And since you asked me, my thought is probably $15m tops... Cos Ajax's also desperately want to move him on...</span></p>

              <p><br> Well, if <span style="color: #000000;">Huntelaar, who was also a
              top scorer in the Dutch league before he went abroad went for
              something like $17 or $18 million... I would think Luis Suarez
              would at least cost a little lesser considering he created quite a
              storm not just in Ajax but also in the whole Dutch League after
              biting another player on the neck or somewhere...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I think that could be the reason
              Pool bid for only $12m... But I guess it could be who dares to
              win in a game of bluff... Pool who needed a 'big name' player or
              Ajax who risk having to keep Suarez a player they want to get rid
              off... But I guess the sudden Torres development may have
              forced Pool's hands and they gave in from a $12m offer to a jumped
              of $11m extra... It kind of seem a little desperate as on a day
              Torres made it known he wants to leave, moments later Pool agree to
              pay a club record sum very close to Ajax's $25m pounds
              valuation...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">And since you asked me, my thought
              is probably $15m tops... Cos Ajax's also desperately want to move
              him on...</span></p>

              <p>Hmmm, I think the price is reasonable as the market is inflated... nobody would rate his star player of the team less than 20m i guess ? </p>

              <p>It is a desperate price as Liverpool already know that Torres want out of the club.</p>
              <p>That is why they have to buy him at such a high price.</p>
              <p>Now, it will be next saga when they sell Torres for Anelka.</p>
              <p>The way they manipulated the press show that they will sell him.</p>
              <p>Or else it will be negative for the team for a player that have expressed his desire to leave.</p>
