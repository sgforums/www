              <p>Actually, any result I am ok, just as long it's a good match to watch... A draw would be good, a Chelsea win also not too bad and a Pool win is also good cos Chelsea are coming back into the title chase so if they drop some points today, it would be good too... lol.</p>

              <p>Anyway, steve was Mourinho's assistant and worked with Grant for a while and left in 2008...i think you definitely know that? inside knowledge?</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">FERNANDO TORRES had a nightmare Chelsea debut against his former club. LIVERPOOL fans felt Fernando Torres was talking bull when he said he was joining Chelsea because it was a bigger club.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And how they lapped it up as their matadors slayed the Spanish defector and his new pals.</p>
              <p>The £50million Spaniard was substituted on 65 minutes and taunted by Liverpool fans.</p>
              <p>Raul Meireles hit the Kop winner and boss Kenny Dalglish could not resist a dig at Torres.</p>
              <p>He said: "I do not think any of their forwards had a day which they will be happy with.</p>
              <p>"Our goalkeeper did not have too much to do because the players in front of him defended brilliantly."</p>
              <p>Reds fans chanted 'You should have stayed with a big club' when Torres was substituted.</p>
              <p>Dalglish added: "Our supporters are entitled to their opinions and know where the players' loyalties lie. They have to show respect to this club.</p>
              <p>"The most important people are the people still at Liverpool and they always will be. Whatever someone else wants to do with their life, that's their choice.</p>
              <p>"The personnel of the opposition isn't important to me. If Carlo Ancelotti was playing up front for Chelsea, I'd still have wanted three points."</p>
              <p>Defender Jamie Carragher said: "Good players come and go. I've played against plenty of former Liverpool players going back to Robbie Fowler.</p>
              <p>"Torres is one of the best in the world but he's not with us now. We've got our own job to do and that's what we did."</p>

              <p>Good result for Pool...  Although I thought Chelsea could have easily been given 2 penalties on another day...  Seriously, the foul on <span lang="EN-GB">Ivanovic could have easily been given if the Newcastle v Arsenal referee was on the pitch yesterday... And the hand ball incident... Really unlucky calls for the Blues there.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Another was Agger elbowed Torres right in the face... That was a really bad one but somehow the referee didn't see or react but the camera caught it... Perhaps Torres didn't make too much of it otherwise, who knows...</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Anyway, like i said earlier, Chelsea's defence is suspected and true enough, it was a defensive error that gave Pool the winning goal... Earlier in the first half, already there was a misunderstanding between Cech and <span lang="EN-GB">Ivanovic when both went for the same ball... The second time, which resulted with the goal, Cech and another of his defender, not sure if it was <span lang="EN-GB">Ivanovic or Terry, but both step back looking to each other to clear it only for the ball to go pass between them and ended up with <span lang="EN-GB">Meireles putting it in the net... They look really silly in that incident cos both avoiding the ball and it ended up with a Pool player... Like a schoolboy error... lol.</span></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB">On the whole, it was a really boring match... I was struggling to keep myself awake... </span></span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB">Anyway, the result was good for a neutural or a United / Arsenal / City fan i guess cos Chelsea was really beginning to threaten again in the title race and I have no doubt Torres will start to score and take them up... But this result kind of put out the fire for the moment again...</span></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB">At the end, I am only concern with the style of play last night... Cos Pool came to "Park the Bus" and got a result... But it was a terribly boring match to watch if you are a neutral... But I am afraid it might encourage other managers to try it too and we will go back to the good old days of the old first division where having 5 defenders was not unusal... </span></span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB">Next time, we can call this the 'Dullglish' formation... lol...</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>
              </p><p><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB">As the say, whatever works right? Got container lorry even better... lol.</span></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB">A good result for Pool on the day. And I hope Kenny gets confirm as full-time manager asap. Cos it could be a different ball game altogether then...</span></span></span></span></p>

              <p>I felt Lotti made a big mistake, he shouldn't have taken out Torres as it could demage his confidence in the following matches...</p>
              <p>Cos Pool were so focus on stopping Torres and taking him out at that moment made them more confident... Torres is a player that can don't do much for a long period of the game then suddenly can get a great goal from nothing kind...</p>
              <p>A bad mistake there I thought... Should just kept him in to keep Pool players occupied... Now by doing this, Lotti have humiliated him infront of those fans who were taunting him from the start... Anyway, what can Kalou bring? Nothing...</p>
              <p>I won't be too surprise if Lotti is given the sack come end of the season... He was lucky last season but he don't seem good enough... And what is the possibility of Mourinho coming back? With him not happy in Madrid and they are not doing great anyway... It would be interesting... cos it could just happen as the United job is still not available...</p>
