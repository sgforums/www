              <p>"Cos Pool came to "Park the Bus" and got a result... But it was a terribly boring match to watch if you are a neutral... " &lt;-- Do you expect team to come to Stamford bridge and go all out attack? Jose Mourinho did park his bus during his time at Chelsea, grinding out 1-0 results...the formation managed to keep Chelsea quiet so credit to Kenny. It is not entirely defensive with both Kelly and Johnson provide the width...3 CB, 3 CM &amp; 2 forwards.</p>
              <p>I am not sure if it is boring to the neutral but one thing am sure of is they were not boring for Chelsea and Liverpool fans.</p>

              <p>Take it from me, I am neither a fan of either clubs so I can have a better prospective... Honestly it was really boring stuff especially so in the first half... Watching Newcastle and Arsenal from a neutral's point of view just a day before, I can say it wasn't... And it got more and more exciting as it got on...</p>
              <p>But I can understand a Pool's fans concern... It's the result that matters... Though I won't agree totally that some Chelsea fans didn't though it's boring too cos of the tactics employed by Pool... </p>
              <p>Mourinho may have "park the bus" during his time but I don't recall he did it wih 5 defenders though... Rafa too... And they both were already labelled boring with 4 defenders, 5 midfielders...</p>
              <p>Of course I am not expecting an "all out attack" but 5 defenders 3 CBs? It's like going back to the time Kenny was still a manager at Pool or Newcastle... And we know what Newcastle fans thought of it... They labelled him Dullglish.</p>
              <p>And it seems more like 5-4-1 rather than a 5-3-2 to me...</p>

              <p>Chelsea was playing with 3 forwards.  Liverpool was right in trying to neutralize this by playing 5 at the back with 3 midfielders helping out for the first half.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Liverpool got a lucky break when they got the goal as the Chelsea backline was suspect.  Earlier on, you saw how Cech was screaming at Ivanovic for going for the same ball.  Not communicating well at the back.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think it was a smart move by the manager not to put saurez on once they were 1-0 up.  He might have put him in if the score was still 0-0 but who knows.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It was like a slap in the face to Chelsea and Torres that they didn't even need to play saurez to win.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Psychologically, this would have demoralized Chelsea while putting in more confidence back into the Liverpool squad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I thought a fair result would have been a draw. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I already said he was good earlier on but many Pool fans criticized him earlier cos he was a Roy signing... He just needed a little time but even before he already showed signs of it... I mentioned he was a Portuguese international so he can't be all that bad to some Pool fan... But they lump him together with Joe and Kon as Roy's poor signings...</p>
