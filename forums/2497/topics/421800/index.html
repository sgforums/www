              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">FERNANDO TORRES insists he will have no problem shooting down Liverpool on Sunday.</h2>
              <p>Torres, 26, is in line to make his Chelsea debut against his former club following his £50million switch from Anfield. And the Spanish striker has told Carlo Ancelotti not to worry about throwing him straight into action at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>He said: "It is like destiny. It is not perfect for me but we will see what happens and I only have good words about Liverpool. "They made me a top player and gave me the chance to play at the top level. I will never say anything bad about Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"I have been very happy there but now the history is different and I am playing for Chelsea. "If I have the chance to play, I will do my best for Chelsea and hopefully I can score."</p>
              <p>Torres admits he first started thinking about leaving Liverpool last summer. He gave Roy Hodgson his full backing and appeared to be returning to peak form following the arrival of Kenny Dalglish.</p>
              <p>But the World Cup winner has revealed there was no way he could reject a move to London. He added: "I felt from last summer that I needed to do a step forward in my career and for my ambition as a footballer.</p>
              <p>"I am joining a team that is at the top level. There is not another level after Chelsea. "I am joining with big names like John Terry, Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka and I can be part of this great team.</p>
              <p>"Also, I wanted to join because Chelsea always have shown a big respect for me. "They really want me and it is important when you have the support of the people in the club. The fans always showed respect to me when I came to Stamford Bridge and at Anfield.</p>
              <p>"Now I am very happy to be a Chelsea player."</p>
              <p>Torres knows he is now despised on Merseyside but he insists the support of the Chelsea faithful is all that matters to him.</p>
              <p>He said: "When I played against Chelsea, there was always a big motivation because it was a special game — it was always one of the biggest games of the season.</p>
              <p>"I want to say thanks to the Chelsea fans because I have seen them very, very happy with me for joining. "If they are happy as well because I am not going to score any more against them then it is good.</p>
              <p>"Chelsea have the chance every season to win all the trophies they play for, so when you have the chance to play in a team like this, you cannot say no."</p>
              <p>Torres is also looking forward to linking up again with former Anfield team-mate Yossi Benayoun, who is close to returning from an Achilles injury.</p>
              <p>He said: "Benayoun is my friend and on the pitch we have a very good relationship. "Hopefully he can play as soon as possible and he will be fully recovered.</p>
              <p>"It is exciting the possibility to play with him again, but as well with my other new team-mates."</p>

He has spoken out over the years on the need for reinforcements. He knows he's a top striker but he has not won any trophy except the world cup for the last few years. Perhaps he's bitter with the quality of players that liverpool have had over the years. He will remember the kop with nostalgia of course but i guess it's bitter sweet.

              <p> </p>
              <p><span><strong>Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti revealed last night he could launch Fernando Torres, Didier Drogba AND Nicolas Anelka on Liverpool this Sunday. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>After seeing his side hit four goals in a resounding victory at Sunderland, Ancelotti admitted he could change his tactics to suit his superstar trio. </span></p>
              <p><span>'I will probably play two strikers, maybe with a diamond,' he said, hinting at a front two of Torres and Drogba playing in front of with Anelka just behind. 'He (Torres) will have no problems playing with Drogba or another striker.' </span></p>
              <p><span>Torres will launch his Chelsea career against his old club despite last-ditch attempts by Anfield chiefs to force him out of the fixture. </span></p>
              <p><span>Liverpool tried to strike a gentleman's agreement with Chelsea so the Spaniard would miss the game, but Ancelotti confirmed: 'There is no agreement that he won't play against Liverpool.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Torres did not travel to the' Stadium of Light to see his new strike partners - particularly Anelka - perform brilliantly in the win that takes Chelsea within a point of third-placed Manchester City. </span></p>
              <p><span>Talks around his move delayed the £50million record transfer as the clock ticked towards Monday's 11pm deadline. Any agreement over Sunday's game would be illegal under Barclays Premier League rules and Chelsea resisted the pressure to find a loophole. </span></p>
              <p><span>It could have worked had Torres moved initially on loan, preventing him playing against his parent club. 'It is like the destiny,' said Torres. </span></p>
              <p><span>It's not perfect for me but we'll see what happens and I only have good words about Liverpool. They made me a top player and gave me the chance to play at the top level. Now history is different and I am playing for Chelsea.' <br></span></p>
              <div class="artSplitter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/02/01/article-1352677-0D01F585000005DC-524_634x286.jpg" alt="Don't forget me: Nicolas Anelka starred in Chelsea's 4-2 win over Sunderland" width="634" height="286">

              <p><span><strong>Torres spent yesterday on administrative tasks and acquainting himself with his new place of work, Chelsea's training ground in Surrey. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>He trained alone on one of the academy pitches with fitness coach Chris Jones for 45 minutes before making it clear the prospect of winning the Champions League had supplied the motivation for his shock transfer request. The Spanish striker also admitted he realised last summer he had to leave Anfield. </span></p>
              <p><span>'The Champions League is a big ambition and all the footballers want to play in it,' said Torres. 'I have a very bad memory of the semi-final of the Champions League in my first season in England when Chelsea beat us and they played the final. Hopefully now I'm here we can go through to the final together and win. </span></p>
              <p><span>'Chelsea have the chance every season to win all the trophies that they play for, so when you have the chance to play in a team like this you cannot say no. I felt from last summer that I needed a step forward in my career. </span></p>
              <p><span>'I am joining a team that is at the top level, there is not another level after Chelsea. I am joining with big names like Terry, Lampard, Drogba and Anelka and I can be part of this great team. </span></p>
              <p><span>'I wanted to join because Chelsea always have shown a big respect for me. They really want me and it is important when you have the support of the people in the club, and the support of the fans who always showed respect to me when I came to Stamford Bridge and at Anfield. Now I am very happy to be a Chelsea player.' ]</span></p>
              <p><span>Ancelotti will formally introduce Torres to his new team-mates today, when David Luiz is also expected to train after Roman Abramovich's personal intervention oiled his on-off transfer from Benfica, just four hours before Monday's deadline. </span></p>
              <p><span>Abramovich is understood to have made a call instructing the club to increase its offer for Luiz by £5m and match the asking price. The £75m outlay in a single day equals what the club's Russian owner has spent over the previous three years. </span></p>

              <h2>SKRTEL: TORRES COULD REGRET MOVE</h2>
              <div><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/11/02/240/skrcrop_2557839.jpg" border="0" alt="Martin Skrtel - expected Torres exit."></div>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel does not think the team will miss striker Fernando Torres having brought in Andy Carroll and Luis Suarez to replace him. </strong></p>
              <p>He even suggested the Spain international may regret his £50million move to Chelsea, which was completed on Monday just after £35million Carroll and £22.8million Suarez had been confirmed as the Reds' new recruits.</p>
              <p>"We have captured Suarez and Carroll. I believe these two will replace him and we will be at least as strong as we were with Nando," said the defender.</p>
              <p>"We all feel sorry because he's a player of world class ability but, to be honest, it was no surprise.</p>
              <p>"This season has not been going according to our wishes and expectations and that convinced him that it is the right time to move elsewhere. This is how he explained it to us.</p>
              <p>"I wish him all the best but do not wish any success to Chelsea.</p>
              <p>"Maybe Fernando will regret making this step sometime in the future."</p>
              <p>Torres' debut could come against his former club at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Skrtel is confident, however, he can keep the 26-year-old quiet.</p>
              <p>"It will be different because so far I have been playing against him only in training," the Slovakian told isport.blesk.cz.</p>
              <p>"I hope he appears on the pitch and, since Chelsea wanted him so much, it is very likely that he will.</p>
              <p>"I'm looking forward and firmly believe I won't let him score."</p>

              <p>Glen Johnson didn't move probably because Liverpool is paying him salary he would never get elsewhere. And no one else is willing to pay that much for this right "winger".</p>
              <p>Reina is a loyal servant since his days at Barcelona and Villareal. I think he will only move back to native Spain if the opportunity arises.</p>

              <p><strong>David Luiz's hopes of a <span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span> debut against Liverpool on Sunday are fading after he was forced to make an 11,000-mile round trip to finalise his work permit.</strong></p>
              <p>The Brazil defender jetted home on Wednesday to get his permit rubber-stamped ahead of his Barclays Premier League debut. Chelsea officials insist there are no problems and that the trip is standard procedure.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old will be eligible to play Liverpool at Stamford Bridge, but whether Carlo Ancelotti will throw his £25million signing into the potentially explosive clash is unclear.</p>
              <p>Fernando Torres is set to make his Chelsea bow against the club he left in acrimonious circumstances on Monday, adding extra spice to the encounter.</p>
              <p>But Luiz is only expected back in the UK today, so he would go into this weekend's clash after just two days of full training.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Ancelotti may prefer to play the centre half in the west London derby against Fulham on February 14. But the Brazilian says he is ready to face Liverpool if needed. </strong></p>
              <p>'I hope I can play quickly, and I feel 100 per cent to play tomorrow if I need to,' he said. 'There is no problem with my fitness. I have a strong desire to get a space in this group and establish myself.'</p>
              <p>Luiz has first-hand experience of what Torres will bring to Stamford Bridge, as the Spaniard scored twice when Liverpool beat Benfica 5-3 on aggregate in last season's Europa League quarter-final.</p>
              <p>Luiz said: 'I am so happy that I can play in the same team as him and not against him.</p>
