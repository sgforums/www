              <p><strong>No1: Bobby Moore</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>There could only be one winner. Bobby Moore will forever be cherished 
              by England fans – young and old – thanks to the defining image of him 
              lifting the Jules Rimet trophy at Wembley in 1966. The World Cup final 
              victory over West Germany was the greatest moment of the country’s 
              footballing history – and who better to lead the celebrations than 
              inspirational Moore?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00429/wright_120x95_429957a.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="95"></p>
              <p><strong>No2: Billy Wright</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>Wright captained England an incredible 90 times – a record the Wolves 
              hero shares with the great Bobby Moore. The defender was the first Three 
              Lions player to reach a century of caps and he was skipper at three 
              consecutive World Cups between 1950 and 1958. A true gentleman, Wright was 
              never booked or sent off during his entire career.</p>

              <p><strong>No3: Bryan Robson</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>The fact Robson was called Captain Marvel says it all. The Manchester 
              United midfielder led out England on 65 occasions, including Euro88 and the 
              World Cups in both 1986 and 1990. Robson would have probably worn the 
              armband even more if injuries had not peppered his career.</p>

              <p><strong>No4: Alan Shearer</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>The devastating centre forward was a commanding leader for England. 
              Shearer took over the captaincy after Euro96 and went on to skipper his 
              country at the 1998 World Cup and Euro2000. The Newcastle legend possessed 
              all the qualities of a great captain — spirit, determination and courage, as 
              well as a superb goalscoring record.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>No5: David Beckham</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>Like him or loathe him, Goldenballs is undeniably an England legend. 
              Beckham’s international future was in doubt when he was needlessly sent off 
              in their 1998 World Cup defeat to Argentina. Yet, he emerged a tougher 
              character and went on to captain his country 58 times in his 99 appearances. 
              Whether that happens again remains to be seen but the memories will never be 
              forgotten.</p>

              <p><img src="http://www.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00429/adams_120x95_429945a.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="95"></p>
              <p><strong>No6: Tony Adams</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>The Arsenal legend made his bow as skipper against Romania at Wembley 
              in 1994. The defender’s command saw him captain his country on home soil in 
              the European Championships two years later when England came within a Gareth 
              Southgate penalty of the final. Alan Shearer took over the armband after the 
              tournament when Adams admitted he was an alcoholic.</p>

              <p><img src="http://www.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00429/haynes_120x95_429948a.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="95"></p>
              <p><strong>No7: Johnny Haynes</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>Described by Pele as the best passer he had ever seen, Haynes was the 
              next major captain after Billy Wright — leading them out on 22 successive 
              occasions. The Fulham forward skippered England in their memorable 9-3 
              victory over Scotland at Wembley. Haynes then captained his country in the 
              1962 World Cup, where they were knocked out in the quarter-finals by Brazil.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00429/lineker_120x95_429953a.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="95"></p>
              <p><strong>No8: Gary Lineker</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>The deadly centre-forward took over the armband after England came 
              within a whisker of the 1990 World Cup final. Lineker went on to lead the 
              Three Lions at Euro92, where he was cruelly denied the opportunity to match 
              Bobby Charlton’s record of 49 international goals after being substituted in 
              the match against hosts Sweden that ensured their early exit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00429/keegan_120x95_429952a.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="95"></p>
              <p><strong>No9: Kevin Keegan</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>The perm-haired star has never been shy to voice his opinions and his 
              choice as England skipper was surprising. Keegan captained his country 31 
              times, including the 1980 European Championships when they narrowly failed 
              to qualify from a tough group that also included Italy, Spain and Belgium.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00429/ince_120x95_429949a.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="95"></p>
              <p><strong>No10: Paul Ince</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article">The no-nonsense midfielder became the first black player to captain England 
              when he pulled on the armband against the US in 1993. Ince only captained 
              his country on seven occasions but few will forget his inspired leadership — 
              as well as bloodied head bandage — in the goalless draw in Italy that 
              secured their ticket to the 1998 World Cup.</p>
