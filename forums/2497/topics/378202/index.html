              <p>Most of the time, Sir Alex
              Ferguson is a credit to the game he loves but now and again, he lets
              himself down with the kind of antics that remind us the sneering bully
              in him is alive and well.</p>
              <p>His
              ill-judged diatribe on the supposed lack of fitness of referee Alan
              Wiley was an unusually clumsy attempt to deflect attention away from
              Manchester United’s poor performance against Sunderland.</p>
              <p>But
              Ferguson’s attack not only made a mockery of the FA’s Respect campaign,
              it also ensured that Wiley will now be a soft target for the boo-boys
              at every Premier League ground he visits.</p>
              <p>In
              those circumstances, it is particularly sweet that ProZone statistics
              appear to show that Mr Wiley actually ran further than most of the
              United team during Saturday evening’s match at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Cue
              bleep tests all round at Carrington, presumably, and plenty of time for
              Sir Alex to think about the way he behaved while he considers the FA
              charge that must surely be heading his way.</p>

              <p>Fergie
                  may have erred (again) in venting his anger at referee, Alan Wiley, but
                  ultimately what damage has it done? Despite his rant, the match was
                  drawn (luckily for an out of sorts United) and no amount of
                  vitipuration from SAF is going to change that.<br>While, as a United
                  supporter, I sometimes find his outbursts a bit embarrassing, I do
                  believe the reaction to this latest incident is way over the top.
                  Calling for Fergie to be kicked out of football smacks of overkill. If
                  he is given the boot for having a go at a ref, then why is Didier
                  Drogba stll playing? Oh yes, gorgot....that referee was not British.
                  And on the subject of referees and Drogba, if, as those now pointing
                  the finger at Sir Alex, are that certain that the current crop of refs
                  are up to it, why has no referee yet been sanctioned - even kicked out
                  of football - for allowing the big Ivorian to get away with sham
                  injuries week after week, game after game? Surely, if they are as good
                  at what they are doing as Keith Hackett claims them to be, Drogba would
                  have been red-carded a long time ago, not only for cheating, but for
                  trying to make a fool of the very officials we are told are basically
                  beyond reproach.</p>

              <div id="CommentBody[6]" class="Comments_CommentText">I
              think this is being taken way farther than it should have been. When a
              Refereee makes a mistake or they fined and banned from the game and
              kicked out of football. No they are not. This is supposed to be a free
              Country. So who are allowed to make comments about the Referee's if
              they get it wrong. The players are not allowed to say anything about a
              mistake if they do they get a card. If the Manager says anything they
              get a ban and fine. So please tell me who is allowed to complain about
              the Referee's. This is all one sided someone should be allowed to at
              least make a comment without it being taken to people saying kick him
              out of the game. When the Referee's make huge mistakes that cost
              football teams a lot of money or even a place further in a World Cup
              for instance. Who sorts that out. Nobody they get away with it. So if
              Managers have a go then they should except some of the critisism that
              comes there way. Maybe some of the comments happen in the heat of the
              moment because of a insident before that the Referee as missed and it
              was an important decision, that to me is understandable. He should be
              made to puplicly apologise to the Referee, pay a fine and be given a 3
              match touchline ban. He only made a comment that a lot of fans make
              week in week out over different things. This should not be blown out of
              proportion like it has been. I think Managers should be able to say
              something if something important was missed in a match or given that
              should not have been given, then if the Manager s are right then the
              Referee's should get a fine and be banned for ? games that it needs.
              This would be a fairer ruling so at least it can be checked on film to
              see who was right. If the Manager is wrong then they should get the
              fine and the ban. But unless this works both ways nothing is fair by
              punishing just the one that has said something. So why does the FA not
              try a fairer system to give all Managers a chance to have an opinion.</div>

              <p>You'd think a
              man in his position would have some dignity. It doesn't matter if he's
              won 100 Premier Leagues and 10 World Cups, he's got no more rights than
              anyone else, and managers cannot go publicly slating referees. The
              respect players have for the referees is already abysmal, with scenes
              of refs surrounded by protesting players completely embarrassing the
              sport, and it doesn't help when managers who are supposed to be role
              models also chip in.<br><br>Fact is the refs are always trying to make
              the right decisions, however obvious it looks to us on TV it can be
              very different on the pitch. Do you think they will be pleased seeing
              themselves on MOTD making a terrible decision, of course not, they
              would much rather avoid that. They are in a no win situation from the
              start because nobody could possibly get all the decisions right,
              particularly with the pace of the PL. Now that the sport has become a
              business, and these decisions can cost millions, they are taking even
              more flak which in turn increases the pressure and makes the job yet
              more difficult. If people want perfection then added technology is the
              only answer.</p>

              <p>Personally, I do think SAF was employing diversion to put the focus elsewhere than on the poor performance of MU vs Sunderland, however, what he said is over the top.</p>

              <p>That is a different matter though.</p>
              <p>The referee is the main enforcer of the rules for the game.</p>
              <p>By disrespecting the referee, they are indirectly going against the ruling body, be it Fifa, Uefa, or even the English FA.</p>
              <p>Sure they might make mistakes, but who doesn't? Is Ferguson saying that he has never made a mistake in his managerial career?</p>

              <p>Today's TNP details the stringent fitness tests the refs go thru every season. And i agree with Iain Macintosh that Fergie needs to be hang out to dry if they wan the RESPECT campaign to gain any sort of credibility.</p>
              <p>If the criticism is factual and is reasonable, then fine but in this case, its a personal attack on Wiley and suspecting his ability to do his job well which turns out to be untrue. This might just consitute a legal case if Wiley decides to take it up.</p>
