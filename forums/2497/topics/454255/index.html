              <p>He knows the game well enough, he has kept himself up to date and has been at it for like more than 10 years and knows the English and European game well... Never afraid to speak his mind out.

              <p>It is very easy to be a TV pundit, all you do there is criticise and comment.</p>
              <p>Shebby is a bad choice for director of football, he has no exposure for english soccer. His only exposure was to play for malaysia. Shebby is a better choice for football administrator. But as director of football you have to make crucial transfer choices.</p>
              <p>Shebby better beware, because of the nonsense from Venky owners. Venky ruined the club by making money to transfer valued blackburn players and buy lowly valued players from other leagues to benefit their transfer agents. Shebby's hands are effectively tied because he was only hired for his image.</p>

              <p><strong>Shebby Singh has issued a public apology to <span style="color: #000000;">Steve Kean</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and Morten Gamst Pedersen after saying that the </span><span style="color: #000000;">Blackburn Rovers</span> manager would be sacked if he lost three games and calling the 30-year-old winger a "pensioner".</strong></p>
              <p>Speaking at an open meeting organised by the Blackburn Rovers Action Group, the club's global adviser Singh told supporters Kean would be sacked if he lost three games in a row but it was the personal comments directed at Pedersen that caused the most upset.</p>
              <p>Kean and Pedersen were so furious with Singh that the Malaysian was forced to apologise to both men at a squad meeting. In addition, he deemed it necessary to make a public apology through the Lancashire Telegraph.</p>
              <p>Singh had said Kean's promises of a strong promotion challenge had to be taken "with a pinch of salt", while he likened Pedersen, who has been at the club for eight years, to a "pensioner".</p>
              <p>He said: "I would like to extend an apology to Steve Kean because some things were said on Saturday. I think they would have hurt Steve Kean's feelings and for that I sincerely apologise.</p>
              <p>"I would also like to apologise to Morten Gamst Pedersen for what was said. There are no excuses and Morten is a great character.</p>
              <p>"My blunt honesty sometimes upsets people and sometimes rubs people up the wrong way. I am making efforts to bring the club back to the fans and in trying to do that I have gone too far. I am trying to find the middle ground."</p>
              <p>Blackburn's Indian owners, Venky's, appointed the 51-year-old former Malaysia defender in June and one of Singh's tasks is to act as a go-between for Venky's and Kean. He has a reputation for forthright views earned while working as a football pundit for Asian TV.</p>
              <p>The Blackburn striker David Goodwillie has been called up by Scotland for Wednesday's friendly against Australia at Easter Road. Goodwillie scored in his last appearance – a 3-1 Euro 2012 qualifying defeat to Spain in October.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old moved to Ewood Park from Dundee United in August 2011, scoring two goals in 20 Premier League appearances, although he started only four games.</p>
