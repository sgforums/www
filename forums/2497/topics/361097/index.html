              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">ARSENE WENGER will test the backing of the Arsenal board with a £15million move for Fulham defender Brede Hangeland.</h2>
              <p class="article">The unhappy Gunners boss has been offered the club’s ‘unequivocal support by chief executive Ivan Gazidis following a long meeting this week. And now Wenger intends to cash in on promises of financial backing by making a club record bid for a defender.</p>
              <p class="article">Wenger is still angry that he has been blamed by fans for refusing to spend big money in the transfer market. The Frenchman feels he has been left to carry the can by a board that promises major funds for new signings but rarely delivers.</p>
              <p class="article">He will not back down in his pursuit of Norway international Hangeland and expects Arsenal to meet Fulham’s asking price.</p>
              <p class="article">The 27-year-old cost just £3.7m from Danish side FC Copenhagen 18 months ago. But 6ft 4in Hangeland’s value has rocketed this season on the back of solid performances.</p>
              <p class="article">Now Wenger believes he is just the man he needs to plug the holes in his leaky defence. The Gunners chief knows opposite number Roy Hodgson will not easily part with the defender, who still has two years left on his Fulham contract.</p>
              <p class="article">But the hard-up Cottagers are in no position to turn down £15m and Wenger has made it clear he sees this issue as a test of Arsenal’s commitment to challenge for major honours next season.</p>

              <h1>Hangeland agent quiet on Arsenal interest</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://fourfourtwo.com/contentimages/news/Hangeland.jpg" alt="" width="286" height="161"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The agent of Fulham defender Brede Hangeland insists there will be no news about the </strong><strong>Norwegian's </strong><strong>future until the end of the season.</strong></p>
              <p>The Cottagers host Everton on the final day of the campaign on Sunday hoping to seal a place in next year's UEFA Europa League.</p>
              <p>It has been a stunning turnaround for Roy Hodgson's side, who needed
              a Danny Murphy goal at Portsmouth 12 months ago to ensure they remained
              a Premier League club.</p>
              <p>One factor of Fulham's success has been their ability to name the
              same back-five on a regular basis, with Hangeland a rock at the heart
              of the West London club's defence, making 42 appearances in all
              competitions this campaign.</p>
              <p>The Norway international is now being linked with a big-money move
              to the Emirates Stadium in the summer, with Arsenal believed to be keen
              on securing his services to add both experience and a physical presence
              to their defence.</p>
              <p>However, Hangeland's agent, Jim Solbakken, has said he would not be drawn on the player's future until the end of the season.</p>
              <p>"It is natural that there will be interest such has been his form
              this season, and it is my job to listen to such interest," he told
              skysports.com.</p>
              <p>"But Fulham have not yet completed their league campaign, and there is no comment to make on his future at the moment.</p>
              <p>"I'm sure there will be conversations over his future as time develops."</p>

              <p>The Norway international defender has been one of the successes of Fulham's record-breaking season which saw them clinch their highest ever top-flight finish of seventh.</p>
              <p>It is only the second time in their history that Fulham have qualified to play in Europe and Hodgson is hoping that Hangeland will remain part of their plans for next season despite being consistently linked with a move to Arsenal.</p>
              <p class="scrollText">'We'll do everything in our power to keep Brede,' said Hodgson. 'Everyone knows he's a player that we love. He's still contracted to us and we want to keep him.</p>
              <p>'We're doing everything in our power - but our power sometimes can't be compared to the power of other clubs.'</p>

              <p><strong>Brede Hangeland has rejected rumours of an Arsenal bid but has not ruled out a move away from the club. </strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/fulham/hangeland_no-way-through.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>Reports in the English press recently claimed that Arsene Wenger
              had made a bid for the 27-year-old centre back, while Roy Hodgson
              admitted he may struggle to hold onto the Norway international. </strong></p>
              <p>However, Hangeland, who recently suggested he would be happy to
              sign a contract extension, says there is no truth in the reports.</p>
              <p>“The rumours are a bit over the top, but it is just because of the fact that I have done well,” he told TV 2 Sporten.</p>
              <p>“I’m very happy with what I achieved this season, but then you have to put up with all the fabrications in the press.”</p>
              <p>Yet while he remains happy at Fulham and is keen to play a part
              in their Europa League campaign next season, he has suggested that he
              would a consider a move if it suited his game.</p>
              <p>“If there is an offer on the table, style of play and formation would be important factors,” he said.</p>
              <p>“I’m probably more protected as a defender at Fulham than I would be at some other places.”</p>

              <h1>Hangeland tired of switch speculation</h1>

              <p><strong>Fulham defender Brede Hangeland insists he has no intention of leaving Craven Cottage to join Arsenal this summer.</strong></p>
              <p>The Norwegian has been a rock at the heart of the West London club's
                  defence this season, making 43 appearances in all competitions to help
                  guide Roy Hodgson's side to a European place.</p>
              <p>As a result, Hangeland has been linked with a big-money move
                  to the Emirates Stadium during the close-season, with Arsenal believed to be keen
                  on securing his services to add both experience and a physical presence
                  to their defence.</p>
              <p>However, despite the speculation, the 27-year-old says he fully expects to still be a Fulham player in 2009/10.</p>
              <p>"Speculation has become a part of daily life and at times it's quite tiring," he told<em> Stavanger Aftenblad.</em></p>
              <p>"I don't know anything about this story. Right now, there is no indication that I will change club."</p>

              <p>"Hopefully
              we can agree a new contract and then I'll stay here for a long time.
