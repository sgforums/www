              <p><strong>Steven Gerrard is used to winning games single-handedly for </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool </strong></span></a><strong>but even the Anfield skipper cannot fancy his chances against half of the </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> team.</strong></p>
              <p>Gerrard is the only non-United player on the list of nominees for the PFA player of the year award. As voting took place before United's recent dip in form, it is perhaps no surprise the quintuple-chasing outfit provide five contenders - including Ryan Giggs, who has never won the prestigious award despite boasting a record 10 league titles. </p>
              <p>However, it could look a little strange if Liverpool or <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span></a>, who have no-one in the list for either the senior or young player prize, go on to win the Barclays Premier League.  </p>
              <p>Gerrard could benefit from a split vote for United players as David Ginola did during the 1999 treble-winning season, a fact which still irritates Sir Alex Ferguson. Aside from Giggs, Rio Ferdinand and Edwin van der Sar - who kept a record 14 consecutive clean sheets earlier in the season - are also nominated, along with Cristiano Ronaldo, who could become the first player to win three times in succession.  </p>
              <p>However, the favourite to lift the trophy at Grosvenor House on April 26 remains Nemanja Vidic, another ever-present during United's record run of clean sheets. </p>
              <p>Apart from a dismal performance in the home defeat by Liverpool last month which culminated in a sending off and a two-match ban, Vidic has hardly put a foot wrong all season.  </p>
              <p>United also have two contenders to be crowned young player of the year in Jonny Evans and Rafael Da Silva. </p>

              <p><strong>Evans has enjoyed an outstanding season, stepping in for Ferdinand on a regular basis but arguably Rafael, an 18-year-old Brazilian, has made an even more startling impact.</strong>  </p>
              <p>There is plenty of competition though, with Gabriel Agbonlahor and Ashley Young both making the final six in recognition of Aston Villa's brilliant first half of the campaign.</p>
              <p>Tottenham's Aaron Lennon also caught the eye of his fellow professionals, although it could be argued Manchester City's Stephen Ireland has enjoyed the most consistent season and is most likely to succeed Cesc Fabregas.  </p>
              <p>Ireland might have courted controversy earlier in his career but the youngster has put all that behind him this term with some stellar performances that have outshone Brazilian duo Robinho and Elano. </p>

              <p><em>Arsene: </em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>FERGUSON SHRUGS OFF WENGER CLAIMS</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"><br><br> </div>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has dismissed Arsene Wenger's claims Manchester United players would not be dominating the PFA award nominations if the votes were being cast now.</strong></p>
              <p>United boast five of the six contenders, including favourite Nemanja Vidic and current holder Cristiano Ronaldo, who is attempting to become the first player to win the prestigious award for a third successive season.</p>
              <p>Steven Gerrard is the only non-Red Devil, which could prove somewhat embarrassing for the PFA if either Liverpool or more notably Chelsea, go on to lift the major prizes this season.</p>
              <p>Wenger feels the nominations list would look somewhat different if voting had taken place later in the season, once United had begun to suffer their present dip in form.</p>
              <p>Ferguson does not disagree with a theory that the voting needs to be put back. However, even if it was, the United boss cannot see how Wenger can think opinions which are supposed to take into account an entire season can be changed on the basis of just a few games.</p>
              <p>"It is valid to have five contenders," he said. "If we are talking about current form, Arsene cannot just go back two or three games. "The PFA awards are always done early. That has been noted in the past. Votes are collected in January or February. I actually think they should be done later."</p>
              <p>There is a theory that United's vote could be split, allowing Gerrard to take the prize.</p>
              <p>As United are still in line to win an astonishing five trophies, that could be equally embarrassing for the PFA, who Ferguson has never let forget handed the prize to David Ginola in the 1999 Treble-winning season.</p>
              <p>It is for that reason the Scot is not getting too stressed out about who might win it this year, or who is his favoured candidate from a list that also includes record-breaking goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, Rio Ferdinand and the evergreen Ryan Giggs, who has never won the award despite gathering 10 league titles.</p>
              <p>"It is difficult to choose a player of the year," said Ferguson. "We have had some good performances this season. Giggs, Vidic, Darren Fletcher, John O'Shea and Edwin van der Sar have all done well.</p>
              <p>"Vidic has had an exceptional season and Giggs just amazes you every time. But it is difficult to say what impact how many players you have got in these things actually has.</p>
              <p>"In 1999 when we won the Treble, we never won an award. I don't think too much emphasis should be placed on it." In addition to dominating the main award, United also have two contenders to be crowned Young Player of the Year in Jonny Evans and Rafael Da Silva.</p>
              <p>Evans has enjoyed an outstanding season stepping in for Ferdinand on a regular basis but Rafael, a young 18-year-old Brazilian, has arguably made even more of an impact.</p>
              <p>There is plenty of competition though, with Gabriel Agbonlahor and Ashley Young both making the final six in recognition of Aston Villa's brilliant first half of the campaign.</p>
              <p>Tottenham's Aaron Lennon also caught the eye of his fellow professionals, although it could be argued Manchester City's Stephen Ireland has enjoyed the most consistent season and is most likely to succeed Cesc Fabregas.</p>
              <p>Ireland might have courted controversy earlier in his career but the youngster has put all that behind him this term, with some stellar performances that have outshone Brazilian duo Robinho and Elano.</p>
              <p> </p>
              </span></div>
              <p>Wenger faces a defensive crisis ahead of tonight’s Champions League quarter-final clash with Villarreal. Manuel Almunia, William Gallas, Gael Clichy and Johan Djourou are injured as Arsenal defend a 1-1 draw from the first leg. And worried Wenger admitted: “We don’t need a manager to select our defence for this game because the defence picks itself.”</p>
