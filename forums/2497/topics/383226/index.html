              <p>The 26-year-old suffered torn ankle ligaments during Holland's goalless draw against Italy in Pescara on November 14 and was initially expected to be out for between four and six weeks.</p>
              <p>But the Gunners' medical stuff have since reviewed the injury and its treatment and concluded he must go under the knife, and is now not expected back until April at best.</p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>The Dutch striker injured ankle ligaments in Holland’s friendly against Italy two weeks ago and was initially expected to be facing a six-week recovery period.</strong></p>
              <p>But examination by <span style="color: #000000;">Ar</span><span style="color: #000000;">s</span><span style="color: #000000;">enal</span><span style="color: #000000;">’s</span> medical team and a Dutch ankle specialist has revealed that Van Persie’s injury is far worse than first thought and this week he will have surgery that could keep him out for five months, effectively ending his season.</p>
              <p>Wenger, whose side face league leaders Chelsea at the Emirates this afternoon, was scathing about the KNVB’s initial treatment of the player’s injury. “I think the Dutch FA minimised the injury,” he said.</p>
              <p>“We have just found out that it is much worse than what they told us. If a player gets injured with his country he should be sent back to his club straight away to be checked out by their doctors, not by those of the national team.</p>
              <p>“Countries just take your player away for a friendly and then give him back and say: 'There you go.’ It doesn’t happen in any other sport. It’s a joke and is so disrespectful.”</p>
              <p>A statement on the club website said: “Robin van Persie returned to Arsenal on November 22 following an ankle injury sustained on international duty with Holland. The injury was expected to keep him out of action for between four and six weeks.</p>
              <p>“Upon his return, the Arsenal medical team conducted a thorough review of his scans, his early injury management and the treatment he had received. Having scrutinised these in detail and assessed the response of his ankle, the club’s medical team concluded that further investigation was required.</p>
              <p>“Advice was sought from leading ankle specialist Mr Niek van Dijk, who confirmed that more extensive damage had been suffered than first diagnosed. In order to repair his ankle, Robin will undergo surgery next week in Amsterdam to reconstruct the ligaments. The club’s medical team anticipate a full recovery will take between four and five months.”</p>
              <p>Ivan Gazidis, the club’s chief executive, revealed this week that Wenger will have money to spend in the January transfer window, and the latest news suggests a striker will be his priority.</p>
              <p>Van Persie had been Arsenal’s main forward following the sale of Emmanuel Adebayor in the summer, scoring eight goals in 15 games. But with Nicklas Bendtner injured, Eduardo still finding his fitness after a long injury layoff, and Theo Walcott not considered ready for a central striking role, Wenger will look for an established striker, with Marouane Chamakh of Bordeaux a likely target.</p>
              <p>Real Madrid’s Ruud van Nistelrooy has been linked with a move to the Premier League in January but Wenger, who is renowned for unearthing talent at bargain prices, is understood to have little interest in signing him. Wenger is thought to have been monitoring the progress of the 23-year-old Toulouse striker André-Pierre Gignac, who was the leading goalscorer in the French first division last season.</p>
              <p>Gazidis said: “We never get into the details of how much money is available but we can invest in the transfer market if Arsène Wenger believes that’s what he wants to do. But fundamentally I think he thinks for a player to be able to break into the squad and make a contribution they have to be a special player.”</p>
              <p>Meanwhile Argentina striker Sergio Aguero has said he will not leave Atletico Madrid for Chelsea. Aguero is being talked about as a possible signing during the transfer window with Chelsea set to lose Michael Essien, Didier Drogba, Salomon Kalou and John Obi Mikel on African Cup of Nations duty. But Aguero said: “I’m committed to the team and I’m not moving in the winter, whatever anyone says.”</p>
