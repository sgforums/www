              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">GARY CAHILL will swap the relegation scrap for a title battle with a £7million switch to Chelsea next month.</h2>
              <p>Bolton will allow the centre-back to discuss personal terms as soon as the busy Christmas period is over after a fee was agreed.</p>
              <p>Cahill will complete his dream deal in early January, barring any late hiccups.</p>
              <p>Tottenham — long-time admirers of the Bolton star — could yet make a dramatic move to scupper the deal with a late bid.</p>
              <p>But Cahill, who is out of contract at the end of the season, believes his future lies at Stamford Bridge in a move that will boost his chances of making England's Euro 2012 squad.</p>
              <p>Boss Andre Villas Boas' Chelsea defence has come under fire this season and he was hugely impressed by Cahill's recent England displays alongside skipper John Terry.</p>
              <p>Chelsea starlet Josh McEachran — initially touted to spend the rest of the season at Bolton — will NOT be heading north.</p>
              <p>Boss Owen Coyle already has Gael Kakuta from Stamford Bridge on a short-term basis and rules prevent taking two players on loan from the same club in a campaign.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Chelsea have opened formal talks with Bolton Wanderers aimed at deflecting long-standing interest from Tottenham Hotspur in Gary Cahill and at securing the England centre-half for around £7m when the transfer window opens.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Cahill will enter the final six months of his contract at the Reebok Stadium in the new year and Bolton are resigned to the fact that he will not agree new terms to remain at the club.</p>
              <p>That has left the Premier League strugglers seeking a fee for his services now in the hope that Owen Coyle will be able to sign a replacement in the January window, and Chelsea are confident the 26-year-old will reprise at Stamford Bridge the central defensive partnership with John Terry that has proved effective for England recently.</p>
              <p>André Villas-Boas confirmed this week that Chelsea were monitoring Cahill's situation and, with the Brazil international Alex placed on the transfer list and sidelined, a centre-half has become a priority in the market. "Regarding Gary Cahill, there has been dialogue between ourselves and Chelsea," Coyle said. "He is a top player and is [still] fully focused on Bolton. That doesn't surprise me. I've said from day one I believe Gary Cahill can play for anybody, I think he has those qualities.</p>
              <p>"There is serious interest in Gary, but I've got to say we have two huge games before 1 January [against Newcastle and Wolverhampton Wanderers], before anything could happen. More than his ability, he's an outstanding man, and because of the lad he is his focus will be doing the best for his team-mates, who he's stood shoulder to shoulder with for years here, and trying to help them get points in these two games. Then whatever January brings, so be it. There's nothing signed and sealed at the moment but it's fair to say there has been dialogue [with Chelsea]. I've got to be up front and tell you, as I always do, and that's the situation."</p>
              <p>Tottenham were close to securing Cahill on transfer deadline day in August but could not agree a fee, a failure that scuppered Sébastien Bassong's proposed move to Queens Park Rangers. Arsenal were also linked heavily with the former Aston Villa defender, though Arsène Wenger confirmed on Friday that he had adequate cover in central defence and is not looking to strengthen in that area.</p>
              <p>Terry, meanwhile, has drawn praise from Tottenham's Emmanuel Adebayor and Ledley King for his strength of character after he excelled in Thursday's draw at White Hart Lane on his first appearance since the Crown Prosecution Service confirmed he has a case to answer over an alleged racist remark directed at Queens Park Rangers' Anton Ferdinand. Terry has denied wrongdoing.</p>
              <p>"John Terry showed great personality, great character and did very well," Adebayor said. "You learn to deal with things through experience. It's not the first problem he's had in his life, or in his career. He has had a couple of problems already and he knows how to deal with them."</p>
              <p>Those sentiments were echoed by King, the Tottenham captain and a former England team-mate of Terry's. "He played well, as did the rest of them," said King. "But he's a top player. He's got himself in the right position and saved his team at the end [after Adebayor's shot passed Petr Cech]. He's a strong character and lets his football do the talking out there. It doesn't surprise me that, with all that's happening off the pitch, he's able to put in performances like that."</p>

              <p>Chelsea and owner Roman Abramovich are hell-bent on closing the gap on the runaway Manchester clubs.</p>
              <p>Top targets include £50m-rated striker Edinson Cavani and his Napoli midfield team-mate Marek Hamsik, who is valued at £30m.</p>
              <p>Ironically, Chelsea face the Italian side in the Champions League last 16, with Hamsik, 24, insisting: "They are a great club — we are up against a very strong team."</p>
              <p>The Blues have come up short so far in AVB's first season in charge.</p>
              <p>But Abramovich is determined to stand by his man and give him the ammunition to make them title contenders again.</p>
              <p>Chelsea are also reportedly interested in Juventus winger and Manchester United target Milos Krasic — rated at £20m.</p>
              <p>However, the Blues' first signing of 2012 will be far cheaper in the shape of Gary Cahill, who is set to leave Bolton for £7m.</p>
              <p>Struggling Wanderers have indicated they are ready to sell the centre-half, 26, and he is expected to link up alongside England partner John Terry.</p>

              <p>Bolton accepted a £7million bid for the 26-year-old England defender last night.</p>
              <p>But Blues boss AVB revealed they are still 'miles apart' from agreeing personal terms.</p>
              <p>It is believed Cahill's camp are asking for £100,000-a-week — £30,000 more than Chelsea are ready to pay.</p>
              <p>Villas-Boas admitted: "I'm not sure if Gary is going to join us.</p>
              <p>"We are still very far away in terms of agreement — miles apart.</p>
              <p>"I think we can sort it out but we also have other targets for this position and we will continue to monitor them."</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool are trying to gazump Chelsea’s move for Gary Cahill.</strong></p>
              <p>The highly-rated Bolton and England defender, 26, had been expected to join the Blues after a £7milllion transfer fee was agreed this week.</p>
              <p>But the bid was threatened by a disagreement over personal terms and Kenny Dalglish is poised to swoop.</p>
              <p>Cahill, who is out of contract this summer, is understood to prefer staying in the north.</p>
              <p>Kop boss Dalglish is a big admirer of the centre-back who would compete for a place with the injury-prone Daniel Agger, Martin Skrtel and Jamie Carragher at Anfield.</p>
              <p>It was believed that Chelsea had already wrapped up the race for Cahill’s signature.</p>
              <p>Bolton chief Owen Coyle said yesterday: “There has been a fee agreed between the clubs and we have now given Gary’s representatives­ permission to speak to Chelsea.”</p>
              <p>But Stamford Bridge manager Andre Villas-Boas later revealed that talks with Cahill had hit a snag, before appearing to suggest he was looking at alternatives.</p>
              <p>Villas Boas said: “We’re still miles apart regarding agreement with the player. We’ll continue to monitor this situation, as we continue to monitor others.</p>
              <p>“I think his technical attributes are immense and his pace is fantastic as well.</p>
              <p>“He is a player that at international­ level has been playing well. He can add to this squad, or any squad in the Premier League.”</p>
              <p>Cahill joined Bolton for £5m from Aston Villa in January 2008.</p>
              <p>He made his first England start in the 1-1 friendly draw with Ghana, at Wembley, in March, and got his first Three Lions goal in September’s­ 3-0 Euro 2012 qualifying victory in Bulgaria.</p>
