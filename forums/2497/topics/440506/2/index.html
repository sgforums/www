              <h1>Chelsea 3 Arsenal 5: Terry the fall-guy as sloppy Blues hit skid row <br></h1>

              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>
              </span></p><p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'> </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>John Terry's slip and fall face-first into the turf as Robin van Persie stole Arsenal's fourth goal at Stamford Bridge on Saturday symbolised the misery of a traumatic week in the life of the England captain.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Only the FA have the power to decide if Terry will ever stand tall again, as they investigate an accusation - denied by Terry - that he racially abused Queens Park Rangers' Anton Ferdinand seven days ago. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But another investigation, if less demanding in its remit, will involve Terry. After their skipper - who else? - had given Chelsea a 2-1 lead moments before half-time, a pall of gloom descended over the corner of the ground accommodating Arsenal's travelling supporters.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Having been humiliated at Old Trafford by Manchester United and beaten at home by Liverpool, there was a suspicion that another afternoon in the company of one of the country's most consistent football clubs would pass without reward.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Instead, Chelsea's defence developed a fragility that would never have been countenanced by the Portuguese manager who ran this club before the appointment of Andre Villas-Boas. Jose Mourinho took umbrage at losing one goal at Stamford Bridge … in a month of Sundays.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/10/29/article-2055003-0E95488600000578-585_634x379.jpg" alt="Early miss: Chelsea fans taunt Robin van Persie for a miss in front of goal" width="634" height="379"> </span>
              </p><p class="imageCaption">Early miss: Chelsea fans taunt Robin van Persie for a miss in front of goal</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <p> </p>
              <span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>
              <p> </p>
              
              <p>
              </p><p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Even if we eliminate blame for Arsenal's fifth, when Van Persie completed a memorable hat-trick deep into injury-time, Terry had long since looked bewildered as all sense of organisation crumbled around him. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Of course, there is a nobility in Villas-Boas's determination to allow Chelsea to play with freedom, to attack on instinct, yet there is also a recklessness to this policy that could stop them mounting a serious challenge for the Premier League title. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Worse, it could leave them excessively vulnerable once the Champions League reaches the knockout stages. Chelsea's Russian oligarch proprietor, Roman Abramovich, takes unkindly to such failure.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Arsenal's win was deserved even if they had some fortune during an unconvincing opening period. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Inevitably, Terry's reaction to a week of questioning, and stern-faced meetings with lawyers and advisers as he has dealt with the most serious of all the controversies that have punctuated his career, would command attention at Stamford Bridge.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Villas-Boas had wrapped a fraternal arm around Terry, a man only four years younger than him, all week. The manager even went as Terry the fall-guy as Van Persie so ruthless as Arsenal turn more heat on Blues captain far as dedicating Chelsea's Carling Cup win at Everton to his 30-yea-rold captain as the furore around Terry's language at Loftus Road refused to die down.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>When Terry led Chelsea out yesterday, he held the hand of a young, white mascot, while being flanked on his other side by another youthful mascot of mixed race. In case there was any ambiguity in Chelsea's defence of their beleaguered captain, Terry's portrait, in his best statesman-like pose, was on the cover of the match programme. And in the corner of the Matthew Harding Stand a hand-crafted flag was unfurled, briefly. It read: 'JT is not a racist'.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Against this backdrop of support, no one could have guessed the way Chelsea and Terry's afternoon would deteriorate after Frank Lampard headed them in front in the 14th minute. His astute finish, from a smartly delivered cross by Juan Mata, will pass into the annals of club history as Chelsea's 6,000th League goal. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But Arsenal's fleet-footed football brought them a worthy equaliser in the 36th minute. A pass from Aaron Ramsey invited Gervinho to place a square ball for Van Persie to stroke into an empty net as Petr Cech advanced from his line. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Then came the moment for which Terry might have prayed all week. When Lampard drove a 45th-minute corner into the area, Terry brushed aside Per Mertesacker to score with a low shot inside Wojciech Szczesny's right-hand post.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>In front of Arsenal's fans, Terry vanished from sight as Chelsea's players rushed to his side, as though hurtling to a scene of an accident, to shower him with affection.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>He trotted back in front of Chelsea fans in the East Stand thumping a fist against the badge on his shirt. For this short, sharp interlude he was again a prince of all he surveyed. But the fates were not smiling on him. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Four minutes after the interval a clever turn from Alex Song released Andre Santos down the left. The Brazilian full-back equalised without a defender in sight.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Perhaps Arsenal's one moment of luck occurred a minute later. Szczesny careered outside his penalty area and clattered into Ashley Cole. Nervously, Arsenal's goalkeeper waited to see the colour of the card referee Andre Marriner would brandish: yellow, as it transpired. Later, Szczesny admitted: 'I don't know why I stayed on the pitch.' </span></p>

              <p>Andre Villas-Boas was bought in to brighten the place up and get Chelsea playing the attacking football Roman Abramovich craves.</p>
              <p>Sadly, the stable door is not so much ajar as wide open with a galeforce wind whipping up off the Thames and blowing right through it.</p>
              <p>There were always going to be unfavourable comparisons with Jose Mourinho if things went wrong for his Portuguese protege at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>And after the shambolic 5-3 defeat by Arsenal, the stats are growing increasingly grim. In 10 league games this term, Chelsea have conceded 15 goals — as many as Mourinho's team let in winning the title in the <strong>ENTIRE</strong> 2004-2005 campaign.</p>
              <p>In fact, the five shipped against Arsenal was just one less than the six surrendered in all 19 home league games that season.</p>
              <p>In terms of league defeats — three in the first 10 games — it's the worst start by <strong>ANY</strong> Blues boss under Abramovich.</p>
              <p>It took Claudio Ranieri 18 games before he lost three. It took Mourinho an extraordinary 64. Yes, <strong>SIXTY-FOUR</strong>.</p>
              <p>Avram Grant was beaten in just two of his first 32 — including his first at Old Trafford — and still vacated his post.</p>
              <p>Phil Scolari lost three of 21, four of 25 and was fired. And, finally, Carlo Ancelotti. He lost three of the opening 15 — and six in all — but still won the Double.</p>
              <p>Even in his second season, there was only one defeat in the first 10 though this would rise to four in 14 and six in 21. And we all know what happened there.</p>
              <p>Under Villas-Boas, Chelsea have failed to keep a clean sheet in nine league games, their worst run for a decade.</p>
              <p>OK, we know statistics don't tell the whole story but there is some damning evidence here.</p>
              <p>We also know a young manager should be given time. Even Abramovich, with his notoriously itchy trigger-finger, must appreciate this.</p>
              <p>Yet Chelsea fans trooping disconsolately away from Stamford Bridge on Saturday must be seriously concerned.</p>
              <p>Incredibly, their own defence was as poor after the break as Arsenal's had been before it.</p>
              <p>And this is taking into account the lumbering, out of position Per Mertesacker — at fault for both of Chelsea's opening two goals — and Andre Santos, who for 45 minutes gave one of the poorest full-back displays seen this season.</p>
              <p>And yet after half-time Chelsea turned into a carbon copy of their north London rivals.</p>
              <p>Sure, Arsene Wenger's side are quick on the break and have Robin van Persie in the form of his life.</p>
              <p>But it was still a shock to see how easily unhinged the Chelsea back four became, as slow on the turn as waxworks, a veritable defensive chamber of horrors.</p>
              <p>Then, again, this has been creeping up on them. Jose Bosingwa is as good going forward as Santos appeared after the break.</p>
              <p>But he is as equally a liability when it comes to positional play — totally exposed by Arsenal's Brazilian full-back for the Gunners' second equaliser.</p>
              <p>And then we come to the heart of the problem — central defence.</p>
              <p>Under Mourinho, John Terry and Ricardo Carvalho formed a near impenetrable barrier.</p>
              <p>Carvalho allowed Terry to play, covered for him and the England skipper did the same.</p>
              <p>Terry, of course, is now five years older. But he is not helped by a lack of a regular partner.</p>
              <p>Alex isn't rated by Villas- Boas and could well be sold in January while David Luiz, despite a great touch and easy, languid movement going forward, is another with defensive weak link.</p>
              <p>To discover this after forking out £21million is a high price to pay.</p>
              <p>Which leaves Branislav Ivanovic. Athletic, powerful, he is the best of the three though too similar to Terry and, like his captain, susceptible to a quick-turning player as we saw when both were left for dead by Theo Walcott for Arsenal's third.</p>
              <p>Only now are people realising just what an accomplished defender Carvalho was.</p>
              <p>And, finally, Petr Cech. To be beaten three times at your near post is a worrying sign of increasing vulnerability.</p>
              <p>As was Chelsea's lack of midfield bite and another anonymous showing from the allegedly revitalised Fernando Torres.</p>
              <p>That this was also, supposedly, Chelsea's best side leaves AVB4 with much work to do.</p>
