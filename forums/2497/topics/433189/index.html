              <p><strong>I said before Ashley Young signed for Manchester United that </strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">I wasn’t sure if he was ready</span></strong><strong> and now it’s up to him to show that he is. </strong></p>
              <p>He needs to improve an extra 15 or 20 per cent to be able to hold his own in the sort of quality company he will be keeping.</p>
              <p>If he can do that, then he will become a top player.</p>
              <p>Speaking from experience, when you go to a top team with top players, it kicks you on. The standard is that much higher and you have to raise your game to reach it.</p>
              </div>
              <p>That’s the challenge facing Young now to show he can raise his game to Manchester United’s high standard.</p>
              <p>There can be no excuses from him. He plays for England, he knows what it’s all about and he’s gone to the right club.</p>
              <p>Manchester United’s whole philosophy is built on playing attacking football and he will see more of the ball than he did at Villa.</p>
              <p>That’s the only ‘if’ for me from his move and overall I think it’s a good bit of business for Manchester United.</p>
              <p>You look at the sort of money being quoted for the likes of Neymar and Sanchez and it’s crazy.</p>
              <p>They’re unproven in the Premier League, can’t speak the language and wouldn’t be used to the pace or physicality of the English game.</p>
              <p>Young has none of those negative points against him and Manchester United are picking him up for just £16million at the age of 25.</p>
              <p>He did well at Watford, improved at Aston Villa and now Manchester United are going to get the best of him.</p>
              <p>He has a good assists record, can play on either flank and he has also shown for England that he can come inside and play off the striker.</p>
              <p>He will be under less pressure at Manchester United, whereas at Villa he was the main man and their best player.</p>
              <p>He was the one under pressure to provide that creative spark and set up Darren Bent.</p>
              <p>At Manchester United the opposition will also have to worry about the likes of Hernandez, Rooney and Nani and he can operate under the radar a little bit.</p>
              <p>He won’t be under pressure to be their match winner every week like maybe he was at Villa.</p>
              <p>Manchester United did well when they picked up Phil Jones for around £16million and signing Young for the same money is another bit of good business.</p>

              </div>
              <div style="margin: 0px 0px 15px;">
              <p class="v5-txt-strong"><strong>Fabian Delph accepts it is going to be 'very hard' for Aston Villa to find a replacement for Ashley Young following his move to Manchester United. </strong></p>
              <span class="lingo_region">
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Young</span><span style="color: #000000;"> has signed a five-year contract with the Premier League champions to leave Villa with a gaping hole to fill before the start of the new season.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Promising midfielder </span><span style="color: #000000;">Delph</span> paid tribute to his former team-mate's qualities and is hoping Villa can find a player capable of replicating the England winger's impact.</p>
              <p>Delph told the <em>Birmingham Mail</em>: "It happens all the time, it's football. People come and go and you have just got to deal with it and just keep going.</p>
              <h4>Unbelievable</h4>
              <p>"I don't think he could be replaced, to be honest with you. His all-round work ethic was absolutely unbelievable. He must have run twice as much as most people on the pitch.</p>
              <p>"With his goals and assists, it will be very hard to replace him but if we can get somebody here half as good as him, then he would still be a great player.</p>
              <p>"You get a lot of players who are not selfish, but do more of their work in the attacking half of the pitch, whereas Youngy is up and down, when he's on the right-hand side especially, working hard for the boys.</p>
              <p>"The lads appreciate that from a winger who has flair, but still wants to graft."</p>
