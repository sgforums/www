              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Mark Hughes</span></abbr> intends to make only minimal adjustments to his squad when the transfer window reopens in January.</p>
              <p>After attending a City board meeting in Abu Dhabi this week, Hughes emphasised that the days of wholesale changes were over.</p>
              <p>He said: "What people must understand is that our business in the last window was unprecedented. That will not happen again.</p>
              <p>"This notion that we will throw money at whatever player, that is not the case.</p>
              <p>"We do not feel we need to go into the market to the extent we did in the last two windows.</p>
              <p>"It about looking at players for areas of the team that still need
              strengthening. Those are the ones we will target. It will not be
              wholesale comings and goings, I can assure you of that."</p>
              <p>Hughes believes they are making good progress.</p>
              <p>He said: "Positive messages came out of the board meeting. We
              are very pleased with the way things are going from a football point of
              view and a business point of view.</p>
              <p>"We are in good shape. It is about making sure we continue in the same vein."</p>
              <p>Hughes scoffed at the perceived difficulty of team spirit with
              such a quickly assembled squad, saying: "People were suggesting the
              gelling of the team might be a difficulty for us but it is plainly
              obvious we have addressed that.</p>
              <p>"The team has come together very quickly - they are good
              players. It is easier for good players to have an understanding of what
              is required.</p>
              <p>"We are very comfortable with how the season has started. It is
              only a positive start, that's all. It is a platform for us to go
              forward."</p>
              <p>City have already taken seven points on the road this season after amassing only 11 in the whole of last campaign.</p>
              <p>Hughes said: "We have more players with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> experience, who have an understanding of what is needed to win games at this level.</p>
              <p>"We look more solid. Sometimes you have to dig in more when you are away in the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> and we have been able to do that. We are pleased at how things are going in that respect. It is a marked improvement."</p>
