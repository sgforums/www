              <p>There is one story plastered across the back pages
              of Tuesday's newspapers and that is Rafa Benitez's demand for Liverpool
              to be given the credit they deserve for their European exploits.</p>
              <p>Speaking ahead of the Reds' clash with Real Madrid in the last 16 of
              the Champions League Benitez pointed out that Liverpool are the best
              team in Europe in UEFA's coefficient rankings and thinks the media
              should be more positive in their coverage.</p>
              <p>It is therefore somewhat ironic that <em>The Sun</em> interpreted this in typically sensational fashion claiming it was Rafa
              Rant II as he roared: You lot don't appreciate us enough!</p>
              <p>What the Spaniard actually said was: "I don't think the messages
              about our performance have been as positive as they could have been."</p>
              <p>"But when you look at what we have done in reaching two finals and a
              semi, it means a lot of credit for the players, a lot of memories for
              the club and a lot of money too."</p>
              <p>The <em>Daily Mail</em> take a slightly softer stance, claiming Rafa is simply demanding a little more respect.</p>
              <p>"The UEFA findings show we have the best record in Europe over the
              last five years,' Benitez told the newspaper. ‚ÄùWe have won it once,
              reached the final another time and have always been challenging in the
              later stages. Yet some of the messages still coming my way are not the
              best."</p>
              <p>The <em>Daily Star</em> also focus on Benitez and report that he has vowed to beat Real Madrid
              and Manchester United as his side continue to battle for European glory
              and the domestic title.</p>
              <p>The Reds face Real on Tuesday and Premier League leaders United on
              Saturday and Benitez insists his team will triumph in both games.</p>
              <p>"At this stage of the season I would not be happy with just the
              Champions League, I want both," Benitez said. "If we beat Real we will
              be in a good position in the Champions League ... If we beat United we
              will still be in the title race. I want to win both and believe we can."</p>
              <p>The <em>Daily Mirror</em> report that Real coach Juande Ramos has turned up the heat on his
              opposite number ahead of the European clash by branding his Liverpool
              side boring and claiming their victory in the first leg was
              'undeserved'.</p>
              <p>"Liverpool came to Madrid not to play football at all, but to try to
              force a 0-0," Ramos complained. "They will play the same way at
              Anfield. We know what they are like, I am sure of that."</p>
              <p>In other news, Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo has admitted he is struggling to control his anger as opponents continue to kick him.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo, who can expect more rough stuff against Inter Milan on Wednesday, told <em>The Sun</em>:
              "I am a target of course so it is difficult to avoid certain things. I
              try to control my anger. Sometimes it's not easy, though, and it is
              something I have to improve on."</p>
              <p>United team-mate Patrice Evra reveals in the <em>Daily Star</em> that he thinks the Red Devils can win the Quintuple this season because of their miserly defence.</p>
              <p>"Winning these five trophies would be the stuff of legend. We are
              hungry for it," Evra said. "It's true that last year we won the league
              and Champions League, but we want even more this year."</p>
              <p>Guus Hiddink is considering handing Michael Essien his first Chelsea start in more than six months in Tuesday's critical Champions League knockout tie at Juventus, according <em>The Guardian</em>.</p>
              <p>The Ghanaian, who ruptured an anterior cruciate ligament in September, could feature on the right of midfield.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Juve manager Claudio Ranieri claims the widening gulf between Italian and English clubs is purely down to money.</p>
              <p>"I would not say we have an inferiority complex," Ranieri told the <em>Daily Express</em>.
              "If there is any inferiority complex at all, then it is about having
              less money, but that is not a complex but a circumstance."</p>
              <p>It was Ranieri himself who was one of the first to benefit from
              English football's new-found wealth - spending Roman Abramovich's
              millions as manager of Chelsea.</p>
