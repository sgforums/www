              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/liverpool/gerrard_steve_benitez_rafa_stare480.jpg" alt="" width="479" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>Steven Gerrard has issued a
              rallying cry to Liverpool fans and team-mates, insisting ‘our season is
              still alive’ both domestically and in Europe. </strong></p>
              <p>The Reds’ early Premier League title charge this season looked to be
              as credible as it has been throughout Rafa Benitez’s reign but seems to
              have tailed off in recent weeks.</p>
              <p>The Spaniard has nevertheless weaved his usual magic in the
              Champions League, guiding the club to a 1-0 first leg win over Real
              Madrid that has put them in pole position to progress to the last
              eight.</p>
              <p>Manchester United’s domestic lead stands at seven points in addition
              to the game they have in hand on both Liverpool and Chelsea, but
              Gerrard is desperate that all involved at Anfield remain optimistic
              after Tuesday’s win over Sunderland.</p>
              <p>"It was a comfortable win and it lifted everybody," he said on the
              club’s official website. "We've struggled at home this season but in
              midweek we were patient and got our rewards. It was important to bounce
              back with a win and a good performance.</p>
              <p>"The following night it was frustrating watching Newcastle play
              United because there were times when I thought United could drop
              points. Newcastle went in front and then I was off the couch when they
              almost scored a second.</p>
              <p>"United seem to be playing well and getting the results but if teams
              believe they can take points off them then I am sure it will happen
              sooner or later. It's important for us not to let the gap get any
              bigger and if they make mistakes we have to be ready to pounce. Of
              course, we all know how big our game at Old Trafford is going to be.</p>
              <p>"Our season is still very much alive. We're not giving up in the
              title race and we're 1-0 up in the Champions League and one win away
              from a place in the last eight.</p>
              <p>"It's important people stay positive and upbeat and not be down or worried about things."</p>
              <p>The Liverpool skipper went on to express his hope that Fernando
              Torres recover from injury in time for next week’s second leg with
              Madrid so the pair can reunite a partnership which has been scarcely
              seen this season.</p>
              <p>"It's been frustrating because I certainly love playing with him and
              from reading some of the things he's said, he loves playing with me,"
              said the England midfielder.</p>
              <p>"Ideally we want to end the season playing together and performing for the team.</p>
              <p>"I spoke to him a couple of days ago and he seems very optimistic so
              fingers crossed he can pull through for Tuesday because you know how
              much I like playing against Everton, and I'm sure it's the same for him
              playing against Madrid."</p>
