              <p><strong>10  Gabriel Obertan (Manchester United)</strong> - Hailed as the next big 
              thing to come out of France, United fans have barely had the chance to 
              see Obertan in action with just six league games under his belt. At £3 
              million it's hardly the flop of the season, but after all the hype, 
              United fans will be wondering when the young Frenchman will make an 
              impact.<br> <strong><br> 9 Stewart Downing (Aston Villa)</strong> - Constantly lauded as 'England's 
              next big left midfielder' it's a surprise to see that Downing is now 25 
              and no longer a fresh-faced youngster. With Middlesbrough's demise a 
              £12m move to Aston Villa seemed like the perfect answer - but the winger
               has been poor for the Villans and often lost out to James Milner and 
              Ashley Young in the Villa midfield.<br> <strong><br> 8 Nikola Kalinic (Blackburn)</strong> - Perhaps harsh to include a forward 
              who plays for the team that struggles to score goals, but just two 
              league nettings all season is a poor return by anyone's standard. Even 
              Tommy Smith has scored more. The Croatian has looked neat but way too 
              ineffective, and is a flop at the kind of cash - £6m - that Blackburn 
              can't exactly afford to waste.<br> <br> <strong>7 Kamel Ghilas (Hull)</strong> - Have you heard of Kamel Ghilas? No? 
              Neither have most fans, but the Frenchman persuaded Hull to spend nearly
               £2m on him in the summer. A return of one solitary goal from 16 games 
              is relegation form for sure. Apt, seeing as Hull are careering towards 
              the drop in some style.<br> <br> <strong>6 Sotirios Kyrgiakos (Liverpool)</strong> - Kyrgiakos became the first 
              ever Greek player to play for Liverpool when he completed a £2m move in 
              August, but it's unlikely they will be heading back to southern Europe 
              any time soon if the defender's performances are anything to go by. 
              Clanger-prone and fan of the odd rash challenge  - just ask Everton's 
              Marouane Fellaini who still hasn't recovered from Kyrgiakos' studs in 
              the Merseyside derby - the James Bond baddie lookalike has, oddly, 
              become something of a cult hero at Anfield.<br> <br> <strong>5 Jason Scotland (Wigan)</strong> - Roberto Martinez must have run out of 
              first-choice targets in July, as he dipped into the Championship to sign
               Swansea's Jason Scotland for £2m. Wigan fans had to wait ten staggering
               months for the Trinidadian to net his first league goal. £2m well 
              spent? Hardly.<br> <br> <strong>4 Patrick Vieira (Manchester City)</strong> - Not the sort of signing City
               fans had in mind when the Abu Dhabi millions were transferred to the 
              Eastlands coffers, the ageing Frenchman was Roberto Mancini's first new 
              face after taking over from Mark Hughes. The former Arsenal captain has 
              looked sluggish and uninterested since arriving, and managed to get sent
               off in his first few games.<br> <br> <strong>3 Mido (West Ham)</strong> - If you've ever wondered why Mido plays like 
              he doesn't care, it's because he comes from a very rich family and it 
              doesn't really matter where his next contract comes from. Indeed, he is 
              currently playing for £1,000 a week at West Ham, making him the lowest 
              paid Premier League footballer by some way. He made the gesture because 
              he wanted to "prove himself" back in England, but has been awful, and 
              missed a tame penalty at Everton recently.<br> <br> <strong>2 Roque Santa Cruz (Manchester City)</strong> - It is no secret that you 
              have to pay through the nose for top class quality these days, but for 
              £17.5m you'd expect better than four goals in 19 games. While Tevez - at
               an even more costly £40m - has been banging in the goals for City, 
              Santa Cruz has looked a shadow of the striker who scored 29 in 69 for 
              Blackburn Rovers. Like someone on their last roll at Vegas, Santa Cruz 
              has been an expensive gamble which failed.<br> <br> <strong>1 Alberto Aquilani (Liverpool)</strong> - The Italian's summer signing was
               supposed to soften the blow of losing Xabi Alonso to Real Madrid, with a
               large chunk of the £30m the Reds received for the Spaniard splashed on 
              bringing Aquilani from Roma. But an ankle injury that lasted longer than
               a James Cameron film delayed his debut and to date he's only played 21 
              games this season, a mere eight as a starter.</p>
