HiddinkÂ’s admission comes at a time when there is fresh speculation about the future of Mourinho, whose team beat Macclesfield 6-1 in the FA Cup third round yesterday.<br><br>If Chelsea fail to win the Champions League, despite recruiting superstars Andriy Shevchenko, Michael Ballack and Ashley Cole, MourinhoÂ’s future would be uncertain, even though Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon insists that the Portuguese will be in charge next season.<br><br>HiddinkÂ’s vision of open, attacking play contrasts with ChelseaÂ’s current functional style and more closely fits with the approach Abramovich is said to prefer.<br><br>He took over as coach of the Russia team in 2005, after being recruited by Abramovich and the president of the Russian FA, Vitali Mutko, but has now prepared his assistant, Alexander Borodjuk, to take charge.<br><br>Hiddink, whose deal runs out in 2008, said: "ItÂ’s really time to say in Russia 'Borodjuk takes over now'.I have the energy to go and do something new and get a lot of satisfaction out of that. The past few years I have enjoyed a lot of successes. IÂ’m grooming my assistant as a top-class coach so IÂ’m no longer needed soon."<br><br>Hiddink gave an insight into his relationship with Abramovich which is sure to unnerve Mourinho.<br><br>Talking about the problems of coaching Russia, who play England in two Euro 2008 qualifiers this autumn, Hiddink, said: "Abramovich has created a massive football academy here (in Russia). But he told me that Russia has not played a significant role in football for 10 years. He asked me if I could give him a helping hand.<br><br>"He was here the other day. He and I talked for a while about a number of things. He stays in the background and he is not pushy with things. I get on with him very well."<br><br>Last month, Abramovich said he and Mourinho Â‘did not have friendly relations but they are warm enoughÂ’.<br><br>HiddinkÂ’s interview was published yesterday in Elf Magazine in Holland. Frank Arnesen, now a key executive at Chelsea,was director of football at PSV when Hiddink was coach there.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Not good if mourinho leave... cos Guus Hiddink is a good coach/manager and without the nonsense... chelsea may actually be likeable even after spending more money cos Hiddink seems to have good PR skills too</span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

All the signs are that The Special One is ready to spread his wings and prove himself once more in another country.<br><br>Italy is favourite, but Spain is another possible destination. And if he does not jump, he might be pushed anyway.<br><br>Many Chelsea players believe Mourinho is on his way, either on his own terms or those of owner Roman Abramovich. It is like being in the Big Brother House. They have seen and heard enough of each other and something has to give.<br><br>Abramovich is getting increasingly cosy with his old pal Guus Hiddink, the Dutchman strongly tipped to take over at The Bridge. Hiddink is currently in charge of the Russian national team, an arrangement brokered by Abramovich who admitted in a recent interview he and Mourinho are Â‘not closeÂ’.<br><br>Mourinho almost quit last season and has admitted he thought about going, safe in the knowledge Inter Milan were desperate for his services. In an interview with SunSport in December, Mourinho said: Â“I was a bit fed up with certain things. Â“But if you go to another club and another country you will find different problems.<br><br>Â“There is not the perfect club, the perfect country, the perfect competition or perfect manager.Â” In the end Mourinho backed off but Abramovich wants to decide when his managers stay or go. It is his train set and he is the controller.<br><br>MourinhoÂ’s behaviour has caused increasing concern in the corridors of power. The board have been alarmed by some of the bosses pronouncements, such as the attack on Â£30million striker Andriy Shevchenko, a friend of Abramovich.<br><br>The view is that Mourinho should be capable of getting the best out of the likes of Shevchenko and Michael Ballack rather than moaning. Mourinho also said in last monthÂ’s interview he would walk out if Abramovich told him to pick Shevchenko.<br><br>Â“He would never do that,Â” said Mourinho. Â“If he did, it would be because he doesnÂ’t trust the manager. Â“If he doesnÂ’t trust the manager, he has enough money to sack me, to give me my compensation, send me home and bring another one in. Â“The day he doesnÂ’t respect me, just give me the cheque and send me home.Â”<br><br>That day may be approaching.<br><br></div>

Mour wanted shev just as much as any manager in the league... Likewise with Ballacks too, Man u and Real wanted him but they couldn't afford the salary chelsea were offering him. Before shev came, no one had any idea that he could or would be a flop... Here was a European footballer of the year, i think a few times... So there was no reason not to want him. Mour even said this on the day he signed...<br><br><span style="color: olive;">Today is a day when the dream became reality. Andriy has always been my first choice for Chelsea since I arrived. Before it was not possible, now it is for real. He has great qualities, ambition, discipline, tactical awareness and of course he is a great goalscorer. I did not need to meet with him to convince him about Chelsea, in the same way we did not need to talk a lot about why I wanted him. Everybody knows him as a player, tactically he can play in the Chelsea system no doubt"</span><br><br>So to push the blame to Roman its not fair... cos he used a lot of his money to support his manager. You could even say he is probably the best boss any manager could have. Anyway, it could be the tactics mour employs that could be at fault. We have seen 35 yrs old Larrson come in and do well immediately and i don't think he is even a European Footballer of the year before and he is also 35 compare to shev 30.<br><br>I really do feel that it could be Lampard and one or two others... They don't seem to pass or create enough for the forwards only thinking of shooting it themselves. This could also hurt the strikers confidence in time...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>

People will close an eye to all the problems he creates... But when the team is not doing well... These people will dig up all the problems he created and come for him.<br><br>With his arrogant ways... i won't be too surprise that he could make some people very unhappy with him at the Bridge... Therefore it is just a matter of time before he is gone... Even if he manage to stay back this year... Those boardroom management people will know that he is not good for their image across the world... If they want to be a top club in the world... They must make it more easier for people to like them but what mour does is the opposite...<br><br>Inter Milan are touted as the most likely destination for Mourinho.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>It would be easy and winning the title is like picking cherries in the field...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

I can't see how they can be a likeable club to the world but these talk could also work for him by motivating his players to give their all...  Though i seriously belief Guus Hiddink is a better coach than him... and without the nonsense.<br><br>And should he leave... the next manager will probably be someone that is more willing to be behind the scene at the back of the team rather than the star of it like mour...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

But Kenyon told the China Daily: "This is an old story that is being re-run. I think it is probably because we are six points behind Manchester United. "Such is the intensity in England. But there is absolutely no truth in it."<br><br>Mourinho has led his side to three points from the last nine in the Premiership as Chelsea have lost ground to United in the race for the Premiership title. Andriy Shevchenko and Michael Ballack have failed to produce their best after high-profile moves to Stamford Bridge and the pressure is intensifying on Mourinho as the Blues' league form stutters.<br><br>Kenyon was more keen, however, to highlight the positives of the season so far, with Chelsea still challenging on four fronts. "You've got to look where we are," added Kenyon. "We're second in the league and behind by six points, with arguably the toughest part of the season still to come.<br><br>"We qualified top of the group in the Champions League, which, again, was arguably one of the toughest groups. "We're in the semi-final of the Carling Cup and through to the fourth round of the FA Cup."<br><br></div>
