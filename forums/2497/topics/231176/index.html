The fed-up Blues boss told a close pal yesterday that he will walk out in May.</strong><br><br>Mourinho said: Â“ThatÂ’s it. IÂ’m going at the end of the season . . . I donÂ’t know where yet.Â” He is sick of being undermined at Stamford Bridge Â— and is angry at the way Frank Arnesen, the clubÂ’s chief scout, has taken on a bigger role than he was promised.<br><br>Arnesen has now been put in charge of transfers and Mourinho blames him for selling William Gallas to Arsenal. Mourinho will have no trouble in finding a club with Inter Milan favourites to land him and Real Madrid a close second.<br><br>Former Porto player Cesar Peixoto, now at Espanol, told reporters in Barcelona: Â“I know Mourinho is looking for a house in Milan.Â” Reports in Spain last night confirmed the conversation between Mourinho and his pal.<br><br>Chelsea know their manager is unhappy and have already targeted replacements. Russia coach Guus Hiddink has been widely linked with the club but may feel the challenge too great at the age of 60.<br><br>Chelsea like the look of ex-Blues star Didier Deschamps, now at Juventus after success at Monaco, and Seville manager Juande Ramos, who won the UEFA Cup last season.<br><br>Angry Mourinho expressed his frustration after the 1-1 Carling Cup semi-final draw at Wycombe on Wednesday. He said: Â“I have asked for players and itÂ’s not my choice that no one is coming. ItÂ’s not my club, I am just a manager. Â“I expect my squad to be the same at the end of the transfer window as it was at the start.Â”<br><br>SunSport understands Mourinho asked club owner Roman Abramovich to buy a new striker Â— ValenciaÂ’s David Villa Â— to make up for flop Andriy Shevchenko and was refused.<br><br>The editor of Dutch magazine Elf, Jan Herman de Bruijn, published an in-depth interview with Hiddink at the weekend. He confirmed Arnesen is now in charge of transfers at Stamford Bridge.<br><br></div>

The self-proclaimed Special One believes former Danish international Arnesen is pushing for ultimate power at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>Arnesen pulled the strings at PSV Eindhoven, where he discovered the likes of Arjen Robben and Eidur Gudjohnsen. He also called many of the shots at Spurs before being poached by the Blues two years ago.<br><br>Now, as ChelseaÂ’s chief scout and director of youth development, Arnesen enjoys a far closer relationship with chief executive Peter Kenyon and billionaire owner Roman Abramovich than Mourinho.<br><br>After Chelsea Â— with a squad worth more than Â£200million Â— stumbled to a 1-1 draw at League Two Wycombe in the first leg of their Carling Cup semi-final on Wednesday, Mourinho complained that club chiefs had clamped down on spending. He also claimed his injury list has exposed a lack of quality young players coming through the ranks.<br><br>He is desperate to get Micah Richards, 18, and believed the board would back him. He even told those close to him that the Manchester City star was on his way to Chelsea in an Â£18m deal.<br><br>It is all adding up to a shambles Â— and proves harmony at a club cannot be bought. The Chelsea board, meanwhile, have reached the point where they will not beg Mourinho to stay. If he chooses to go at the end of the season Â— as is widely believed Â— there will not be anyone getting down on their hands or knees tugging at MourinhoÂ’s trouser leg.<br><br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/Mourflops.jpg"><br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/Mourflops2.jpg"></div>

Asked about the reports, Ferguson told reporters on Friday: "I take that with a pinch of salt and I think the important thing is to make sure I'm still the manager of our club come May." But he added: "It would be disappointing for me, because I have enjoyed his company the times we met after the game. "I think he has got a good personality and I enjoy the competition against him."</div>

His excellent charisma has really lit up the English game, which has really threatened to go down-hill with the same old boring Fergie-Wenger opera.<br><br>He had already proven himself to be a winner at Porto, and now Chelsea. Now, Jose, go look for another challenge. It seems like the board no longer support him.<br><br>That is just so sad, but that is the consequences of working for a club as big and glamarous as Chelsea.<br><br>Possible replacements? Guus Hiddink may sound like a short term replacement. How about Big Phil (Felipe Scolari)?<br><br>World Cup winner Marcelo Lippi? Fabio Capello, Otmar Hitzfeld, or even Frank Rijkaard? Stranger things have happened.<br><br>Whatever it is, Chelsea need a strong character to bring all those array of stars together, and lead them forward.<br><br>There is indeed only one Jose Mourinho - the "Special One".<br></div>

If Roman Abramovich really is trying to push around the coach who has inspired the most successful period in Chelsea's history, the one thing he must realise is that Jose Mourinho will do nothing quietly.<br><br>He's a smart one, Mourinho. In the midst of a power struggle against the one man in football even he cannot begin to master, he fought his corner with a rousing appeal to the sympathy vote. It certainly struck a chord with the faithful. His name was chanted from the Matthew Harding Stand to the Shed End. They all made an enthusiastic effort to 'stand up for the Special One'. Last out of the tunnel, he made his entrance, settled into the manager's seat and rubbed his hands together. Mourinho 1 Abramovich 0?<br><br>This is boardroom hardball versus dugout defiance. Even the most entrenched of Mourinho bashers has to admire his front. Indeed, they might end up changing their tune sufficiently to do something they never thought possible: feel sorry for him.<br><br>However long he stays at Stamford Bridge, there is a school of thought that Mourinho's intense methods, which rely on consistently cranked-up levels of motivation, work best in short doses. Conventional managerial wisdom says that after a few years either the boss or the players have to change, before drills and messages lose impact through repetition. That theme is accelerated where Mourinho is concerned. He likes to come into a club with a bang, sustain a high electric charge and leave before anything starts to fizzle out.<br><br>The spell he has cast around the Kings Road has lasted the longest of his managerial career so far. And now that he has beat his personal record for longevity at Chelsea, the masterplan is being severely tested.<br><br></div>
