              <p class="small bold"><em><strong>FLOORED ... Emmanuel after thumping</strong></em></p>
              <p class="small bold"> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">EMMANUEL ADEBAYOR claims Arsenal have gone backwards during his three years at 
              the Emirates.</h2>
              <p class="article">And the outspoken targetman has told Arsene Wenger he must get the chequebook 
              out this summer after yet another season of frustration and disappointment.</p>
              <p class="article">Adebayor insists something has to change following Arsenal’s brutal beating by 
              Manchester United in their Champions League semi-final.</p>
              <p class="article">The Togo star said: “I think we have taken a step backwards — not only me but 
              the whole team.</p>
              <p class="article">“I don’t know what we are going to do for next season but we need to get some 
              more players.</p>
              <p class="article">“We lost Alex Hleb to Barcelona and Mathieu Flamini to Milan last summer and 
              it has been quite difficult for us since.</p>
              <p class="article">“We have a young team and we have tried to make the best of it. But when I 
              came Arsenal in 2006 people told me I had the chance to win trophies — yet 
              we are still empty-handed.</p>
              <p class="article">“This has been a difficult season for everyone. Last season we created four or 
              five chances in every game with our passing and movement but that hasn’t 
              been the case this time.</p>
              <p class="article">“Now we have to play for our dignity, show our character and hopefully come 
              back stronger.”</p>
              <p class="article">Despite his outburst, Adebayor insists he has no intention of quitting the 
              club this summer and believes he is duty bound to stay at the Emirates and 
              fight.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: “Arsenal put me where I am today. They made me one of the biggest 
              strikers in the world.</p>
              <p class="article">“Now I have to pay them back. The only way to do that is to help them win 
              trophies. I came here to win trophies and I don’t have any reason to leave 
              until I have achieved that.</p>
              <p class="article">“Next season I will be an Arsenal footballer, 100 per cent.”</p>
              <p class="article">Adebayor’s pledge of loyalty is in stark contrast to his comments earlier this 
              week when he was quoted in an Italian newspaper admitting he frequently 
              speaks to AC Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani.</p>
              <p class="article">He also compared Milan’s achievement of seven European Cups to Arsenal’s none 
              and admitted he was very close to signing for the Italians last summer.</p>
              <p class="article">Yet now he wants to prove his commitment to the increasingly sceptical Arsenal 
              supporters and promised: “I will do everything it takes to come back next 
              season and show how good I am.</p>
              <p class="article">“I will show more character, personality and desire for this club.</p>
              <p class="article">“I have been trying my best and giving 100 per cent in every single game. But 
              I have had to cope with a lot of injuries in the last two years and that 
              makes it difficult.”</p>
              <p class="article">Boss Wenger will rethink his entire Arsenal strategy this summer after finally 
              conceding that his youngsters do not have what it takes to win football’s 
              major prizes.</p>
              <p class="article">After four years without a trophy, Wenger knows he has no option but to break 
              the habits of a lifetime by spending big money in the transfer market.</p>
              <p class="article">Billionaire shareholder Stan Kroenke has promised Wenger the financial backing 
              to go out and sign the established international players Arsenal are crying 
              out for.</p>
              <p class="article">Frustrated directors almost had to prise the £15million out of Wenger’s grip 
              to sign Andrey Arshavin in the final minutes of the January transfer window.</p>
              <p class="article">But the success of the Russian superstar has convinced the manager that he CAN 
              find a quick fix in the transfer market this summer.</p>
              <p class="article">Top of Wenger’s priority list is at least one strong, quick and experienced 
              centre-half to replace William Gallas and, perhaps, Kolo Toure. He also 
              wants a talismanic centre-forward to rival the likes of Fernando Torres, 
              Didier Drogba and Wayne Rooney.</p>
              <p class="article">Then there is a powerful ball-winner to give muscular protection to midfield 
              lightweights Arshavin, Cesc Fabregas and Theo Walcott.</p>
              <p class="article">None of this will come cheaply but Wenger knows the alternative is the risk of 
              falling even further behind United, Chelsea and Liverpool next season.</p>
              <p class="article">Wenger said: “The average age of this team is still very young and they 
              deserve a lot of credit to reach this level.</p>
              <p class="article">“But in the games where it really mattered, against United in the Champions 
              League and Chelsea in the FA Cup, we couldn’t win. So that is something I 
              have to think about.”</p>
              <p class="article">Wenger also needs no reminding that the longer Arsenal fail to challenge for 
              honours, the greater the danger of losing impatient stars such as Fabregas 
              and Robin van Persie. Captain Fabregas still has five years of his Arsenal 
              contract to run but, with Barcelona knocking on his door, the midfielder 
              will not wait forever for success.</p>
              <p class="article">The Spanish international made no attempt to hide his frustration after 
              Tuesday’s defeat and said: “Manchester United have been much, much better 
              than us over the two legs.</p>
              <p class="article">“We don’t deserve to be in the Champions League final because we haven’t been 
              good enough.</p>
              <p class="article">“Manchester United and Chelsea have many, many players who can make a 
              difference. We don’t have the same depth in our squad but we have to cope 
              with it.</p>
              <p class="article">“I don’t know what will happen this summer. I thought we would all stay 
              together last year but that didn’t happen and some players left us.</p>
              <p class="article">“All I know is that we have to make a big improvement next season. Fourth 
              place is not good enough.”</p>

              <p>actually, arsenal's youngsters should have more patience. they

              <p>Given how other teams have youth too like MU, Pool or even Chelsea,and they improve the quality by adding better players..</p>
              <p>I still think a good mix of experienced players with youth is the way forward. Arsene is fortunate that he has a good history to back him in this direction, if someone else, they would be fired long ago.</p>

              <p>of course. these seasoned players come in, and realized they won't be fighting for the title, but instead, are playing nanny for the young players. So they leave.</p>
              <p>hmm, what happened to helb or flamini, nothing about them these days...</p>
