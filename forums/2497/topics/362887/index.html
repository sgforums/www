              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Manchester City's brand and
              marketing officer David Pullan says the club are determined to achieve
              parity with the best clubs in the world.</span></strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/08/11/330/City-fans_1544456.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p><strong>The Citizens are looking to
              develop their global fan base and want to become the club of choice for
              football supporters worldwide undecided about which colours to wear. </strong></p>
              <p>Pullan said: "There is a vast international audience for the
              Premier League and lot of those viewers probably have not formed an
              allegiance to one club.</p>
              <p>"There are the obvious choices but there is plenty of room for the non-obvious choices.</p>
              <p>"We have a compelling story to tell about the kind of club we
              are, the kind of values we have and the kind of relationship we have
              with this city."</p>
              <p>The landscape at Eastlands has changed remarkably following the takeover by the Abu Dhabi United Group last year.</p>
              <p>That was emphasised on Tuesday with the £12million arrival of established England midfielder Gareth Barry from Aston Villa.</p>
              <p>Behind the scenes there is considerable activity as well with City forming a 10-year partnership with Umbro.</p>
              <p>Pullan is excited about the future and says he is not concerned about living and competing alongside Manchester United.</p>
              <p>He said: "I do not really think about it. One of my former
              bosses used to say 'Worry about the things you can affect'. That is a
              very good mantra to live by.</p>
              <p>"I cannot affect what they do and how they operate and I not
              going to worry. We will do what is right for our club and our
              supporters.</p>
              <p>"Hopefully in the long term that will bring us to a level of
              success that is comparable to the best sporting clubs in the world.
              That is our ambition."</p>
              <p>Part of the deal with Umbro is that they will supply home, away and third City kits for the 2009-10 season.</p>
              <p>Pullan added: "They are a company with very deep roots in the
              city. It is very much consistent with our club and how we feel about
              our role in Manchester. We share an agenda.</p>
              <p>"Both of us have been acquired by much bigger organisations
              with deep pockets and big ambitions. We have a similar desire and
              aspirations to grow and become more successful.</p>
              <p>"We have a commitment to building a successful and sustainable club for the future and a big part of that is around innovation."</p>
              <p>Umbro spokesman Martin Prothero said: "This is an exciting
              opportunity for both Umbro and Manchester City to build on their
              collective heritage and create truly iconic football brands."</p>

              <p>For Man City, they have been, and still are a low mid table team.</p>

              <p>With all the money they are pumping in, they have a chance of buying top quality players and improve their standings.</p>

              <p>As for challenging for the title, I would still give them at least 5 years to build and gel the team first.  And that depends on whether the owners are prepared to wait that long before the club bears fruits if ever. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
