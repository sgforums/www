              <p><strong>With a nod to his team’s 27-hour journey to Hamburg and their 57th game of the season, Fulham boss Roy Hodgson was delighted with the 0-0 draw in their Europa League semi-final first leg with Hamburg.</strong></p>
              <p>He said: ‘We must be very happy. We played against a good team and the journey was not the best.</p>
              <p>'It handed us a ready-made excuse not to play as we can and I am delighted we did not do that.</p>
              <p>‘We have given ourselves a tremendous chance but if we are to progress we will have to play well and win the game. We are not asking for a miracle but a great home performance.’</p>
              <p>'It would be worse than dangerous, it would be downright foolish,' he added when asked if he thought victory had already been achieved. 'We are at half-time, and we have to play another 90 minute half.</p>
              <p>'Not many people leave stadiums at half-time, or go for a cup of tea thinking the game has been won.</p>
              <p>'There is a lot of football to be played and Hamburg are a very good team. If they score a goal next week the advantage passes to them.</p>
              <p>'The tie is open but I am delighted about that because it is very easy to put yourself out of contention.'</p>
              <p>The only sour note for Hodgson was the sight of Bobby Zamora limping towards the dug-out after 52 minutes after a recurrence of an achilles tendon problem.</p>
              <p>Hodgson said: ‘He has had this problem for some time. He has missed one or two league games but he felt okay and we hope he would get through the game.</p>
              <p>'But even in the first half he was struggling with it. The medical staff gave him the all-clear to start the second half but they warned me I might have to take him off.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>'We have one week to deal with the problem. It is not a fresh injury so we hope a week gives us the chance to put it right because I would say he has no chance of being fit to face Everton on Sunday.'</strong></p>
              <p>Fulham skipper Danny Murphy said: ‘We had a reasonably comfortable night and have put ourselves in a great position. We knew we had to be organised and we knew we’d have chances on the break. It was a job well done.’</p>
              <p>Murphy’s words were echoed by goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer, who was required to pull off a smart stop at the death to deny substitute Mladen Petric.</p>
              <p>‘They only had a few chances really but they were coming at us towards the end,’ said Schwarzer.<br></p>

              <p>But Fulham need to win, but not a draw with the number (For example, 1-1, 2-2 etc...) in order to go finals.</p>
              <p>Atletico Madrid finally get their FIRST win in Europa League. They, aka, away goal specialist, managed to scrap through last 32, 16 and quarter-finals through better away goal. Maybe they will do the same against Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Hope Fulham can lift it!!! They really deserve it, the way the eliminated Juventus with never say die spirit!!!</p>
