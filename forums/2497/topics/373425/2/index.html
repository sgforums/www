              <h1 class="titlestory">Liverpool boss Benitez: Champions League travelling is not too bad</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> boss Rafael Benitez says the travels his team faces in the group stages of this season’s Champions League are not too bad.</p>
              <p>The Reds manager was relieved after the draw, saying his team would not
              have to face any long trips, but admitted his opponents – Lyon,
              Fiorentina and Debreceni - were all capable of playing good football.</p>
              <p>"The important thing, as always, is that the travelling isn't
              too bad. We don't have too far to go for any of the games. We're just
              looking forward to starting the competition now,” the Spaniard said.</p>
              <p>He added: "You know in the Champions League there will always be difficult games and tough teams to play against.</p>
              <p>"Lyon might not have won the league last season but before that
              they won it many years in a row, so we know they have lots of good
              players who can play good football.</p>
              <p>"Fiorentina are an historic club in a nice city. I know from
              experience they have fantastic supporters because I spent some time
              there when Claudio Ranieri was the coach.</p>
              <p>"And we have experience of Hungarian football because of our
              relationship with MTK, so if Debreceni have won their league then we
              know it means it's because they're a good side."</p>

              <h2>FERGUSON EXPECTS TOUGH TEST</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/09/08/240/Sir-Alex-Ferguson-August-21_2350625.jpg" border="0" alt="Ferguson - faces Moscow trip."></div>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson admitted Manchester United face a stern test in this season's Champions League after a tough-looking draw in the group stage.</strong></p>
              <p>United were drawn in Group B - not so much the Group of Death as the Group of Jetlag - with the prospect of long-distance trips to Besiktas in Turkey and CSKA Moscow as well as strong opponents in German champions Wolfsburg.</p>
              <p>Last season's beaten finalists look to have the most daunting draw of all the British clubs, who all avoided the European heavyweights of Barcelona, Real Madrid and the Milan sides.</p>
              <p>Ferguson is not a fan of long away trips in Europe, and he told the club's official website: "These are difficult ties especially the trips to Russia and Turkey.</p>
              <p>"CSKA have developed strongly in the last few years and games in Turkey are always difficult. "We also know the quality that we're up against with Wolfsburg, with what they achieved in the Bundesliga last season."</p>
              <p>Ferguson's mood will not have been lightened by the knowledge that United face two major Premier League clashes after their long trips - they are at home to Manchester City after travelling to Turkey and away at Liverpool four days after their Moscow journey.</p>
              <p>David Gill admitted the draw could have been kinder to United. He told <em>Sky Sports News</em>: "I think pot four was the interesting one, I think most clubs would have preferred not to get the German champions out of that, but we got it. "But overall we have to be happy with it and look forward to starting in three weeks. Besiktas away, long trip first one, but we will see where we go from there." </p>
              <p>United would have preferred to have avoided a trip to Istanbul first up, while a lengthy trek to Russia lies ahead when they face CSKA. </p>
              <p>Gill, though, is adamant the Red Devils will have no problem coping with travelling to far-flung destinations and admits the club are looking forward to heading back to Moscow - the scene of their 2008 triumph. </p>
              <p>"I think you can get psyched out by that sort of thing," he said. "We are in the competition and we will get on with it and I'm sure it won't affect on the games either side in the Premier League. </p>
              <p>"We will look forward to going back to Moscow, after those great scenes in 2008, so we have got to be excited about." The first round of matches will be played on September 15 and 16.</p>

              <p>Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon was happy to have avoided the continental big guns.</p>

              <p>"There will plenty of glamour ties once you get through this group, but we have to get through this stage first.</p>
              <p>"I'm sure Carlo Ancelotti will be happy - he's had a great start to the season, he's very happy with squad and we have great strength in depth so winning that final still beckons." </p>

              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> chief Ivan Gazidis admits they've earned a good draw for their Champions League group.</p>
              <p>The Gunners are joined by Dutch champions AZ Alkmaar, Greek side Olympiakos and Belgian title holders Standard Liege.</p>
              <p>Gazidis said: "A lot of people might say we are the favourites to win
              this group but we have not played any of these teams before and they
              are all champions of their respective leagues.</p>
              <p>"Our ambition is to become the first London club to win the
              Champions League. We have believed in ourselves through this close
              season even though we have been written off and a lot of pressure has
              been placed on us.</p>
              <p>"One of things we have this year is real focus game-to-game and I think if we can maintain that we can achieve great things."</p>
              <p>Former <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> player Charlie Nicholas said the draw could not have been better for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsene Wenger</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Nicholas told <em>Sky Sports News</em>: "It's a lovely draw for the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr>, there's absolutely no doubt about that.</p>
              <p>"After coming under a little bit of pressure against Glasgow <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Celtic</span></abbr> I was sitting here looking at the prime draw and this is it. There's a
              little bit of travelling involved to Olympiakos, but Belgium and
              Holland are a little hop over the water.</p>
              <p>"It's an absolutely fantastic draw. I know they've not played
              AZ Alkmaar or Olympiakos before, but I don't think it gets much better
              than this.</p>
              <p>"You take nothing for granted at this level, but this is one where <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> will be able to change their team a little bit and use their squad players.</p>
              <p>"It's a very, very good draw for the Gunners."</p>
