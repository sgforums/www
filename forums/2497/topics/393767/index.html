              <p><span>It was a frustrating evening at <a class="contextLink" href="http://www.chelseafc.com/page/StadiumHistory/0,,10268%7E1813415,00.html">Stamford

              <p><span>It means another year of frustration in Europe, but things 
              could have been different had first-half penalty shouts from Drogba and <a class="contextLink" href="http://www.chelseafc.com/page/PlayerProfileDetail/0,,10268%7E39508,00.html">Branislav
               Ivanovic</a> and Malouda been answered.</span></p>
              <p><span>With the tie delicately poised from the first leg in Milan 
              three weeks earlier, a 1-0 Chelsea win would have been enough for 
              progression, but an Inter goal would mean Chelsea needed three.</span></p>

               Ancelotti</a> to the starting 11 that beat West Ham on Saturday, but 
              Mourinho's side represented a sturdier barrier to break down, and were 
              also likelier to offer a testing examination of third choice goalkeeper <a class="contextLink" href="http://www.chelseafc.com/page/PlayerProfileDetail/0,,10268%7E28985,00.html">Ross
               Turnbull</a>.</span></p>
              <p><span>The Portuguese made just one change himself from the side that 
              prevailed in Lombardy, Goran Pandev replacing Dejan Stankovic, 
              suggesting a shift to 4-3-3 as demonstrated in the closing stages of 
              that first meeting.</span></p>
              <p><span>Inter kicked off attacking the Matthew Harding end, but the 
              first drama of the evening came in front of the Shed, <a class="contextLink" href="http://www.chelseafc.com/page/PlayerProfileDetail/0,,10268%7E27915,00.html">Florent
               Malouda</a> blocked off by a static Lucio on the edge of the Inter box.
               Nothing was given by referee Wolfgang Stark of Germany. The mind 
              couldn't help but wander back to May last year, when numerous appeals 
              were turned away as Barcelona went through at Chelsea's expense.</span></p>
              <p><span><a class="contextLink" href="http://www.chelseafc.com/page/PlayerProfileDetail/0,,10268%7E27923,00.html">Michael
               Ballack</a>, one of the main protagonists on that evening last spring, 
              was the first to gain a sight of goal, flashing a low drive past Julio 
              Cesar's right-hand post, close enough to temporarily hush a boisterous 
              home support.</span></p>
              <p><span>On 16 minutes Drogba lined up a 35-yard free-kick after Lucio 
              had raised his foot on Malouda, his shot straight into the wall, and 
              then 10 minutes later the same player was denied by Maicon as he shot 
              from inside the area.</span></p>
              <p><span>The <em>Nerazzurri</em> were limiting Chelsea's forward play 
              effectively, denying the Blues space and time in midfield and not 
              allowing the full-backs sufficient room in which to attack on the 
              flanks, Maicon particularly impressive against Zhirkov.</span></p>
              <p><span>On the front foot the Brazilian picked out an unmarked Eto'o 
              just after the half-hour, the Cameroonian forward in a state of shock as
               the ball reached him, heading into the ground and over the bar as <a class="contextLink" href="http://www.chelseafc.com/page/PlayerProfileDetail/0,,10268%7E39508,00.html">Branislav
               Ivanovic</a> tried to make ground after <a class="contextLink" href="http://www.chelseafc.com/page/PlayerProfileDetail/0,,10268%7E5593,00.html">john
               Terry</a> was beaten.</span></p>
              <p><span>In the Inter area Ivanovic was felled by a Motta tug, but again
               no whistle. There was however when Alex tripped Eto'o just over 30 
              yards out, making it Wesley Sneijder's turn to send a powerful drive 
              directly into a defensive wall.</span></p>
              <p><span>Five minutes before the break Malouda did superbly to wriggle 
              inside the Inter area and create space to shoot on his favoured left 
              side, yet from nowhere emerged a sliding Lucio to divert the shot away. 
              Within a minute <a class="contextLink" href="http://www.chelseafc.com/page/PlayerProfileDetail/0,,10268%7E20230,00.html">Nicolas
               Anelka</a> also found space as Drogba found him inside the area, but 
              Cesar was quick to smother the chance.</span></p>
              <p><span><img src="http://www.chelseafc.com/javaImages/b0/68/0,,10268%7E8677552,00.jpg" alt="Chelsea v Inter" width="400" height="266"></span></p>
              <p><span>At the resultant corner Walter Samuel had both arms wrapped 
              around Drogba as both men went to ground, but again there was no penalty
               awarded. Mourinho himself was always a fan of conspiracies, Ancelotti 
              and Ray Wilkins looked like they were starting to wonder.</span></p>
              <p><span>Half-time came and went without changes, the first action of 
              the second half being a yellow card for Motta after a block on Malouda. 
              Again Drogba lined up the dead ball, and this time his shot did find its
               way through, but was far too tame to trouble Cesar.</span></p>
              <p><span>Inter were still threatening on the counter, and again Eto'o 
              could have put his side in front on the night, but allowed Zhirkov to 
              backtrack and remove the threat.</span></p>
              <p><span>Malouda's low shot was turned around the post by Cesar on 51 
              minutes, before Stark issued three yellow cards in as many minutes, to 
              Malouda, Lucio and finally Drogba.</span></p>
              <p><span>Zhirkov showed his defensive worth again just before the hour 
              as he challenged Goran Pandev, who had been put through by Sneijder, and
               then Turnbull had to be alert to hold Diego Milito's close range shot.</span></p>
              <p><span>With time just beginning to ebb away, Ancelotti made his first 
              substitution, <a class="contextLink" href="http://www.chelseafc.com/page/PlayerProfileDetail/0,,10268%7E6078,00.html">Joe
               Cole</a> for Ballack in an unmistakably attacking switch. In the other 
              technical area Mourinho began to grow animated, urging his full-backs to
               concentrate on defence rather than attack.</span></p>
              <p><span>Milito dragged a golden opportunity wide on 65 minutes after 
              Sneijder had caught the Chelsea sub flat-footed, stealing in and 
              chipping the ball beyond a Chelsea defence wrongly looking to play 
              offside, and then Motta headed the Dutchman's free-kick over the bar 
              when well placed.</span></p>
              <p><span>Inter looked to have grasped control of the tie. With 20 
              minutes left what more could Chelsea offer?</span></p>
              <p><span>Ancelotti made another sub, Zhirkov was withdrawn, Malouda 
              moved to left-back and <a class="contextLink" href="http://www.chelseafc.com/page/PlayerProfileDetail/0,,10268%7E31329,00.html">Salomon
               Kalou</a> introduced as another attacking option. Mourinho countered by
               replacing Pandev with Stankovic, the Serb dropping into central 
              midfield.</span></p>
              <p><span>Kalou's first contribution was to cut inside a challenge and 
              fire wide from 30 yards. Wasteful it may have been, but it at least 
              offered hope.</span></p>
              <p><span><img src="http://www.chelseafc.com/javaImages/a1/68/0,,10268%7E8677537,00.jpg" alt="Chelsea v Inter" width="400" height="252"></span></p>
              <p><span>That hope was quickly diminished with 13 minutes remaining, 
              when another accurate Sneijder through ball, this time from his own 
              half, was seized upon by Eto'o. One of the best strikers in the world, 
              he rarely misses twice and so it proved as he guided the ball past 
              Turnbull and into the bottom corner, the nearest defender Ivanovic 
              unable to make up enough ground. </span></p>
              <p><span>Two goals were needed just to force extra time. Alex was moved 
              up front as a focal point, but before he could have any impact Chelsea 
              lost Drogba to a red card, after the Ivorian tangled with Thiago Motta 
              in the Inter area. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Replays suggested very little had gone on, though he 
              may have trodden on the midfielder's leg</span>.</span></p>
              <p><span><img src="http://www.chelseafc.com/javaImages/ba/68/0,,10268%7E8677562,00.jpg" alt="Chelsea v Inter" width="400" height="281"></span></p>
              <p><span>By now Inter were in the ascendancy, and Eto'o could have 
              doubled the lead in injury time, only for Turnbull to produce a superb 
              save to keep the deficit to one.</span></p>
              <p><span>So another European dream ends in disappointment with question 
              marks over the officiating, the focus now must be on domestic success. 
              Ancelotti's job is to pick his men up in time for the weekend, when 
              valuable Premier League points are at stake at Blackburn.</span></p>

              <p>i watched the match. yes, referee was seriously biased against chelsea.</p>
              <p>chelsea player pulled down in inter penalty box, no penalty; yet give inter free kick? not once but few times too?!</p>
              <p>but then chelsea did not play well. not aggressive enough. i think ancelotti's strategy is lousy. does not play fast attacking football more like start stop.</p>
              <p>and of chelsea players, only 3 are scoring threats: drogba, lampard, malouda. seriously, the other strikers anelka, kalou, cole all suck. for a EPL contender, i think it is seriously lacking, esp when their best 3 goal scorers also are not as consistent as rooney.</p>
              <p>and needless to say chelsea defence also got more and more problems. partly because of injuries: mikel &lt;&lt; essien, zhirkov &lt;&lt; ashley cole</p>

              <p>quite a few players are getting old.  mikel has no attacking sense.  malouda is lousy.  ballack can only pass square.  lampard is over the hill.  terry is distracted. ferriera is medicore.</p>
              <p>is ancelotti good enough for the BPL?  no denying he is good in italy.  but then BPL and italian league are very different.</p>

               a stormy game at Stamford Bridge to give Inter Milan a 3-1 aggregate 
              win, but there were echoes of Chelsea's ugly demise at the hands of 
              Barcelona last year.</p>
              <p>Didier Drogba was sent off in the 
              closing minutes after clashing with Thiago Motta and John Terry was seen
               to shout obscenities at the fourth official as he left the pitch at the
               end. </p>
              <p>Mourinho said of Chelsea: 'This is a team that lost a 
              semi-final
              with a goal that was not a goal, lost a semi-final on penalties, lost a
              final on penalties, lost a semi-final in a game they should win 3-0
              with three penalties. This is the history of this club and these
              players. It is a history of frustration.</p>
              <p>'Tonight, they
              felt immediately that Inter were the best team and this brings
              frustration to great players. These are my players, my people but today
              I was the enemy and the enemy won.</p>
              <p>'I celebrated a lot in
              the dressing room. It was a big victory for my team. I love Chelsea, I
              love this stadium, I love these people but I am a professional.</p>

              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/17/article-1258487-08BF2E26000005DC-863_468x323.jpg" alt="Didier Drogba (centre) argues with Inter Milan defender Lucio" width="468" height="323">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Sent off: Didier Drogba (centre) had a torrid

              </div>
              <p>'Who knows, in the future I may coach another English team and I
              will come here again as an opponent.' Mourinho revealed he had texted
              Terry on the eve of the game to say 'someone would be sad'.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's
              players
               complained bitterly about two penalties not given in the first
              half, about Drogba's red card and a stamp by Dejan Stankovic on Alex
              which was missed by referee Wolfgang Stark.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But Inter 
              deserved their win and Ancelotti was dignified in defeat. He said: 'We 
              were never fully in control. Inter put us under a lot of pressure, won 
              the ball a lot in midfield and were dangerous on the break, so there 
              were only short periods when we were in control.</p>
              <p>'I want to 
              say best wishes to Inter because I have nothing against Mourinho or 
              against Inter.'</p>
              <p>Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich walked alone 
              across the pitch to the dressing room after the game as Inter fans sang 
              Mourinho's name.</p>

              <p>Abramovich sacked Mourinho two-and-a-half years ago and brought 
              Ancelotti to the club to win the European Cup.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti 
              added: 'I've worked for a long time in this environment and I know 
              exactly what the expectations are. It's normal that a manager is going 
              to come under pressure if he loses a few matches. My regret is we didn't
               play as well this evening as we did in the first leg.'</p>
              <p>Mourinho
               added: 'Roman is a very intelligent man. He is not the same man today 
              he was when he first came into football. I am sure he accepts the 
              situation with class because he knows Inter were the best team.'</p>

              <p>but what was surprising is that Inter dominated chelsea at their own den. i thouhgt chelsea would go all out to attack. probably ancelotti was taken aback by Mourinho's tactics and formation of attacking strategy. chelsea was lucky to lose 1-0.</p>

              <p>And the biggest mourinho trade mark last night... The Inter players touch a bit and they fall and roll around or hold their legs or cover their faces in pain to waste time...</p>
