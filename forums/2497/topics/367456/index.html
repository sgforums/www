              <p>Barcelona president Joan Laporta has confirmed the club have lodged a bid of over €40million with Valencia for striker <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=28600"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">David Villa</span></span></a>.</p>
              <p>A host of top clubs have been chasing Villa this summer, with Barca understood to have been locked in talks with <em>Los Che</em> for the past few weeks.</p>
              <p>Real Madrid have already pulled out of the race to sign the 27-year-old forward, saying the price was too high.</p>
              <p>Chelsea and Manchester United are both still interested, but Villa's preference is a move to either Real or Barca.</p>
              <p>He recently called for a resolution to the situation, with the La Liga season fast approaching.</p>
              <p>Now Laporta has confirmed Barcelona want to take him to the Camp Nou. He said: "He's (Villa) a player we're interested in, and we made a good bid for him, closer to €40 million than €50million."</p>
              <p>Laporta also confirmed Barca would attempt to sign <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=42968"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Franck Ribery</span></span></a>, should Bayern Munich decide to sell: "He's (Ribery) a player we are interested in at a logical price. But Bayern don't want to sell. Although if they are interested in selling, we are interested (in buying). We need small adjustments; a left back, a central defender, a midfielder and a forward."</p>
              <p>The Samuel Eto'o situation is no closer to being resolved, Laporta said. The Cameroon striker has been offered a two-year contract extension but has yet to respond, while Manchester City have put in an offer for him.</p>
              <p>"I have called him a couple of times but he hasn't answered his mobile," Laporta said. "I don't know if he has changed the number or whether he's lost it, but I would like to speak to him."</p>
              <p>The Barca president also said there is no way <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=45843"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Lionel Messi</span></span></a> will be leaving the club: "I love him a lot! He wouldn't leave Barcelona for any price. We are not selling, he has a clause of €150million, but more than that there his commitment to the club."</p>
              <p>Laporta confirmed manager Pep Guardiola only has one-year left on his contract, but insisted both parties were content: "He's got a contract until the end of the season and he likes this situation."</p>
