              <p><strong>Lille starlet Eden Hazard
              insists he has no intention of leaving the club this summer – but has
              revealed he is dreaming of a move to Real Madrid or Arsenal in the
              future. </strong></p>
              <p>The 18-year-old attacking midfielder has enjoyed a hugely successful
              debut season in Ligue 1 and has been linked with a number of major
              European sides including Barcelona, Chelsea and Inter.</p>
              <p>Yet, despite the interest, the Belgium international says he wants
              to be given time to develop before moving on to bigger things.</p>
              <p>“This was my first season as a pro,” he told De Standaard.</p>
              <p>“I’ve scored and have been playing more than I’d expected. I hope it continues.”</p>
              <p>He added: “Next year, I have to play in every game. That is my aim – to become an undisputed first-team player at Lille.”</p>
              <p>Asked if he would be tempted by a move to Barcelona, Real Madrid or
              Chelsea this summer, he said: “I’m going to stay at Lille. Definitely.</p>
              <p>“I have a three-year contract and feel that I have a lot to learn in Lille.</p>
              <p>“The situation could only change if a club offers €30 million
              (£26.5m) and Lille were unable to refuse, but for now I ask all the
              clubs interested to respect my decision: I want another year to develop
              at Lille.</p>
              <p>“After that, we will see.”</p>
              <p>France and Real Madrid legend Zinedine Zidane hailed Hazard at a
              recent awards ceremony and suggested he would love to see the player at
              the Bernabeu.</p>
              <p>However, although Hazard was hugely flattered, he insists he has no intention of moving at this stage.</p>
              <p>“That was great,” he said.</p>
              <p>“Zidane is my idol – the greatest footballer of his generation.</p>
              <p>“If someone like that praises you, it is heart-warming. It moved me.”</p>
              <p>He added: “I must repeat that it is too early to move.</p>
              <p>“In one or two years I will maybe make the next step.</p>
              <p>“What’s more, Lille play European football, which is also a good
              opportunity for me. Getting minutes on the field is what counts from my
              perspective right now.”</p>
              <p>Although he says he has no intention of moving in the near future
              and does not want to discuss possible transfers, he did reveal that
              Real Madrid and Arsenal would be his ideal clubs.</p>
              <p>“Real Madrid and Arsenal are the clubs I dreamed of joining as a child,” he said.</p>
              <p>“If I joined Inter or Barcelona and could play football there then
              that would be very good, but Real and Arsenal are really great and play
              at a very high technical level.”</p>
              <p>Arsene Wenger revealed in April that he had been impressed by Hazard but was not planning a move in the near future.</p>
