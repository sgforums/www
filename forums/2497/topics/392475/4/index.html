              <p>I don't wish to spark off any debate on politics but the Foreign Talents in the national team really CMI.</p>
              <p>Egmar Goncalves and Mirko Grabovac took full advantage of Singapore citizenship and both left Singapore back to their hometown, Brazil and Croatia respectively. Talk about biting the hand that fed you.</p>
              <p>Precious is definitely not a good defender. Even the goofiest defender in the mould of Titus Bramble and Jean Alan Boumsong will outsprint him, outtackle him, outjump him any day. Talks big in front of the media but failed to deliver anything.</p>
              <p>Daniel Bennett, the only reason he's staying is because he plays in Wrexham in England before. He takes awkward freekicks, and count himself lucky for a few goals via deflections.</p>
              <p>John Wilkinson - who?! Why do we have him again?</p>
              <p>Shi Jia Yi - decent passer of the ball and thats all he'll ever be. Lacks pace, lacks creativity and easily bump off the ball by taller and stronger players.</p>
              <p>Mustafic Fahrudin, a defensive midfielder that always commits unnecessary fouls and should be sent off for a couple of occasion if not because of play-acting and fooling the referee to believe that he was the victim of an ill-timed tackle.</p>
              <p>Itimi Dickson, he just disappeared under the radar. Seems to have lost his pace, his run and plot. Should never have been given a second chance.</p>
              <p>Agu Casmir - This joker, I've no idea why Indonesian football club Persija Jakarta tried to sign him and paid him a signing-on fee of US$20,000. However, Agu did not report for training, went for trials at Russia, failed the trial, went on hiding in Canada, was disillusioned with football and had no intention of returning to Singapore. he re-signed for former club Woodlands Wellington FC on a one-year contract, under a deal in which the club would re-pay Persija Jakarta his signing-on fee. There's a lack of sportsmanship, integrity and loyalty. I wonder why Singapore still stick by him.</p>
              <p><span class="mw-redirect">Aleksandar Duric, 40 years old and Singapore is still playing him. Speaks alot on our FAS insistance on FT Scheme.<br></span></p>
              <p>Qiu Li - Had alot of promises and lets hope he keeps them. Played well but lacked the cutting edge. Plus he's 28 this year, unless he does a Duric.</p>
              <p>However, I'm not just critical on FTs, local footballers need to buck up as well. It's good to see a few venturing out of their comfort zone in the form of S-League into the Indon League. But, i don't think local supporter should ask too much from the team.</p>
              <p>Goal 2010 is a joke, and probably made us a laughing stock in this region. The ASEAN Football Championship (formerly known as Tiger Cup) winnings are just pure luck. The countries in this region probably thought of it as a Carling Cup to EPL Clubs.</p>
              <p>Go back to basics, get them right first before going to the stage. Otherwise, not only will u lose face in front of the audience, you will also lose support from your fans.</p>

              <p>Actually we haven't gone backwards, we beat thailand for the first time in 34 years at their turf, reach the third round of world cup qualifying for the first time as well..it's a little improvement although obviously it's not good enough...</p>
              <p>but think about if we got a result against jordan, then we'll be going to the asian cup for the first time on merit as well, we came so close....</p>

              <p><br>It is simple case of 'goheadgostan'&gt;meaning sometimes you move forward and sometimes you need to back up&gt;LOL</p>
              <p>All SIngapore needed was a draw to be off to the Asian Cup and into the history books .Was that too hard to ask for ? After the equaliser they should have played defensive and pulled every muthur furker son back into defence,isnt this what they had trained for.....to absorb all kinds of attacks?That was the strategy.This would have made the Jordanian more kanchiong as the clock  runs it course the pressure would be on host team playing infront of their own rowdy fans.It is said that this was the most important game in Singapore soccer so if you were playing in this match how many % should you put into this game? Ok then lets rewind back to the game in SIngapore against Thailand, THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE MOTHER OF ALL GAMES ,PAST OR FUTURE FOR SINGAPORE!!!!</p>
