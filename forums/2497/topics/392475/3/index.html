              <p>The sad truth is, after years and years of foreign imports into Asian soccer, standards have never improved except for Japan. Even they have stagnated too. Asia is always a place for 2nd, 3rd grade foreigners........and whoever "spotted" the "talent" of precious, agu, shi jiayi etc.....that fella deserves to be shot!</p>

              <p>Let me share with you one Unker Story</p>
              <p>When I first came to Japan they just started the J-league and I played for an amatuer team which is now renamed as a 'Venforet' in J-2 league.At that time the level of soccer was so low that people who didnt know me or Singapore thought I was a Brazilian Japanese import player.Now ar I dont even dare to tell people that I was born in South-East Asia.From my experience I can tell you that Japanese people used to play soccer like cartoon people who didnt use brain but lots of sprinting and aimless running around on the field but now look at them.Soccer is not the main sport in Japan but the soccer developement programs for the youth are very good starting with teams of toddlers.</p>

              <p>Too bad, when spore team under pressure, the passes also under pressure. The thinking go haywire and everything collaspe.</p>
              <p>That is spore team.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dont believe me, ask a thai side, score a quick 1 or 2 goal, and you can start to see spore crack, players play aimlessly and run as if gana hypotised. They not chasing balls, but chase shadow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I have a team that can think and work in pressure, play simple passes, fast in closing down players, know how to create open spaces, then my team will be able to beat spore. No magic. Just plain simple and accurate passes will beat spore.</p>

              <p>Just follow my pool (billiards) philosophy and see if it could be applied to Singapore Soccer.</p>
              <p>1) Learn all the basics down to every detail and take advance lessons from an expert  and he will show you  how it is practically done</p>
              <p>2)Start sparring  with reasonably skilled beginner and make sure you apply whatever skills and knowledge you have acquired to beat them</p>
              <p>3) Go a step up by matching up with players who are levels above you.Together with the exposure you already have by now,you should be able to take them.You might win some or lose some</p>
              <p>4) This step is the most important step to furthur your developement.</p>
              <p><strong>Never to lose any games to those who you have already beaten soundly in the past (several times)</strong></p>

              <p>If this goes on, surely the overseas team (Most probbaly Etholie FC) can outcast the local teams in S League.</p>
              <p>But Singapore had played against Liverpool and Poland before. Should have learnt from these two friendly matches.</p>
              <p>OT: Despite being crown for SEA games for many times for polo ball team, they do not manage to crown in Asian Games and Commenwealth Games.</p>
              <p>So, if Sinagpore wants to improve everything (crown in Asian, Olympics, Commenwealth etc...), train more players from Singapore Sports School, train more and organise the similiar competition like: YOG, and Asian Youth Games.</p>
              <p>Maybe all of the polys can conduct their PE lesson for at least 1 hour.</p>

              <p>Feels like instead of working harder to achieve more the whole team of regulars became like a family and got comfortable.It needs to be reshuffled from time to time but where to find players when he pool of talent from the S-league is so small  and resources have reached it limits?</p>
