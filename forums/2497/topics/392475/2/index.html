              <p>answer is simple. spore football lack basics. they should go back to basics, like learn how to control and trap a football, then learn how to pass properly to your team mates. they cant even string a few passes before being dispossessed by the jordanian players so easily. all they do is to hoof the ball up for the strikers to chase, and that lies the problem. you are giving the ball away so cheaply and they keep coming back to attack. there lies the problem. better employ a brazilian as coach and teach these footballers the basics of football better, then can play like samba football of SE Asia.</p>

              <p>that means is the sg coach who is mostly at fault right.</p>
              <p>this ang moh what his name raddy abromovich tactic is exactly that: defender long ball to striker who can tap it in..</p>
              <p>he probably thinking this is EPL standard. our defender cant even defend properly talk about long ball properly. and the strikers are all malays, who are small size and cant fight or hold ball well. this strat is doomed to failure.</p>
              <p>when is the sg coach going to get fired? and can along the way take all the foreign players back. i think only the ang mohs are doing ok can keep. the rest should just put in a container return to sender.</p>

              <p>Its the whole Singaporean soccer mentality that is at fault.I remember Shi Jia Yi was one of the most revered players but now what happened....no more love and support ar? 5 year rule problem you say? Still ,Qiu Li got to play last night at the ripe age of 28 didnt he? If this is a serious problem then get them when they are even younger....better still invite their parents to have sex in Singapore.<strong>EXCUSES,EXCUSES,EXCUSES</strong></p>
              <p>I also have a few<strong>  excuses </strong>too you noe!.Raddy's bag of tricks is already empty and he is unable to motivate this team to maintain or move up one level.Some of those 'FTs' need to be dropped and the Lions has to start looking for new talents  especially in the defence department.Time to go back to the drawing board and start fresh.Aim for Gold in the Sea games first when that is done then ASEAN cup......only then Asian cup ,Commonwealth games...forget about World Cup not the other end around.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>(only saw 30mins)</p>
              <p>to be fair to the sg team, two of our FTs were not playing, one their captain, and one wilkson or something. And with that, our MF were a bit weak.</p>
              <p>I find Lionel Lewis/Precious a bit apprehensive. With the Jordan's first attack. A cross from the right and their striker almost score with a header but he miss by a few inches. Lionel/Precious were spectators and that spell trouble.</p>
              <p>the first goal was nicely described by the commentators, precious did not go for the ball, he waited, so the jordan striker came in &amp;  took the chance and score.</p>
              <p>But from there, SG team did play better. They were coming from the flanks and if Nor Alam's pass to Dukic were a bit heavier, dukic would have scored in a fast reply. I think the goal did settle the sg but the defence esp centre is abit suspect.</p>
              <p>well, sadly, sg team is out of the asian cup..</p>

              <p>1) Spore cannot match Jordon. Confirmed.Count spore lucky that they only score 2 goals.</p>
              <p>2) Many bad passes by Spore. Aimlessly like chicken with its head.</p>
              <p>3) Spore players not closing down the Jordon players fast enough. Most stand and watch.</p>
              <p>4) The foreign import players especially that prc cant even chase the loose balls.</p>
              <p>5) The passing is awful. Look at Jordon attack, got speed, simple pass and deadly. Spore? They cant even penetrate!!!</p>
              <p>6) And why give respect to Jordon players? Seem like spore players very afraid of them, give them too much room.</p>

              <p>actually got alot of local singaporeans who have much more potential than the foreigners in our first team, just that they are unwilling to make national football their career becos no pay or no prospects</p>
              <p>so our FT coach bring in FT players who only here to collect $ and play with zero dedication. i have not watched local soccer for a decade, cant believe ppl still do or got hopes for our 21st century national team to accomplish anything.</p>

              <p>Where got prospect?</p>
              <p>You old you gana kick out.</p>
              <p>So why join soccer team, rather be own business.</p>
              <p>Govt dont want to fund, what to do?</p>
              <p>Spore soccer is declining, so as the ranking. If they keeps on playing SEA team, can kiss goodbye liao.</p>
              <p>Send entire team to play in other league (just like s league).</p>
              <p>Send them to middle east, Japan, or korea, or even better, south america countries, but not europe. It will improve.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Govt sure say got money or not? No money keep my mouth shut.</p>

              <p>Long ago, i said this singapore team cannot even make simple passes to string up attacks and hold possesion of the ball. All i see yesterday was the defender kicking the ball right up hoping for a striker to chest/head it down and make a silly mistake. how to even progress from the 'asean' standard ?</p>
              <p>Most of their passes are either weak, horrible or off target. I as a singapore football fan is not being harsh on their performance and i can see they are working tirelessly on the pitch. But seriously, they should work on their fundamental skills. No point being the fittest player in asean but lose out to middle east skinnier counterparts.</p>

              <p>raddy avramovich played for west brom in the old division 1 of the 70 and 80s. Long ball tactics, "kick and rush" and of course, low technical skills were the trademarks of that era.</p>
              <p>He is applying the same shit for sg football. Yes he can be a good tactician but that's all about it. I agree with rooney9 that we should hire a brazillian.</p>
              <p>And we don't need so many malays anymore. The govt shd do something to encourage the chinese to take up football professionally but then again, this is "in my dreams" LOL. Look at trinidad and tobago, honduras, holland etc. Their population is a few million, ours too. Why can't we do it? We are simply Singapore Inc.</p>

              <p><br>There is a myth that 'White Men Cant Jump' meaning white people cant play basketball.The is also a myth in Singapore that Chinese boys dont know which is their left leg from their right leg when it comes to kicking a soccer ball.I say give everybody a chance to prove their worth and who knows maybe one day we can even see Indians playing ping pong and Malays playing Water Polo for Singapore.</p>

              <p>So when is the next major failure tournament ? Suzuki Cup ar?</p>
              <p>I dont know much about the names and national team but common sense tell me that some of them must go</p>
              <p>Raddy -The past few years he kept saying ,'If the team play and follow to my instruction they can overcome anything' That means he has totaly lost all clues on what to do and has washed his hands properly even before any blame can fly to his face.</p>
              <p>Duric -Old legs,please either you retire this old horse to stud or you take a gun and put it out of misery.He should have played for Singapore 15 years ago not now as a good semi-retirement policy for himself</p>
              <p>Precious Amujeyakumar (dont know his full name)- Even the sports writer at CNA  had to use the word 'precious' twice ,as if to hint at something.This player talk big but fail big also and look how  scary it is everytime Raddy endorse his faith in Precious Amujeyaratnam (sorry i really dont know his name) once even saying he is currently one of the best players for the Lions.</p>
              <p>The others who play like pendulum sometimes ok and sometimes not so ok ...well what can I say?</p>
