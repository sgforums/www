              <p><strong>For while </strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span></a><strong> have stuttered and slipped back from Premier League champions to Premier League also-rans, Mourinho has gone on to reach even greater heights. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>Mourinho achieved such rapid success at Chelsea in such a short space of time that Abramovich came to expect nothing but glory and silverware. As such, when the trophies dried up, even a little, the <em>Special One</em> was shown the door.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>Since then, Avram Grant, Luiz Felipe Scolari, Guus Hiddink, Carlo Ancelotti and Andre Villas-Boas have sat in the hot seat and none have looked like coming close to matching Mourinho's achievements.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>As they have all discovered - Villas-Boas apart - the Russian billionaire can simply wake up one day and decide he has had enough and a change is needed.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>This time, though, Abramovich is probably reasoning that if he does not give Villas-Boas time then the undoubtedly talented Portuguese may go on to great things at another club. As has happened with Mourinho.</p>
              <p>Jose worked wonders at Inter Milan and is now doing so at Real Madrid, who currently lead Spain's La Liga by three points, with a game in hand, over the mighty Barcelona.</p>
              <p>Here, we look at how Chelsea have fared since Mourinho's departure and how the man himself has fared since leaving Stamford Bridge.</p>

              <div id="mainBodyArea">
              <div class="firstPar">
              <p><strong>Despite his glittering array of achievements at Porto, Chelsea and Inter Milan it would be the second campaign at Real Madrid which would tell us just how special the ‘Special One’ is – with indications that he would quit the Bernabéu come what may. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>That has changed. Now the signs are that Mourinho will stay in Madrid — he has two more years on his contract after this season — and that he is happier than ever. It’s clear he’s happy because he’s not saying anything. There have been no outbursts, no controversies, no grand statements. Nothing.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>With all three of his former clubs in varying degrees of crisis, he has resisted the temptation to gloat. There has been no war of words, no provocation while the incident in August when he shoved his finger in the eye of Barcelona assistant coach Tito Vilanova, after a tempestuous Super Cup tie, seems like an awful long time ago.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>Instead, Mourinho has let his team do the talking and there is a quiet confidence that he has assembled a squad formidable enough to not only wrestle the Spanish title away from Barcelona, but also to take the <span style="color: #000000;">Champions League</span> trophy from Pep Guardiola.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>The strength of that squad is evident in the fact that Mourinho — having won his power struggle with the now former director general Jorge Valdano – spent €55 million (£47 million) with the arrivals of Fabio Coentrao, Raphael Varane, Hamit Altintop and, most excitingly, the young Turkish midfielder Nuri Sahin. Yet none of them was in the team for last weekend’s thumping 4-1 victory over city rivals Atlético.</p>
              <p>Real are now three points clear of Barcelona in the league table, with 34 points from 13 games, scoring four more goals, have won 13 times in a row and have walked their Champions League group, scoring 16 goals in five ties. And it is those statistics which are the most exciting of all as they prove that Mourinho has also adapted as a coach.</p>
              <p>Real play far better football, a far more attractive and attacking game, than he ever managed at his previous clubs, the manager transforming Karim Benzema from a €35 million (£30 million) waste to one of Europe’s best strikers.</p>
              <p>Mourinho eventually wants to come back to England. He’s made no secret of that and his present behaviour, plus the way he has adapted, will not have gone unnoticed and might just be revising opinions of his eventual suitability at, for example, <span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span> as Sir Alex Ferguson’s eventual successor.</p>
