It will, however, dwarf the Â£130,000-a-week deal recently agreed with captain John Terry.<br><br>Luring Ronaldinho from the Nou Camp is not going to be easy, and not just because the summer transfer window closes this Friday. There is the buy-out clause in the contract Ronaldinho signed at Barcelona in September 2005 which runs until 2010. It is a staggering Â£85million. But Abramovich is desperate to see his Chelsea side play with more flair and adventure, not least after seeing them stutter to a 1-0 win against Portsmouth on Saturday, and would consider it money well spent for the 27-year-old, who has twice been named World Player of the Year.<br><br>Stamford Bridge officials have also been encouraged by Ronaldinho's stuttering performance as part of a three-pronged attack in Barca's La Liga opener against Racing Santander, which they drew 0-0. Evidence is mounting that the talented attacking quartet of Ronaldinho, Samuel Eto'o, Thierry Henry and Lionel Messi is becoming increasingly difficult for Nou Camp boss Frank Rijkaard to juggle.<br><br>Sportsmail understands that Moreira flew back to Spain last night to speak to his brother following the fixture in Santander and discuss the meeting he had with Abramovich.<br><br></div>

As Sportsmail revealed on Monday, Chelsea's Russian owner has already held two meetings with the Brazilian's brother, Roberto de Assis Moreira, after he approached the club. </strong><br><br>Encouraged by those meetings, Abramovich is now ready to authorise a deal worth a staggering Â£100million for a player who would add flair to an already formidable Chelsea team.<br><br>Half that money would go to Ronaldinho in wages over the next five years and the other half would go directly to Barcelona as a British record Â£50m transfer fee for the 27-year-old double World Player of the Year.<br><br>Ronaldinho has an Â£85m buy-out clause in his contract but the full amount applies only to Spanish clubs and is essentially designed to prevent him from ever following Luis Figo to Real Madrid.<br><br>Barcelona's sporting director, Txiki Beguiristain, told Sportsmail on Monday that Ronaldinho was not for sale. 'Any big European club would want Ronaldinho but he is ours and there is no chance of him leaving,' he said.<br><br>'Honestly, not even Chelsea have the kind of money that can match the value we put on Ronaldinho. He is the symbol of the club and it is therefore impossible to sell him.<br><br>'It would be sporting suicide to do it now. To help a big Champions League rival like Chelsea would be total madness. If the agent has travelled to London that is not important to me.'<br><br></div>
