            <div class='col-md body'><p>SINGTEL strategy is simple. capture as much market share it has by offering low prices for now and freebies thrown in to entice people to switch network. it is prepared to lose money anyway. once it has the volume to rival or surpasses starhub, it will slowly and gradually start to increase prices one, I can guarantee you that. that will be many years down the road, not a mere 3-5 years time. also it also need to win the next bidding after the present bidding has ended, so that it wont go to waste the money spent on the winning bid this time round. doesnt make sense that starhub win the next bidding and customers flocked back to starhub again. EPL or BPL is the cashcow of cable tv in Singapore, retail and corporate customers like clubs, pubs and kopi diam.</p></div>

              <p>Agreed.The two telcos are in tantrum to hookwink viewers to signing up for their services.All these big organisations cannot be trusted when they say they are doing it for the benifits for the general public.They're a big bunch of bullshit trying to squeeze out every ounce of the general public.</p>
              <p>Early there were the banks offered whatever sort of investments to the public then came the financial meltdown and so many pple were sucked dry of their moneys and the banks said that was not their faults and they could not be responsible for the debacle and just washed their hands clean.How can we trust all these big bussiness organisations?They are just taking innocent consumers as suckers.</p>
              <p>Therefore,we the consumers must not be their suckers,we must endure the agony of not watching those EPL matches for awhile and not subscribe to their services so that their bussiness suffer a lack of viewrship for a period,in the meantime, when they had secure the rights of telecast they have to continue to pay for the rights to the relevant owners of the programme and when there's a drastic drop in viewership their bussiness will certainly suffer and hence the "power of the consumers" will prevail.</p>
              <p>We, the consumers must show to these "low-down","blood-sucking" organisations that we're no pushovers.</p>
              <p>I'd stopped my Starhub cable tv subscription eversince they upped the fee for the sports channel.I'm managing very well without it.</p>
              <p>If I can do it,so can you!C'mon show them!</p>

If they keep it at 15.50 even with BPL, thats great. If they keep at Starhub price, then thats fine with me. If higher than that, they are crap. Anyway, good also. I will cancel sports package, keep the Discovery and drama channels, then subscribe to Mio;s sports frenzy. Wun make alot of difference to my overall spending.</p></div>

              <p>This is a load of bull, Singtel not going to increase prices? I won't be surprise if they start to charge $16 alone for CL and another $25 for Premier league... And they will "give us" a special package if we sign up for both at $35 + gst... This is already an increased of $10 bucks from the current price... And I think this is the best we can hope for as it could be much more... Maybe $40 to $50 bucks just to watch football on tv. Bottomline is they are going to make money straightaway and not wait another 5yrs or 10 yrs down the road...</p>
              <p>I am just curious who do they make their bids to? Direct to the Premier League in England or our very own Media Development Authority (MDA)? Cos how is China showing English Premier League matches for free?</p>
              <p>I have to say I smell a rat here... If the MDA was the only party who could bring it in, I am sure it won't cost that much...  And they in turn can pass it to both Singtel and Starhub and they can compete for subscribers with better or cheaper package deals...</p>
              <p>But sadly, we are just the little people in this money making deal... In other words, the ones that get squeezed...</p>
