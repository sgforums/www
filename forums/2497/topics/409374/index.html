              <p><em>Ramires: Now picks up £11,000 a day</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">SIX years ago Ramires was working as a builder in Rio de Janeiro earning just TWO QUID a day.</h2>
              <p>Now he picks up £11,000 a day after his £17million move from Benfica to Chelsea.</p>
              <p>But the one-time bricklayer insists his humble beginnings back in Brazil make him proud.</p>
              <p>For seven months, he woke up at the crack of dawn for a nine-hour slog on the building site - which he claims has given him the strength of character to survive the Premier League's physical demands.</p>
              <p>He said: "I worked on a building site when I was younger to help at home.</p>
              <p>"I'm not ashamed of that. That made me the man I am today, giving me the character I am now.</p>
              <p>"I was 16 or 17 working there. On Tuesdays and Thursdays I'd work from 7am until 4pm because, after that I had football practice.</p>
              <p>"I earned around £30 every 15 days."</p>
              <p>Ramires is in line to make his Chelsea debut at home to Stoke today.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Brazilian midfielder Ramires is set to make his debut for </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span></a><strong> against Stoke on Saturday and insists he is ready for the physical challenge of the Premier League.</strong></p>
              <p>The 23-year-old, who cost £17million from Benfica, is likely to start on the Stamford Bridge bench with Chelsea having scored six goals in both of their first two league games this season.</p>
              <p>But he cannot wait to begin his Premier League career and is under no illusions about the physical and mental toughness required in the world's most competitive league.</p>
              <p>Ramires, talking through an interpreter at Chelsea's training ground, said: 'I understand the challenge ahead, both in the Premier League and the Champions League and I'm ready for that. If I hadn't been ready, I wouldn't have signed for a club like this.</p>
              <p>'I know what lies ahead and I'm looking forward to taking on that challenge.'</p>
              <p>Ramires has been handed the number seven shirt most recently worn by Andriy</p>
              <p>Shevchenko, the Ukranian who came to Stamford Bridge with a big reputation but turned into a £30million flop.</p>
              <p>But the Brazilian, who was part of his country's squad at the World Cup, vowed to shed buckets of sweat in the Chelsea cause to ensure he would be a success.</p>
