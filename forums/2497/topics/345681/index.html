              <p>Â </p>
              <p><strong>MADRID - Brief reports of matches played
              in the Primera Liga on Sunday:</strong></p>
              <p><strong> ALMERIA 2 ATHLETIC BILBAO 1</strong></p>
              <p>Hugo Sanchez's second league win at the helm of Almeria was
              sealed with two first-half goals.</p>
              <p>Juanma Ortiz headed the opener after 26 minutes and Kalu
              Uche swivelled to score the second before the break. Joseba del
              Olmo broke away to score for the visitors midway through the
              second half.</p>
              <p><strong>GETAFE 5 SPORTING GIJON 1</strong></p>
              <p>Sporting's new signing Inaki Lafuente had a debut to forget
              in goal as Getafe ended a run of four straight defeats in style.</p>
              <p>Striker Roberto Soldado made the most of an error to score
              Getafe's opener, and Esteban Granero looped in a shot from
              distance soon after.</p>
              <p>David Barral's solo effort put Sporting back in the game
              just before the break but Soldado scored again, Ikechukwu Uche
              made it 4-1, and Soldado completed his hat-trick from the
              penalty spot.</p>
              <p><strong>MALAGA 1 ATLETICO MADRID 1</strong></p>
              <p>Atletico are still seeking their first win of 2009 after
              coming from behind to draw with the team just below them in the
              standings.</p>
              <p>Apono's long-range shot skimmed off a defender to put Malaga
              ahead in the 22nd minute, but John Heitinga levelled at a
              freekick just before halftime.</p>
              <p><strong>REAL MADRID 1 DEPORTIVO CORUNA 0</strong></p>
              <p>Real Madrid made it five wins on the trot but were never
              comfortable against Depor.</p>
              <p>Raul glanced in a header from Lassana Diarra's cross just
              before the break. Angel Lafita went close for the visitors and
              Arjen Robben's pace almost earned a second for Real at the end.</p>
              <p><strong>REAL MALLORCA 3 VALENCIA 1</strong></p>
              <p>Mallorca were led to their first league victory since late
              October by midfielder Jurado.</p>
              <p>The 22-year-old pounced on a loose ball for the first after
              eight minutes and was brought down for a penalty which Jose Luis
              Marti scored in the 41st. A minute later, Jurado broke away for
              the third. Vicente pulled one back for Valencia in the second
              half.</p>
              <p><strong>REAL VALLADOLID 1 ESPANYOL 1</strong></p>
              <p>New Espanyol coach Mauricio Pochettino was unable to crown
              his league debut at the helm with a victory.</p>
              <p>Valladolid's Henok Goitom nudged in Jonathan Sesma's shot
              after 42 minutes but Sergio Sanchez levelled with a header from
              a corner 11 minutes from time.</p>
              <p><strong>RECREATIVO HUELVA 1 REAL BETIS 0</strong></p>
              <p>Recre's mini-revival continued with a fourth game unbeaten
              at the expense of Andalucian rivals Betis.</p>
              <p>Javier Camunas scored the winner 18 minutes from time with a
              superb glancing header.</p>
              <p><strong>SEVILLA 0 RACING SANTANDER 2</strong></p>
              <p>Sevilla were unable to cope with Racing's giant Serbian
              striker Nikola Zigic and failed to make the most of their extra
              man after Racing's Oscar Serrano was sent off in the 32nd
              minute.</p>
              <p>Zigic's header from a Pedro Munitis freekick was saved on
              the line but Cesar Navas put away the rebound, and Munitis
              supplied the freekick for Zigic to poke in the second in the
              46th.</p>
              <p><strong>Played Saturday:</strong></p>
              <p><strong> BARCELONA 4 NUMANCIA 1</strong></p>
              <p>Barcelona showed little sign of slowing up at the top of the
              table as they breached Numancia's well-organised defence with
              four second-half goals.</p>
              <p>Lionel Messi tapped home from Daniel Alves's set up just
              after the restart and Samuel Eto'o doubled the lead soon after,
              before Jose Barkero lashed in a freekick for the visitors.</p>
              <p>Thierry Henry slotted away Messi's pass to make it 3-1 and
              the Argentine squirmed through for the fourth and just failed to
              complete his hat-trick by hitting the bar at the end. Numancia
              finished with 10 men after Cesar Palacios was sent off.</p>
              <p><strong>VILLARREAL 1 OSASUNA 1</strong></p>
              <p>Osasuna were rewarded for their ambition with a point at
              Villarreal when an error by home defender Pascal Cygan allowed
              Portuguese striker Dady to equalise from close range in the 64th
              minute.</p>
              <p>Italian striker Giuseppe Rossi had put the home side in
              front, showing fine technique to control a cross on his chest
              and finish with a deft touch in the 28th minute.</p>
