              <p><em>Ferguson celebrates in the Moscow rain after defeating Chelsea in the European Cup final last May</em><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1186593" rel="1186593|3| nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1186593/United-legend-Fergie-boss-look-gushes-Chelsea-chief-Hiddink.html"> </a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Guus Hiddink has called Sir Alex Ferguson the greatest modern manager in the English game. The </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea </strong></span></a><strong>boss said his </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> counterpart commands respect throughout world football because of his continued dominance at the very top of the sport.</strong></p>
              <p>Hiddink said: ‘There have been big managers, legends, in the past. In the modern game, he has proven that he is the best. It's reflected in titles – national and international.</p>
              <p>‘He is the leading man, for many years, and it's not that easy to keep the level and sharpness year after year. He shows he can do it, so he is well respected.’</p>
              <p>The Chelsea manager also disagreed with the notion that Ferguson will field a weakened team in United’s last league fixture against Hull City on Sunday. </p>
              <p>The Tigers must win to be guaranteed Barclays Premier League football next year but, with the title already in the bag and a Champions League final against Barcelona to look forward to on Wednesday, United could be forgiven for resting key first-team players.</p>
              <p>Hiddink, whose side travel to relegation-threatened Sunderland for the Dutchman’s last league game in charge, said the idea of a ‘weakened team’ is misguided at the top of the Premier League.</p>
              <p>‘The teams who are playing on two or three roads, like us and Manchester United, have constructed very competitive squads,' he said. 'So it's not a weakened team that will start.</p>
              <p>‘Looking at our team and that of Manchester United, if there are changes, the strength of the team is almost on the same level. If we make two or three changes, the team will still be very competitive whoever plays.’</p>
              <p>Hiddink plans to field a strong side at the Stadium of Light, believing the momentum achieved by a win would help Chelsea ahead of their FA Cup final against Everton on May 30.</p>
              <p>‘We're taking every game seriously,' he said. 'It will be a team that likes to win as well, which means there won't be many changes to in the previous line-up.</p>
              <p>‘There's always a risk of injuries, but I like my players to be in a good rhythm so I'm not in favour of giving them time off. Their intensity might go down, and we'll need that in the Cup final.’</p>
