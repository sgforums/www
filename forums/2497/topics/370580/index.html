              <p>Adrian Mutu is facing a bill in excess of £14.6m after a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fifa"><span style="color: #005689;">Fifa</span></a> compensation award to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chelsea"><span style="color: #005689;">Chelsea</span></a> was upheld by sport's highest court. The sum was for Mutu's breach of contract relating to his having tested positive for using cocaine in September 2004. He was sacked a month later and after the five-year-long legal battle that ensued, the Court of Arbitration for Sport today definitively rejected the Fiorentina and Romania striker's arguments.</p>
              <p>They were as follows:</p>
              <p>* That the £14.6m compensation related to the full residual value of his transfer fee, although he had no say in the fixing of that figure when he joined Chelsea.</p>
              <p>* That in summarily sacking him at the time of the positive test, Chelsea had taken insufficient steps to limit their damages.</p>
              <p>* That the Fifa disputes resolution chamber which fixed the compensation award has jurisdiction only in cross-border disputes: he claimed that he was therefore being discriminated against as a foreigner.</p>
              <p>* That Fifa rules state his new club [Livorno or Juventus at the time of the previous rulings] should be jointly liable alongside the player for compensation payable, however that has, as yet, not been enforced.</p>
              <p>In a statement the CAS said: "In his appeal to the CAS, Adrian Mutu sought to set aside the DRC decision and establish that no compensation was due to be paid by him to Chelsea FC.</p>
              <p>"The CAS Panel concluded that the appeal brought by the player was to be dismissed and the measure of damages, as awarded by the DRC, was to be confirmed. Adrian Mutu must therefore pay €17,173,990 (£14.6m) to Chelsea."</p>
              <p>Chelsea have so far declined to comment. But although today's award is a significant victory for the Stamford Bridge club, they have already written off the £14.6m and will not expect easily to receive the sum from the 30-year-old. Anyone expecting an instant windfall for Carlo Ancelotti's summer transfer budget would be mistaken.</p>
              <p>Since the compensation was set by the football authorities and is principally enforceable by them, Mutu may attempt to test the resolve of Chelsea, as well as the legal foundation for such awards to be upheld outside sport, by simply retiring from the game.</p>
              <p>But for now, at a time when there is significant dispute among the anti-doping authorities and player-representation organisations about how to deal with positive tests for recreational drugs, the CAS's decision is a stark warning to any sportsman thinking of dabbling in prohibited substances.</p>
