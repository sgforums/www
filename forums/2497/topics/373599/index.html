              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> have launched a last minute bid for Bayern Munich winger Franck Ribery.</p>
              <p>Bayern are finally considering cashing in - with a deal to sign direct replacement Arjen Robben almost done. <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> are offering £57 million for the Frenchman.</p>
              <p>Holland midfielder Rafael van der Vaart is also in talks to follow his <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Real Madrid</span></abbr> team-mate to the Allianz Arena.</p>
              <p>So far, the Blues' only marquee signing has been the £18m capture of
              Yuri Zhirkov from CSKA Moscow, but a long-running pursuit of Ribery
              could finally pay off following the latest bid, according to <em>France Football</em> magazine.</p>

              <h2>NO MORE BUSINESS FOR CHELSEA - KENYON</h2>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon says it's unlikely they will sign
              any new players before the end of the transfer window next week.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Blues have brought in Nemanja Matic, Daniel Sturridge, Ross
              Turnbull and Yuri Zhirkov so far this summer while star striker Didier
              Didier committed their future to the club by signing a new contract.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And having made a 100% start to the Premier League campaign
              after three games - as well as clinching the Community Shield against
              Manchester United - Kenyon feels there's little reason to add further
              to the Chelsea squad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We have concentrated on re-signing the players we wanted and
              that has been really successful," said Kenyon. "We have had a great
              start to the season and (manager) Carlo Ancelotti, before he joined,
              was very happy with the squad, and we have strengthened that with Yuri
              Zhirkov.</p>
              <p>"We are happy with the squad and we believe this year we can go on further."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meanwhile Kenyon was more than happy with the outcome of the
              Champions League draw, which put Chelsea in a group with Atletico
              Madrid, Porto and Apoel Nicosia.</p>
              <p>Portuguese champions Porto have been frequent recent opponents
              for Chelsea, having faced the Blues in the group stage in 2004/05 and
              the quarter-finals in 2006/07.</p>
              <p>Atletico Madrid, who finished fourth in Spain last season, will
              be new opponents for the Londoners while Apoel, from the Cyprus capital
              Nicosia, came through the qualifiers by beating FC Copenhagen.</p>
              <p>"We have to generally be pleased with the draw," said Kenyon.
              "There are no easy games and no easy groups but overall there is not
              too much travel and we managed to avoid one of the big ones.</p>
              <p>"We have played Porto twice in the competition and ex-Porto
              players have been an important part of Chelsea's history. We know Porto
              better than most."</p>
