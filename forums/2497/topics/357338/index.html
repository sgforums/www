              broadcast, after accusations that he was a bad father following his
              bitter split from fiancée Elen Rives.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEH7G8yFVUw">•  <strong><strong>Listen to Lampard's outburst here...</strong></strong></a></p>
              <p>The
              England and Chelsea midfielder called the phone-in show in a 15-minute
              rant to blast LBC presenter James O'Brien, after the DJ said that men
              who allow their children to live in inferior circumstances to them were
              "weak and scum".</p>
              <p>His sister had been listening to the show and
              was angered by negative comments callers made about the footballer,
              which spurred the England star to phone in.</p>
              <p>In an emotional and
              angry exchange, Lampard said: "Since I've had kids every penny I earn
              and every yard I run on the football pitch is for my kids. It hurts me
              every day when I wake up and my kids are not there."</p>
              <p>The
              30-year-old called the presenter an "idiot" for upsetting his family on
              the first anniversary of his mother's death and accused Rives of
              "having had a few drinks" when she made the remarks in a national
              newspaper.</p>
              <p>He said: "Someone approached her in a bar and got her
              talking after she had a few drinks. My ex-girlfriend is very distressed
              about the story. She gave it away in a moment of weakness."</p>
              <p>Miss
              Rives said that their daughters Luna, three, and Isla, one, were living
              in a small flat while Lampard had stayed in their £8.5m townhouse.</p>
              <p>But
              Lampard said: "They are living in a temporary flat which is actually in
              Fulham. It's not a bad flat at all. I am buying a house at the moment
              which is going to be of equal standard to mine if not better.</p>
              <p>"It
              hurts me every day when I wake up and my kids are not there. Luckily I
              have a relationship with my ex-girlfriend where we will share custody
              or whatever you want to call it. For three nights a week - and I'm away
              two or three nights for my football - the kids wake up in my house. I
              look after them solely."</p>
              <p>Lampard became emotional when O'Brien
              said that he also had daughters and would fight "tooth and nail" to
              keep his family together.</p>
              <p>He said: "What do you think I have been
              doing for the last two years? Let me tell you something now, right, my
              mother died a year ago today and that has had a huge impact on my life
              and my family's life and on my sister's life and unfortunately that has
              had a huge impact on my relationship at home. I find it insulting that
              you insinuate I wouldn't fight tooth and nail for my kids. You don't
              know anything about me.</p>
              <p>"The hardest part of this break-up is not
              waking up with my kids every day. So before you start insinuating and
              calling people weak and scum on a radio station, sitting on a high
              horse which you are.. I hope one day that your wife or your girlfriend
              doesn't come up to you and say, I don't want to be with you any more.
              That will hurt you as well."</p>
              <p>He then went on to tell O'Brien that he had no right to discuss his personal life.</p>
              <p>He
              said: "I have to wake up and listen to idiots like you say, I read
              this' and this is what he's doing' and it's wrong. I put up with it and
              keep my mouth shut. The only reason I rang you is because my sister is
              distressed and as I said, it's the anniversary of my mum's death.</p>
              <p>"Do you think my sister needs to hear idiots like you saying that on the radio station?"</p>
              <p>O'Brien
              apologised for bringing up the issue on the anniversary of Lampard's
              mother's death, but added: "You will understand that I am not likely to
              have an anniversary like that in my desktop diary.</p>
              <p>"You cannot expect verbatim first-hand quotes from the mother of your children to go unremarked by the general public."</p>
              <p>The conversation then ended like this:</p>
              <p><strong>Frank:</strong> Listen I've spoken much too much about my private life today already -
              I didn't expect to have a phone call with you this morning. So I'll
              leave it there thank you.</p>
              <p><strong>James: </strong>So you won't give us a quick rundown on your thoughts for the champions league semi-final then.</p>
              <p><strong>Frank:</strong> No, I certainly won't.</p>

              <p>That stupid DJ got off lightly in my opnion. Even though Frank was all worked up and all, I still feel he was gentlemanly enough about it. He didn't curse or swear, and yet he told it like it is.</p>
              <p>I feel for him being apart from his kids, and it says a lot about a man who takes action when his sister is distressed.</p>
              <p>Shame on the idiotic DJ.</p>

              <p>Below is an extended version of the phone in, and as I listen to it more especially the extended version, I really find the DJ is a jerk.</p>
              <h1><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwbEBncB7rc">Hear It! Frank lampard's On Air Radio Rant</a></h1>
              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwbEBncB7rc"><em>Click to listen.</em></a></p>
              <p>Drawing and asking questions, what crap is that man. He was so strongly implying and insinuating everything.</p>
              <p>Once Frank starts going tough on him, he;</p>
              <p>1)starts hiding in his shell about how what he says is just part of his job.</p>
              <p>2)keeps saying he's just drawing "generalised comments" off the newspaper</p>
              <p>3)talks about how he's just asking questions and obviously not expecting a phonecall direct from Frank himself</p>
              <p>Utter disgrace of a human being, too disgusted to even learn the DJ's name. What a scum!</p>

              <p>Well, managed to learn his name afterall. O'Brien.</p>
                      <p>Here he is trying to say how he was not at fault in an interview with SKY Broadcasting.</p>
                      <h1><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmTQHi5-XdQ">Radio host O'Brien hit back at  Frank Lampard rant</a></h1><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmTQHi5-XdQ">Click here to listen.</a>
                      <p>Still seems like he's trying to imply that Frank is less of a man than he really is. And it's quite clear that he is still sticking to what that one newspaper articlar quoted as truth. It's not even that he spoke to Frank's ex himself.</p>
                      <p>Apparently, he thinks provoking and instigating a response was the right thing to do.</p>

              <h1>Frank Lampard vs James O'Brien the full transcript</h1>
              <p>James O’Brien: “The contention is as you know, in the newspapers over
              the last couple of days is that you’re painted as a bit of a rat.  I'd
              just like to offer you the opportunity to defend yourself first…”</p>
              <p>Frank Lampard: ”I’m not sure about maybe being painted in the papers as
              a bit or rat. The reason I’m calling in is my sister just phoned me up
              and said she had been listening to the show and she was slightly
              distressed particularly by your comments calling me weak and scum. Is
              that right? I missed the show.</p>
              <p><br> James O'Brien: "No I didn't call you scum.  I suggested that any man
              that could comfortably allow his children to live in cirucmstances
              inferior to his own would deserve that description, but of course what
              you have now is the opportunity to tell us why you don't."</p>
              <p><br> Frank Lampard. "First of all you’re incorrect to say that anyway, my
              situation is where is I’ve split up as a lot of people do that across
              the board, regardless what profession you are, whether you're a
              footballer or whether you work in a bank or whatever. Unfortunately I
              have split up with my girlfriend and my kids will never ever live in
              inferior circumstances to me. I just caught the end of your
              conversation with a gentlemen then and you said that, about people that
              are working and about their kids and it should be all about their kids.
              And that’s exactly how I live my live now, everything do in my career
              in football terms, before I had kids it was all for myself and since
              I’ve had kids, every penny I earn and every ounce and every yard I run
              on the football pitch is for my kids. Unfortunately I’ve split up with
              my girlfriend so they’re now living in a temporary flat which is
              actually in Fulham Chelsea and it’s not a bad flat at all I'll let you
              know and I’m actually buying a house at the moment which is going to be
              of equal living standard if not more to mine.”</p>
              <p>James O’Brien: "I appreciate that it is a little uncomfortable to have
              your personal life picked over, but that's the nature of the world you
              live in.“But they’re not waking up in bedrooms that they’ve known all
              their lives?”</p>
              <p>Frank Lampard: “Unfortunately you’re wrong because you don’t know the
              terms of my thing but when I split up with my girlfriend… let me
              explain to you what happened she was actually out in a club or a bar
              and someone came up and approached her and didn’t actually say they was
              a journalist and actually got her talking after she’d had a few drinks
              and caught her at the wrong time….Unfortunately when you spilt up
              obviously you’re not going to carry on living in the same place, that’s
              a fact of life. Unfortunately that means, and it hurts me every day
              when I wake up and my kids are not there, but when you split up, as
              anyone will tell you, you’re not going to carry on living together.
              Luckily I have a relationship with my ex-girlfriend where we have
              decided where we’re going to share custody of them. So for three nights
              of the week, half the nights of week, and I’m away probably two or
              three nights with my football anyway, the kids wake up in my house. I
              look after my kids solely, I have a nanny that comes but I spend all he
              time with my kids. I wake up if my kids wake up at three in the
              morning, if they wake up at six in the morning regardless of if I have
              a football match or not. They wake up in the bedrooms I decorated for
              them and that’s what they will always do.”</p>
              <p>James O’Brien: “But not at the moment, but that’s the plan for the immediate future?”</p>
              <p><br> Frank Lampard: “No that’s what they’re doing at moment, I don’t know what made you think that they’re not.”</p>
              <p>James O’Brien: “I’m only going by what has been printed in the newspapers.”</p>
              <p>Frank Lampard: “Where did it say they’re not staying with me anyway?</p>
              <p><br> James O’Brien:(reads Elen’s quotes): “I’m in small flat waiting for my
              own flat with our two daughters, he is in our house which he has turned
              into a batchelor pad”.</p>
              <p>Frank Lampard:“Where did it say they are not staying in our house?”</p>
              <p><br> James O’Brien: “If you describe something as a batchelor pad, Frank,
              the general assumption is going to be is that it’s not a family home.”</p>
              <p>Frank Lampard: “That was her description when she was drunk, yes, the
              problem is you read the papers now, if you’re going to be a man that
              reads the papers and takes everything as gospel truth and start calling
              people weak and scum that’s a sign of how you are, that’s not a sign of
              the reality. Luckily enough the last caller heard there shows there are
              some genuine people out there.”</p>
              <p><br> James O’Brien: “That is the nature of what I do, my phone lines are
              wide open and people can call me an idiot people can call me what ever
              they want and people like you can phone in and say why the newspapers
              have got it wrong. You’ll accept that the 60 million people in this
              country don’t have the privilege of phoning up Frank Lampard for his
              side of the story, they’re going to read what they see in the papers
              and draw up their own conclusions.”</p>
              <p><br> Frank Lampard: “That doesn’t make it right that they can draw the
              conclusion you are making, which is a completely negative one. You are
              calling me weak and scum.”</p>
              <p><br> James O’Brien: “I was asking questions to which you are providing some
              answers. For me if you’ve got little girls and this is going to sound
              awful, I have little girls of three and one, I can’t conceive of any
              circumstances in which I wouldn’t fight tooth and flipping nail to hold
              my family together.”</p>
              <p><br> Frank Lampard: “Excuse me, what do you think I’ve been doing for the
              last two years? Let me tell you something now, my mother died a year
              ago today, which has been a huge impact on my life, my family’s life
              and my sister’s life. And unfortunately that’s had a huge impact on my
              relationship at home. And there is nothing, I wish I could do a lot
              about that, but unfortunately I can’t do nothing about that. So I find
              it insulting that you’re telling me you would fight tooth and nail and
              insinuating that I wouldn’t fight tooth and nail. That’s what I’ve
              spent time doing. You don’t know anything about me and you’re
              insinuating I’m weak and scum because I haven’t fought tooth and nail.
              The hardest part of this whole break up for me is not waking up with my
              kids every day. So before you start insinuating and calling people weak
              and scum on a radio station, getting on a high horse which you are, cos
              I hope one day that your wife or your girlfriend doesn’t come to you
              and say I don’t want to be with you anymore and unfortunately that
              means you wont see the kids for a few days a week. That will hurt with
              you as well but you’d have to deal with it.”</p>
              <p>James O’Brien: “It would break my heart Frank.”</p>
              <p><br> Frank Lampard:“Yeah and it’s breaking my heart, do you think I’m happy?”</p>
              <p>James O’Brien: “Of course I don’t think you’re happy that’s why I’m delighted you've taken this opportunity to have your say.”</p>
              <p>Frank Lampard:“Then you should stop insinuating…”</p>
              <p>James O’Brien: “I’m not insinuating anything Frank, I’m merely describing a news story my friend and I appreciate you...”</p>
              <p>Frank Lampard:“You’re saying any man that let’s his kids life in inferior circumstances to him is weak and scum.”</p>
              <p>James O’Brien: “Yes I am saying that and you’re telling me you’re not that man, so in a way you agree with me.”</p>
              <p>Frank Lampard: “Yeh but you’re insinuating about me…”</p>
              <p>James O’Brien: “So I was describing a news story. Let’s not get…”</p>
              <p>Frank Lampard: “Listen, at the time you were saying that statement you
              were talking about me. Correct or not? The last phone conversation I
              heard was about me. My sister has been listening for the last half an
              hour and the conversation was about me.”</p>
              <p><br> James O’Brien: “I’m not going to apologise to you for reading out a
              story from a newspaper and drawing generalistic questions. For what
              it’s worth, you have explained yourself absolutely brilliantly.”</p>
              <p>Frank Lampard:"What I’d like you to do in future is think when it
              becomes the personal issues, about people’s families, about people’s
              kids, and you’re degrading them as human beings.I grade myself as a
              human being as how I bring up my kids. <br> I have to wake up and then listen to idiots like you say ‘I read this
              and this is what he is doing’. And it is wrong. But I have to put up
              with it and I keep my mouth shut. <br> But, today, the only reason I ring you is because my sister is
              distressed and as I said to you earlier it is the anniversary of my
              mum's death. Do you think my sister needs to hear idiots like you
              saying it on the radio station?"</p>
              <p>James O’Brien: "Of course I don’t, I was completely unaware of your family anniversary."</p>
              <p>Frank Lampard: "Sometimes you should think about things before you
              speak about them because you are speaking about personal people now.
              Next time I'll speak to you man to man, forget the radio show, I’ll
              speak to you man to man about that."</p>
              <p>James O’Brien:"I’d welcome that opportunity Frank and I will apologise
              to your family for drawing up difficult domestic situations on a day
              which was clearly of enormous emotional impact already. I’ll offer that
              apology unreservedly. But you'll understand that I'm not likely to have
              an anniversary like that in my desktop diary. All I'll say to you is
              this, and you've made your case brilliantly.  You've given me pause for
              thought, but you can not expect verbatim first hand quotes from the
              mother of your children, when a man that enjoys the level of publicity
              and profile that you enjoy to go unremarked by the general public. Noe
              you can call me an idiot if you want, you can call me whatever you
              please, that's your perogative as a caller to this radio station. But
              to comment upon stories in the news is actually a very important and
              intrinsic part not only of what we do as journalists but of democracy
              and the public as a whole. So if the facts are wrong you have more
              power at your finger tips to put the record straight more than just
              about anybody else in Britain. It's astonishing that you've chosen to
              do it this way rather than hiring an army of lawyers, or an army of
              PRs. But anything that has been said on this radio station this morning
              in response to comments that were genuinely given by your former
              partner. There is no speculation there.”</p>
              <p>Frank Lampard:“I agree with you there completely, the unfortunate thing
              about this is that my ex-girlfriend she didn’t grow up in this life at
              all… Unfortunately I have to live that in the public eye. Now someone
              has approached my ex-girlfriend, pretending to be friendly, caught her
              at a moment where she is a little bit drunk and down or whatever and
              got a load stuff out of her. At the same time you’re saying that people
              have a right to discuss that, unfortunately it’s probably what many
              other women have done in a bar or a coffee house or in a club or
              anywhere when they have split up with someone. Unfortunately mine gets
              splashed across the papers and then leaves it open for people like you
              to make accusations and innuendos and things about people, which is
              very unfortunate right? My ex-girlfriend is very distressed about the
              whole situation 'cause she didn’t want that to come out. She can have
              her private thoughts about me and speak to her close friends. Someone
              has conned her basically. She has been conned. And by being conned and
              then comes out as a pure quote like she has sold her story. She gave
              her story away in a moment of weakness. That really is the statement of
              the culture of England and Britain that someone would try to con a
              personal statement out of you to then be broadcast everywhere for
              everyone to debate.”</p>
              <p>James O’Brien: "I hear you. That’s an accurate description of how modern media works. Rightly or wrongly."</p>
              <p>Frank Lampard: "And you’re part of it. If you choose to earn your living like that, then that’s fair enough."</p>
              <p>James O’Brien:"Of course I am I don't dispute that. Well I’m not as
              good at football as you or I’d probably rather be doing what you’re
              doing. Is there no chance at all, Frank, of this relationship being
              rescued?"</p>
              <p>Frank Lampard: "Listen I’ve spoken much too much about my private life
              today already – I didn’t expect to have a phone call with you this
              morning. So I’ll leave it there thank you."</p>
              <p>James O’Brien: "So you won’t give us a quick rundown on your thoughts for the champions league semi final then."</p>
              <p>Frank Lampard: "No, I certainly won’t."</p>
              <p>James O’Brien: "Frank Lampard thank you very much, for well what can I say, for being a man."</p>
