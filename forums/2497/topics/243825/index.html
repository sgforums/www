You enjoy celebrating a win and then when something like that happens, it sort of shocks you," he told Sky Sports News.<br><br>"But when a couple of days pass and you don't see it on the front of the papers and when you're watching Sky all day, then maybe it'll just be something that'll be put right and hopefully not happen again."<br><br>Lampard will face another hostile environment when he heads to Israel for England's Euro 2008 qualifier on Saturday, but he insists it is something players thrive on.<br><br>"I enjoy it. I enjoy those atmospheres - that's what football's all about.<br><br>"I think they're the games - Champions League away games, England games away from home - those atmospheres have to inspire you and make you want to do well, and that's the attitude we'll all have to have on Saturday."<br><br>A win for England is particularly important with the team's poor form of late, and while Lampard is yet to open his account in the qualifying campaign, he is refusing to get too worried about his lack of goals.<br><br>"I haven't scored in qualifying game for England in this campaign yet, so I'm determined to do that, and we've got players in midfield who can contribute, and it'll be important we try to do that.<br><br>"We've got talented players, we've got creative players, so let's hope they can create and score goals.<br><br>"But as a midfield player you can't expect to be scoring all the time. It goes with the territory. There's a lot of other things you have to put in your game first, and hopefully the goals are just a bonus that will come because of that."</span></div>
