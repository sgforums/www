              ARSENAL are leading a four-way chase for Celticâ€™s Olympic hero Ki Sung-Yueng. 
              
              Atletico Madrid, QPR and Fulham are all in the hunt for the South Korea midfielder â€” making their interest known to Parkhead powerbrokers. 
              
              SunSport can reveal Hoops chiefs are now anticipating a concrete Â£8.5million offer from Gunners boss Arsene Wenger. 
              
              Itâ€™s understood Emirates chief scout Steve Rowley has the playmaker at the top of his list of targets. 
              
              Ki was outstanding for his country at the London Games, netting the winning penalty that knocked Team GB out as South Korea won bronze. 
              
              His hugely impressive performances have only increased the prospect of the 23-year-old leaving Parkhead this summer. 
              
              Neil Lennon is in no hurry to sell any of his first-team stars â€” especially ahead of next weekâ€™s Champions League qualifier with Swedish outfit Helsingborgs. 
              
              Itâ€™s unlikely any deal will be done before then but Lennon accepts letting Ki go at a hefty profit would be good business. 
              
              Celts paid out just Â£2m for him to FC Seoul three years ago and now stand to rake in around FOUR TIMES that amount. 
              
              Meanwhile, Celts kid Dylan McGeouch says he has no idea what happened to him when he was knocked out in the friendly clash with Real Madrid in Philadelphia. 
              
              The 19-year-old, whoâ€™ll need surgery to fix a jaw broken in a collision with Nuri Sahan, said: â€œI didnâ€™t know anything about it. 
              
              â€œThe first thing I knew I was coming round and was surrounded by a lot of medical people.â€�

              ARSENAL were last night set to cave in and strike a deal with Manchester United for Robin van Persie.
               
              They are ready to start serious talks with United boss Alex Ferguson hoping to seal a Â£22million move before the weekendâ€™s Premier League opener.
               
              United and Italian giants Juventus have yet to improve offers of Â£15m. 
              
              But Van Persie, 29, was jeered by his own fans in Sundayâ€™s win over Cologne in Germany and is now desperate for a move to be completed.
               
              United see that as the opening to force through a deal.
               
              Arsenal were demanding Â£25m for the Dutch striker, who has just one year left on his contract. 
              
              But the club will now settle for less â€” rather than have a player on their books who does not want to be there and could become a hate figure for the fans.
               
              RVP scored 37 goals in all competitions last term, 30 of them in the Premier League.

              <p><strong>Manchester City are trying to snatch hot-prospect Chilean striker Angelo Henriquez away from Manchester United.</strong></p>
              <p>City boss Roberto Mancini sent top spy Gary Worthington to watch the 18-year-old sensation play two games for his country's Under-20 side in a tournament in Holland at the weekend.</p>
              <p>And now the champions want to hijack the £4million <span style="color: #000000;">deal set up between neighbours United and Universidad de Chile for their starlet</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span> who has already scored a dozen first team goals for them.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Henriquez has appeared destined for Old Trafford since he was a kid - he has already been over for a couple of visits, and there is an option in place to take him on when he has a chance of a work permit.</p>
              <p>United also updated their files on Henriquez in the Dutch tournament, and are looking at him as <span style="color: #000000;">a possible alternative to Paris Saint-Germain-bound Brazilian Lucas Moura</span><span style="color: #000000;"> after the collapse of his multi-million move.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">But City could step in and try to do their own deal with Universidad de Chile as the club's money-men reacts to </span><span style="color: #000000;">Mancini's stinging criticism about a lack of activity in the transfer market</span> this summer.</p>
              <p>Henriquez is open to offers and could be swayed if City make a bid to take him now rather than wait - and his club would also take the guaranteed cash.</p>

              <h2><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Luka Modric" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/luka-modric"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Luka Modric</span></span></a></h2>
              <p>It is incredible how long this saga has dragged on for given its relative straightforwardness: Modric wants to leave Tottenham, Tottenham are prepared to sell him, Real Madrid want the player and he wants to join them. Simple. Not quite. More than a month has passed since André Villas-Boas, the Spurs manager, confirmed Modric's desire for a transfer yet all that has happened since then is the Croatian has been forced to train on his own after going AWOL ahead of a tour to the USA and the two clubs involved have postured over a fee, with Spurs refusing to budge on £35m. Thankfully, a compromise figure of £25m appears to have been agreed upon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Emmanuel Adebayor" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/emmanuel-adebayor"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Emmanuel Adebayor</span></span></a></h2>
              <p>If ever a saga epitomised the dark depths that Premier League football has descended to, it is the endless bartering between Manchester City, Tottenham and Adebayor. The Togolese striker spent last season on loan at White Hart Lane and scored 17 league goals in 33 appearances under Harry Redknapp. Despite a change of manager, Adebayor is still expected to make a permanent switch to north London, although tedious negotiations that have dragged on since the beginning of the summer have still not reached a conclusion. The 28-year-old is on ludicrous money at City and is unwilling to take a cut on his £170,000-a-week contract that he signed in 2009. Roberto Mancini has said the striker has "no chance" of playing for City in the forthcoming campaign, but the champions will have to subsidise a large chunk of Adebayor's wages if the move is to be finalised.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Robin van Persie" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/robin-van-persie"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Robin van Persie</span></span></a></h2>
              <p>The Dutchman played for Arsenal in their pre-season win against Köln on Sunday but it remains a near certainty that he will be leaving the club soon. His destination? That remains unclear with Juventus, Manchester United and Manchester City all interested in the player but none able to seal a deal despite weeks of behind-the-scenes manoeuvrings. Van Persie is apparently keen to move to United but they, according to Sir Alex Ferguson, cannot agree a fee with Arsenal, while City have not even made a firm bid. Juventus, meanwhile, have all but accepted the 29-year-old does not want to move to Italy. This one looks set to run and run and run.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>Daniel Agger</h2>
              <p>Last week Brendan Rodgers confirmed what had been rumoured for some time – that Manchester City are interested in signing the Dane, and after stating "every player has a price" it appeared the Liverpool manager was laying the ground for him to move there. This would surely only be the case if Agger himself had asked for a transfer given his abilities but it has transpired that the 27-year-old wants to stay put, so much so that he has had YNWA (You'll Never Walk Alone) tattooed on his knuckles. So it seems Liverpool may be trying to push the player out of the door, and with City still keen on him there could be more to come from this curious tale.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Andy Carroll" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/andy-carroll"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Andy Carroll</span></span></a></h2>
              <p>Another player who appears to have no future at Liverpool and one who has been left dangling by the club for more weeks than is perhaps kind. Brendan Rodgers made it quite obvious soon after he took over at Anfield in June that he was open to offers for Carroll and there has since been loan-first moves from West Ham and Newcastle, both of which have been rejected. Rodgers publicly insists he is happy with Carroll but it is more likely that he is holding out for a larger bid for the £35m striker and will allow him to go should the right bid land his way. Carroll, meanwhile, does not know if he is coming or going.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Michael Owen" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/michael-owen"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Michael Owen</span></span></a></h2>
              <p>Less of a saga this and more the slow, sad decline of a once sparkling career. Owen was released by Manchester United in late May and insisted then that at the age of 32, and despite a catalogue of injuries, he could still play in the Premier League. The striker has since held talks with Stoke but an agreement has stalled over Owen's reluctance to accept a short-term contract. A deal could still be done with Stoke, or indeed Everton who are apparently keen on the former England forward, but as things stand Owen remains in a long, agonising limbo.</p>
