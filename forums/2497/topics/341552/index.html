              <p>i am arsenal fans but the look of it. i dont think we can win anything this season.</p>
              <p>1. almunia is too soft to be a great goalkeepers.</p>
              <p>1. central defenders cant deal with aerial heights.</p>
              <p>2. alex song is too slow and light weight to be a wordl class defensive midfielder.</p>
              <p>3. denilson is too slow and lightweight to be deploy as a winger or creative midfielder.</p>
              <p>4. rosicky is good as not having! he is on the treatment table more than on the field.</p>
              <p>5. theo walcott is too fast that he often left the ball behind when he run past defender.</p>
              <p>6. bendther, well i think he will be sold once eduardo or asharvin join arsenal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>arsenal problem is too lightweight, lack of height, lack of experience leadership. and arsene wenger obsession with kids. arsenal is a top club, they shouldnt depends on yongster to fill the starting XI. As most of the footballers are late developers.</p>

              <p>west ham can develop lotsa good players from its youth system because the fans or the clubs has less pressure on the manager. they dont need to qualify for UCL, or UEFA cup. they just need to survive the drop. thus mamager will limited budget can have the time to developed the youngsters and give them time to mature.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but at arsenal and at big clubs, they have to qualify UCL to survive, putting alot of pressure on youngster to perform day in and day out.</p>
              <p>it is like putting the kids at a young age alot of pressure. some crumble at a result.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>yeah, maybe the problem all lies in wenger with his overly obessess with boys.  maybe mourinho comment and call him a pervert is correc afterall.</p>

              <p><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/08/07/330/Jay-Simpson-celeb-Barnet-v-Arsenal_1042405.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Arsenal's
              Jay Simpson has confirmed he will join Premier League strugglers West
              Brom on loan when the transfer window re-opens next month.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The 20-year-old is highly
              regarded highly enough by Gunners boss Arsene Wenger to have been
              offered a new two-and-a-half-year deal but the club have decided to
              send him out on loan to gain first-team experience.</p>
              <p>Simpson is yet to feature in the Premier League for Arsenal but
              played in this year's Carling Cup campaign and had a spell on loan with
              Millwall last season.</p>
              <p>"I feel as if I am called upon I could answer some questions
              but I want to be playing as well so it is a good chance to go out and
              get some games," Simpson told Ian Wright and Adrian Durham's Bowtime on
              talkSPORT.</p>
              <p>"Obviously if I am playing regularly I am only going to improve.</p>
              <p>"They [West Brom] play good football and if I get chances to score I intend to take them.</p>
              <p>"I have always wanted to play in the Premier League, it has always been one of my goals.</p>
              <p>"I am just going to go there and try my hardest and try to score as many goals as I can."</p>
              <p>Simpson would bolster an attack which has lost the services of
              Ishmael Miller for the rest of the season due to a cruciate ligament
              injury.</p>

              <p>i am arsenal fans but the look of it. i dont think we can win anything this season.</p>
              <p>1. almunia is too soft to be a great goalkeepers.</p>
              <p>1. central defenders cant deal with aerial heights.</p>
              <p>2. alex song is too slow and light weight to be a wordl class defensive midfielder.</p>
              <p>3. denilson is too slow and lightweight to be deploy as a winger or creative midfielder.</p>
              <p>4. rosicky is good as not having! he is on the treatment table more than on the field.</p>
              <p>5. theo walcott is too fast that he often left the ball behind when he run past defender.</p>
              <p>6. bendther, well i think he will be sold once eduardo or asharvin join arsenal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>arsenal problem is too lightweight, lack of height, lack of experience leadership. and arsene wenger obsession with kids. arsenal is a top club, they shouldnt depends on yongster to fill the starting XI. As most of the footballers are late developers.</p>

              <p>i share the same feeling as you. only difference is not "i think they will not win anything" but they will not win. even in such dire situations, arsene wenger is unwilling to spend to buy players. and even if he buys, he is looking to get yaya toure, a defensive midfielder, we need attacking midfields and better defenders, not an average player who can't make the barcelona squad. we need someone like robben, van de vaart.</p>
              <p>in relation to your points above:</p>
              <p>1) almunia is a good keeper. he has good reflexes, agility and handling but lacks the most important attribute keepers must have: positioning. that's why he always dives when people shoot into the goal yet can't reach it. if he was in the correct spot, he could have saved it. also arsenal is the only team in the current top 6 who has a 1st keeper who has 0 caps for the country.</p>
              <p>2) it's not about the height, it's about the jumping ability and other than gallas and toure and sagna, the rest are featherweights.</p>
              <p>3) alex who? when was alex song even meant to be an Arsenal midfielder. he is a million miles away from world class because although he has the stature, he cannot read the game well, we need someone like mascherano or gilberto silva</p>
              <p>4) just check out denilson's assists to game ratio and balk at the paltry figure, in fact it's close to 0.1. a creative midfielder need to string passes well and start counter attacks - again another short featherweight.</p>
              <p>5) Rosicky is a member of Arsenal Hospital not Arsenal football club. He gets knocked over too easily.</p>
              <p>6) Walcott is skilful but Arsene Wenger should put him in front rather than on the wing so that he can contribute in terms of goals</p>
              <p>7) Arshavin will never come to Arsenal because of the high asking price. Eduardo will probably come back and contribute as much as Kanu had contributed - i.e. average. Bendtner will just be another Bentley or Pennant - a forgotton talent who only shined in other clubs.</p>
              <p>just do a heads to heads comparison with the squad now and that of 2002</p>
              <p>seaman vs almunia - seaman. world class keeper</p>
              <p>cole vs clichy - draw</p>
              <p>lauren vs sagna - sagna</p>
              <p>campbell vs gallas - campbell</p>
              <p>adams vs toure - adams is a legend</p>
              <p>pires vs nasri - can't tell yet. nasri is full of potential</p>
              <p>ljungberg vs walcott - ljungberg</p>
              <p>vieira vs denilson - vieira</p>
              <p>bergkamp vs diaby - bergkamp</p>
              <p>henry vs adebayor - henry</p>

              <p>Well analysis.</p>
              <p>As much as I hate to admit it, Arsenal are slowly becoming a second-tier team in the EPL.</p>
