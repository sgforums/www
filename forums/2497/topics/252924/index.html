I have done the calculations and we will finish at least five points clear of United at the top of the table."<br><br>Ferguson warned his players against complacency - and wisely so, since Chelsea went on to win their game in hand, a 1-0 victory over Newcastle.<br><br>United's 12-game unbeaten run ended in a 1-0 defeat at West Ham in Alan Curbishley's first game at the helm of the struggling Hammers on 17 December.<br><br>Hours later Chelsea scored two late goals to beat Everton 3-2, closing the gap to two points.<br><br>Report: West Ham 1-0 Man Utd<br>Report: Everton 2-3 Chelsea<br><br>Ferguson opined "I'm not sure they are on a charge" but Chelsea seemed to have a real sense of momentum.<br><br>However, another crucial injury would undermine Chelsea's attempt to close the gap on their rivals.<br><br>Inspirational skipper John Terry had missed the match against Everton after suffering a recurrence of a back injury.<br><br>31 December 2006<br>1st: Man Utd P21 W17 D2 L2 53pts<br>2nd: Chelsea P21 W14 D5 L2 47pts<br><br>The talismanic figure was ruled out of the busy festive period and his absence was keenly felt as Chelsea conceded two goals in each of their last four league matches of 2007, drawing two of them.<br><br>Worse still, Chelsea announced on 28 December that Terry had undergone surgery to remove a sequestrated lumbar intervertebral disc.<br><br>He would be out for some time.<br><br>United, in stark contrast, enjoyed a happy Christmas, winning three matches after the defeat by West Ham with Ronaldo, whose future was in doubt several months earlier, scoring twice in each game to take his tally for the season to 12.<br><br>The year ended with United six points clear of Chelsea.<br><br>JANUARY<br><br>January heralded the opening of the transfer window - although United had already announced some time earlier the short-term arrival of Henrik Larsson on a loan deal from Helsingborg.<br><br>Mourinho taunts Man Utd over lead<br>Kenyon dismisses Mourinho reports<br><br>The problems all seemed to belong to Mourinho, who started the year by claiming: "In this moment Chelsea cannot defend. I am the first to know that."<br><br>Robert Huth and William Gallas had left the club the previous summer and, with John Terry now sidelined, Mourinho, for all his expensive purchases, found himself short of central defenders.<br><br>Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho<br>Mourinho had precious little to smile about in January<br><br>Yet the Chelsea boss let it be known that his requests to bolster his squad had fallen on deaf ears - and stories began to appear suggesting he would not be at the club beyond the end of the season.<br><br>Blues chief executive Peter Kenyon claimed on 9 January that there was "absolutely no truth" in the rumours.<br><br>The poor form of Mourinho's big summer-signings Shevchenko and Ballack was not helping the situation but Mourinho nonetheless found time to taunt Ferguson.<br><br>Speaking on 3 January, Mourinho said: "Considering the problems Chelsea have had, Manchester United should be 10, 12, 14 points clear of us. I am happy to be six points behind.<br><br>"In my opinion, Manchester United did not take advantage of our bad moments."<br><br>But the bad moments did continue - with Chelsea losing 2-0 at Liverpool, while Terry, despite persistent rumours of his imminent return, remained sidelined for the rest of the month.<br><br>31 January 2007<br>1st: Man Utd P25 W19 D3 L3 60pts<br>2nd: Chelsea P25 W16 D6 L3 54pts<br><br>Thankfully for Chelsea, United failed to capitalise on the defeat at Anfield, instead losing 2-1 at Arsenal the following day.<br><br>United led 1-0 with seven minutes left but conceded two late goals.<br><br>They ended the month six points clear but it could so easily have been nine, while Cech had returned from his lengthy injury against Liverpool and was back in goal for the Blues.<br><br>FEBRUARY<br><br>Chelsea only played two Premiership games in February - winning both of them.<br><br>Terry returned at the start of the month and the Blues won the first trophy of the season, the Carling Cup, with a victory over Arsenal.<br><br>28 February 2007<br>1st: Man Utd P28 W22 3 L3 69pts<br>2nd: Chelsea P27 W18 D6 L3 60pts<br><br>United took full advantage of Chelsea's participation in that competition by winning all three Premiership fixtures they played - extending their lead to nine points, having played one game more but with a vastly superior goal difference.<br><br>It might have been only seven points had the irrepressible Ronaldo not scored a late winner at Fulham on 24 February.<br><br>MARCH<br><br>No more could have been asked of Chelsea in March.<br><br>Report: Watford 0-1 Chelsea<br>Report: Liverpool 0-1 Man Utd<br><br>With lynchpins at the back, Cech and Terry, having returned to the fold, Chelsea won all four of their Premiership fixtures - including their game in hand on United.<br><br>It was superb form under extreme pressure - and from a team that had looked to be faltering at the turn of the year.<br><br>United could be forgiven for believing they had dealt a major blow to Chelsea when John O'Shea's injury-time goal gave them a 1-0 win at Liverpool on 3 March.<br><br>Salomon Kalou scored the vital goal in the 1-0 win at Watford<br>Kalou is mobbed by team-mates after his winner at Watford<br><br>It was the early kick-off that day and put United 12 points clear. However, only hours later Chelsea showed their mettle with a 2-0 win at Portsmouth before winning their game in hand - against Manchester City - to close the gap to six points.<br><br>Didier Drogba scored the opening goal against Pompey on 3 March to take his Premiership tally to 18.<br><br>After an unspectacular first season in the Premiership, his second was a revelation and the Ivorian was battling for the Premiership's Golden Boot with Ronaldo, who at the same stage of the season had scored 16 goals.<br><br>It almost turned sour for Chelsea at rock-bottom Watford on 31 March before Salomon Kalou popped up with a last-minute winner.<br><br>31 March 2007<br>1st: Man Utd P31 W25 D3 L3 78pts<br>2nd: Chelsea P31 W22 D6 L3 72pts<br><br>Mourinho admitted afterwards that dropping more points would have effectively handed the title to United.<br><br>United, in addition to beating Liverpool, won their other two Premiership fixtures, beating both Bolton and Blackburn 4-1.<br><br>But key defenders Gary Neville and Nemanja Vidic had picked up injuries during the month - stretching United's resources at a crucial time.<br><br>APRIL<br><br>Chelsea opened April with their eighth and ninth consecutive Premiership victories.<br><br>United, in contrast, suffered a defeat at Portsmouth at the start of the month - a loss that reduced their lead to three points and with the Red Devils set to visit the Blues on 9 May.<br><br>30 April 2007<br>1st: Man Utd P35 W27 D5 L4 85pts<br>2nd: Chelsea P35 W24 D8 L3 80pts<br><br>The result blew the title race wide open and Ferguson called on his players to hold their nerve.<br><br>"We have showed character all season and must do so again now," he said.<br><br>But his team slipped up again, drawing 1-1 with Middlesbrough at Old Trafford on 21 April and afterwards Ferguson admitted the result had "opened the door".<br><br>Plus, during the match Rio Ferdinand limped off with a groin problem, prompting Ferguson to talk of an injury crisis of "massive proportions".<br><br>The following day Chelsea had the chance to close the gap to one point but were held to a goalless draw at Newcastle.<br><br>Report: Chelsea 2-2 Bolton<br>Report: Everton 2-4 Man Utd<br><br>Mourinho was at his belligerent best afterwards, arguing that his team were having to contend with "new football rules" because "it is not possible to have a penalty against Manchester United".<br><br>He was referring to penalty claims by Sheffield United and Middlesbrough that had been turned down in recent games at Old Trafford.<br><br>Ferguson responded in no uncertain terms, stating: "Mourinho seems to be on some sort of personal crusade. We have four games to go now. If we get a penalty against us, Mourinho wins that war. That is wrong."<br><br>And so came what proved to be the decisive weekend of the season.<br><br>Michael Carrick and Cristiano Ronaldo celebrate the win over Everton with Sir Alex Ferguson<br>Ferguson (right) was delighted after the crucial win at Everton<br><br>Unusually, Chelsea and United both kicked-off at the same time, 1245 BST on Saturday 28 April.<br><br>After conceding a goal, Chelsea came from behind to go 2-1 ahead against injury-ravaged Bolton, while Everton took the lead against United - a situation that left Mourinho's team level on points with their title rivals.<br><br>But Bolton equalised after the break and, although Everton doubled their lead, United staged a brilliant comeback to win 4-2.<br><br>Ferguson danced on to the Goodison Park pitch at the end, clapping his hands. Stamford Bridge was eerily silent at the final whistle.<br><br>Mourinho argued the title race was "not over" but, with only three games left for each team, United appeared to have a decisive five-point advantage, allied with a hugely superior goal difference.<br><br>MAY<br><br>It was a bleak start to May as both teams suffered Champions League exits at the semi-final stage.<br><br>United shrugged off the hugely disappointing 3-0 second-leg defeat at AC Milan by winning 1-0 in a local derby at Manchester City.<br><br>Report: Man City 0-1 Man Utd<br>Report: Arsenal 1-1 Chelsea<br><br>After losing a penalty shoot-out at the hands of Liverpool, Chelsea faced a daunting trip to Arsenal.<br><br>They were up against it after Khalid Bouhlarouz was dismissed for a professional foul on Julio Baptista moments before half-time, with Gilberto Silva dispatching the penalty.<br><br>Despite a gallant second-half display at the Emirates during which Michael Essien levelled, the Blues could not find the winning goal which would have prolonged their title challenge.<br><br></div>

But Chelsea play a different brand, where they tend to look at the opposition, weigh them up and then beat them.<br><br>In contrast, United are probably more fluent, quicker on the counter-attack and are probably more exciting to watch.<br><br>That does not mean that Chelsea are not as good a team - because they are.<br><br>I really don't think there is anything between the two. And next season it will be interesting to see who the bookies make favourites for the title.<br><br>I have a hunch that Chelsea will be favourites. Regardless, Chelsea were favourites this season and look what happened.<br><br>To a certain extent, the money Chelsea had spent was supposed to negate any injuries, suspensions and loss of form.<br><br>But Chelsea did have a couple of critical injuries to goalkeeper Petr Cech and defender John Terry - and it cost them.<br><br>Those injures came at a critical time and both players were out for long spells. And you only have to look at Chelsea's record with Cech and Terry and their record without them.<br><br>Yet it is hard to say that Chelsea made a mistake by not bringing anyone to the club in January because it would have depended on who they bought.<br><br>But, certainly, by not buying anybody, Chelsea were left short of personnel for too long during the season.<br><br>Liverpool and Arsenal were the closest challengers to the top two but they must be massively disappointed after finishing so far off the pace.<br><br>Before the season I thought Liverpool had a good chance of winning the title but they got off to a terrible start and that ended their challenge right there.<br><br>Reaching the Champions League final is a massive consolation for Liverpool but they have not won the league for 17 years - and that is too long.<br><br>It has been a great Premiership - but there is a chasm between the top four and the others<br><br>Alan Hansen<br><br>Manager Rafael Benitez has already stated that Liverpool's priority next season will be the Premiership. If they are to get close, though, he needs to buy one or two Â£25m to Â£30m players.<br><br>As for Arsenal, the neutrals say they are the best team to watch - and I agree that their passing and movement is as good as anyone's and they are fantastic to watch.<br><br>But there is a certain way of playing against Arsenal and I think the lesser teams have cottoned on to it.<br><br>Arsenal did very well against the top three but dropped points where they probably shouldn't have.<br><br>If they are going to be successful again, they need more of a cutting edge and they have to learn to handle it when teams get in their faces.<br><br>There is a massive gap between the top two and the next two but there is hope for Liverpool and Arsenal - and it would be great to see four teams going for the title next season.<br><br>It has been a great Premiership - but it has to be said that there is a chasm between the top four and the others.<br><br>If Liverpool and Arsenal think it is hard to topple Manchester United and Chelsea, it is almost impossible for anyone else to even break into the top four. The gap is getting bigger and bigger.<br><br>And I expect the top four at the end of next season to be the same as this season.<br><br>In what order, I don't know. But it's an exciting prospect.<br><br></div>

And it is no coincidence that Chelsea conceded twice in each of the first four games Terry missed over the Christmas period.<br><br>Chelsea skipper John Terry<br>Chelsea's defence has suffered injury problems at key times<br><br>The lack of numbers in the centre of defence was an issue that Mourinho wanted to address in the January transfer window but he was not given the funds to do so.<br><br>The knock-on effect was that Michael Essien often found himself drafted into defence and his all-action displays were sorely missed in the heart of the Chelsea midfield.<br><br>Keeper Cech has surgery on skull<br>And Petr Cech, widely regarded as the world's best goalkeeper, missed several months with a fractured skull - further weakening Chelsea's defensive unit. Ashley Cole has also suffered from injury problems.<br><br>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson had struggled to fill the goalkeeping void left by Peter Schmeichel following his departure from the club in 1999.<br><br>A succession of keepers have been and gone but in Edwin van der Sar, Ferguson has finally found a suitable replacement.<br><br>Hard-man Vidic tipped to star in England<br>Serbia defender Nemanja Vidic has also enjoyed a fine season in the centre of defence, with his no-nonsense defensive style complementing Rio Ferdinand's more cultured approach.<br><br>Patrice Evra has matured at left-back while Gabriel Heinze has proved versatile and effective when required.<br><br>United also suffered from injuries - but Ferguson's team already had a solid lead at the top of the Premiership by the time Gary Neville, Vidic and Ferdinand were sidelined in the latter stages of the season.<br><br>Carrick completes move to Man Utd<br>United's defence has often been regarded as error prone over recent seasons but it has had a more solid look this time around - and been excellently protected by summer signing Michael Carrick.<br><br>And although United have kept fewer clean sheets than the Londoners, they have only conceded one goal or more in a game five times compared to nine by the Blues.<br><br>THE ENGINE ROOM<br><br>One crucial difference between this season and last has been the return of Paul Scholes.<br><br>Scholes missed five months of the last campaign with an eye problem and his presence has restored craft and maturity to the United midfield.<br><br>Michael Carrick and Paul Scholes<br>Carrick and Scholes have been superb in the centre of midfield<br><br>His range and accuracy of passing has allowed United's myriad attacking talents to flourish and he has formed a superb combination alongside Carrick, whose form has gone a long way to silencing those who questioned the value of his Â£18.6m transfer fee.<br><br>One of Chelsea's big summer signings was Michael Ballack who joined on a free transfer from Bayern Munich.<br><br>The German has had a disappointing season, not gelling with Frank Lampard in the middle of the park and looking a shadow of the player who was so dynamic for Germany at last year's World Cup.<br><br>Nigerian Jon Obi Mikel has been impressive since Christmas and has started to justify the hype but injuries elsewhere have meant that all-too-often his African compatriot Essien has been played in defence.<br><br>WORKING OUT WIDE<br><br>Pat Nevin on Chelsea's tactical shift<br>Mourinho's first two seasons at Stamford Bridge saw him favour the use of three in midfield, with two wide players and a solitary striker in front of them.<br><br>The Chelsea boss had an impressive pool of wide players in Joe Cole, Arjen Robben, Damien Duff and, for his second season at the helm, Shaun Wright-Phillips.<br><br>Cristiano Ronaldo<br>Ronaldo has been brilliant for Man Utd this season<br><br>But Cole, so impressive for Chelsea in recent years, has missed all but a handful of games this season, while Robben has also spent large spells on the sidelines.<br><br>With Duff sold to Newcastle last summer and Wright-Phillips often overlooked, Chelsea have not been as effective down the flanks.<br><br>United boss Ferguson also understands the importance of width and in the evergreen Ryan Giggs has a veteran winger who is both consistent and potent.<br><br>But the revelation has been Cristiano Ronaldo.<br><br>His Premiership future seemed in doubt when he was accused of playing a role in Wayne Rooney's dismissal against Portugal at the World Cup last summer.<br><br>Ronaldo secures PFA awards double<br>But the Portuguese youngster has been the Premiership's best player this season.<br><br>The 22-year-old has learnt to refine his vast array of skills. Instead of constantly overplaying he has used his gifts to hurt the opposition - as his return of 17 Premiership goals testifies.<br><br>FINDING THE NET<br><br>Didier Drogba's second season in English football has been an unqualified success.<br><br>The Ivorian is the Premiership's top scorer with 19 goals and his combination of physical power and finishing ability has proved too much for many defences.<br><br>Shevchenko not in Mourinho elite<br>Unfortunately for Chelsea their Â£30m summer signing last summer Andriyi Shevchenko has endured a difficult first season in England.<br><br>The Ukraine star's return of four Premiership goals from 22 starts and eight substitute appearances tells its own story.<br><br>His inclusion in the side alongside Drogba required a change of formation, while rumours that his signing was instigated by owner Roman Abramovich cannot have helped.<br><br>Didier Drogba (left) and Andrei Shevchenko<br>Drogba (left) has been excellent but Shevchenko has struggled<br><br>United sold Ruud van Nistelrooy to Real Madrid last summer.<br><br>The Dutch striker was prolific for United, with 95 Premiership goals in 137 starts - but with his presence came a relatively fixed style of play.<br><br>United's forward line this season - with the likes of Louis Saha, Wayne Rooney, Henrik Larsson, Giggs and Ronaldo - has been fluid and inventive and have not relied on van Nistelrooy to apply the finishing touch.<br><br>HARMONY AND HEARSAY<br><br>The good times have rolled down the Kings Road in the past two seasons as Mourinho, financed by the millions of new owner Abramovich, delivered back-to-back Premierships to wrestle the balance of power from Manchester United and Arsenal.<br><br>This season, however, the relationship between Mourinho and Abramovich has been the subject of constant speculation.<br>Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich<br>Relations have been frosty between Abramovich (pictured) and Mourinho<br>Their relationship is reported to have soured, leading to repeated suggestions that the Portuguese will not be in charge of the club next season.<br><br>Abramovich is said to have favoured a more attacking style of play and wants to win the Champions League above all else.<br><br>Mourinho, on the other, was extremely candid in January, explaining that although he wanted to sign a defender, the board would not provide the necessary funds.<br><br>My future is clear, says Mourinho<br>Chief executive Peter Kenyon made it clear in April that Mourinho would remain at the club - but the months of rumours may have unsettled a group of players trying to close the gap on United.<br><br>Recent seasons have seen unrest and uncertainty at Old Trafford - a situation that arose prior to, and following, the takeover of the club by Malcolm Glazer.<br><br>Glazer completes takeover at Man Utd<br>Fans rage at Glazer takeover<br>The American borrowed heavily to finance the purchase and many supporters feared it would necessitate radical and unwanted changes to their club.<br><br>Their worst fears have not materialised, while the Glazer family, with Malcolm's five sons and one daughter occupying six of United's seven boardroom seats, have maintained a low-key presence.<br><br>Ferguson does not seem to have been hamstrung in the transfer market and without the constant distraction from off-the-field issues the manager has been able to ensure everyone has been focused on what matters most - winning games.<br><br>WINNING WAYS<br><br>Both Chelsea and Manchester United have enjoyed lengthy periods of excellent form.<br><br>Crucially, though, it was United who made the best start, moving to the top of the Premiership and subjecting Mourinho's Chelsea to the role of pursuers for the first time.<br><br>United lost just one of their first 17 fixtures, drawing two and winning 14.<br><br>During the same period Chelsea lost two and drew three, winning 12 to give United a five-point lead.<br><br>Chelsea won nine straight games starting on 31 January - their longest winning streak of the season. United responded with seven consecutive victories of their own before losing to Portsmouth.<br><br>It seemed as though United might crack under the pressure of Chelsea's brilliant run but Mourinho's team lost crucial momentum with draws against Newcastle and Bolton.<br>Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho<br>It was a frustrating end of the season for Mourinho<br>In the end it seems Chelsea left themselves just too much ground to make up on their rivals.<br><br>Chelsea have won 29 games in each of their title seasons.<br><br>Last year they drew four and lost five on their way to the title, the season before drew eight and lost just once. This season Chelsea have drawn nine and lost three - with a maximum of 26 wins possible.<br><br>Chelsea won the title in 2005 with 95 points and the year after with 91. This year they can still reach 87 points.<br><br>It is not that Mourinho's team have suffered a dramatic lowering of standards, more that for the first time they have been seriously challenged.<br><br>United finished with 77 points in 2005 and 83 in 2006. This year they have played more consistently than in recent years and with a team that has a superb blend of experience and youth, United can finish the season with 94 points.<br><br>The coming together of the two clubs owes more to United's improvement than Chelsea's decline - and it has made for a brilliant title race.</div>
