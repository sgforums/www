            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Former Celtic midfielder Neil Lennon has revealed he almost signed for Wycombe Wanderers this week.</strong><br><br>The 35-year-old left Celtic after seven successful seasons and agreed to meet Wycombe officials as he ponders offers from several clubs.<br><br>Lennon, a former team-mate of Wycombe boss Paul Lambert, said: "Their offer put me in a real dilemma.<br><br>"I was impressed by what they had to say and almost joined them, but it took a lot of soul-searching to say 'no'."<br><br>Wycombe managing director Steve Hayes said: "I know how highly Paul rates Neil, both as a player and as a man, so I thought 'why not?' Let's see if he's interested.<br><br>"We did everything we possibly could to sign him, but the fact we're a League Two club went against us.<br><br>"Regrettably, that's the one thing we can't change overnight but it makes us more determined than ever to win promotion next season."<br><br>Lennon's agent Martin Reilly added: "Neil's been offered a contract by a top Premiership club and several from the Championship and other divisions.<br><br>"Steve Hayes put up a very convincing case and at one point I thought Neil was going to say 'yes', but Neil is still a very talented player and wants to test himself at the highest level he can."</div>

In fact, he told me that I might have to calm him down on occasions.<br><br>"I think he will be a refreshing, elder professional at the club and will complement the rest of the group. Signing Neil is a strong indication of the type of player we have been after."<br><br>Lennon added: "Basically I'm here because of Colin Calderwood. I was really impressed with him.<br><br>"I've asked high-profile people in the game, whose judgement I respect, what they think of him and they had nothing but good things to say about him.<br><br>"I know the club from my playing days in England and know the history and tradition of the place. It's a very good club, there's great potential here and I've very excited."<br><br>Lennon enjoyed a colourful career in Scotland since Martin O'Neill signed him from Leicester City in December 2000 for Â£5.75m.<br><br>During his time at the club, the Northern Irishman, who was linked with former club Leicester and Premiership new-boys Sunderland among others, won five Scottish Premier League titles, four Scottish Cups and two CIS Cups.<br><br>Forest narrowly missed out on promotion to the Championship last season, losing to Yeovil 5-4 on aggregate in the play-off semi-final.<br></div>
