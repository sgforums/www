Both have now left the club.<br><br>Defender Justin Hoyte is likely to be the solitary Englishman in the side when the Gunners line up to face West Ham on Sunday.<br><br><img src="http://www.teamtalk.com//Images/81140.jpg"><br><br>The Arsenal boss was criticised by the Hammers manager Alan Pardew last season following the Champions League victory over Real Madrid for not placing enough emphasis on home-grown talent.<br><br>It is a stance Wenger has always vehemently rejected - and at the time accused Pardew of hypocrisy and racism.<br><br>"I would never like to feel somebody is better than me, but sits on the bench just because he does not have the right passport," Wenger added.<br><br>"I am just concerned that when you love football, you have not got to act this way and be big enough, and capable enough to say 'you do not play because you are not good enough'.<br><br>"Elite sport is first about quality. That is what I fight for.<br><br>"I would prefer to say 'you make Â£4million per year in wages because you are good enough', rather than say 'I give you Â£2million a year because I need you and you have the right passport'."<br><br>Wenger believes such a system would be cheating the fans who part with their hard-earned cash at the gates.<br><br>The Arsenal boss added: "What can you say to a guy who pays money to watch your team? 'This player's first touch is not good, yes, we know but he is English. What can I do?'<br><br>"You are telling them 'yes, okay he is not good enough, but we have to play him because he is from the right country'.<br><br>"I would like to say, 'listen, whether he English, South African, French or South American, he is a good football player'.<br><br>"You say to a player, 'you play because you are better'. I have always done that in my life."<br><br>Wenger declared: "It is contestable because it is not defendable.<br><br>"How can you stop somebody from playing? Because just within the European Union, you cannot stop him from playing.<br><br>"It is a rule which cost a lot of time and money to produce, that will not resist the first challenge in the European Court.<br><br>"It will be destroyed."<br><br></div>
