              <h2>Carlo Ancelotti is on the verge of taking over as coach of Chelsea,
              as Sky Sports News claims that the Milan boss' representatives have
              agreed a deal for him to move to Stamford Bridge.</h2>
              <p>Ancelotti has been strongly linked with taking over at Chelsea ever since the sacking of Avram Grant just under a fortnight ago.<br><br>Sky
              Sports News claims that the Milan coach's representatives held talks
              with Chelsea officials this afternoon which resulted in an agreement
              for him to move to West London.<br><br>Now all that remains is for
              Ancelotti to give his final go-ahead to the deal, and for the Blues to
              agree a compensation package with Milan.<br><br>This all follows
              reports in the Italian media that Ancelotti met with Roman Abramovich
              in Paris last night at the Four Seasons George V hotel near the Eiffel
              Tower, where the Chelsea owner offered the Italian a four-year contract.<br><br>The
              meeting was long and thorough, and the Russian billionaire offered
              Carletto 7.2 million Euros net per year, as well as 100 million Euros
              to invest immediately on transfers, with the first target being Kaka.<br><br>Assistant
              coach to Ancelotti will reportedly be former Chelsea playing legend
              Gianfranco Zola, who is currently working with the Italy Under-21
              national team.<br><br>Milan Vice President Adriano Galliani has
              admitted that Ancelotti was in Paris last night but denied it was to
              have talks with Abramovich.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">"I spoke with Ancelotti. He was in Paris, but not to meet Abramovich. He was in Paris
              for business," said the transfer guru.</p>
              <p>Whatever the exact truth, it certainly seems that Chelsea are homing on their new manager.</p>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>ROMAN ABRAMOVICH has found out again that money cannot buy you everything. He thought his search for a new coach had secured him Carlo Ancelotti. But, instead, he ended up with egg on his face.</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Why? Because Ancelotti loves AC Milan more than he loves a buck. Despite the offer of a three-year contract worth £18million, the 48-year-old Italian spurned Chelsea’s advances and decided to stay at Milan on £3.8m a year.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">It is a bitter personal blow to billionaire Abramovich, who took on the role himself of finding a replacement for Avram Grant. Having admitted the mistake of employing his friend Grant in the first place, Red Rom proudly decided he would make amends. That vow led him to Ancelotti, who he has known and admired for the last four years.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Yet it was an incredible whirlwind of a courtship between the Blues and Ancelotti which began on the banks of Lake Geneva last week. As SunSport revealed, the two men had dinner in a restaurant in the Swiss city nine days ago, when Abramovich invited the San Siro chief to offer him some advice.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The Chelsea supremo was told he should look no further than Frank Rijkaard or Roberto Mancini in his search for a new coach. Both men, he told Abramovich, would make a good choice as coach for Chelsea. Ancelotti did not ask for the permission of his club officials before speaking to Abramovich, as the discussion was informal and not a job interview.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">After speaking for more than two hours on a whole range of football issues, though, Abramovich left the meeting convinced he had just spoken with his club’s new manager. A second meeting was arranged for last weekend, thought to have taken place aboard Abramovich’s yacht on the Adriatic. This time the Russian was not so coy and asked Ancelotti for a blunt assessment of the Chelsea squad and how it could be improved to win the Champions League.</p>
              <p class="article">Supremely qualified to give an opinion — Ancelotti has won two more European Cups as a coach — the two men talked seriously. For the AC Milan boss, meeting with another club’s owner did not seem like betrayal. After all, the Rossonieri faithful who used to idolise him had turned after a season in which their heroes did not qualify for the Champions League.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The club’s vice- president, Adriano Galliani, then made public his knowledge of Chelsea’s interest — even though Ancelotti had asked him not to. For the embattled coach, it seemed like the end of a seven-year stint as boss at the San Siro. A call was made to his lawyer on Monday, asking if the two sides could meet in Paris to finalise a deal.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">No doubt Ancelotti would have cast his mind back to August 1, 2004 and the first time he came across Abramovich. Their friendship initially sparked in the tunnel of Lincoln Field Stadium, Pennsylvania. It was just six weeks since Jose Mourinho had been appointed Chelsea manager and they and AC Milan were due to meet the following day in a friendly in Philadelphia.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">While Mourinho was busy taking a warm-up, Abramovich and his then wife Irina stopped to chat with the charming, grey-haired Italian. It looked a strange meeting between the suave Ancelotti and the slightly dishevelled supremo of Stamford Bridge in jeans and trainers.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">But language was no barrier to the conversation. Andriy Shevchenko happily acted as translator. Red Rom and Ancelotti spoke for more than 10 minutes about all sorts of football topics. The following day, Abramovich watched his new Portuguese boss lose 3-2 to the Italian master. He congratulated Ancelotti afterwards and the men exchanged mobile phone numbers.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Abramovich did not use the number for nine months, until after watching Ancelotti’s men lose the Champions League final to Liverpool on penalties in Istanbul. The message he sent to the Italian was: “You did not deserve to lose. It was a great injustice.”</p>
              <p class="article">Having seen AC Milan triumph over Liverpool in Athens since then, Abramovich became more convinced than ever that Ancelotti was the man to take his club to a higher level.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Monday’s Paris meeting ended with a cordial handshake with the Italian and his advisors. Abramovich was convinced he had his man. Meanwhile Ancelotti returned to Milan with an ultimatum for the club he loves and was told any demands he had to stay would be met.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">For Chelsea and Abramovich, it is a familiar story. Alex Ferguson and Sven Goran Eriksson have both said ‘No’ to managing the club in the past. Abramovich is a man used to getting his own way. But he might just now be starting to wonder exactly which top boss does still want one of the most prestigious posts in football.</p>

              <p class="article"><strong>Chelsea Statement </strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"><strong>CHELSEA</strong> last night issued a statement to deny they had offered the manager’s job to AC Milan chief Carlo Ancelotti.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The club insisted that they had not approached ANY club for permission to talk to their manager but claimed their search for a successor to the sacked Avram Grant was progressing well.</p>
              <p class="article">It said: ''Contrary to reports, Chelsea Football Club has not reached agreement with any individual to become manager, nor have we sought permission from any organisation to talk to their manager.</p>
              <p class="article">''We are extremely happy how our search is progressing.''</p>
