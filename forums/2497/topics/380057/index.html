              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> doesn't believe Mark Robins saved his job.</p>
              <p>But for a goal scored by Barnsley boss Robins in a 1-0 FA Cup third
              round win against Nottingham Forest in Jan 1990, many believe that
              Ferguson would have lost his job as United manager.</p>
              <p>But Ferguson said: "The goal at Forest was an important goal,
              don't get me wrong, and who's to say what would have happened without
              it, but I don't think it saved my job.</p>
              <p>"You never know in football. Who's to say how the club would have reacted if we'd lost and if crowds had tumbled?</p>
              <p>"One thing's for sure though. (Director) Bobby Charlton would
              not have let it happen. He knows better than anyone the heartbeat of
              this football club. This football club needed the foundation of youth
              and we were doing some great work on that side of it. Bobby knew we
              were on the right road."</p>
              <p>Ferguson admits he has been impressed by his former strikers progress in management.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: "Mark did a great job at Rotherham. They were
              going into administration and it's not easy if that happens because you
              cant get any players.</p>
              <p>"He had to work with what he had and I think that’s a good
              start in management, I really do. Learning the hard way is the best
              way.</p>
              <p>"When I was at East Stirling, there were only eight players
              when I joined the club. I had to get five players quickly just to get a
              team on the pitch. They gave me £2,000 to get five players!</p>
              <p>"My first signing cost £100 and that boy is now the chief scout
              at Ross County, George Adams. I keep joking to him: 'You were a huge
              waste of money!'"</p>
