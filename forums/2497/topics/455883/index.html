              <p class="body "> </p>
              <p class="body "><strong>Roman Abramovich has been accused of being panicked into sacking Andre Villas-Boas.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">Chelsea's billionaire Russian owner was spooked into the move by the rise of London rivals Tottenham and the growing power of Manchester City, according to ex-Blues defender Alex.</p>
              <p class="body "><span style="color: #000000;">Villas-Boas - ironically appointed as Spurs boss</span> earlier this month - was sacked in March, less than a year after Abramovich triggered a £13million release clause to sign him from Porto.</p>
              <p class="body ">Now, Alex – who played for AVB at Stamford Bridge before moving to Paris Saint-Germain in January – has revealed the extent of the pressure the Portuguese was under in west London.</p>
              <p class="body ">The centre-back said: “We [at PSG] certainly aren’t under the same amount of pressure.</p>
              <p class="body ">“Mr Abramovich never hesitated to show up and demand more effort – there were several team meetings.</p>
              <p class="body ">“We’ve met representatives of the owners, but the relationship at PSG is definitely less intense.” </p>
              <p class="body "> </p>
              <p class="body ">Although he slipped down the pecking order behind David Luiz and then January signing Gary Cahill under Villas-Boas, Alex believes Abramovich should have shown more patience with the 34-year-old.</p>
              <p class="body ">He told Champions magazine: “Andre should have been given more time.</p>
              <p class="body ">“After all, the club spent a lot of money getting him from Porto and needed to take into account that there was a new manager with new players to settle in.</p>
              <p class="body ">“Everybody [at Chelsea] was starting to look over their shoulders because Manchester City had arrived in the top four and Spurs were catching up.”</p>
              <p class="body "> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="body "><img class="captify" title="Fall guy: Abramovich feared dropping out of the Premier League's top four" src="http://i4.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article1133717.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/Roman+Abramovich" alt="Roman Abramovich" width="615" height="409"></p>

              <p class="body "> </p>
              <p class="body "><strong>Villas-Boas’ predecessor at Chelsea was Carlo Ancelotti, who Alex has since followed to PSG.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">The Italian was also dismissed prematurely last year, 12 months after winning the Double at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p class="body ">By contrast, Ancelotti retains the confidence of PSG's Qatari owners, despite finishing second in the French League to shock winners Montpellier, who have a far lower playing budget.</p>
              <p class="body ">PSG have responded by splashing the cash to land defender Thiago Silva and striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, both from AC Milan, for a total of £51m.</p>
              <p class="body ">Alex went on: “A team needs at least two seasons to gel properly and get itself into a position to challenge regularly for trophies.</p>
              <p class="body ">“When I joined PSG it was clear to me that we would not start winning things overnight.</p>
              <p class="body ">“It’s understandable that the arrival of the new owners and all the media coverage the team was receiving could get people overexcited.</p>
              <p class="body ">“But the players were always aware that we are in the process of building a foundation.”</p>

              <p>The sacking of AVB actually united the chelsea players and they wanted to play well to prove AVB wrong.</p>
              <p>So, AVB is instrumental in Chelsea winning FA Cup and CL.</p>
              <p>As for the pressure, it comes with in a package when you are paid so much.</p>
              <p>Same for ponytail in which Liverpool want to dump now.</p>
              <p>But, AVB should be able to show his stuff with Spurs next season.</p>
