            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p><a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/manchester-united/">Manchester United</a>, the record 19-
              time English soccer champion planning an initial public offering
              later this year, has climbed above Real Madrid in a survey of
              <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/europe/">Europe</a>’s top 30 teams by brand value.</p>
              <p>The annual report published by <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.brandfinance.com/about">Brand Finance Plc</a> gives
              United a brand valuation of 412 million pounds ($644 million),
              up 11 percent from last year. Real, which has a policy of
              signing some soccer’s biggest names like <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/cristiano-ronaldo/">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and
              Kaka, has a brand estimated to be worth 401 million pounds, with
              European champion Barcelona third at 392 million pounds.</p>
              <p>United’s strength has been underpinned by its success on
              the field, where it’s won the Premier League in four of the last
              five seasons, and the results of a commercial division that
              enjoyed an annual increase of 27 percent to top 100 million
              pounds for the first time. Earlier this month the team announced
              a sponsorship agreement for its training apparel worth 40
              million pounds with logistics company DHL.</p>
              <p>“The commercial team at United have developed such a
              compelling and well-protected brand that global partners are
              willing to pay premium sums to be affiliated with the
              champions,” said Brand Finance, which advises companies like
              brewer SABMiller Plc and bank Standard Chartered Plc. “In the
              upcoming IPO, we would expect the brand strength of United to
              feature prominently in the investment story.”</p>
              <p>United is planning to raise $1 billion later this year by
              floating as much as 30 percent of the club in an IPO on the
              Singapore stock exchange.</p>
              <p>While United may have a stronger brand than Real, the team
              owned by the U.S.-based Glazer family isn’t making the most
              money. It’s behind both Real and Barcelona in terms of revenue,
              according to a list published by accountant Deloitte LLP in
              February. Real last week announced record sales of 480 million
              euros ($654 million), more than any other team in professional
              sport. United had revenue of 331.4 million pounds, according to
              a Sept. 1 filing.</p>
              <h2>Most Improved</h2>
              <p>Brand Finance said the most improved soccer brand in the
              past 12 months is United’s cross-town rival <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/manchester-city/">Manchester City</a>. The
              team owned by billionaire Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan has
              lavished millions of pounds on talent to make it a contender at
              home and abroad and has qualified for Europe’s lucrative
              <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/champions-league/">Champions League</a> for the first time.</p>
              <p>In August, City signed the biggest partnership deal in
              sport, a decade-long agreement worth more than 350 million
              pounds with Abu Dhabi-based airline Etihad. The report ranks
              City 11th, up from 19th, with a brand value that’s almost
              doubled to 106 million pounds.</p>
              <p>City’s rise can be attributed to a combination of “huge
              sponsorship deals, star signings, Champions League football and
              a first trophy in 35 years,” the report said.</p>
              <h2>Top Ten</h2>
              <p><a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/bayern-munich/">Bayern Munich</a>, <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/germany/">Germany</a>’s richest and most successful team,
              is fourth on the list, ahead of London teams Chelsea and
              Arsenal. The Italian trio of AC Milan, <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/inter-milan/">Inter Milan</a> and Juventus
              and Liverpool complete the top ten. The total brand value of all
              30 teams is worth 1.5 billion pounds, according to the report.</p>
              <p>Still, that figure “alone has little immediate
              application to football clubs,” according to Brand Finance.
              Clubs must invest in “servicing the brand” if they are to
              monetize the strength of the brand. Manchester United’s
              commercial division has grown from two to more than 40 since the
              Glazers bought the team in 2005.</p>
              <p>“Within the branding industry they are not doing anything
              unique,” Dave Chattaway, one of the report’s authors said in an
              interview. “They are just taking best practice from companies
              like Apple, Prada, heavily branded industries and bringing it
              into the sports industry.”</p>
              <p>The report, which is in its 6th edition, defined “brand”
              as the teams’ trademarks and intellectual property. Of the
              team’s that make up the top 30, Brand Finance has undertaken
              paid consultancy work for Manchester United and <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/portugal/">Portugal</a>’s
              Benfica.</p>
