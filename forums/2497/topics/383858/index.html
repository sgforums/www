              <p>With the amount of money <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> have spent over recent season's, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Everton</span></abbr> boss David Moyes believes Spurs should have achieved more.</p>
              <p>Spurs are currently third in the Barclays <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> after an impressive start but Moyes has warned Sunday's opponents spending money does not always guarantee success.</p>
              <p>In the last two seasons <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> have splashed out about £50million (in 2007/08) and £77million on new
              signings and finished 11th and eighth and won the Carling Cup.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Everton</span></abbr>, by contrast, spent roughly around £20million and £23million and finished fifth twice.</p>
              <p>"<abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> have always been spenders. Since I have been at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Everton</span></abbr>, every year I've looked to see what they are doing and said 'Oh, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> have bought again'," said the Scot.</p>
              <p>"I think, for what they have invested, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> will have looked for a bit more over the years but in the main they have always been a good side.</p>
              <p>"Harry has done a brilliant job with the people he has brought
              in because they have done really well for him and with the squad they
              have are capable of challenging for the top four.</p>
              <p>"But there is a lot of talk about clubs wanting to finish in the top four - we want to finish in the top four.</p>
              <p>"We finished fifth last year so there are a lot of clubs trying to take our position and have spent big to do that."</p>
              <p>Moyes admitted he is envious of the money the likes of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr>, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr>, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sunderland</span></abbr> and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Aston Villa</span></abbr> have spent in an attempt to close the gap on the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr>'s traditional big four.</p>
              <p>"It has showed in the past: we have not spent great fortunes but
              we have had a team working together which has had success," he added.</p>
              <p>"There is an envy to it but last season we did it without
              spending an awful lot, we did it the season before without spending a
              lot and four years ago we finished fourth.</p>
              <p>"We have done it with a steady budget without going overboard.
              We are trying to match these teams and a little bit [of money] wouldn't
              go amiss."</p>

So what use is it saying that now? Moyes is better off concentrating on the present which is a Tottenham managed by Harry Redknapp.</p></div>
