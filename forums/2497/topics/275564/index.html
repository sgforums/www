Ramos said he turned down the chance to replace Martin Jol at White Hart Lane to concentrate on his duties at Sevilla.</strong><br><br>He said: "They made an excellent, dizzying offer, but I'm under contract to Sevilla and my decision is to fulfil it. "There was not the slightest possibility that I would accept it because I'm under contract. It did not interest me or the club."<br><br>Ramos has been linked with a move to Spurs after Jol held talks with chairman Daniel Levy earlier this week following their poor start to the season. Jol has been assured his job is safe for the time being as long as he delivers Champions League football but his reprieve is thought to have come as a result of Ramos' decision to turn Spurs down.<br><br>The north London club, however, have denied offering the position to Ramos, or any other individual. The club said in a statement: "No individual was or has been offered the position of manager/coach at this club while that position has been held by Martin Jol."<br><br>Ramos has guided Sevilla to five trophies in the last two seasons, including back-to-back Uefa Cups and the King's Cup. Sevilla beat Real Madrid 5-3 on Sunday to complete a 6-3 aggregate win in the Spanish Super Cup and face AC Milan in the European Super Cup next week. "We are in the middle of a great project with Sevilla and there is still work to do," Ramos said.<br><br></div>

The Sevilla coach held a press conference on Wednesday in an attempt to end days of rumours linking him with the Spurs manager's job. Ramos pledged to fulfil the final year of his contract with Sevilla, but was also quoted as saying a lucrative offer had come in from Spurs.</strong><br><br>However, Ramos has confirmed he was never offered the chance to replace Martin Jol at White Hart Lane and says his comments had been misinterpreted. "People are talking about wages and an offer from Tottenham," Ramos told The Times. "I never got an offer to take charge of the club. "When I described a possible offer as 'dizzying', I only meant the kind of money English clubs can pay at the moment makes any possible offer dizzying.<br><br>"People have put words in my mouth. "I want to apologise if I have upset anybody. It was not my intention. "In the press conference I only wanted to show clearly my commitment to Seville. "I have a big project on my hands and I am very proud to lead it. I am staying at Seville."<br><br>Spurs have also strongly insisted that no one has been offered Jol's position at the club.<br></div>
