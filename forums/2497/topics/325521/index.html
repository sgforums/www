              <p><strong>Joao Moutinho has confirmed he intends to leave Sporting to join
              Everton in what would be one of the sensational transfers of the
              summer.</strong></p>
              <p>Moutinho is one of the most highly rated youngsters in world
              football and he showed glimpses of his class for Portugal during Euro
              2008.</p>
              <p>Having won the Portuguese Cup last season, Moutinho now wants a new
              challenge, and the player confirmed after Saturday’s friendly with
              Blackburn that Everton had made an offer.</p>
              <p>Sporting have rejected that offer, believed to be around £18
              million, and now the talented midfielder hopes a solution can be found.</p>
              <p>“Everton already made a proposal, but Sporting did not accept it,” revealed Moutinho in Portuguese media outlet Ojogo.</p>
              <p>“We will now see what it happens in the next few days, but Sporting
              already knows my will, I have already transmitted it to the people.</p>
              <p>“What is my will? With the reasons that I have, I want to leave Sporting.</p>
              <p>“I hope that an agreement can be found and that a good solution arrives for both parties."</p>
              <p>It is believed the stumbling block could be Everton’s desire to pay
              Moutinho’s fee in installments, but that obstacle could be felled with
              the sale of Andrew Johnson.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Moutinho has eased fears that he will join Porto,
              insisting a chance meeting with Porto’s president was in no way a
              meeting about his future.</p>

              <p><strong>Sporting have confirmed that Everton have failed with an £11.8 million
              bid for Joao Moutinho, and the Portuguese club remain unmoved by the
              midfielder’s public articulation of his intention to leave Lisbon.</strong></p>
              <p>A statement on the club’s official website read: “Following the
              statements made yesterday to the media by player Joao Moutinho, who
              expressed his willingness to be transferred to another club, which he
              already forwarded to the board and director of sports society, for
              alleged reasons of a personal nature, the board of directors has
              communicated the following:</p>
              <p>“ 1. Last Saturday the Fifa agent Pini Zahavi, with a letter of
              representation issued by Everton FC, visited the headquarters of the
              society and transmitted that the English club offered €15 million
              (£11.8 million) for the acquisition of the sporting rights of the
              player Joao Moutinho, with the figure eventually adding an amount not
              yet determined if Everton FC qualify for the Champions League.</p>
              <p>“ 2. The proposal was rejected outright and it was told to Mr Pini
              Zahavi, who acted in the dual capacity as representative of the player
              and Everton FC, it was not the intention of Sporting SAD to transfer
              the player.</p>
              <p>“ 3. As is public knowledge, Joao Moutinho’s contract was
              substantially improved last year and provides for a termination clause
              to the value of €25m (£19.7m) which can be exercised until June 15 of
              each year.  Any proposals submitted after that date, although not
              binding on the company, will have to comply with certain requirements,
              which did not happen.</p>
              <p>“ 4. In addition Sporting SAD believes that its structures have the
              ability to create good conditions for an athlete, with much pride,
              beyond the questions of a personal nature which he faces and can
              continue to feel good and happy in their midst.</p>
              <p>“ 5. Finally, reveals that the personal reasons that the player
              pleads to transfer are completely unrelated to Sporting SAD and the
              employment relationship it maintains with the player and, as such, it
              cannot justify in any way an act of management that does not advocate
              adequately the interests of the company and its shareholders.”</p>
