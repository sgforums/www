            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lazio Â– Torino</span><br><br>The Biancocelesti will want to continue where they left off last season even though Delio Rossi and company know that it will be difficult to repeat the same exploits of last year due to the increased competition.<br><br>On the other hand, Torino have started afresh with a new coach (Walter Novellino) and new players to boost the teamÂ’s strength in order to have a season without too much worry like the one that just passed. The task will not be easy but Novellino is a coach capable of getting the best out of his players.<br><br>On paper Lazio start as favourites, but with their heads on the vital mid-week Champions League clash against Dynamo Bucharest, the Biancocelesti might start the season not in the best possible way as Torino are no pushovers.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Juventus Â– Livorno</span><br><br>The Old Lady is back in Serie A and all eyes will be on her this weekend. Will the Bianconeri be able to challenge for the top honours? Or will this be just a transitory season preparing them for the next years? Not everything will be resolved in this first matchday, therefore whatever the result, it will not be an indication of things to come.<br><br>Livorno will not want to feel like the sacrificed lamb and will arrive in Turin knowing that they have nothing to lose against a team which has disappointing during the pre-season. In fact Juventus only won 2 matches against teams of the same level, whereas it lost 5 without even scoring a goal against Milan or Inter.<br><br>For the Bianconeri this will be a difficult match, with the possibility of not winning all three points especially if the squad does not improve from its past outings.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fiorentina Â– Empoli</span><br><br>The Tuscan derby is definitely one of the most awaited matches this weekend, with the two sides wanting a win against their rivals. Both squads did very well last year and their fans expect the same from them this season, in particular Fiorentina.<br><br>The Viola have focused their transfer market attention on many promising young players, but also on a veteran who can still give a lot to Serie A: Bobo Vieri. At his best, the former Inter striker can be a nightmare to any defence, but a lot will depend on how well he recovered from his injury.<br><br>Empoli have no particular player to watch for, as last season it was a collective effort by the entire team guided by the expert Gigi Cagni. The players are more or less the same as the previous year, therefore the team does not need to gel more than it has already done.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Genoa Â– Milan</span><br><br>Serie A sees the return of another glorious club, apart from Juventus and Napoli, as the Grifoni are back in the Italian top division and will start off their campaign against the European Champions of Milan. Not the best of the starts, but an important one.<br><br>For the Rossoneri this will be a good test ahead of the European Super Cup against Sevilla, with Carlo AncelottiÂ’s side forced to play the game without any fans at the Marassi stadium, thus making the task more difficult for them.<br><br>The Brazilian colony at Milanello has just increased further with the purchases of Pato and Emerson, adding more flair and experience to the side. On the other hand, Genoa have the enthusiasm and crowd to drive them forward in this match and many expect a good result from the Rossoblu.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inter Â– Udinese</span><br><br>The reigning Italian champions kick-off their campaign with a difficult home game against an Udinese side ready to surprise everyone. For the Nerazzurri this season is important to prove that last year the title was a deserved win despite many important clubs having points reduced and Juventus being demoted to Serie B.<br><br>For Inter, the season did not start in the best possible way as the Nerazzurri lost in the Italian Super Cup against Roma, and now will have to face a long layoff of influential defender Marco Materazzi for about 2 Â– 4 months which will also affect heavily the Champions League.<br><br>Udinese have their own problems, with Antonio Di Natale currently frozen out of the squad and with most probability being shipped to Manchester City. Still, the Friulani have some very interesting young players who can definitely do well this year in the Italian topflight.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Napoli Â– Cagliari</span><br><br>The Partenopei mark their return to Serie A with a home match against a weakened Cagliari side, who lost Suazo to Inter this summer. The perfect opportunity for the Azzurri to kick-off their campaign with a bang and prove that they are back to the Italian topflight to stay.<br><br>Cagliari are one of the main candidates for the drop this season, and most probably not even the purchase of talented midfielder Pasquale Foggia will be enough to save the Sardinian side from relegation.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parma Â– Catania</span><br><br>Two teams which battled till the last matchday for the survival in Serie A last season. The Gialloblu will be hoping to avoid the lower positions in the standings this year following some good purchases during the transfer market, whereas the Rossoblu do not seem equipped well enough to remain in the topflight.<br><br>A game which sees the home team clearly at an advantage over their opponents due to the difference in quality between the two sides, which will have to be proven on the pitch.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reggina Â– Atalanta</span><br><br>Miracles only happen once in a lifetime, and this will probably be the case of Reggina. The Amaranti incredibly enough managed to overcome an 11 point deficit at the start of last season and survive in the last matchday of Serie A.<br><br>Without some of their main players (Bianchi on top) and especially without their former Coach Walter Mazzarri, things look difficult for the Reggio Calabria side and relegation is a very huge possibility.<br><br>Atalanta look more like a mid-table formation, and even though they will probably also be fighting fo relegation, in the end they should make it through.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Siena Â– Sampdoria</span><br><br>Siena have no big aspirations and surviving this season is their only objective. Not an easy one by all means, but can surely repeat the good early part of last season where they built their survival.<br><br>Sampdoria can be the real surprise package of this season with so many quality players especially in the forward line. Coach Walter Mazzarri joined the Blucerchiati from Reggina and he will surely add his magic tough to the Genoa-based squad, starting from this match which the Doriani have every opportunity to win.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Palermo Â– Roma</span><br><br>The first big match of the season, a game which could go either way especially if Roma does not perform at its best. Palermo will have Amauri back spearheading the attack line and this will be a major boost for the Rosanero.<br><br>The Giallorossi have just won the Italian Super Cup and this will surely be a huge morale booster which can help Luciano SpallettiÂ’s side overcome the first hurdle of the season if they want to fight for the top honours in the Italian topflight.<br><br>Not the easiest of the starts for Roma, but with the sheer quality that the team possesses, a win is well within reach for the Giallorossi.<br></div>
