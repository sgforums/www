              <p><strong>More than 75,000 fans leapt in delight as Federico Macheda
              scored Manchester United's last-gasp winner against Aston Villa at Old
              Trafford on Sunday - but most probably did not even know his name at
              the start of the match.</strong></p>
              <p>Even club captain Gary Neville
              admitted afterwards he had never seen him before but said he was
              grateful for his stoppage-time goal that gave United their memorable
              3-2 win.</p>
              <p>The 17-year-old made his debut
              as a 61st-minute substitute for Nani. He looked impressive from his
              first touch before scoring the goal that took United back to the top of
              the Premier League table.</p>
              <p>He was then booked for running
              into the crowd and hugging his father in delight and finished the
              afternoon being named man of the match.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He has been scoring regularly
              for United's youth and reserve teams since joining the club in
              September 2007 after developing through Lazio's youth system.</p>
              <p>Born in Rome, he signed
              professional forms last August and is regarded as one of the most
              promising young prospects of Italian soccer.</p>
              <p>Known as "Kiko", United's
              website says: "He is strong on the ball, has good positional sense in
              the box and his clinical finishing meant manager Alex Ferguson gave him
              a Champions League squad number midway through the 2008/09 campaign."</p>
              <p>Macheda told Sky Sports News: "Scoring a goal like that - I really enjoyed it."</p>
              <p>Asked what Ferguson said to him
              when he sent him on, he replied: "Play simple, just play. When I got
              the ball I just wanted to score."</p>
              <p>United skipper Neville praised the youngster's performance.</p>
              <p>"We are grateful to him -- the
              quality he showed at the end was unbelievable. I had not seen him
              before today but he's a great finisher and you'd want it to fall to him
              in the box."</p>
              <p>Ferguson, though, kept it all in perspective.</p>
              <p>Asked what he said to him
              afterwards, the United manager replied: "Well done. He'll need to keep
              his feet on the ground because he will get a lot of publicity over the
              next few days and he'll need to handle that."</p>

              <h1>Lazio president slams Macheda transfer</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://fourfourtwo.com/contentimages/news/Macheda.jpg" alt="" width="286" height="161"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>MILAN - Federico
              Macheda's debut goal for Manchester United is the result of a cattle
              market where young players are snapped up by rich foreign clubs, Lazio
              president Claudio Lotito said on Monday.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 17-year-old Macheda, a
              product of Serie A side Lazio's youth system, scored in stoppage time
              on Sunday to give the Premier League leaders a crucial 3-2 win over
              Aston Villa.</p>
              <p>"It's unthinkable that a lad of 15 can be bought as if it was a cattle market," Lotito told Italy's Sky television.</p>
              <p>"Normally these boys are not from wealthy families and they look for alternatives in foreign countries for economic reasons."</p>
              <p>Born in Rome, Macheda joined
              United in 2007 and in August became the latest in a string of
              non-English youngsters to sign professional forms with a Premier League
              club.</p>
              <p>FIFA wants to protect under-18 players and keep them with their local clubs but employment law complicates the situation.</p>
              <p>"We knew that he was a great
              player, we did everything to keep him. We can not allow ourselves to
              behave in a way which I feel is immoral."</p>
              <p>Lotito added that his mid-table
              side would be packed off on a training camp and may have wages held
              back after losing 2-0 at Siena on Sunday in the latest in a series of
              poor displays.</p>

              <p>Lazio president Claudio Lotito insists they did all they could to stop Manchester United signing Federico Macheda.</p>
              <p>"We tried in every way to stop Manchester United from taking away our
              player but the present Italian regulations don't give you any type of
              defence," said Lotito.</p>
              <p>"In reality we find ourselves in front of a proper cattle market.</p>
              <p>"I talked repeatedly with Macheda's parents, we established a
              dialogue, but it was not possible to do anything. We could not compete
              with United's offer.</p>
              <p>"That is not right, we have to be provided with more reliable and concrete rules than those which govern Italian clubs."</p>
