              <p class="first"><strong>Steven Gerrard says he expects to finish his career at Liverpool but
              is desperate for the side to challenge for the Premier League title.</strong></p>
              <p>The midfielder has repeatedly been linked with a move, and the club
              have dismissed as "fantasy" last week's reports of a bid from Inter
              Milan.</p>
              <p>Gerrard said: "I cannot see myself ever leaving Liverpool now."</p>
              <p>But he added: "I do not want to look back and say I have never been in a title race."
              </p>
              <p>Gerrard has played in two Champions League finals with
              Liverpool, lifting the trophy in 2005, but the side have again failed
              to keep pace with Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal in the Premier
              League.</p>
              <p>"I cannot see myself ever leaving Liverpool now, and what I would
              dearly love is to lead this club to the next level that I believe we
              are capable of reaching," he told the club's website.</p>
              <p>"I have won trophies here but there is one I am missing and I want that before I finish playing.</p>
              <p>"I do not want to look back and say I have never been in a title race.</p>
              <p>"I can see that the team is getting stronger and stronger and I
              can see that we are going forward. I feel that we are getting closer
              and I really believe that."</p>
              <p>Liverpool have secured fourth place and Champions League
              qualification, but Gerrard is keen to see more players arrive over the
              summer to strengthen the squad.</p>
              <p>"We always say this every year but it will be an important summer because we need to keep the momentum.</p>
              <p>"The manager's signings will be important as they always are. I
              have been lucky as a footballer and I've won more things than most
              players, but I am greedy because I always want more.</p>
              <p>"I want to win as many trophies as I can with Liverpool. That is why the summer is important.</p>
              <p>"We are a young team with a lot of promise and if the manager can get
              the right support then we could take an important step forward.</p>
              <p>"We are disappointed we did not maintain a challenge in the
              league for longer than we did. The points gap between us and the top
              two is not particularly pleasant viewing for anyone here at Anfield.</p>
              <p>"The boss is on record as saying he wants some players and if
              we get some of the ones he wants, and if they can have the same impact
              that guys like Fernando Torres, Martin Skrtel and Ryan Babel have
              had...</p>
              <p> "Their performances this season have seen us take a step forward. But I think there is a hell of a lot more to come from us."</p>

              <p>With Rafa tinkering all season, forget about winning the EPL.</p>
              <p>With Rafa not knowing that he is leaving better players like Peter on the bench, forget about winning EPL.</p>
              <p>With Liverpool so inconsistent, losing to smaller teams like Reading (first half of season), forget about winning the EPL.</p>
              <p>Like that how to challenge for EPL? I remember Steven Gerrard said that last season. He says that before every new season and it never comes true.</p>

              <p>everything starts with a mindset, visualizing the end state. in the end, you may or may not win, but i think all winners do that. gerrard may not have won the epl title with liverpool yet, but winners always play to win. afterall, he has medals in his cupboard as well, including uefa cup winners cup, fa cup and the CL.</p>
              <p>so, you can't fault him for saying so.</p>

              <p>the rotation policy is blown out of proportion in my opinion. there is always the core team players that rafa picks, e.g. pepe reina, carragher, gerrard, javier masch, xabi alonso (when he is fit) andÂ kuyt. torres should be in his `start at every match' line-up as well next season. the rest will then fit into his game plan.</p>
              <p>the reality as he puts it, is real. too many games, injury, etc. meant it is virtually impossible to start the same 11 all the time.</p>
