              <p>The <em>News of the World</em> says Redknapp will fly to Amsterdam this week to make Huntelaar the highest-paid player in <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr>'s history.</p>
              <p>A fee of around £18million was agreed in principle with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Real Madrid</span></abbr>,
              shortly before Redknapp travelled to Holland 10 days ago for talks with
              the player's representatives. And the Spurs boss will return this week
              with a package that could be worth more than £90,000 a week depending
              on appearances and goals.</p>

              <h1 class="heading">Peter Crouch joins Harry Redknapp for a third time</h1>
              <p class="heading"><img src="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00465/crouch_360_465250a.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="360"></p>
              <p class="heading"> </p>
              <p><strong>Peter Crouch is expected to have a medical today to complete his move from Portsmouth to Tottenham Hotspur.</strong></p>
              <p>The fee is believed to be about £10 million and if the transfer is completed in time, the England forward has an outside chance of joining his new team-mates when they fly out for their pre-season tour to China today.</p>
              <p>It is the fourth time that Crouch will have played under Redknapp. He managed the player at Southampton during his brief spell in charge there and paid £10 million to Liverpool to bring him to Portsmouth — the player’s second spell at Fratton Park — little more than a year ago. The South Coast club had agreed a £12 million fee with Sunderland earlier this summer but Crouch turned down the move.</p>
              <p>His arrival at White Hart Lane — on a four-year contract — will raise eyebrows in certain quarters, but Redknapp left no doubt about his appreciation of the 6ft 7in forward after watching his team lose 2-0 against Celtic in the Wembley Cup yesterday.</p>
              <p>Crouch has not been Tottenham’s first option, but he will cost about half the fee of Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, whose £90,000-a-week wage demands have proved a stumbling block. Should the England international join, Redknapp would rekindle Crouch’s partnership with Jermain Defoe that was fashioned at Portsmouth a year ago.</p>
              <p>Crouch has had six clubs and has now generated about £35 million in transfer fees since he first left Tottenham nine years ago.</p>
              <p>“He is different because he can hold the ball up and we don’t do that well enough,” Redknapp said. “He gives me an option.”</p>

              <h1>Real pay-off may help Huntelaar move</h1>
              <p><br> <img src="http://fourfourtwo.com/contentimages/news/Huntelaar24.jpg" alt="Huntelaar24" align="right"> </p>
              <p><strong>Real
              Madrid striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar is reportedly seeking a £4.3 million
              pay-off from the Bernabeu giants, which could help facilitate a summer
              switch to the Premier League.</strong></p>
              <p>Huntelaar's future in the Spanish capital - along with several of
              his fellow countrymen - has been cast into doubt following the return
              of former president Florentino Perez, who has already splashed more
              than €200 million on stellar signings including Kaka, Cristiano Ronaldo
              and Karim Benzema.</p>
              <p>The striker has been linked with a move to several Premier League
              clubs, including Manchester United, Arsenal and Spurs, while Bundesliga
              outfit Stuttgart had agreed a deal with Real, only for the player to
              snub the opportunity to join the German outfit.</p>
              <p>Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp confirmed on Friday that he was
              interested in bringing the ex-Ajax goal-getter, who has totalled 143
              league goals in 203 club appearances to date, to White Hart Lane.</p>
              <p>But he conceded that he was reluctant to shell out silly money to
              land Huntelaar, saying: "his wages are beyond us ... I can't see it
              happening."</p>
              <p>However, the Dutchman is now believed to be seeking a £4.3 million
              going-away-present from the 31-time la Liga champions, which would
              allow him to accept a considerably lower amount of wages from
              prospective new employers.</p>
              <p>The striker is believed to currently earn £55,000 per week after tax in Spain.</p>
