              It’s been three years and it’s killed me personally. Going three years

              <p>after checking this replay, u can see that ballack didnt really elbow him. its a natural reaction to protect yourself when someone is dashing at u. he used his arm to shield. rooney played on when Erva was down. only when they lose ball then they kpkb.Anyway, is Erva injured? He wanted to get ballack booked so he rolled on the gloor. if he had not play acted, picked himself up to defend, there probably wont be a goal.</p>
              <p>By the way, Rooney had the chance to clear the ball to the touchline but he chose to play on and lost the ball in the end. So whose fault?</p>
              <p>What about Rooney's offside? how come no one pointed that out?</p>

              <p>I am just surprised that so many are irrated by the referee or is it just MUFC fans? Come on, MUFC's fans, they got one, MU also got one, fair and square. It is the Ref's way to balance, all should be happy mah. Why complain?</p>

              <p>at least he dare to admit, kudos to him. but he is probably a bit economical with the truth cos it is not a bit, but very much when he blocked him. it should be a sending off by the ref, who was so close to the incident.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>during the course of the season, you will see plenty of of such incidences missed or did not give by the ref as usual.</p>
