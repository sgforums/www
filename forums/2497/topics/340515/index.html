              <h1>Bernd Schuster joins long list of possible successors to Roy Keane at Sunderland</h1>
              <h2>German coach Bernd Schuster, sacked from his post as Real Madrid manager, has expressed an interest in filling the vacant managerial position at Sunderland as Niall Quinn casts the net wide in search of a successor to Roy Keane at the Stadium of Light.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01205/Bernd_Schuster_1205581c.jpg" alt="Bernd Schuster joins long list of possible successors to Roy Keane at Sunderland" width="460" height="288"></p>
              <p><span class="caption"><em>In to the light: Former Real Madrid coach Bernd Schuster has expressed an interest in taking charge of Sunderland</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Quinn recently expressed his delight at the high quality of applications he has received since Keane left the club after a disastrous run of form saw them slip in to the relegation places.</strong></p>
              <p>And the true extent of the pulling power of the Premier League has been evidenced by reports that former Inter Milan manager Roberto Mancini and Dutch coach Leo Beenhakker, too, are candidates for the role.</p>
              <p>Caretaker manager Ricky Sbragia strengthened his claims to be taken on permanently with an emphatic 4-0 victory for Sunderland over fellow relegation candidates West Brom.</p>
              <p>However, the former reserve team coach at Manchester United remained sanguine about his prospects after a victory that elevated Sunderland to 17th overnight. “If it’s there it’s there, Sbragia said. “If it’s not it’s not.”</p>
              <p>Schuster won the Spanish League title with Real in May after succeeding England manager Fabio Capello at the Bernabeu in 2007. The German also enjoyed success with Getafe, an unfashionable Madrid-based club that he guided to a domestic cup final, as well as having stints with Levante, Shakhtar Donetsk in Ukraine and FC Cologne in his native Germany.</p>
              <p>Sunderland majority shareholder Ellis Short said recently that the club were determined to appoint a “world class” manager with experience and reports of Mancini being in London to brush up on his English have sparked suggestions that he is interested in the position.</p>
              <p>The 44-year-old Italian has been out of work since he was sacked by Inter Milan after four years at the San Siro in which time he claimed back-to-back Italian titles but was dismissed for a failure to achieve in European competition.</p>
              <p>The case of Beenhakker is being pushed by Sunderland’s commercial director Chris Woerts who has been impressed with the 66-year-old.</p>
              <p>Currently managing Poland, Beenhakker is viewed as the man to bring harmony to a Sunderland dressing room that suffered the tension of Keane’s intense personality and he is well known to Kenwyne Jones, Dwight Yorke and Carlos Edwards, all of whom played under Beenhakker when he was in charge of the Trinidad and Tobago national team.</p>
              <p>Sunderland are in no rush to make an appointment, particularly after Sbragia has quickly proved himself a safe pair of hands, and the roster of international names interested in the job will force the club in to a period of consideration.</p>
              <p>Other names that appear on a list that is anything but short include Gerrard Houllier, Louis van Gaal, Martin Jol and former West Ham United and Charlton manager Alan Curbishley.</p>

              <p><em>Hands up if you want the Sunderland job: former Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira</em></p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1094891" rel="1094891_3" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1094891/World-Cup-winning-Brazil-boss-Parreira-running-Sunderland-job.html"></a></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Former Brazil boss Carlos Alberto Parreira has entered the race to replace Roy Keane at </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/sunderland.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Sunderland</strong></span></a><strong>. The 65-year-old, who won the 1994 World Cup with Brazil, has told the Stadium of Light board he would be interested in the post.</strong></p>
              <p>Sunderland chairman Niall Quinn is considering about 30 applicants to succeed Keane who quit two weeks ago. Parreira has been out of work since April when he quit as coach of South Africa, but is looking for work in Europe.</p>
              <p>Although he will be considered by Quinn and other directors, including the new arrival Chris Woerts, it seems unlilkely that his club credentials will sway a board looking for some stability.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Parreira, who had two spells in charge of his country, has only coached Valencia and Fenerbahce in European club football, and Sunderland need a figurehead with knowledge on the current squad to trim the numbers and guide them away from the drop zone.</strong></p>
              <p>Sam Allardyce, Alan Curbishley, Gordon Strachan, Gerard Houllier, Sven Goran Eriksson and Peter Reid have all been linked with the vacancy while caretaker Ricky Sbragia is also a serious contender following Saturday's impressive 4-0 win over <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/west-bromwich-albion.html"><span style="color: #003580;">West Bromwich</span></a>, which followed an impressive rearguard in the 1-0 defeat at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United</span></a>.</p>
