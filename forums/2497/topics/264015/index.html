            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Hibernian have signed goalkeeper Yves Ma Kalambay from Chelsea.</strong><br><br>Kalambay has agreed a three-year deal and will arrive at Easter Road on 1st January.<br><br>The 21-year-old had a trial with Hibs in January and John Collins had wanted to recruit him for the second half of last season.<br><br>However, he was recalled by Chelsea to cover for the injured Petr Cech and Carlo Cudicini.<br><br>Despite not making a first-team appearance in his four years at Stamford Bridge, Collins believes the young Belgian has a bright future ahead of him.<br><br>"We were all very impressed by Yves when he came to Easter Road in January and had hoped he might join us at that point," Collins told Hibernian's official website.<br><br>"Chelsea required him to return as back-up and we had to be patient.<br><br>"He is again a young signing for us but of tremendous potential.<br><br>"He is a good height for a goalkeeper at 6ft 5in tall and is very strong and athletic - in fact he has all the attributes you could expect to find in a player in that position.<br><br>"He has benefited from world-class coaching at Chelsea under Silvino Lauro but such is the quality of goalkeepers at Chelsea there was little opportunity for first-team football and at this stage in his career that is what Yves is seeking.<br><br>"Yves will continue to develop at our club and have every opportunity to reach his full potential, something that I am confident he will achieve."<br><br>Kalambay will compete with Andrew McNeil for the role of first-choice keeper at Hibernian.</div>
