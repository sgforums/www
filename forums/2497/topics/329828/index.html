              <h1>Kaka Could Be Tempted By City</h1>
              <h2>Kaka’s agent has fuelled speculation that the Brazilian could join Chelsea by suggesting that if Mark Hughes’s side can qualify for the Champions League, he could be tempted.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/28549_news.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Since the takeover by Dr Sulaiman al Fahim, Manchester City, now armed with a seemingly limitless transfer budget, have been linked with a host of big money signings.</strong></p>
              <p>Mark Hughes’ side have already signed Chelsea-target Robinho and may also now be considering Kaka, who also was linked with a move to Stamford Bridge all summer, but remains with AC Milan.<br> <br>Speaking to <em>The Observer</em>, Diogo Kotscho Kaka’s representative, did however admit that Manchester City may not be the Brazilian’s first choice. He said: ‘Kaka would prefer a club like Chelsea, Real Madrid or Milan, but we never know.”</p>
              <p>However, Kotscho did speculate that with a new ownership in place and with Robinho already signed up at Eastlands, the club were certainly moving if the right direction if they wanted to attract the top players. He explained: “I think Manchester City are headed in the right direction, but they have big work to do. It's no easy thing to reach the same level as the biggest clubs in the world, and it's not just about money - you have to spend it properly and build a great team. In two or three years they can be there if they do the right things.”</p>
              <p>Should Kaka decide to swap Milan for Manchester he would join fellow Brazilians Elano and Jo as well as Robinho at Eastlands. However, Kotscho admitted that City would need to strengthen considerably and qualify for the Champions League if they seriously wanted to attract the best players in the world to Eastlands.</p>
              <p>“This season Manchester City do not have a team to win the Champions League. Maybe next season they can get into that competition - they have the prospects to be good enough,” explained Kotscho before concluding, “What they need to have is a big project to win the Premier League and the Champions League. It's not just about Kaká, they will only get the very best players if they attain this level. It was the same with Chelsea a few years ago - they had to prove themselves too.”</p>

              <p>I belief he is, only don't expect too much this season cos one player can't change everything... If you give Scolari the same City squad Hughus has presently, I don't think he can do any better either...  He has taken a pennyless Blackburn to the top in a very difficult league and has an eye for players like Santa Cruz too...</p>
              <p>Of all the former United players managing right now, I think he is the best...</p>

              <p>Brazil playmaker Kaka has brushed aside speculation he could leave AC Milan for big-spending Manchester City.</p>
              <p>The 26-year-old world player of the year has been linked in the press
              with a move to the Premier League but - unlike compatriot Robinho, who
              left Real Madrid to join the Eastlands outfit on transfer deadline day
              - Kaka insists he will stay where he is.</p>
              <p>'Before it was Real Madrid, now it's England that is in fashion,' said Kaka to Gazzetta dello Sport.</p>
              <p>'The market is like that, just as Milan make offers other clubs make offers to Milan.</p>
              <p>'But I will never ask to leave.'</p>
              <p>Kaka continued: 'I have always been treated well by (club) executives and my rapport is excellent.</p>
              <p>'Perhaps one day they (club executives) may change their approach with respect to me but I don't see that happening.</p>
              <p>'I
              will only leave if Milan decide to sell me or perhaps on the day when
              we no longer have the same objectives and that day has not come.</p>
              <p>'Milan has done a good job in the transfer market, the club still wants to win and be competitive and those are my aims.'</p>
              <p>Kaka is under contract with the Italian giants through the 2012/13 campaign.</p>
