              <h2>SOUTHGATE SACKED BY BORO</h2>
              <p><a class="betting_link top_betting_link_1" href="https://www.skybet.com/secure/rbs?action=go_sgl&amp;ev_oc_id=29433961&amp;lp_num=11&amp;lp_den=2&amp;aff=705"></a> <span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Middlesbrough boss Gareth Southgate was relieved of his duties within
              hours of guiding his side to victory over Derby on Tuesday night.</p>
              <p>The 39-year-old former England defender's departure was
              confirmed in a brief statement issued through the club's official
              website, www.mfc.co.uk.</p>
              <p>The statement read: "Middlesbrough FC have tonight announced
              that manager Gareth Southgate has been relieved of his position with
              immediate effect.</p>
              <p>"Football consultant Alan Smith will also be leaving the club as part of the change."</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Chairman Steve Gibson admitted the decision to dispense with Southgate's services had been the toughest of his reign to date.</p>
              <p>He said: "This has been the most difficult decision I have had to make in all the time I have been in football.</p>
              <p>"Gareth has given Middlesbrough Football Club magnificent service as a skipper and, in very difficult circumstances, as manager.</p>
              <p>"I appointed Gareth in a situation that was greatly unfavourable to him.</p>
              <p>"He is a good man and has all the qualities and integrity that we wanted in a manager.</p>
              <p>"However, the time is right for change and that change has had to be made.</p>
              <p>"Gareth will always be welcome at our football club. English
              football needs people of his stature and we feel certain that this
              experience will serve him well.</p>
              <p>"Gareth deserves another opportunity once he has had the chance to rest and refresh himself."</p>

              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Former Celtic boss Gordon Strachan was appointed manager of Championship team Middlesbrough on Monday.</strong></p>
              <p>"It's a special job," Strachan told Middlesbrough's website after replacing Gareth Southgate who was sacked last week.</p>
              <p>"I don't have to be here, I don't need to be here, I want to be here. I don't need football but when I'm in it, I love it," added the 52-year-old after signing a four-year contract with the English team.</p>
              <p>Former Scotland and Manchester United midfielder Strachan left Celtic in May after spending four years at the Glasgow club.</p>
              <p>Middlesbrough, relegated from the Premier League in May, are fourth in the Championship after drawing 2-2 at Preston North End on Saturday.</p>
              <p>Strachan has also managed Coventry City and Southampton, the team he took to the 2003 FA Cup final where they lost 1-0 to Arsenal.</p>
