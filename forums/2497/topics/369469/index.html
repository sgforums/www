              <h1>Valdano: No more Real signings</h1>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><span id="intelliTXT">Real
              Madrid director general Jorge Valdano has ruled out making any more
              major signings until the club can offload some existing players.</span></p>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/09/01/330/Real-Madrid-celeb-v-Real-Mallorca-2009_1765382.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Madrid have splashed out
              almost £200million already this summer on bringing in Cristiano
              Ronaldo, Kaka, Karim Benzema and Raul Albiol, while Alvaro Negredo and
              Ezequiel Garay have also been added to the squad.</p>
              <p>A deal for Getafe midfielder Esteban Granero to return to the
              Bernabeu also appears to be close, but that could well be the final
              addition until Madrid, who have been chasing Liverpool duo Xabi Alonso
              and Alvaro Arbeloa, manage to trim their squad down.</p>
              <p>Players such as Javier Saviola, Javi Garcia, Fabio Cannavaro
              and Jordi Codina have already moved on, but Madrid will be keen to cash
              in on a number of other first-teamers in order to recoup some of their
              money and free up some squad space.</p>
              <p>"The transfer door will remain closed until some players have
              left, other than for exceptional cases such as that of Granero," said
              Valdano, who admits it has not been easy to offload players.</p>
              <p>"There are days when you take a step forward and others a step
              back. We are continually working on player exits. It's a difficult
              market but until the last moment we will continue working hard on
              finding a possible exit for the players that are not in the coach's
              plans."</p>
              <p>One Madrid player whose future has been in the news of late is Dutch striker Klaas Jan Huntelaar.</p>
              <p>Huntelaar, who only moved to Spain at the start of the year, had
              looked set to join German side Stuttgart after missing Madrid's
              pre-season trip to Ireland to try to sort out his future, but that move
              has now fallen through.</p>
              <p>A number of other clubs have been linked to the former Ajax
              player, but Valdano insists there is nothing concrete on the table for
              Huntelaar at this time.</p>
              <p>"There is no firm offer. We had a great opportunity, but the
              player decided to let it pass. There is a long way to go until the end
              of August and we hope to find another European club that is interested.</p>
              <p>"He (Huntelaar) will occupy a secondary role in the squad
              because he has not had the same preparation as his team-mates and he
              already knows what the club's intentions are."</p>

              <h3>Madrid legend will have to fight for his place</h3>
              <p></p>
              <p><img src="http://img.skysports.com/09/04/218x298/Raul-celeb-Sevilla-v-Real-Madrid-2009_2223419.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="298"></p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold">Raul is not assured
              of a place in Real Madrid's new look team and the club's other strikers
              are also playing for their places at the Bernabeu, according to Miguel
              Pardeza.</p>
              <p>Los Merengues' sporting director believes that the
              team captain cannot, and will not, expect any preferential treatment
              from coach <span class="lingo_link" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12.1667px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;">Manuel Pellegrini.</span></p>
              <p>Despite
              being a crowd favourite, Raul will have to earn his place in the team
              and compete with the numerous forwards now vying to be part of the team.</p>
              <p>"If Raul has played up until now it is because he has deserved to," <span class="lingo_link" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12.1667px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;">Pardeza</span> told <em>Publico</em>.</p>
              <p>"He has had his ups and downs, but that is normal for any player that has been at Real Madrid for 16 years.</p>
              <p>"This
              season he will be just another player and the coach will have to
              evaluate how he will fit in and what options he has. There will be no
              drama made of it."</p>
              <h4>Uncertain futures</h4>
              <p>Alvaro Negredo was
              re-signed from Almeria in June and could stay, but Pardez hinted that
              it would be preferable if the striker left, although he is unsure what
              will happen to Ruud <span class="lingo_link" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12.1667px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;">van Nistelrooy.</span><img id="lingo_icon" class="lingo_icon lingo_icon_black" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 0pt ! important; padding: 0pt; float: none; position: static; left: auto; top: auto; line-height: normal; background-color: transparent; visibility: visible; width: 12px; height: 12px; background-repeat: no-repeat; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: top; display: inline; cursor: pointer;" src="http://static.lingospot.com/spot/image/spacer.gif" alt=""></p>
              <p>"It
              would not be a problem if [Negredo] stays. But we have signed a player
              in that position and have some big names. If options are there then we
              will look at them," he continued.</p>
              <p>"The doctors are optimistic
              [about Van Nistelrooy], but we are talking about an older player. It is
              difficult to know what will happen with him."</p>
              <p>Real Madrid have already seen one youth team player leave as <span class="lingo_link" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12.1667px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;">Javi Garcia</span><img id="lingo_icon" class="lingo_icon lingo_icon_black" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 0pt ! important; padding: 0pt; float: none; position: static; left: auto; top: auto; line-height: normal; background-color: transparent; visibility: visible; width: 12px; height: 12px; background-repeat: no-repeat; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: top; display: inline; cursor: pointer;" src="http://static.lingospot.com/spot/image/spacer.gif" alt=""> has signed for Benfica and Pardeza admits that the club cannot keep every player that comes through the ranks.</p>
              <h5>Sales inevitable</h5>
              <p>"When
              you start a season you analyse the squad and there are players that you
              count on and others that you do not," he explained.</p>
              <p>"Then there are other players whose positions are undecided and depending on how pre-season goes, you make a decision later on.</p>
              <p>"Javi could have stayed here, but he realised that he was not going to play much and a move was the best thing for everyone.</p>
              <p>"Once
              a player reaches the first team you cannot forget he is a youth team
              product, but he is another player and is open to the same conditions as
              everyone else."</p>
