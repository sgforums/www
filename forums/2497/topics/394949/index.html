              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez has hit back at the continued criticism aimed at him mostly by ex-players who are now pundits.</strong></p>
              <p>Plenty of former Reds stars have secured work in the media and Benitez has had to listen to them giving their opinion on what has been a disappointing season.</p>
              <p>However, he felt the need to respond to the comments of former Liverpool captain Jamie Redknapp after the 2-1 defeat at Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Redknapp, a close friend of Steven Gerrard, criticised Benitez for moving the England midfielder to different positions as they chased an equaliser late on.</p>
              <p>To back up his assertion that Liverpool were a weaker team than the previous season he referenced the influence of Xabi Alonso, sold to Real Madrid in the summer, in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford last March.</p>
              <p>That finally prompted Benitez into a response.</p>
              <p>"I was surprised to see some comments by some experts talking about how they could see Alonso playing in the 4-1 win against United - he didn't play," said the Liverpool manager, referring to the fact the Spain midfielder was injured.</p>
              <p>"This expert said he (Gerrard) cannot play on the left but he is playing with the national team on the left.</p>
              <p>"He was playing here on the right and scoring 23 goals so Gerrard can play everywhere. It depends on the team.</p>
              <p>"I told him before the Sunderland game he was playing in the middle and he was happy. He can help the team and that is the main thing."</p>
              <p>Despite the praise for their first-half performance in the 3-0 win over Sunderland Benitez said his tactics had not changed much.</p>
              <p>Playing Gerrard in a more orthodox central midfield position is something he has done before this season but yesterday was just one of those days when all the players hit top form.</p>
              <p>"With the same tactics we scored more goals than anyone in the Premier League last year and more goals than anyone in England two years ago," added the Spaniard.</p>
              <p>"It is a question sometimes of accuracy, pass completion or just a little bit of luck."</p>

              I think he meant 23 in total of all those games that Gerrard played on the right of midfield, which would be around 200 i guess.

              <p><br>To be exact, 6.5 years. But the big difference between Fergie and Rafa is... When Ferguson took over United, they were second from bottom (21st place) on the table and not a team in the top 4 like when Rafa took over at Liverpool almost 6 yrs ago now... United could seriously got relegated that year, therefore they could see the improvements Fergie made.</p>
              <p>But obviously football has change since 20 plus year ago... Back then a top 4 probably didn't earn you a lot difference to say a top 5... But today there is probably a big gap in earnings between 4th and 5th places. Anyway, I think if the next manager that comes in after Ferguson experienced 3 barren years, I think he would probably be sack.</p>
              <p>Rafa is just plain lucky to be given a new 5 yrs contract...</p>

              <p>zzzzzzzzzzzzz........</p>
              <p>saf took over in november, i think, so the league position of man u is immaterial at that point in time because it is (only) in the 3rd month of the season. what about man u's league position in the prior season? it finished #6 despite being a mid-table team a few years before that. so, man u is hardly a hull city team at that time if that is what you are trying to imply.</p>
              <p>granted rafa took over a stronger team. but didn't he delivered the european cup and fa cup in his initial tenure? he came close last year, so if you look at rafa's managerial acumen not only amongst liverpool managers and also with the rest of the epl team, he is ranked right up there with the best.</p>
              <p>arguably, saf took a longer time to gel and get the team's balance right. </p>
              <p>and you are skirting the issue.....it is exactly today's impatient mindset that alot of the investors and fans have that is sidelining the efforts of the club. if rebuilding take 3 or 10 years, so be it. and obviously money has taken a significant influence on how the game plays out today. but to take it all out at rafa is hardly fair given the limitations and constraints he has to deal with.</p>
              <p>what i am trying to tell rooney9 is his comment is not a valid one. you don't just look at the timeline to justify sacking someone. there are a lot more variables involved, so if rafa needs to go, it has to be for the right reasons. </p>

              <p>saf took over in november, i think, so the league position of man u is immaterial at that point in time because it is (only) in the 3rd month of the season. what about man u's league position in the prior season? it finished #6 despite being a mid-table team a few years before that. so, man u is hardly a hull city team at that time if that is what you are trying to imply.</p>
              <p>granted rafa took over a stronger team. but didn't he delivered the european cup and fa cup in his initial tenure? he came close last year, so if you look at rafa's managerial acumen not only amongst liverpool managers and also with the rest of the epl team, he is ranked right up there with the best.</p>
              <p>arguably, saf took a longer time to gel and get the team's balance right. </p>

              <p><br>November is immaterial ? Maybe someone told Newcastle about this last season too... And did anyone expected them to go down? Honestly, NO! Then what happen? The unexpected. To brush it away as immaterial is a rather silly comment. Just look what happen to Spurs, had they persist with Ramos they might have joint Newcastle in the Championship for this season cos there was no telling what could happen to the club. They were at the foot of the table and one game after another nothing changed. They had only 2 points from 8 games... They were still at the foot of the table until Harry came and turn them around to what they are today... Starting from mid-season is probably more difficult than from the start... cos you have lesser time to work with the players.</p>
              <p>Anyway, since you said Man United were a mid-table club during the mid 80s, which is very true, then all the more Fergie did wonders with a mid-table club taking them all the way to the title within 6.5 yrs... Something Rafa won't be able to now even with a top 4 club.</p>
              <p>And you are correct too on Rafa taking over a stronger team... Perhaps one might wonder was it his team that won the CL in his first year. Or was it the previous manager's ? or even Gerrard who made it possible? Cos year after year, they seems to be getting worst from his first year...</p>
              <p>Is it really arguable at all that Rafa is taking a longer time to gel and get the team's balance right than Fergie? What are you basing it on, some cup matches? It's winning the league title the only valid point of prove that they got the team's balance right... Cos the league is the only prove of consistency over a long season... Have Rafa done this yet? No.</p>
              <p>There is no need to skirt any issue... Football indeed has changed over the years that's a fact... Even the game rules itself. There is more money to be gain and loss from it now than 20 odd years ago. Missing out on the top 4 place could mean a smaller budget for next season's operation. And in turn, towards a mid table club...</p>
              <p>And to be very frank, those people who believed there has been limitations and constraints placed on Rafa... Probably read too much of his comments and belief it to be true... But in reality, Rafa has just covered his shortcomings by claiming limitations and constraints...</p>
