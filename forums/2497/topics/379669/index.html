              <p class="first"><strong>Everton manager David Moyes had nothing but praise for his young team after they were humbled 5-0 at Benfica.</strong></p>
              <p>Moyes
              was missing 11 players for their Uefa Europa League game in Lisbon and
              said: "It was the best team we had and the players did everything they
              could.</p>
              <p>"Only one of the defence played in their normal position
              and Seamus Coleman made his debut, but that's what we had, we didn't
              have any options.</p>
              <p>"There were some mistakes for goals, but I've only got praise for them."</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>The
              Toffees' injury problems are mounting ahead of Sunday's Premier League
              match against Bolton, with Leighton Baines suffering a calf problem
              before the Benfica tie and winger Diniyar Bilyaletdinov finishing the
              game with a strapping on his thigh.</p>
              <p></p>
              <table style="height: 3px;" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="6" align="right">
              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td width="5"> </td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>
              </table>
              <p>Moyes added: "We will need to assess Diniyar when we get back as well. I am not sure yet who might be fit for the weekend.</p>
              <p>"Maybe
              if I could have told the fans what sort of team I'd have to put out a
              couple of days ago some of them wouldn't have travelled, but I couldn't
              do that.</p>
              <p>"The boys came up against some serious players
              tonight. They are professionals and when you are out there you do your
              best, so I've praised them, but also they've seen the level they need
              to get to.</p>
              <p>"I'm not sure it was a five-goal game, the scoreline hurts, of course it does."</p>
              <p>Everton
              had won their first two Group I games in the Europa League and sit
              second in the table behind the Portuguese giants, who they meet again
              at Goodison Park on 5 November.</p>
              <p>"I'm looking forward to playing Benfica again when we've got a couple of players back from injury," stated Moyes.</p>
              <p>"It would have been nice to be able to put out my first team and see what might have happened.</p>
              <p>"Benfica
              have a good attitude and showed their attacking qualities in the second
              half. They capitalised on several mistakes we made in that spell and
              took their opportunities very well."</p>
