              <p>Personally. I find him a good player from last year onwards and he has the potential to be the best player in the premier league... Thats my take, cos he was the best player in the first half of the season last year...</p>
              <p>If United could get him, I would be very pleased but the salary City is offering is more than what United is offering Sneijder anyway... So I don't think it will ever happen.</p>
              <p>Anyway, who can blame him for wanting to join City seriously? He is getting something like maybe $50k currently while Arsenal are only offering $90k per week to sign a new deal... That's like $45k after tax... At City, the 90k is after the 50% UK tax... It's really not a hard decision to make... It's like getting 2 weeks salary in one week, 2 yrs in 1 yr... or work 5 yrs for 10 yrs income...</p>
              <p>On top of this, a better chance of winning titles and trophies... To borrow Joe Cole's words, it's really a no brainer not to go...</p>

              <p></p>
              <p><strong>Arsenal's wantaway midfielder <span style="color: #000000;">Samir Nasri</span><span style="color: #000000;"> has used <em>Twitter</em> to deny earlier comments posted on a <em>Facebook</em> account suggesting he was set to leave the Gunners on less than amicable terms.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The <em>Facebook</em> page, masquerading as part of Nasri's personal account, said his Arsenal exit was imminent and that he would "certainly leave very soon" with "bitterness and anger in my heart".</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Nasri has been pursued by Manchester City throughout the current transfer window, and with contract extension talks at Arsenal long since stalling, the 24-year-old still appears set to leave the Emirates.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Arsene Wenger</span> had hoped the club could hold on to Nasri, but recently admitted the Gunners were not in a strong position to retain his services.</p>
              <p>The quotes attributed to Nasri were in relation to what he earlier described as "disrespectful" chants aimed at him by fans during Arsenal's Premier League opener against Newcastle - despite the France international not appearing on the pitch.</p>
              <p>"I was very disappointed by the supporters last weekend," the message read. "I am still an Arsenal player but I will certainly leave very soon. It's nearly done. But I will leave with bitterness and anger in my heart."</p>
              <p>To which the Frenchman later replied via <em>Twitter</em>: "Just to make things clear i dont have a facebook so i never said i was leaving with bitterness the guy who said that use a fake account."</p>
              <p>The transfer of Nasri would follow the sale of former skipper <span style="color: #000000;">Cesc Fabregas</span><span style="color: #000000;"> to Barcelona after protracted negotiations over the Spain midfielder were resolved earlier this week.</span></p>
