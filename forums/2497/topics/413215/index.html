              <p><strong>After opening his Aston Villa tenure with two victories, Gerard Houllier came back down to earth with a 2-1 defeat to Spurs before the international break. </strong></p>
              <p>Unfortunately for the Frenchman, standing in the way of his side's hopes of a victory this weekend is a Chelsea outfit that has reasserted itself after the blip at Manchester City last month - the same Chelsea outfit that spanked Villa 7-1 and 3-0 in the space of two embarrassing weeks in April this year.</p>
              <p>On a brighter note for Villa, they have a proud home record against the Blues to defend, having beaten them twice in the past three seasons and lost to them just once in the past 11 league meetings, including a 2-1 victory last October. That win came in both sides' ninth Premier League match of the season and two games after Chelsea had tasted their first defeat of the season, a set of circumstances that are mirrored this time around.</p>
              <p>Further hope for Houllier comes in the form of Chelsea's injury problems. Brazilian centre-back Alex misses out due to injury so John Terry, who has recovered from the problem that saw him miss England's draw with Montenegro, will be partnered by Branislav Ivanovic. Frank Lampard has not yet recovered and, crucially, Didier Drogba is missing due to a virus. Gael Kakuta could start in his absence, with Nicolas Anelka performing in a lone striker's role, as Salomon Kalou and Daniel Sturridge are also out.</p>
              <p>Another interesting sub-plot to this clash is that involving Nicolas Anelka and Houllier. The French manager's decision not to sign Anelka on a permanent deal in 2002 is one that has been furiously lamented by Liverpool fans over the years, and the player himself has regularly expressed a disappointment that his compatriot did not stump up the cash to prise him from PSG.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Aston Villa player to watch: <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/132107/Marc-Albrighton"><span style="color: #000000;">Marc Albrighton</span></a>.</strong> The 20-year-old midfielder has enjoyed a spectacular start to the 2009-10 campaign, emerging as one of Villa's standout performers since making his first Premier League start on the opening day of the season. A tricky, fearless right winger, Albrighton has impressed with his willingness to take on full backs at pace, and his excellent delivery has regularly left strikers <span style="color: #000000;">John Carew</span> and Emile Heskey licking their lips in delight. A first Premier League goal, against Spurs, last time out will have Albrighton brimming with confidence and the prospect of him trying to get the better of <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8054/Ashley-Cole"><span style="color: #000000;">Ashley Cole</span></a> should provide an exciting spectacle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Chelsea player to watch: <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/stats?id=130545&amp;cc=5739"><span style="color: #000000;">Gael Kakuta</span></a>.</strong> The kid who almost landed Chelsea with a lengthy transfer ban is fully expected to make his first Premier League start for the Blues. The acrimonious nature of his move from Lens saw Kakuta briefly become one of the most talked-about players in English football, and now he has the chance to demonstrate just why the Blues risked censure by bringing him to Stamford Bridge. The young Frenchman has a large repertoire of tricks and will drift off lone striker Anelka and into wide positions, meaning Stephen Warnock could be in for a difficult afternoon. It is quite an ask for Kakuta to step into a very destructive Chelsea side, but it could be a fascinating watch.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Key battle: <span style="color: #000000;">Nicolas Anelka</span> v <span style="color: #000000;">Richard Dunne</span>.</strong> Anelka's goalscoring record since Houllier cast him aside at Anfield speaks for itself, and he will be determined to remind the Villa boss exactly what he missed out on eight years ago. Villa centre-back Dunne will likely be charged with the unenviable task of keeping Anelka under wraps and ensuring the Frenchman doesn't add to his tally of seven goals in nine games this season. An imposing presence at the back, Dunne's return from injury did not go to plan against Spurs, but having improved his match sharpness by playing 180 minutes for Ireland over the international break, he will be ready to resume his solid defensive partnership with <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/5527/James-Collins"><span style="color: #000000;">James Collins</span></a>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Trivia:</strong> Chelsea have only left Villa Park with all three points on one occasion in their past 11 attempts, a 1-0 victory courtesy of a Nicolas Anelka goal in February 2009.</p>
              <p><strong>Stats: </strong>Villa have dropped eight points this season from winning positions, the joint-most in the Premier League.</p>
              <p><strong>Odds: </strong>Aston Villa (5.00), Chelsea (1.72.) and the draw (3.60) is on offer at <strong>Bet365</strong>, while Nicolas Anelka to score the only goal in a 1-0 win is priced at 17.00.</p>
              <p><strong>Prediction: </strong>The champions' makeshift defence will give Villa hope, but expect Carlo Ancelotti's side to cast their dismal record at Villa Park to one side and emerge victorious.</p>

              <p class="third-party-tool reddit">This has the potential to be an awkward fixture for <span style="color: #005689;">Chelsea</span>. Carlo Ancelotti is without Didier Drogba, Frank Lampard, Saloman Kalou and Alex for a trip to a stadium where Chelsea have generally struggled. Villa, who will again be without the injured Gabriel Agbonlahor, should have plenty of motivation after Chelsea won 7-1 at Stamford Bridge last season and also defeated them 3-0 in the FA Cup semi-finals a couple of weeks later. Much could depend on whether the rejuvenated Emile Heskey can continue his excellent recent form. <strong>Venue </strong>Villa Park</p>
