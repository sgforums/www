              </span></p><p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>John Terry has vowed to clear his name after he was accused of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand. </span></strong></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The England and Chelsea captain is preparing to fight his corner after internet and social networking users appeared to launch a smear campaign against him. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The defender is also prepared to walk into the FA and state his case if necessary after becoming increasingly angry with the allegations, which surfaced after his club’s 1-0 loss at QPR.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Police have said they are investigating the allegations after a complaint from a member of the public.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But, peaking exclusively to <em>Sportsmail</em>, he said: ‘I’ll do whatever it takes to clear my name and I don’t have anything to hide. I’m not taking that level of abuse. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>‘Anton and I spoke for 10 minutes in the dressing room after the game and there is no issue between us. It’s finished.’</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Terry asked Ferdinand for an explanation after he believed the QPR defender had accused him of racism.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Around 10 players, including Chelsea left back Ashley Cole, were present during Terry’s dressing-room talk with Ferdinand. It is understood that it finished with the players high-fiving each other and embracing.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Terry’s legal team are expected to take a witness statement from team-mate Ashley Cole as he prepares to mount a potential defence.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>And sources told <em>Sportsmail </em>that Ferdinand is giving serious consideration to making a formal complaint against Terry, although the former Sunderland defender was understood to want to sleep on the decision before a specially arranged meeting at QPR’s Harlington training ground.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Ferdinand will be joined by manager Neil Warnock and an adviser at the meeting. </span></strong></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>A Scotland Yard spokesman said on Monday night: 'We can confirm police have been notified of an incident on Sunday, October 23 involving alleged racial abuse. This is currently being assessed by officers from Hammersmith and Fulham.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Although Terry is protesting his innocence, it did not stop the internet rumours engulfing the 30-year-old. Scores of amateur lip-readers have posted the flashpoint on YouTube, adding speech bubbles and the offending words during the clash. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But Terry is furious at allegations suggesting he called the QPR defender a ‘black ****,’ during the stormy match at Loftus Road.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Although he does not deny using those words, he insists they have been taken out of context after he was convinced Ferdinand accused him of a racist remark.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Instead Terry spoke to the 26-year-old in the dressing room to say the full version was: ‘Oi, Anton, do you think I called you a black ****?’</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>PFA representative Bobby Barnes spoke to QPR players who were close to the incident. He is expected to make his representations to the PFA, but chief executive Gordon Taylor is coming under growing pressure to intervene.</span></strong></p>
              <p><em><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Sportsmail </span></em><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>also understands the FA are reluctant to act unless an official complaint arrives from QPR with any evidence. The governing body are awaiting the outcome of the club’s meeting with Ferdinand before deciding whether they will need to act.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Terry made a point, in his statement denying the allegations, of referring to the racial diversity of Chelsea’s squad and the incident was discussed extensively among certain players at the club’s Cobham training ground.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Anton Ferdinand will decide on Tuesday whether to report the </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Chelsea" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chelsea"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span></a><strong> captain </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on John Terry" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/john-terry"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>John Terry</strong></span></a><strong> to the Football Association over an alleged racist slur, after speaking face to face with the manager at Queens Park Rangers, Neil Warnock.</strong></p>
              <p>Video footage circulated on the internet of an incident towards the end of <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on QPR" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/qpr"><span style="color: #005689;">QPR</span></a>'s 1-0 victory in which it has been suggested Terry calls the home defender a <em>"fucking black cunt"</em> as he retreats into his own half of the pitch. Terry denies it and issued a statement on Sunday evening in which he claimed viewers had "leapt to the wrong conclusions about the context of what I was seen to be saying to Anton Ferdinand".</p>
              <p>Terry said he had been responding to accusations from the opposing centre-half that he had used racist language. "I thought Anton was accusing me of using a racist slur against him," he said. "I responded aggressively, saying I never used that term." The key part of the footage, where the England captain said he shouted "Oi, Anton, I never said …", is obscured by Ashley Cole walking across the camera shot.</p>
              <p>The furore over the incident, and a fractious fixture which saw Chelsea reduced to nine men before the interval, is understood to have spilled into the tunnel after the final whistle, with angry altercations involving players from both sides. Terry and the home goalkeeper, Paddy Kenny, continued arguments that had sparked on the pitch, and other players are believed to have become involved in what is a narrow corridor outside the dressing rooms.</p>
              <p>Terry said he had spoken to Ferdinand once tempers had calmed "and there was no problem between us", saying the incident had been "a misunderstanding". Yet the notion that the pair departed amicably has been rejected by sources at QPR. The club have declined to comment publicly on the issue and Ferdinand – normally a keen twitterer – has maintained silence.</p>
              <p>The Rangers players were given the day off on Monday after their victory but will report back to their Harlington training centre on Tuesday morning. The club made preliminary contact with him by texton Monday, with the defender – brother of the former England captain, Rio Ferdinand – and one of his representatives to meet Warnock after training to discuss whether the club will ask the FA to investigate. It is understood the player and the club were minded to pursue the matter, though the 26-year-old asked to sleep on the matter before making a final decision.</p>
              <p>Should a complaint be made and if Terry is found guilty, any charge would inevitably have serious repercussions for the 30-year-old's position as England captain. The FA declined to comment but does technically have it within its power to investigate, even if no formal complaint is made. Terry was due to make a personal appearance at the opening of a pet shop in Surbiton on Monday but withdrew late from the event, leaving around 100 supporters disappointed.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the FA is reviewing the post-match conduct of the Chelsea manager, André Villas-Boas, after he confronted the referee, Chris Foy, in the tunnel. Onlookers described the Portuguese's language as "industrial", with Villas-Boas subsequently admitting he had been "very aggressive" with the referee as he complained at perceived inconsistencies in the official's display.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The Chelsea manager claimed Foy had "lost it" and was "card happy" towards his team, comments that could prompt the FA to impose either a fine or touchline suspension. It remains to be seen whether Foy's match report includes mention either of the players' altercations in the tunnel or Villas-Boas's reaction after the final whistle.</strong></p>
              <p>The referee sent off Didier Drogba, who apologised to his team-mates in the changing room post-match, for a two-footed lunge at Adel Taarabt, as well as José Bosingwa for a professional foul on Shaun Wright-Phillips, and booked a further seven visiting players. "I thought he reffed it superbly," said the QPR midfielder Shaun Derry. "These big players have a knack of persuading refs to make different decisions but the ref was very strong. The sendings off were the right decisions, and most of the yellow cards were for Chelsea players, and I felt we kept our heads.</p>
              <p>"We wanted to unnerve them and put them under pressure in the right areas, and that plan came off. What do you do? Do you stand off these players and let them dictate, or do you get amongst them and mix it with them? I don't think we were vicious in any way or over-aggressive in anything we did. But these top players aren't used to losing to teams of our stature. Perhaps it hurt them because they showed that even the best players can lose their heads."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">JOHN TERRY faces a fight for his England future — after the FA launched a probe into his race row with Anton Ferdinand.</h2>
              <p>The Three Lions captain is accused of calling Ferdinand "a f****** black ****" during Sunday's explosive clash between QPR and Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Rangers have asked the FA to investigate after Ferdinand made it clear he did not agree with Terry's explanation of what was said.</p>
              <p>The dispute is a crushing embarrassment for the FA, who only reinstated Terry as England skipper in March following a string of scandals about his private life.</p>
              <p>And if they decide to charge the Blues defender and he is found guilty, then Terry will almost certainly be stripped of the England captaincy — and possibly banned from international football for good.</p>
              <p>The FA is committed to vigorously clamping down on racism via their award-winning Kick It Out campaign.</p>
              <p>Terry vehemently denies hurling racist abuse at Ferdinand, claiming it was just a misunderstanding and that he and Ferdinand were 'cool' with each other.</p>
              <p>Chelsea boss Andre Villas-Boas had claimed earlier yesterday the matter was over.</p>
              <p>But Ferdinand, after meeting with his manager Neil Warnock and FA reps yesterday, is ready to dispute Terry's explanation.</p>
              <p>Hoops owner Tony Fernandes said last night: "Queens Park Rangers do not condone racism in any way, shape or form.</p>
              <p>"As a club, we will provide our players with our unequivocal support when alleged incidents like this occur.</p>
              <p>"The club has and will continue to support Kick It Out's One Game, One Community Initiative.</p>
              <p>"However, we are keen to draw a line under this alleged incident and focus on our forthcoming fixtures."</p>
              <p>Terry insists he will fight to clear his name and welcomed the news in a statement. It read: "I welcome the FA enquiry and look forward to clearing my name as soon as possible. Until then I have no further comment."</p>

              <p>They have such clear evidence of him on video saying those words how is he going to escape I don't know...</p>
              <p>Maybe he need the great Houdini to get out of this one... cos this is even more damaging than sleeping with his team mate's / good friend's wife... Not that that one was a small matter but compare to this... This is huge. He will forever be condemn as a racist if he is found guilty. Everywhere he goes, the fellow players and fans in the stand will have a go at him cos all those before were private matters while this is on a professional level.</p>
              <p>The FA is in a very difficult position cos it's like damn if you do and damn if you don't situation now... Back him and people will say they are covering up for their captain... Find him guilty and it would embarrass them further after they agree to reinstated him in the first place... </p>
              <p>Anyway, the video evidence is so clear as hell how are they going to 'spin-it' I look forward to see... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>There is a reason John Terry has been so proactive in defending himself against an allegation of racism. This is a situation far more serious than any he has faced before. If the allegation is proved, it would destroy his reputation.  </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He is the captain of England and Chelsea and Terry knows only too well that they are not roles that can be occupied by a racist. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">As he said himself, the Chelsea dressing room is as diverse as any in football and one would have to question if he could remain part of it if the FA conclude that he is guilty. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The England dressing room prides itself on its cultural diversity and on many occasions has united to fight the racism that sadly exists in many countries.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Terry has worn the Three Lions when team-mates have been abused in Madrid, Kiev and Sofia and he has backed English football’s hugely successful Kick It Out campaign: a campaign this country should be proud of for the way it has tackled racism in its football grounds.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">England sets an example that few countries can match and, after all the progress since the Seventies and Eighties, could not contemplate someone leading out the national team who has been found guilty of racial abuse.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">For Terry, these allegations are so much more serious than the salacious headlines and errors of judgment that forced Fabio Capello to strip him of the England captaincy. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He would probably consider it more serious than the criminal charges that could have led to his imprisonment had he not been acquitted. If found guilty, he would find himself a pariah of the English game.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">As Ron Atkinson knows only too well, there is a strong intolerance of racism in this country. And rightly so, because were it not the case our black footballers would still be enduring  the vile chants from the stands when they are simply making their contribution to a sport we adore.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Never has Terry been under more scrutiny and he - more than anyone - know the stakes have never been higher. </span></p>

              <p><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">November 2009: </span>His father is caught dealing cocaine in the toilet of a wine bar. Ted Terry was later handed a six-month suspended sentence.</span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">March 2009: </span>His mother, Sue, and mother-in-law, Sue Poole, are arrested and cautioned for shoplifting £800 worth of clothes and groceries.</span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">January 2010:</span> A four-month affair between Terry and Wayne Bridge’s<br>ex-girlfriend Vanessa Perroncel is revealed.</span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">December 2009:</span> He is exposed for organising a secret tour of Chelsea’s training ground, apparently in exchange for £10,000.</span></p>

              <p>Anton is currently at the centre of a racism row, after England captain Terry was accused of verbally abusing him during QPR's victory over Chelsea on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Neither of the Ferdinand brothers have made public statements about the incident, but <em>ESPNsoccernet</em> spoke to them at length as they attended the launch of Pele's new sportswear brand in London on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The depth of the pair's anger towards Terry was clear, though they reiterated that they are not yet prepared to comment publicly.</p>
              <p>During the event in central London, both Anton and Rio also spoke with PFA assistant chief executive Bobby Barnes, the second in command to Gordon Taylor at the players' union.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">IT breaks my heart to see the ugly spectre of racism in football.</h2>
              <p>But equally, I've come to the sorry conclusion it will never be totally wiped out of our game — because it will never be totally wiped out of society.</p>
              <p>You can have as many notices as you like inside stadiums, as many campaigns as you like, but it will continue to be an issue as long as it's an issue in life.</p>
              <p>The one thing I've realised over the years is that it all boils down to how you deal with it — and that isn't through anger and aggression.</p>
              <p>The only way you will ever get a grip on this is by educating ignorant people in a sensible, dignified and intelligent manner.</p>
              <p>Now in the case of John Terry and Anton Ferdinand, clearly I wasn't on the pitch and don't intimately know what was said by whom and when.</p>
              <p>Only Terry himself knows exactly what was said and in what context.</p>
              <p>What I do know is that, if Terry was proved to be guilty of hurling racist abuse, then his real punishment would come when he goes back to the Chelsea training ground.</p>
              <p>That's when he would have to look into the eyes of team-mates like Didier Drogba, Ashley Cole, Daniel Sturridge, John Obi Mikel, Florent Malouda, Salomon Kalou, Ramires, Jose Bosingwa, Nicolas Anelka, Michael Essien and Co.</p>
              <p>He's their captain, their leader and the feeling would not be pleasant for him. I'm sure there are a lot of black players who he's respected and only JT himself fully knows what was said.</p>
              <p>But if he's guilty, I can guarantee he will be punished for life — he will never, ever get over it. What more punishment would he need than that?</p>
              <p>When an England captain is caught in a controversy like this, it makes you feel all the hard work in the past has come to nothing.</p>
              <p>It's all well and good campaigns like 'Kick It Out' focusing on racism in football. But shouldn't we all be focusing on society in general?</p>
              <p>What is good is how it simply isn't accepted by everyone as 'just part and parcel of the game' any more. The number of people offended by it shows we are making major progress.</p>
              <p>There are a lot of mixed race relationships, clubs have so many different cultures within them nowadays. It all comes down to how it's dealt with.</p>
              <p>We need to know how to put these fires out when they do flare up, so that when they come again, we handle it properly.</p>
              <p>People need to be able to say 'OK, we handled it this way before, that's how we do it again.' Otherwise it will flare up again and we'll have a problem like this every season.</p>
              <p>I am just so disappointed Terry is at the centre of these allegations.</p>
              <p>He's been around the world, seen so many different cultures — he works with plenty of players from different nationalities.</p>
              <p>Even if it is established John was guilty, I must say that if I bumped into him, I'd look him in the eye and shake his hand, because you don't deal with this issue through aggression.</p>
              <p>You do it with dignity and intelligence, because anyone who has those sort of feelings is ignorant in the extreme.</p>
              <p>I must say, though, when Chelsea came out so quickly to back him 100 per cent, you'd have to question their wisdom.</p>
              <p>Of course you expect them to be loyal to their player, but did they really have time to investigate it thoroughly?</p>
              <p>It's the same thing with Liverpool and their rapid defending of Luis Suarez, after similar allegations from Patrice Evra. Yes, back him to the hilt. But you've got to hold your own official inquiry to look fully into the situation as well.</p>
              <p>And although I know Liverpool's game against Norwich last week was picked as one of the Kick It Out, anti-racist promotion matches, seeing them run out in anti-racist T-shirts added to my sense the matter could have been handled in a different way.</p>

              <p>That is the view of Les Ferdinand, former Three Lions striker and cousin of QPR defender Anton.</p>

              <p>And last night Sir Les, who suffered abuse during his career, insisted JT must be hit hard if the FA find against him.</p>
              <p>He said: "If John Terry has said something he needs to come out and say it. If he hasn't, let's get it sorted and out of the way."</p>
              <p>Video footage of Terry allegedly mouthing abuse at Anton appeared on websites after Sunday's ill-tempered clash.</p>
              <p>And Les, talking at last night's Black List Awards, added: "I was asked to look at it on the internet and I've seen what's said — unfortunately you are not privy to the whole conversation.</p>
              <p>"The FA, FIFA and UEFA have been in positions where they have been able to stamp out a few problems which have reared their ugly heads in the last few years and they haven't done so or they haven't done it diligently enough.</p>
              <p>"When you look at the punishments dished out, it lets you know these people don't think there is a racist problem in football.</p>
              <p>"They need to make a statement. That means bans instead of fines — that's the only way it's going to work."</p>
              <p>Former Chelsea defender Paul Elliott, a leading anti-racism campaigner, said: "A man is innocent until proven guilty. But there must be zero tolerance if someone is found guilty, no matter who they are — even the Queen!"</p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Rio Ferdinand has broken his silence on the controversy that has rocked football by telling friends he believes England and Chelsea captain John Terry's clash with his younger brother, the QPR defender Anton Ferdinand, involved language that was 'blatantly racist'.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The 32-year-old Manchester United defender, England captain before Terry's reinstatement to the role last March, has watched television images of the moment in Chelsea's 1-0 defeat at QPR when Terry is alleged to have used the words '****ing black ****' in an exchange with the younger Ferdinand. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Terry does not deny using the words, but claims the context in which he said them meant they could not be taken as racist abuse. The Chelsea captain insists that he was simply asking Ferdinand if he was accusing him of using the highly offensive phrase.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>And the man at the centre of the storm, Anton, has revealed he won't be backing down either. </span></p>

              </span></p><p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">The QPR man said: 'I didn’t know racism still existed in football until last weekend. I thought we were past all that here. I had no idea it had happened until I left the ground. It was pretty shocking. It’s crazy, I can’t believe it.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">Ferdinand added in the People: 'I don’t need to say anything, it’s all on YouTube, everyone can see what he said. What do you think he said? Look, it’s with the FA now.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">Rio has told friends that he believes the onus is on the Football Association to establish, once and for all, whether Terry is guilty of using racist language or not. </span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">And Ferdinand's manager at Old Trafford, Sir Alex Ferguson, has added his weight to the affair by calling on the FA to show 'responsibility' in dealing with players found guilty of making racist comments and backing his vice-captain, Patrice Evra, in his own race-related dispute with Liverpool striker Luis Suarez. </span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">Ferguson said: 'I can't believe this is an issue in 2011 given the number of black players who have played in our game over the last 25 years. At our club, we have had fantastic [black] players with great personalities and I have been very lucky to have them.'</span></p>

              </span></p><p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">Ferguson's comments came as a well-known member of the black footballing community, former Arsenal player Paul Davis, claimed that United and QPR were not giving as much support to Evra and Ferdinand as Liverpool and Chelsea were giving to Suarez and Terry.</span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">Davis, now a respected coach with the players' union, said: 'It is double standards and might prevent other black players from speaking out.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">Ferguson chose to break his silence on Evra's claim that Suarez racially abused him despite the club's wish not to comment until an FA investigation is complete. </span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">Anton Ferdinand is understood to have discussed the Terry affair with his older brother, other family members and his club.</span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">The 26-year-old has told them that he was not aware of Terry using abusive language during the game itself, which is said to explain why, when the Chelsea captain spoke to him in the dressing room after the match last Sunday, there was no apparent problem between the two men. </span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">However, after later seeing video footage of the game and hearing that Terry had effectively admitted using the offensive phrase in some capacity, Ferdinand and QPR considered whether to take further action. </span></p>

              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">On Friday, staff from the FA's governance and regulation department visited Chelsea's training ground in Cobham, Surrey, and questioned Terry about the allegation. </span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">Ferdinand, expected to be in QPR's team to face Tottenham at White Hart lane today, said: 'The last few days have been crazy, but I'm looking forward to Sunday's game and fully focused on football. </span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">'Anyone who knows me will know that whatever's going on, football's always going to be my No 1 priority.' </span></p>
