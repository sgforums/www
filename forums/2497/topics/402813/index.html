               fan bursts into dressing room to tell England players: Youâ€™re a

              </li>
              </ul>
              <p>An England supporter sparked a major security 
              scare by storming into the team's dressing room to rant at Fabio Capello
               and his players after their World Cup goalless draw with Algeria.</p>
              <p>The intruder, wearing an England shirt, burst in just a few minutes 
              before Prince William and Prince Harry were due to meet the players, and
               had to be talked out of the room by David Beckham.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Moments earlier, Wayne Rooney had snapped at fans as he marched from 
              the pitch and snar led a foul -mouthed message down the lens of a 
              television camera.</p>
              <p>'Nice to see your own fans booing you,' a 
              furious Rooney could be heard to say. 'That's what loyal support is - 
              for ****'s sake.'</p>
              <p>It was a chaotic and fractious night all round 
              for Capello and his team as they stumbled to a draw against the 
              unfancied North Africans, who are at their first World Cup for 24 years 
              and ranked 30 in the world.</p>
              <p>'The fans can decide to do what they 
              prefer,' said the manager, who criticised his players and claimed they 
              were stifled by fear. 'I didn't hear the boos because of the vuvuzelas.'</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Point and shout: But Fabio Capello was unable to
               galvanise his side</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The FA will lodge a formal 
              complaint to FIFA today about 
              the security lapse at the Green Point Stadium.</p>
              <p>England were 
              disappointing against the USA in Rustenburg last Saturday and worse 
              still last night against the Algerians.</p>
              <p>A win against Slovenia on
               Wednesday will still be enough to qualify for the last 16 - they could 
              even top the group - but they will be without Jamie Carragher, who 
              collected his second booking in one-and-a-half games and will miss the 
              game in Port Elizabeth.</p>
              <p>Prospects would have been even worse had 
              the USA not fought back from two down to draw against Slovenia earlier 
              yesterday, as Ashley Cole acknowledged later.</p>
              <p>'We were lucky the 
              USA got a draw,' he said.</p>
              <p>Former England boss Graham Taylor said 
              on BBC Radio that he feared Capello's team may not even get out of the 
              group and raised doubts about the harmony in the camp.</p>

              <p>'I do now believe there's a real 
              danger of England going out,' said Taylor. 'There's something not right 
              behind the scenes. I don't know what it is. I have an idea; I don't 
              believe the proper preparatory work is being done. Look at the body 
              language: something's wrong.'</p>
              <p>Goalkeeper David James replaced Rob
               Green, axed after his dreadful mistake against the USA, and he offered a
               prickly response when asked about Capello's theory that the team were 
              playing with fear.</p>

              James. 'It was more frustration than 
              fear. Algeria just didn't want to lose. 
              We can recover, without a doubt.'</p>
              <p>Rooney's form will worry 
              Capello, 
              but John Terry said: 'There is no 
              pressure on Wayne. He does what 
              he does and is one of the best in the 
              world for it. Obviously Wayne is 
              frustrated. Everybody in the 
              dressing-room is feeling the same 
              as Wayne. I would ask the fans to 
              stay behind us. We need them fully 
              behind us. It is in our hands.'</p>

              <p>Wayne Rooney was unhappy with England fans booing the players 
              after their 0-0 draw with Algeria last night.</p>
              <p>The <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> striker trudged off following an 
              ineffective performance.</p>
              <p>He told the <em>ITV</em> cameras: "It's nice to see your home fans booing 
              you."</p>
              <p>The result means England need to beat Slovenia next Wednesday to ensure 
              they qualify for the last 16.</p>
              <p>Midfielder Gareth Barry understood the fans' frustration.</p>
              <p>He said: "It is a long way to come out here, they want what's best for 
              us and we do too. We want to qualify and they want to extend their stay 
              out here and see us go as far as possible.</p>
              <p>"On Wednesday night that is just the small push for us to try and do it 
              for the fans."</p>
              <p>Captain <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Steven Gerrard</span></abbr> made no excuses for the display in 
              which the team were sloppy throughout and rarely threatened the Algeria 
              goal.</p>
              <p>The <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> skipper told ITV1: "We're not happy with 
              the performance, we need more.</p>
              <p>"We want to stay in this tournament until the final stages.</p>
              <p>"We were not good enough to make the breakthrough in the final third.</p>
              <p>"We've not got any excuses, we know what we have to do. We have to win 
              the final game which adds to the pressure but at this level you have to 
              handle that pressure.</p>
              <p>"We were not aggressive enough and didn't have the cutting edge in the 
              final third.</p>
              <p>"Give them (Algeria) credit but we have to look at ourselves."</p>
