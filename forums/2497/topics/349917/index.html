              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger insists he is not worried that the Arsenal supporters
              are showing their frustration with the team and has again asked to be
              judged at the end of the season. </strong></p>
              <p>The Gunners have failed to fire in recent weeks and, after four
              games without a goal in the league, the fans growing increasingly
              unhappy with the side as Champions League qualification looks more and
              more difficult.</p>
              <p>However, Wenger insists he still has faith in his squad and has called on his players to prove the doubters wrong.</p>
              <p>Asked whether the fans were losing faith in the side, he said: “I don’t know. That is not my worry.</p>
              <p>“What is important is that I do what I believe is right and we keep
              going, that we show great attitude and do our job as well as we can,
              then let everybody judge and have an opinion.</p>
              <p>“I believe it’s not the biggest problem, not the biggest worry. The
              biggest worry is that we don’t win games that we should win.</p>
              <p>“We have been through difficult times, but it’s an opportunity to show that we are strong enough to come through it.”</p>
              <p>He added: “I feel the players are showing enough desire but, when
              you don’t get results, the first thing people always doubt is the
              desire.</p>
              <p>“I want to win the games and, when we don’t win the games, it’s disappointing.</p>
              <p>“You know how much I want to get into the Champions League. For me,
              it is not important – it is vital – but you can only play your games
              and try to win them.</p>
              <p>“I want to be in the Champions League because it’s the best I can be. If I’m not then I’m not happy – it’s as simple as that.</p>
              <p>“You don’t play football to be average. I don’t manage in the game to be average, and the players want to play at the top.”</p>

              <p>arsenal midfield are in shambles.</p>
              <p>i think fulham play a more passing game than arsenal.</p>
              <p>Fulham can stroke the ball around with ease,, nip arsenal for the loseball. and always caught arsenal on the break few times.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>we have know the problems that AW dont want to admit. i think he is too big a ego to admit he make a mistake.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1.  arsenal nebver find a replacement for patrick vieira</p>
              <p>2. arsenal lack experience from the middle to the attacking..</p>
              <p>3. he should have extend gilberto and robert pires contract.</p>
              <p>4. he should not rely on youth . what good of the youth is there isnt senior experience player to guide them?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. he should consider tall and tough english players instead of always buying small and petite player.</p>
              <p>6. denlison, diaby, vela , eboue ,song,are average players, get rid of them. i dont think they can be improve.</p>
              <p>7. the most impt fault is AW.</p>
