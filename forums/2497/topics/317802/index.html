              <p class="story"> </p>
              <p class="story"><strong>Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas is close to signing a new, lucrative contract aimed at finally warding off Real Madrid and Barcelona. The 21-year-old Young Player of the Year is already committed to Arsenal until 2014 but it is understood the club are set to complete a new deal worth around £100,000 a week.</strong></p>
              <p class="story">Gael Clichy already confirmed that he has agreed to a new deal and is about to extend his existing contract by a further two years. Fabregas joined Arsenal in 2003 and in 2006 he signed an eight-year deal; his existing agreement is believed to be worth around £60,000 a week and despite insisting that they will not break their strict wage structure, the youngster's wages will be increase to send a clear message to Spain that he is staying at the Emirates Stadium.</p>
              <p class="story">In February, Fabregas revealed that he was in talks aimed at improving his already lucrative agreement and Arsene Wenger, his manager, admitted that a deal could be done when the season had finished.</p>
              <p class="story">At the time Fabregas said: "I want to succeed at Arsenal and that the club wants me is fundamental for me. I am proud (to be linked to Barcelona), I am from Barcelona and I have played there. But now I only think of winning as many titles as possible here (at Arsenal)."</p>
              <p class="story">Real have never disguised their admiration for Fabregas and, more recently, Ramon Calderon, the club's president, said: “Every coach likes him but my policy is that it has to be the player who makes the first step for the signing because we don't want conflicts with any team. Something nice about Cesc is that he is Spanish and this is one of my objectives - to make Real Madrid more Spanish.”</p>
              <p class="story">Fabregas has also admitted that he would like to see a fellow Spaniard join Arsenal, claiming that David Villa, who is set to leave Valencia, would be an ideal signing at the Emirates. Wenger, for now, will be satisfied just to keep Fabregas and Clichy in North London, particularly after losing his midfield partner, Mathieu Flamini, to AC Milan on a free transfer.</p>
              <p class="story">Clichy's current contract expires in 2010 and he added: "We're talking about a further two years. It's a superb plan to throw yourself into the future with this group here. I never hesitated, not at all. Arsenal is one of the great clubs in Europe."</p>

              <p>fabgregas has proven his quality  in past three season in vieira absent. 100K is not unique. gallas, campbell, henry is drawing that salary.</p>
              <p>abebayor 80k must wait until next season when he delivered another 30 goal season performance.</p>
              <p>player who earn over 100K, deserve their paychecks coz most has proven season in and out their are regular performer. lampard, terry, gerrard, sheva, ballack, ronaldo, rooney, Rio.</p>
              <p>other arsenal players, if u think u worth that much, no harm trying your luck. there are many youngster waiting in the wing or 200+ player to replace them. If what wenger said is true.</p>
