              <h1>Mourinho's quitting Inter - but Jose will snub English return in favour of Real Madrid job<br></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img title="Mourinho on the brink at Inter" src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00754/sport_splash_mourin_754161a.jpg" alt="Mourinho on the brink at Inter" width="516" height="250"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>No respect: Jose Mourinho is said to have fallen out of love with Inter Milan</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Jose Mourinho wants to take over at Real Madrid after deciding to quit Inter Milan at the end of the season. Sources in Italy have told London's <span style="font-style: italic;">Evening Standard</span> - the <span style="font-style: italic;">Daily Mail's</span> sister paper - that the 46-year-old does not believe the time is right for a return to English football and will reject any approach from </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea </strong></span></a><strong>or </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester City</strong></span></a><strong>. However, it is he would eventually like to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson at </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong>.</strong></p>
              <p>Relations between Mourinho and the Inter board have become strained as the club's hierarchy demand instant success in Europe. The situation will have intensified after Inter were knocked out by United after a 2-0 defeat at Old Trafford in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 clash.</p>
              <p>The Portuguese has also had an ongoing battle with the Italian media ever since taking charge at the San Siro last summer and feels he will have nothing left to prove should his team win the League, regardless of their exit in Europe.</p>
              <p>Mourinho also faces being interviewed by Greater Manchester Police after they received a complaint from a fan who claimed he had been punched by the coach as he was standing by the Inter team bus outside Old Trafford, although the club insist nothing untoward happened.</p>
              <p>Although City are likely to offer Mourinho a fortune in salary and transfer funds should Mark Hughes depart in the summer, the Portuguese has now set his sights on a return to Spain as he looks to continue to build a successful career in a variety of countries.</p>
              <p>Chelsea insist Russia coach Guus Hiddink is only in temporary charge until the end of the season and a significant section of the Blues faithful would want their former boss back in charge.</p>
              <p>Mourinho won four League titles, a Champions League and a UEFA Cup in his time with Porto and Chelsea, who sacked him in September 2007 amid rumours of a falling out with owner Roman Abramovich.</p>
              <p>His Inter side are currently seven points ahead of Juventus in <span style="font-style: italic;">Serie A.</span> A source said: 'It is not about money with Mourinho - Chelsea made him a very rich man when they sacked him.</p>
              <p>'He wants titles and does not think he should be undermined by the board as could happen in Italy. Despite his links with Barcelona, he would have no problem taking over at Madrid.'</p>
              <p>Mourinho worked under Bobby Robson at a variety of clubs during the 1990s including Barcelona, where he earned the nickname 'The Translator' before embarking on a coaching career.</p>
              <p>It is thought Mourinho's ideal return to England would be to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson at United.</p>

              <h1>Why Jose Mourinho could soon be out of a job in Italy... and back in the Premier League</h1>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/03/13/article-0-03D80169000005DC-615_468x297.jpg" alt="Jose Mourinho" width="468" height="297"></p>
              <p></p>
              <p class="up"> </p>
              <div id="article-body">
              <p><strong>Jose Mourinho's brief love affair with Italian football was ending last night as the former Chelsea boss edged towards a return to England.</strong></p>
              <p>Inter Milan had to deny claims by a Manchester United fan that he was hit by Mourinho as the team were boarding the coach to leave Old Trafford on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Stretford police say they are investigating an allegation of common assault after a complaint was made, with officers asking United for any CCTV footage of the area outside the players' entrance.</p>
              <p>But as far as Inter fans and the Italian press are concerned, Mourinho has already been judged guilty of failing in his main task for the season, with the fall-out likely to be spectacular. And that will alert Manchester City, Newcastle and perhaps even Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Mourinho's defensive post-match posture after watching his side's Champions League elimination was an eye-opener for those who witnessed the Special One at close quarters at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>The Inter boss had tried all his tricks before the game, even trying to change the ball when he claimed United might have an advantage by using the holders' special gold and red version.</p>
              <p>Yet his bleak mood afterwards, glaring at his Italian interrogators then complaining "I don't have a team good enough to beat Manchester United" went down like a lead balloon at the San Siro.</p>
              <p>Mourinho outraged most of Italian football last week with a verbal onslaught on Juventus, Milan, Roma and the media in general, who he accused of "intellectual prostitution".</p>
              <p>And he continued his theme on Wednesday as he added: "I don't understand the reason behind these questions.</p>
              <p>"All Italy will be happy because we were eliminated. But I do not care. I can tell you why Inter have failed in the past four or five years, why they couldn't do it in Europe, but suddenly it is my job to come here and win the Champions League."</p>
              <p>Mourinho's aggressive posturing, which made him such a cult figure in England, has not gone down as well in the land of calcio.</p>
              <p>While Inter are set to retain the Serie A crown they have won for the past four years - twice, admittedly, off the pitch rather than on it - under Roberto Mancini, Mourinho's approach has made him few friends.</p>

              <p>I am a Man United fan...</p>
              <p>Much as I hate to see him winning against United in the past, somehow, part of my thinking is I want him to succeed Ferguson when he retires...</p>
              <p>There are not much managers around who has the class like him...</p>
              <p>Martin O'Neil, David Moyes, Fabio Capello, Brian Robson, Mark Hughes are all familiar names to English football fans but I really dont think they can match The Special One.</p>
              <p>But of course, I want Ferguson to stay as long as possible with United.</p>
              <p>Maybe Mourinho can become Ferguson's assistant manager for one/two year before finally taking over. That would be ideal to preserve the attacking brand of football United is famous for.</p>

              <p>Mourinho should never be consider for the United post until he change his behaviour... But I am afraid that will be very difficult presently... Maybe when he gets older, he may not behave so hostile...</p>
              <p>Honestly, I am still not convince he is really very good... He may have won 2 titles with Chelsea but during those 2 years, there was really no other side around strong enough, Arsenal and United were undergoing rebuilding to their squad, he came and inherit a very strong Chelsea squad from Ranieri and spent another $100 over million in those 2 years. But in his 3rd year, despite spending another $80m of Roman's money... He still lost to a United team who have come of age...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">
              </span></p><p>Joining Inter is almost alike too, he also inherit a already very good squad from R Mancini. They were champions of Italy 3 yrs running... If the present state remains, he won't achieve anything better than R Mancini either... But the big point standing out like a sore thumb now is Inter is more dislike by more Italians than when R Mancini was their manager... Another thing is, his big money purchases so far... Sulley Muntari, Ricardo Quaresma and Mancini... Over $40m worth of flops in just one season...</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Anyway, Mourinho's negative brand of football isn't good for United either... Moreover, he is a manager that can't last with a club for very long... The way he behave, it would be a big surprise if he can last more than 5 yrs at one club...</p>

              <p>Rafa have to bring his managerial skill one level up in handling and torturing flashier and skilful player like Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>If Liverpool dun employ this type of players, the EPL title will never come.</p>
              <p>The result of the team is already amazing considering Ah Ben having a squad of CMI players and lousy reserves.</p>
              <p>As for Jose, he have proven himself in getting the league title for Inter Milan if there is no hiccup.</p>
              <p>But, he need to be in EPL so that EPL can have more issues and more competitions.</p>
              <p>It is getting a bit boring when Alex dominates, Ah Ben talk to himself and Wenger have turned into a lamb.</p>
