I want to play in the Champions League or at a club wanting to be there next season."<br><br>Bolton have lost all three of their Premier League games this season, putting new boss Sammy Lee under pressure.<br><br>Speculation also surrounds the future of Diouf's fellow Bolton striker Nicolas Anelka, who has also been valued at Â£10million.<br><br>And Diouf made it clear he would only have a long-term future at the Reebok Stadium if the club spent heavily rather than cashing in on its best players.<br><br>However, a move to Celtic Park would be a major surprise given the forward, then with Liverpool, received a two-match ban after spitting at Celtic fans during a Uefa Cup quarter-final tie in 2003.<br><br>Speaking ahead of Senegal's friendly with Ghana at Millwall's New Den stadium on Tuesday, Diouf said: "If Nicolas goes I will be very disappointed.<br><br>"We must keep Nico as we have been doing very well with him. We need to go up to the next level and keep our good players as well as buying some more.<br><br>"We need to get five good players in and find big players. We have missed Tal Ben Haim but we also need midfielders and strikers.<br><br>"This season we have the Carling Cup, the FA Cup and the Uefa Cup as well as the Premier League, so we must have a big squad.<br><br>"We don't have a big squad like last season and I'm not happy about that. I want to play in a good team."<br><br>Diouf added: "We are not happy to have made a start to the season like this but we got out of a similar position under Sam Allardyce two years ago.<br><br>"Now we have a new manager, things are not going well but we just have to keep working hard.<br><br>"Sammy Lee is a different guy but he's a good manager. We are not having much luck under him now.<br><br>"I have known him for a long time since he was head coach at Liverpool under Gerard Houllier.<br><br>"But for the first game he put me on the bench - I don't know why. When I came on I did well every time to prove I want to do well."</div>
