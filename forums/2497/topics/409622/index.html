              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Warm welcome: Javier Mascherano ‘Roy Hodgson knows the truth, a lot of lies have been spoken about me and shortly I will respond.’</em><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1307475" rel="1307475|3| nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1307475/Javier-Mascherano-completes-Barcelona-sealing-22m-deal-Liverpool.html"></a></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Javier Mascherano completed his troubled move to Barcelona on Monday night, then accused Liverpool of lying.</strong></p>
              <p>The Argentina captain was labelled ‘selfish’ by Anfield boss Roy Hodgson, who claimed the midfielder had refused to play for the club in a Europa League tie to try to force through his move.</p>
              <p>But Mascherano, 26, said: ‘Roy Hodgson knows the truth. This is a happy moment for me so now is not the moment to say it, but a lot of lies have been spoken about me and shortly I will respond.’</p>
              <p>The midfielder said he was close to moving to Barca a year ago but Liverpool refused to sell him because Xabi Alonso was leaving. He added: ‘When the best club in the world calls you, then it is something that you want to happen.’</p>
              <p>Mascherano signed a four-year deal at the Nou Camp office of new club president Sandro Rosell. The contract has a buy-out clause of £74million.</p>
              <p>Mascherano will wear the number 14 shirt with Barca, which was previously the number worn by Thierry Henry prior to the Frenchman's departure this summer.</p>

              <p><strong>The Argentina midfielder will have to vie for playing time with Spain trio Xavi, Sergio Busquets and Andres Iniesta at the heart of Pep Guardiola's side, but insisted he wasn't deterred by the challenge.</strong></p>
              <p>'It would be stupid to think I would come here and be playing every game,' Mascherano said. 'You have to respect the people who are already doing well and who have won everything. In the positions I play in, there are three world champions.</p>
              <p>'It will be an honour to be able learn from them and to grow with them.'</p>
              <p>Barca's sporting vice-president Josep Maria Bartomeu said the 26-year-old had taken a pay cut to help complete the move, and said Mascherano's arrival would be their last of the current transfer window.</p>
              <p>Mascherano became Barca's third acquisition of the summer after Spain striker David Villa and Brazilian full back Adriano Correia, and he helps fill the gap left by Yaya Toure's departure to Manchester City.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Javier Mascherano</span> has vowed to reveal the "lies" about his transfer to Barcelona in due course, hinting that Liverpool manager <span style="color: #000000;">Roy Hodgson</span> "knows the truth".</strong></p>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Mascherano, who also revealed the switch to Barcelona was a year overdue, was labelled "selfish" by Hodgson when he supposedly refused to play for the Reds against Manchester City last week.</p>
              <p>"Roy Hodgson knows the truth," he said in the <em>Guardian</em>. "This is a happy moment for me so now is not the time to say it, but a lot of lies have been told about me and I will respond to them.</p>
              <p>"Last year Liverpool would not let me leave. There was no way they would sell me. They had <span style="color: #000000;">Xabi Alonso</span> and me, and they would only let Xabi leave."</p>
              <p>He added in the <em>Sun</em>: "Against Manchester City, I was not right to play. Liverpool will always be in my heart but my time there has finished."</p>
              <p>The Argentina midfielder dismissed reports that former manager Rafa Benitez had tried to sign him for his new club Inter, confirming Barcelona was the only club who made a bid for his services.</p>
              <p>"I was disappointed not to be able to sign last season. When the best club in the world calls you, then it is something that you want to happen. I have signed for the only club who really wanted me. In no moment did I ever think that Inter was a possibility.</p>
              <p>Rafa valued me and perhaps that is why people started saying that I could go there but this is the only club that pushed to sign me.</p>
              <p>"When I landed I said that I was achieving a dream. At last I will be able to say that I play for Barcelona, the team who I wanted to play for."</p>

              <div>
              <p><strong>Former Liverpool midfielder <span style="color: #000000;">Javier Mascherano</span> has again hit out at the club, claiming the Reds told "lies" over the reasons for his departure from Anfield</strong></p>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Mascherano completed his move to La Liga side Barcelona on Monday, and the player believes that Liverpool were prepared to go back on a promise made 12 months earlier when they said they would sanction his move to Spain.</p>
              <p>Mascherano, who took a considerable pay cut to make sure the transfer went through, claims he spent the 2009-10 season waiting on the chance to move to Camp Nou - but it was only 24 hours before the transfer market closed that he was finally able to complete the move.</p>
              <p>The Argentina international also dismissed claims made by Liverpool that he wanted to move for family reasons.</p>
              <p>"When they started to involve my family and to say things that didn't make sense, I obviously suffered," he said. "They'd promised me something for a whole year and they never fulfilled their promise. And that didn't have anything to do with my family or anything else. When you read or hear lies, you obviously get angry.</p>
              <p>"I'd also like to thank the club [Barca] for their efforts. They've spent a lot of money and it was my duty to give way a bit to make this dream come true. When this chance came up I didn't hesitate. I've joined the best club in the world and the best team in the world."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Mascherano did have positive words about ex-boss <span style="color: #000000;">Rafael Benitez</span>, who at one stage he seemed destined to link up with at Inter Milan.</strong></p>
              <p>"Rafa taught me tactics," Mascherano said. "He's one of the coaches who have taught me the most in my career and I'm very grateful to him. He was fundamental. He gave me the chance to join Liverpool. He had confidence in me at a time when, perhaps, nobody would have dreamed of giving me an opportunity. I'll be grateful to him all my life."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, <span style="color: #000000;">Lionel Messi</span> has welcomed he player to the La Liga champions: "He's a great player. In addition to what he can do in football, his arrival is a joy for me. Barcelona wanted him for what he means as a player and as a person, I am very glad that he signed.</p>
              <p>"He's a great player, he really helps us, hopefully this season we can keep winning titles with Barcelona's shirt."</p>
              <p>The paper also reports Mascherano took a pay-cut on his £70,000-a-week wages to sign for Barcelona.</p>

              <p>The Argentina international's three-year stay at Anfield came to an end last week when he secured a big-money move to Barcelona. </p>
              <p>But rather than receive a fitting farewell from the Liverpool supporters, Mascherano left the club in acrimonious circumstances. </p>
              <p>Reports suggested that he refused to play in the 3-0 defeat to Manchester City, which would have turned out to be his final game for the Reds.</p>
              <p> Mascherano later denied the claims, insisting that he had spoken to manager Roy Hodgson and they both agreed he was not 'right to play'. </p>
              <p>Carragher nevertheless believes his former team-mate will have regrets about the way his exit from Liverpool came about. </p>
              <p>"Mascherano was great for Liverpool for three or four years and it was a privilege to play with him," said the defender. </p>
              <p>"But he let himself down badly and that left a bad taste in the mouth. </p>
              <p>"If he'd played in that match he would have got a great send-off and it all would have been fine. </p>
              <p>"But he ruined that and I think he'll regret it."</p>
