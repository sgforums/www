              <p>And also to Man U fans, especially those arrogant ones, I must say that you lot are very sore/poor losers and cowards with a capital C.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you all are winning, you make fun of, poke fun at and make sarcastic remarks at the opposing teams fans, act arrogantly. Now when the boot is on the other foot and the tables are turned, how do you feel?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you think I am being harsh in this posting of mine, I suggest you analyse and examine yourselves first, I have been tolerating all the abuse for Man U fans because they are the ones that are winning and they hold the upper hand, now that your team kena walloped at home and thrashed, its now MY TURN and I intend to enjoy it to the full.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Man U is winning, you sing, you cheer and you act so arrogantly, when you lose and lose emphatically, like damn cowards you run away and you become poor/sore losers, cannot take defeat and instead throw tantrums, just like that old fossil your manager Alex Fergiescum.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Next time, if you want to give it, you better take it, if you cannot take it then DONT give it! If you want to make fun of, poke fun at other fans and act arrogantly towards them just because you are the ones that won, then you better realise that when it is the other way around and the tables are turned, do you not think that others can also do that to you too?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just my frank opinion after enduring too much abuse from arrogant Man U fans, I think it is about time the tables are turned and it is my turn to gloat. You might not like it or even hate me for my words in this posting, but I am only human and I think that to those who abused me and made fun of me, poke fun at me and my fellow team supporters, just think, would YOU like it if others did that to YOU?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think about it, I am not a bad person or revengeful one, as I said before, I am only human, there is only so much I can take, and when people push me too far, is it wrong of me to do some pushing back myself? Think about it. </p>

              <p>Ditto.</p>
              <p>All ManU fans are alike - the arrogance amazes me. Win, but win humbly; lose but lose humbly too.</p>
              <p>Move on, the chance to attain 5 titles is still there. For Liverpool, what can i say? I'm just happy to share in the moment as an Arsenal fan.</p>

              <p>The funny thing is that SAF should have subbed out Vidic in the 1st half when it was obvious he could not cope with Torres &amp; Gerrad speed. That what my Man Utd friend was saying.</p>
              <p>Gave away a goal and fouled another Torres again near the penalty box, lucky never get a card from that, all in the 1st half. What was SAF thinking</p>

              <p>I met Liverpool fans who love to boast about their club success in the past whenever Liverpool lost to Man U. And I also met Liverpool fans who offer their gratz when their club lost to Man U. The same can be said of fans of other clubs too, discounting those "jersey-changing" fair weather fans (not worth mentioning imo).</p>
              <p>BUT unlike you, I understand and accept the fact that whichever club is may be, there will definately be fans of both extreme ends. Thus it's very immature to attack in the manner you did, surely you can do better than to steorotype all Man U fans as "very sore/poor losers and cowards with
              a capital C"</p>
              <p>Fair enough, there are such Man U fans out there. But such a sweeping statement from you does not make you any inch different from them imo.. Good riddance.</p>
