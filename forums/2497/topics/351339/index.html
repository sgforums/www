              <p class="article">The Liverpool striker scored the first goal as Rafa Benitez's side blasted into the quarter-finals of the Champions League last night. His strike, along with a double from skipper Steven Gerrard and Andrea Dossena's first for the club gave the Reds an emphatic 4-0 win. </p>
              <p class="article">With confidence sky high at Anfield, Liverpool travel to Premier League leaders Manchester United on Saturday. And Torres says they are desperate to claw back some of United's seven-point lead in the title race. </p>
              <p class="article">The Spanish star, 24, roared: "We now have the belief for Saturday against United. "That is a massive game. I hope to win that and have more chances in the league. "We know it's very important to win there - if not they will be many points ahead." </p>
              <p class="article">Liverpool's victory over Real was extra special for Torres, who played for their arch-rivals Atletico Madrid for six years. He added: "I am very proud. "I am proud at the performance of the team and the performance of the fans. "We knew the atmosphere would be amazing but it was even better than we thought. </p>
              <p class="article">"This was a big night for Liverpool and for English football as well. "We showed Real Madrid that this is Anfield and that Liverpool can win against any team here. </p>
              <p class="article">"It was a fantastic performance. After the first goal they knew it would be difficult because they had to score two. "The penalty finished the game."</p>
              <p class="article">Torres stunned Real by blasting home the opener on 16 minutes. He revealed: "The plan before the game was to play with intensity and with a high-tempo. "Spanish football has quality but it is slower, so we knew it would be difficult for them if we played with intensity. </p>
              <p class="article">"I think we prepared the game better than them. The boss was brilliant in explaining how to play against them." Liverpool could have had more than four goals but Real keeper Iker Casillas was on top form. </p>
              <p class="article">Torres said: "They have a fantastic 'keeper - one of the best in the world. "Every time I play against him he is brilliant. The best Real Madrid player on the night was Casillas." </p>
              <p class="article">Torres recovered from a ankle injury to play last night. And he added: "I feel good. "My ankle felt a little bit painful in the second half but that doesn't matter in a match like this. "We will work hard from Wednesday morning and I think I will be 100 per cent for Saturday."</p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>Liverpool forward Dirk Kuyt believes the team can draw on their performances against Real Madrid to re-ignite their Barclays Premier League title challenge against leaders Manchester United on Saturday. The foundation for a 5-0 aggregate Champions League last-16 victory over the nine-time European champions was set up by Yossi Benayoun's solitary goal in the Bernabeu a fortnight ago.</strong></p>
              <p>Kuyt said that experience in the Spanish capital, in particular, would be invaluable as they make the short trip to Old Trafford for the lunchtime kick-off.</p>
              <p>"This was a great result and performance in the Champions League, but it's also great going into our next game on Saturday," said the Dutchman after the club's 4-0 demolition of Real at Anfield last night. "It gives us confidence and we're really looking forward to the weekend now.</p>
              <p>"Man Utd are playing very well - they've had some great results - but we'll see what we can do on Saturday. "Of course Liverpool have to win every game but it will be very difficult against a side like Manchester United. "It was the same for us when we played Madrid two weeks ago. We will give it a try."</p>

              <p class="storyTitle" style="margin-top: 0px; font-size: 2.8em; margin-bottom: 0px;"><a href="http://sgforums.com/news/story?id=626797&amp;sec=uefachampionsleague&amp;cc=5739"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/domr/rafabenitez412gesture.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="412" height="232"></a></p>
              <p class="storyTitle" style="margin-top: 0px; font-size: 2.8em; margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p><strong>Buoyed by Liverpool's 4-0 Champions League demolition of Real Madrid at Anfield, Rafa Benitez insisted the Reds can force their way back into the Premier League title race with a win at Old Trafford on Saturday.</strong></p>
              <p>In the build up to Tuesday night's clash with Madrid, Benitez suggested Liverpool did not receive the respect they deserved for their European exploits, but after inflicting the heaviest Champions League defeat in Real's history the plaudits fooded in.</p>
              <p>A 5-0 aggregate win against the nine-time European champions claimed a place in the quarter-finals and also means the Reds are brimming with confidence ahead of this weekend's clash with Premier League leaders Manchester United, who are seven points clear at the top.</p>
              <p>"This is the best way to approach the Manchester United game," said Benitez. "When you have an important game coming up and the players are playing this well and scoring four goals against a team like Real Madrid, you have to be pleased.</p>
              <p>"We play a very good team on Saturday and we have to win. If we can reduce the gap we will be in the title race but we have to wait and see what happens at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>"Hopefully we have given Manchester United something to think about but they have a very good team. At least we will approach the game with a lot of confidence."</p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7935"><span style="color: #000000;">Steven Gerrard</span></a> scored twice in his 100th European game for the club with <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=24257"><span style="color: #000000;">Fernando Torres</span></a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=14357"><span style="color: #000000;">Andrea Dossena</span></a> completing the crushing victory. And Benitez was able to hit back at the critics who have branded him a defensive coach, particularly in his Spanish homeland.</p>
              <p>He said: "Yes, I know people in Spain think that my teams do not attack, but look at this result and look at the 119 goals we scored last season. That says something different.</p>
              <p>"We are ranked the number one club in Europe by UEFA over the last five years and a result like this against a great club like Real Madrid is very pleasing."</p>
              <p>And following Liverpool's victory the Spanish newspapers were quick to heap praise on Rafa's Reds. A typical reaction came from Jose Samano in <em>El Pais</em>, who wrote: "Liverpool had everything that Real lacked: energy, purpose, aplomb, speed, shape and flair.</p>
              <p>"They were facing a team reduced to rag dolls. It was an exercise in demolition, with an imperious Torres and Gerrard and (Xabi) Alonso and (Javier) Mascherano running the show."</p>
              <p>Pictures of a tearful-looking Iker Casillas contrasted with shots of his jubilant international colleague Torres, and the Spanish champions were variously dismissed as "pathetic", "lamentable" and "provincial".</p>
              <p>The English press were equally gushing in praise of Liverpool's win with <em>The Times</em> declaring it "a result that will resonate through Europe and go down in the modern history of both clubs".</p>
              <p>The <em>Daily Mail</em> said Liverpool simply "pulverised" Real. "There is no other word for it," wrote columnist Martin Samuel. "Fittingly for a team nick-named The Meringues, Real Madrid were splattered and dispersed over a wide area of Anfield in the manner of an airy fairy dessert.</p>
              <p>"One that has been run over by a steamroller. Then another one then. Then a herd of rampaging elephants. Driving more steamrollers." <em>The Independent</em> added: "This was Liverpool playing like European royalty, delivering a four-goal cuffing to Real Madrid, their biggest defeat in the Champions League.</p>
              <p>"This was European football's most successful club humiliated, eliminated, eviscerated. A rout."</p>

              <p>Nah... I see Man Utd winning this battle against Liverpool. Both would want to win. Liverpool winning would bring them back into contention. Man Utd want to win because winning would put liverpool out of contention of the PL crown.</p>
              <p>But I can see no way Liverpool winning against Man Utd. Even though they whacked Real Madrid 4-0 at home in the CL, it was nothing great at all. Real Madrid just sucks, because they just look ordinary to me thru out the 2 legs against liverpool in the CL.</p>
              <p>Man Utd, took apart Inter Milan coached by the special one. Did you see the CL match against inter, it was almost perfect performance by Man Utd.</p>
              <p>Liverpool only has Torres and Gerard. You take out Gerard, there is nothing to play for. Compare to the Man Utd team, you see winners, They have Rooney, Berbatov, Ronaldo, Park, Giggs. All these players can win games for Man Utd. Just simply deploy an Anderson to Man marked Gerard would be more than enough. With the bulldog, Rooney running around the pitch going for each and every ball, I dont see why Man Utd would lose this one.</p>
              <p>Further more this match is at Old Trafford. I would only have to say bye bye to Liverpool.</p>

              <p><strong>It is a Premier League riddle, wrapped in a Champions League enigma: just why can't Liverpool repeat their European form on the domestic stage?</strong></p>
              <p>As Javier Mascherano said straight after Tuesday's incredible demolition of Real Madrid: "When Liverpool play like that we are capable of beating any team."</p>
              <p>He was thinking of this weekend's title showdown with Manchester United, and offered the notion as evidence his side can win at Old Trafford to keep alive their dream of being Champions.</p>
              <p>The problem is, they simply do not perform that way in the Premier League. Ever.</p>
              <p>One senior figure at Anfield, a long-time supporter of Rafa Benitez, said as he left on Tuesday: "It's just a pity we can't play like that against Stoke." It was a sentiment echoed by thousands of Liverpool fans.</p>
              <p>It was one of the greatest results in the club's history, with mighty Madrid handed their heavie st-ever Champions League drubbing.</p>
              <p>The question remains, what do the likes of Stoke, Hull, Fulham, Wigan, and West Ham have that the Spaniards do not? Or perhaps it is not what those sides possess, but what Liverpool lack.</p>
              <p>Against Real, you would have to say they lacked very little. But as winger Ryan Babel admitted, something has been missing. "We played superbly, but winning any game is possible," he said.</p>
              <p>"A season is long, and that's why teams make mistakes.</p>
