              <div><em>Mascherano, the latest of many Liverpool players
              who reckons they could beat United this weekend.</em></div>

              <p> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>It is a Premier League riddle, wrapped in a Champions
              League enigma: just why can't Liverpool repeat their European form
              on the domestic stage?</strong></p>
              <p>As Javier Mascherano said straight after Tuesday's incredible
              demolition of Real Madrid: "When Liverpool play like that we are
              capable of beating any team."</p>
              <p>He was thinking of this weekend's title showdown with Manchester
              United, and offered the notion as evidence his side can win at Old
              Trafford to keep alive their dream of being Champions.</p>
              <p>The problem is, they simply do not perform that way in the
              Premier League. Ever.</p>
              <p>One senior figure at Anfield, a long-time supporter of Rafa
              Benitez, said as he left on Tuesday: "It's just a pity we can't
              play like that against Stoke." It was a sentiment echoed by
              thousands of Liverpool fans.</p>
              <p>It was one of the greatest results in the club's history, with
              mighty Madrid handed their heavie st-ever Champions League
              drubbing.</p>
              <p>The question remains, what do the likes of Stoke, Hull, Fulham,
              Wigan, and West Ham have that the Spaniards do not? Or perhaps it
              is not what those sides possess, but what Liverpool lack.</p>
              <p>Against Real, you would have to say they lacked very little. But
              as winger Ryan Babel admitted, something has been missing. "We
              played superbly, but winning any game is possible," he said.</p>
              <p>"A season is long, and that's why teams make mistakes.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">NEMANJA VIDIC claims Manchester United will crank up their performance against Liverpool this weekend.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Serbian powerhouse was a key man against Inter last night, opening the scoring in a 2-0 win at Old Trafford. And with attention now turning to the Premier League showdown with Rafa Benitez' men, Vidic claims the best is yet to come.</p>
              <p class="article">He said:"We need to forget Inter now. "Liverpool is the next big game we must play, and they are in good form, full of confidence. "They had a great win against Madrid but we're at home in front of our crowd, and I think, I hope we are going to be much better than we were against Inter. "We will definitely try to improve, to erase the mistakes we made and play better against Liverpool."</p>
              <p class="article">Rafa Benitez's side are seven points behind the Red Devils and have played a game more than their rivals. Defeat on Saturday would almost certainly spell the end of their title challenge for another season, but Vidic is not thinking that far ahead.</p>

              <p><br>Well, if United win they will move away from Pool (They are now equal on points for that 2nd spot)... If Pool win, United's lead would get smaller... The Premier league is still not over where Chelsea is concern, they still stand a chance no matter how slim it may be.</p>
              <p>So either of the 2 teams that are closest to them dropping points, they will benefit from it... Rather than both teams playing other opponents and winning... Here one is going to drop points for sure...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">WAYNE ROONEY says he hates Liverpool. That is why the former Everton striker is licking his lips at the prospect of finishing off the Reds’ title challenge. </h2>
              <p class="article">The Kop boys go to Old Trafford tomorrow seven points behind leaders Manchester United, having played a game more. Rooney, who left Goodison Park in August 2004, said: “I’m very excited about the match. “I grew up an Everton fan, my whole family are Everton fans and I grew up hating Liverpool. And that hasn’t changed.” </p>
              <p class="article">That is why Rooney says he would like nothing better than to put them to the sword and take United another step towards an incredible haul of five trophies in a season. </p>
              <p class="article">Rooney, 23, said: “Liverpool have been brilliant and put up a good challenge, but it will be great if on Saturday we can finally finish that challenge off. "For me, it is our biggest game of the season. If we can beat Liverpool it will almost certainly put them out of the title race. </p>
              <p class="article">“For everyone at United, especially myself, that would be a great feeling.” It is always a massive fixture but more so with the destiny of the Premier League crown still just in the balance. </p>
              <p class="article">So Rooney is expecting a red-hot occasion. He said: “They are always anxious games against them and I am sure it will be frantic with a lot of challenges. “It’s a massive fixture for both clubs with what’s at stake.” </p>
              <p class="article">Both sides go into the lunchtime encounter on the back of morale-boosting Champions League triumphs. United beat Inter Milan 2-0 to go through to the last eight by the same score on aggregate. </p>
              <p class="article">And Liverpool thrashed Real Madrid in the performance of the week in the competition with a 4-0 win at Anfield to go through 5-0 over the two legs. Rooney said: “I thought Liverpool played really well against Real Madrid. </p>
              <p class="article">“They attacked with a lot of speed, they were aggressive and put Real under a lot of pressure.” But United are the reigning European kings, lifted the Club World Cup in December and are aiming for their 11th Premier League success. And, if they achieve that, the Old Trafford men will draw level with Liverpool’s record of 18 top-flight championship titles. </p>
              <p class="article">Credit to manager Alex Ferguson after it appeared Chelsea were embarking on their own decade of dominance when they bagged Prem glory for the first time in 2005. </p>
              <p class="article">Rooney said: “It would be a great achievement for us to win the league a third year running, especially after Roman Abramovich came into Chelsea and they won it two seasons running. </p>
              <p class="article">“At that point it was hard to see anyone else winning it but we have shown again we are a quality team.” They certainly showed that against Serie A champions and leaders Inter, claiming victory at home without even playing at their best. </p>
              <p class="article">Rooney, who has 92 goals in 221 appearances, said: “It was always going to be a difficult game but I thought we created good opportunities and we took our chances. In the away game, we showed a lot of maturity. </p>
              <p class="article">“In fact I think it was our best away performance in the Champions League since I’ve been here. As a team we are more confident going into games like these after winning it last year. Results like this make us more confident that we can win it again. </p>
              <p class="article">“We are still in for all the trophies. We know it’s going to be difficult but we know it is all there for us. “We can still get better this season, we can score more goals. Chelsea used to win games 1-0 and if they got a goal they didn’t look like conceding. “It’s the same with ourselves now. With our defence we are confident we can hold on to the lead. “But we have been working hard in training on taking more chances and we have done better at that.” </p>
              <p class="article">Inter midfielder Patrick Vieira, 32, is convinced he has just faced this season’s European champions. The ex-Arsenal star said: “They have shown they have what it takes to win it again. “They have underlined how strong their hunger is for more success. In fact, they have what it takes to win every competition. </p>
              <p class="article">"I’ve been watching some of their league games on television and they have been winning game after game and that is not easy to do in the English game. </p>
              <p class="article">“In the last two seasons they have been difficult to catch.” Vieira believes it is the Fergie factor that keeps them at the top. The Frenchman added: “Somebody has to drive the team every day, every week, every year and he is the main man at the club, the one who gives the club the winning spirit. “He’s been there for so long and has won every thing there is to win. Yet year after year he keeps winning games . . . and wanting to win more.”</p>

              <div><span><strong>Liverpool midfielder Javier Mascherano is determined to keep his cool when he returns to face Manchester United at Old Trafford for the first time since blowing his top last season.</strong> </span></div>
              <div id="articlebody">
              <p>Just less than 12 months ago, the Argentina captain was sent off a minute before half-time for a second bookable offence when referee Steve Bennett cautioned him for dissent.</p>
              <p>The 24-year-old exploded in rage at what he felt was an injustice and had to be escorted from the field by team-mates. He was subsequently charged with improper conduct by the Football Association and received a two-match suspension in addition to his statutory one-game ban.</p>
              <p>Liverpool, trailing 1-0 at the time, went on to concede a further two goals, but Mascherano insists he has learned his lesson and history will not repeat itself in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>"It was really difficult for me but I am sure that situation will not happen again," said the Argentinian, who believes victory at Old Trafford would give Liverpool a chance of pipping United to the Barclays Premier League title.</strong></p>
              <p>"We are in the title race and we need to think about winning there and then see what happens. "First you have to win. The most important thing for us is to try to win and give the supporters a happy day."</p>
              <p>Third-placed Liverpool, who trail leaders United by seven points having played one match more, go into the crunch clash against their arch-rivals boosted by a resounding victory over Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>Rafael Benitez's side demolished the nine-time European champions 4-0 at Anfield on Tuesday with two goals from Steven Gerrard and one apiece from a sharp-looking Fernando Torres and substitute Andrea Dossena.</p>
              <p>The tactics Benitez employed and the manner of victory surprised many but Mascherano feels the players have to use that to inspire them against United.</p>
              <p>"From the beginning we were on top of Madrid and we didn't allow them to play," he said. "We are happy after that result. We know it will be really difficult to play United but we have to try to play in the same way we played on Tuesday. "We played very well [against Real]. Fernando Torres was unbelievable and hopefully on Saturday he can be the same.</p>
              <p>"If we play like that in all the games, it will be difficult for any team to beat us." Mascherano believes the club's form in Europe - they have not lost in 10 matches (including qualifiers) this season - has lifted everyone's confidence.</p>
              <p>Victory over Real saw Liverpool progress to the quarter-finals of the Champions League for the fourth time in the last five years, having won the competition in 2005 and finished runners-up in 2007.</p>
              <p>"In the last two or three years we have been playing against top sides and we have proved we can beat them," he said. "We are in the quarter-finals so the teams are really good but we know, if we play like we did against Madrid, we can beat anyone."</p>

              <p class="storyTitle" style="margin-top: 0px; font-size: 2.8em; margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p>Rafael Benitez's side are again proving a force to be reckoned with in the Champions League, going from strength to strength, as proven by their 4-0 demolition of Real Madrid on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>In the Premier League, however, Liverpool have recently endured one of their customary falls from grace that has left them facing a game they cannot afford to lose tomorrow at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Defeat in the early afternoon kick-off will almost certainly wreck their title chances as they will be 10 points off the pace, having played a game more than United, and with just nine matches remaining.</p>
              <p>Despite Liverpool's hot-and-cold nature at times when it comes to playing at home and abroad, United skipper Giggs is fully expecting Liverpool to be firing on all cylinders.</p>
              <p>"They've proven again this season they are a top European side, something they've managed to do over the last four or five years,'' assessed Giggs. "But this year I feel they've improved, they've got good players, and so we're not going to be complacent. We know we will need to play well to win.</p>
              <p>"If we do then it will obviously make it difficult for them to win the title. The games might be running out and the momentum is with us, but we still have to go out and win.</p>
              <p>"I'm sure after their great result and performance the other night they'll be looking forward to the game as much as we are.</p>
              <p>"No matter what is riding on the outcome, United v Liverpool is one of the games of the season, and as they're our closest rivals right now, along with Chelsea, it makes it a massive game.''</p>
              <p>United striker and former Evertonian <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=21046"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Wayne Rooney</span></span></a> has stoked the fires ahead of the game by claiming a United win will spell the end of Liverpool's title hopes.</p>
              <p>With United unbeaten in their last 16 Premier League matches, on a winning streak of 11 and having dropped just two points at home all season, Liverpool seemingly face a mountainous task.</p>
              <p>Summing up the situation, Rooney said: "They know in coming to Old Trafford it's going to be a difficult game for them. They also know they need the three points, and I'm sure they'll be up for it - we certainly will be.</p>
              <p>"But I think if we beat them it will probably end their chances of winning the league.''</p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7825"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rio Ferdinand</span></span></a>, meanwhile, was not quite so outspoken as the centre-back appreciates the season does not end tomorrow.</p>
              <p>"Could it end their title chances? Possibly, but we still have games after that to win,'' stated Ferdinand. "People say 'If you win this game, you win the league', but it just continues until it's mathematically over and one team wins it, and hopefully that will be us.</p>
              <p>"If we win it will obviously make it hard for them, but I couldn't care what happens to Liverpool as long as we beat them. If we do that and that leads to people thinking they're out of it, then so be it.</p>
              <p>"We're there to win games, we're at home and people will be expecting us to get the three points. Fingers crossed we can go out there, do a good job and give a good account of ourselves.''</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/rafael-benitez"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Rafael Benítez</strong></span></a><strong> has insisted he does not regret the outburst against </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/sir-alex-ferguson"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson</strong></span></a><strong> that led </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong>'s manager to hold him up to ridicule ahead of </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong>'s visit to Old Trafford today. The infamous list of "facts" that Benítez produced on 9 January coincided with Liverpool's title challenge starting to fall apart and Ferguson could not resist the opportunity to poke fun at his rival last night. "I would need to read more of Freud before I could understand what he was talking about," he said.</strong></p>
              <p>In his wide-ranging attack Benítez had alleged that Ferguson was allowed to operate above the law by the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span></a> and the Football Association. He also accused United's manager of intimidating match officials, damaging the FA's Respect campaign and being "scared" of Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said he could not comprehend why Benítez was such "an angry man" and "talking with venom" and he insisted that, if it was intended as psychological warfare, it had failed. "I don't know where it came from and I'm not really interested," he said. "It never bothered me then and it doesn't bother me now. If we beat them it doesn't involve psychology."</p>
              <p>It has certainly backfired on Benítez given that his team have taken only 13 points from their eight league games since he revealed his grievances. Until that point, they had been top of the league, with realistic aspirations of winning their first league title since 1990. United's record since then, however, has been immaculate, with 10 wins in a row to turn a seven-point deficit into a seven-point lead, with a game in hand.</p>
              <p>Rio Ferdinand, the United defender, has accused Benítez of "falling into the trap" but the Spaniard is adamant he did not make an error in judgment. "I was just talking about the facts," he said. "I don't expect a bad situation [with Ferguson]. We will shake hands. There is still respect between us. I was not giving an opinion. These were facts and everyone can judge whether they are true or not."</p>
              <p>Benítez also denied that the criticisms were poorly timed, having carefully planned what to say with the intention of putting pressure on United before they played Chelsea and Liverpool went to Stoke City. United won 3-0 whereas Liverpool drew 0-0 but Benítez was in a defiant mood when it was put to him that it had been a turning point in the title race.</p>
              <p>"If [Steven] Gerrard had scored and not hit the post in the last minute against Stoke the situation could be different but the facts would be the same," he said. "Maybe I should improve my English [if Ferguson doesn't understand]. My English is not the best, it can improve, but I put the facts across rightly. I'm sure he could understand clearly."</p>
              <p>Of Ferguson, he added: "I haven't spoken to him since. I have a lot of respect for him. He is a great manager at a big club, that is clear, but I have to defend my club. What I said was clear – facts are facts.</p>
              <p>"I have read about the strength of the United squad. That, for me, is the main difference. We were in a better position before but we couldn't be consistent. It is a pity, but we will fight until the end of the season and we will try to be more consistent if we are in the same position next year. The difference between the sides is £100m, a bigger stadium, lots of things. We have to do everything almost perfectly if we want to reduce the difference."</p>
              <p>The damage to the managers' relationship is almost certainly irreparable and Ferguson mischievously noted Benítez never celebrated his team scoring a goal. "My instinct is to celebrate because I'm a football man and that is what football supporters do," he said. "I'm a football man." Ferguson was also reminded that United fans would subject Benítez to chants of "cracking up" but on this he was more sympathetic. "People said I was cracking up three years ago, if I remember correctly People said my shelf-life had gone."</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool capped off a wonderful week and left the door ajar on the
              Premier League title with a 4-1 mauling of Manchester United that draws
              them to within four points of their hosts. </strong></p>
              <p>It is a result that certainly does not lose United their third
              successive Premier League crown, but one that gives both their
              conquerors on Saturday lunchtime and Chelsea more than a sniff of
              catching them.</p>
