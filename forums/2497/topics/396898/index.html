              <h1>Chelsea's £150m wage bill has bought them success: Arsene Wenger 
              says Blues spending is out of control<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Just when Chelsea looked to be marching unhindered to their third 
              title in six years, along come Tottenham to remind us, on a day of high 
              drama at White Hart Lane and Old Trafford, of football’s capacity for 
              the gloriously unpredictable.</p>
              <p>And few will have enjoyed it 
              more than Arsene Wenger as he prepares his Arsenal  ide for their match 
              at Wigan Athletic today, suddenly handed a championship lifeline by the<br>north
               London rivals he was cursing, rather than thanking, just a few nights 
              earlier following their own derby defeat.</p>
              <p>His pleasure will 
              be all the sweeter as he remains a firm opponent of the kind of spending
               that has taken Chelsea to the top of the table.</p>
              <p>In fact, 
              Wenger thinks Chelsea should be stopped from what he sees as buying 
              titles.</p>
              <p>The Stamford Bridge club’s newly released accounts 
              reveal that they spent a staggering £142.6million on players salaries 
              last year, the highest sum in English football history. </p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/17/article-0-092323E7000005DC-6_468x286.jpg" alt="Arsene Wenger " width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Out of reach: Wenger says Chelsea spending is 
              exorbitant</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>It is over £20m more than Manchester United’s playing budget and £40m
               more than Arsenal’s. ‘What is not normal is not our wages bill, but 
              their wages bill,’ said Wenger, who resents Chelsea being able to 
              continue to splash out more than his club — and United — despite not 
              bringing in the same revenue.</p>
              <p>‘That should not be allowed.’ 
              Indeed, the Arsenal manager believes the game’s  governing bodies should
               legislate to prevent Chelsea spending the record sums on wages that 
              could carry them to the Premier League and FA Cup Double.</p>
              <p>Chelsea
               and their fans will be shocked by Wenger’s comments. After all the big 
              spending in the early years of Roman Abramovich’s ownership, the club 
              have been positively frugal by comparison this season as the Russian 
              seeks to rein in the spending.</p>
              <p>Only Yuri Zhirkov and Daniel 
              Sturridge arrived this season, at a cost of £23m — just £4m more than 
              United paid for Antonio Valencia and Gabriel Obertan and which does not 
              begin to compare with the £80m Real Madrid forked out for Cristiano 
              Ronaldo alone. </p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/17/article-0-092D7D1F000005DC-923_468x324.jpg" alt="Yuri Zhirkov of Chelsea challenges Jermain Defoe of Tottenham

              </div>
              <p>But the belief that English football at the top level is impoverished
               as a result of the recession is undermined, not just by Manchester 
              City’s spending power but also by Chelsea’s wage bill.</p>
              <p>Wenger’s
               attack on Chelsea and lament for the financial imbalance may have 
              something to do with his frustration at his perception, before 
              yesterday’s new (slim) hope, that his side had fallen short in a trophy 
              campaign for a fifth season in a row. It also had much to do with his 
              chagrin at the authorities failing to act quickly to prevent<br>what he 
              sees as unfair spending.</p>
              <p>New UEFA rules have been drawn up 
              aimed at preventing clubs accumulating debt while still spending 
              heavily, which is why Abramovich converted many of his loans to Chelsea 
              into equity and also one reason why Liverpool’s indebted co-owners, 
              George Gillett and Tom Hicks, are seeking a new buyer.</p>
              <p>Recently,
               however, the big clubs of Europe persuaded the governing body to delay 
              implementing the rules from 2012 to 2015. Wenger turned 60 this season. 
              Time is slipping away for him.</p>
              <p>Dredging up defiance after 
              recent setbacks, he insists, however, that his club can<br>compete on 
              the field with Chelsea and big-spenders United, despite having lost 
              twice to both this season, and even surpass them next season.</p>
              <p>‘We
               cannot compete for wages but I believe we can realistically compete on 
              the pitch,’ he added. ‘I’m convinced of that. As well, we can overcome 
              them. We were for a while not investing, maybe because we were building 
              the stadium. But I think now our financial situation is much stronger 
              and that we will be capable of buying the players we need to buy.</p>
              <p>‘Not
               all the top players can go to Chelsea. There are top players Chelsea 
              don’t want to<br>buy who are still good enough for us.’</p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/17/article-0-092DBDB6000005DC-520_233x339.jpg" alt="Marouane Chamakh" width="233" height="339">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>New arrival: Chamakh</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Bordeaux striker Marouane Chamakh will be the first Arsenal signing 
              of the summer,<br>with Wenger admitting that he needs to buy.</p>
              <p>However,
               he rebuts criticism from former England manager Glenn Hoddle, a Wenger<br>devotee,
               that Arsenal are developing a reputation for being forever a team for 
              the future.</p>
              <p>Wenger also cites injuries as a crucial factor in
               his team’s capitulation to Barcelona and Tottenham over the past 
              fortnight.</p>
              <p>‘We have played the last 10 years in the Champions
               League so I don’t call that teams  for the future,’ he said. ‘If you go
               into the final sprint of the season without four or five of your best 
              players, you are going to struggle. If you take Messi and Xavi out of 
              Barcelona when they go into March, I would like to see how they do.’</p>
              <p>Wenger
               does concede that next season will be ‘a decisive year’ for his team, 
              although he says that even another campaign without silverware would not
               spell disaster for the club.</p>
              <p>‘This club have never been in a
               stronger situation,’ he added. ‘The club have a new stadium, fantastic 
              training facilities, are in a strong financial situation and have a very
               young team who are playing at the top. What can happen to the club?’</p>
              <p>But
               it could also be a decisive year for Wenger, with both Stan Kroenke and
               Alisher Usmanov pondering a full takeover.</p>
              <p>‘I am like 
              everybody. I act every day like I will stay my whole life here knowing 
              that it<br>can stop as well,’ he said. ‘It will be the final year of my 
              contract. I will give the maximum I can for this club because, first of 
              all, it’s my nature and I want to do well for the club.</p>
              <p>‘After,
               I don’t think the future of this club is linked with me. All the 
              ingredients are here to be very successful and we will be.’</p>
              <p>There
               is in Wenger’s voice a wistfulness that suggests weariness, however, 
              despite all the positive talk he delivers.</p>
              <p>More twists like 
              yesterday and a summer of refreshment might help, but with the 
              authorities, especially the market-driven Premier League, unlikely to 
              heed his plea for<br>financial regulation, could it be that the 
              Frenchman is preparing to give up the unequal struggle of seeking to mix
               it with the money men he so resents?</p>

              <p>not really possible in football imho, NBA is the best basketball league and even when cap the best would still wanna ply their trade against the very best basketball can offer, but in football its alot more difficult as players will have other league to go to and that'll cause the standard of BPL to drop and if you keep the cap higher to attract the better players then its no different from what it is currently</p>

              <p>not really possible in football imho, NBA is the best basketball
              league and even when cap the best would still wanna ply their trade
              against the very best basketball can offer, but in football its
              alot more difficult as players will have other league to go to and
              that'll cause the standard of BPL to drop and if you keep the cap
              higher to attract the better players then its no different from
              what it is currently</p>

              <p>hmm. true in some aspects. NBA is the best, but also the highest playing. Similiarily, La Liga is attracting talents but also due to the tax break, whereas in EPL, there is no tax break.</p>
              <p>if U don't have talents in EPL, people won't watch, the standards won't improve, but then Ur locals may not get chances in terms of playing,so English national team, even coaches, suffers.Seems all are related. so a chicken, egg thingy.</p>

              <p>without money arsenal wont be where they are too.</p>
              <p>clubs get relegated because they have no money to attract the

              <p>the fact chelsea spent more than arsenal dont make arsenal
              better.  unless arsenal can win without spending.</p>
              <p>but then which club can win without spending?</p>

              <p>true, but i think the key here is the obscene money the rich owners are coming in with, and making it a money game.</p>
              <p>Gunners were forced to develop from youth rather than buy established, battle-hardened stars and hence their consistency took a hit whenever their key players injured/suspended. whereas for rich teams, they can slot readily available top players in. hence the disparity.</p>
              <p>of course, for gunners, they were shouldering the stadium debts, and hence the prudence. but it seems they are going to flex their muscles in the transfer market soon.</p>
