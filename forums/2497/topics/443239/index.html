              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">NICOLAS ANELKA has agreed a £20million contract with Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua.</h2>
              <p>The 32-year-old Chelsea striker has <strong>TREBLED</strong> his wages after rejecting offers from Spurs, AC Milan and three American clubs.</p>
              <p>Anelka has been banished from Andre Villas-Boas' first-team squad after handing in a transfer request.</p>
              <p>But that is the least of his worries after agreeing a two-year contract with the Chinese Super League club worth £200,000-a-week.</p>
              <p>Shanghai will be the ninth different club of Anelka's career.</p>
              <p>His departure will leave the Blues with a striking shortage next month, particularly with Didier Drogba and Salomon Kalou heading for the African Nations Cup.</p>
              <p>Villas-Boas said: "We still have Fernando Torres, Daniel Sturridge and Romelu Lukaku so that's enough."</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Looks like it cos he has already been banished from the first team and left 6 months on his contract. From Chelsea's point of view, no point keeping a player who is no longer playing and just waiting to leave. Might as well let him go earlier by 6 months and can still save on his salary and used it to pay another new signing as well as relief a place from their allowed squad of 25 registered. If require a fee, I don't think he will be getting so much for a coming to 33 yrs old player...</p></div>

              <p>I think they can pay for such amount for one or two star player names but not collectively over a squad... The star name is, apart from quality, it's also to promote their club name which is usually an unknown brand. Also, a player in his prime probably won't go to china even if it's $200k a week. Normally it's those who are in their twilight of their careers wanting a last big money move and Europe won't pay such fee to them anymore kind...</p>
              <p>But having said this, if it works out... I guess it suits everybody...</p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>A Chelsea statement read: 'Chelsea Football Club and Chinese side Shanghai Shenhua have agreed terms for the permanent transfer of Nicolas Anelka in the January transfer window.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The Chinese Super League club have confirmed that Anelka will join them on a two-year deal in January that is understood to be worth £175,000 per week. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The dream is now to partner the Frenchman with the Drogba. With the financial muscle of businessman Zhou Jun behind them - he made his fortune from an internet company which held the China licence for the hugely popular World of Warcraft fantasy game - Shenhua have shown they can compete with anyone. And Zhou says there is more to come.              </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'(Didier) Drogba, is a very excellent player. From the perspective of Chinese football, if these big-name players, these excellent players, are willing to come to China, we are willing to have warm negotiations and communications with them,' Zhou said.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'A lot of clubs are chasing Drogba. From our perspective... we also have to see what Drogba wants. So from our club's perspective, we have this to say - If he is willing to come, we will definitely welcome him.'       </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>There is already another lucrative offer on the table from China for the Ivory Coast striker. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Drogba, whose contract at Stamford Bridge runs out at the end of the season, has been offered a three-year deal worth more than £30million - £200,000 a week - by Dalian Aerbin.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Aerbin's general manager Li Ming said he was waiting for a response on the offer, adding: 'Money is not the problem.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'Drogba is still one of the most popular soccer stars in the world, though he will be 34 years old. We have talked a lot with Drogba's agent and promised to provide him with a three-year contract.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Aerbin were only formed in 2009 and have just been promoted to China's top division. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Chelsea are reluctant to offer Drogba more than a year extension as he will turn 34 in March. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Russian big-spenders Anzhi Makhachkala are among other clubs who see him as an ideal high-profile signing. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Aerbin are considering an offer for former France striker David Trezeguet as an alternative if Drogba turns them down. </span></p>

              </p><p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Shenhua have confirmed they are also interested in Drogba but have not revealed details of their offer as they revel in the signing of Anelka. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Club director Zhou told reporters near the club's Pudong training ground: 'People are aware of Anelka's Chelsea yearly salary which is around 5.8 million euros. So when he comes to China it definitely won't be below this figure.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The signing of Anelka heralds a massive step for Chinese soccer - and a growth mirroring that of the nation itself.           </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'It's like with the opening up of China,' Zhou said. 'We needed to bring in the good stuff from foreign countries for us to learn from.        </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'The benefits Anelka brings to the club are obvious. Firstly it will definitely increase the squad's attacking capability.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'Secondly, the arrival of such a high level football star like Anelka in a young club like Shenhua will increase the hopes of the young people and create an example for them to follow.         </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'It will definitely increase the club's competitiveness.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The club's captain Yu Tao said on Twitter: 'It is impossible not to be excited! Warm welcome to our new team-mate!' </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Goalkeeper Wang Dalei added: 'Tell Anelka he made his new team-mates  really proud!' </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Shenhua have a reputation for signing ageing stars, having previously welcomed Ruben Sosa, Jorg Albertz, Carsten Jancker, Junior Baiano and Dejan Petkovic. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Shanghai spokesman Ma Yue did not reveal the fee but said Anelka could start playing in January 'if all contract details are 100 per cent confirmed'. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>West Ham had hoped to take the 32-year-old Anelka on loan for the rest of the season but could not match the financial muscle of the ambitious Chinese side, so the Chelsea striker is heading east in the January transfer window. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>AC Milan and Tottenham had also enquired about Anelka, while three Major League Soccer teams - New York Red Bulls, Philadelphia Union and Montreal Impact - were also disappointed.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The rise of the Chinese league was underlined earlier this year when Guangzhou Evergrande signed Dario Conca from Brazilian side Fluminense on a huge contract. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Argentine forward Conca, who is little known outside of South America, signed a deal worth about £130,000 a week. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Villas-Boas is set to cull even more big names from his squad in January, with Salomon Kalou looking likely to leave.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Full-backs Jose Bosingwa and Paulo Ferreira are also available for transfer, while uncertainty now surrounds Frank Lampard, who is no longer first-choice in the team. </span></p>
