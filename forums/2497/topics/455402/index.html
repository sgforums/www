              <p><span><strong>Fabio Borini is set to become Brendan Rodgers' first signing, as the Liverpool manager challenges Andy Carroll to show he can be part of the new Anfield regime. <br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Having worked with the Italy striker at Chelsea and Swansea, Borini has been on Rodgers' wanted list for some time, and Liverpool have held lengthy discussions with his current club Roma over a deal that could be worth £10million. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Borini was co-owned by Roma and Parma last season, but Roma concluded their own £3.95m deal to take full ownership of his contract last month, which has made Liverpool's negotiations for the 21-year-old go more smoothly. </span></p>
              <p><span>It is, however, a surprise that Borini is set to move to Anfield as he said last month that he was 'a Roma player' and 'it's not my business that there is talk about whether I go there (to Liverpool) or stay.' <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Rodgers wants to bring in 'three or four' additions, but aims to do that 'without throwing wheelbarrows full of money at it'. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>He is also confident of getting improvement out of the Liverpool players he inherited, Carroll included. </span></p>

              <p><span><strong>The England forward has endured a turbulent 18 months since his £35million move to Anfield from Newcastle and it had been assumed that Carroll - who is being linked with a loan switch to AC Milan - will struggle to adapt to the intricate system Rodgers favours.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Though Rodgers has not handed Carroll any assurances about where he will fit into the team, he is prepared to give him the necessary chances. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>'Andy is a player I want to assess and speak with,' said Rodgers, who received confirmation yesterday that Luis Suarez and Sebastian Coates will represent Uruguay in the Olympics.  </span></p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers is ready to bid £7.5 million for Fulham's American star Clint Dempsey in his first major transfer raid. </strong></p>
              <p>Rodgers wants to snap up Dempsey quickly and tie up a deal before the Kop fly to the shooting star's homeland next week.</p>
              <p>Dempsey had a sensational season for Fulham but may have to be sold as his deal is running down and he fancies a 'glamour' move at this stage of his career - with the Anfield club prepared to pay.</p>
              <p>Rodgers wants a couple of new faces and has the funds to land Dempsey - with Fulham willing to sell and also open to a possible exchange deal involving one of Liverpool's fringe men.</p>
              <p>Sources close to the Dempsey camp claim a deal may be pushed through as soon as Wednesday.</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool have agreed a £12million fee to make <span style="color: #000000;">Fabio Borini</span> the first signing of new boss Brendan Rodgers' Anfield revolution.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="body ">
              <div>The Italian arrived on Merseyside on Friday morning and is expected to have a medical at noon, after the deal was sealed when the English club offered Roma a swift profit on their investment in the young striker.</div>
              <div>.</div>
              <p>It is something of a coup for the Reds and their new manager, with Borini considered the rising star of Italian football, after a fine first season in Serie A concluded with his inclusion in the national squad for Euro 2012.</p>
              <p>Rodgers knows the 21 year old well, after first coaching him in the Chelsea youth team, and then taking him on loan at Swansea - where he had a dramatic impact by helping the Welsh club to get promoted to the Premier League.</p>
              <p>Borini was regarded as a rich prospect by Chelsea who signed him from Bologna as a 16-year-old, but they lost him to Parma last summer, when he exercised his right to move after reaching the end of his contract.</p>
              <p>But before even kicking a ball in anger for Parma he was loaned out to Roma, who then bought a half stake in the striker after he impressed in the early part of the season.</p>
              <p>Borini produced a strike rate of one goal in two games to win his first Italy cap and secure his place in the squad for Euro 2012.</p>
              <p>Rodgers feared his move for the young forward would be scuppered by the complications of joint ownership, but Roma removed that hurdle by buying out Parma, to take their investment in the player to close on £6million.</p>
              <p>Now the Reds have agreed to double that fee to ensure Rodgers gets the striker he wants to get his Anfield revolution off to a flying start.</p>
              <p>The arrival of Borini could signal the end of Andy Carroll's Liverpool career, with the big striker likely to be loaned out to AC Milan, though West Ham have also expressed an interest in the centre forward.</p>

              <p>Now Borini, 21, is already planning to cut down defences and treat Kop fans to his unique goal celebration.</p>
              <p>He revealed: “My goal celebration is a knife between the teeth. In Italy it means a warrior or someone who never gives up.</p>
              <p>“At Swansea and Roma the fans liked it, so I hope to show it to Liverpool fans as well.”</p>
              <p>Borini, who had a shock call-up to Italy’s Euro 2012 squad, has worked with Rodgers during his days as a Chelsea youth star, as well as hitting six goals on loan at Swansea to them into the top flight.</p>
              <p>Rodgers reckons his first signing will prove an instant terrace hit.</p>
              <p>He said: “I think the supporters will love him.</p>
              <p>“He’s a goalscorer, but also a multi-functional player who can play in a number of positions. He’ll do well at Liverpool.”</p>

              <p>he is up and coming young coach, but he is not a winner, not yet.</p>
              <p>I have said many times, liverpool appointment has been disastrous since 1991, when Kenny Daglish resigned. sure Houllier and Rafa won UEFA and CL, but the holy grail of the EPL title remains a pipe dream.</p>
              <p>I am wondering what the owner and board was thinking when they appoint Rodgers to be the manager? do they seriously think Rodgers will win the EPL title? EPL title is a long way from winning, think about qualifying for CL first for a start.</p>

              <p>keny daglish buys are also no better, except for suarez who is a qualified success. No way the ponytail is worth 35m, the most he is worth is 15m, plus the 3 british buys, all failures and waste of money.</p>
