              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1297855" rel="1297855|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1297855/New-25-man-Premier-League-squad-rule-big-earners-sitting-out.html"></a> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>We've had squad rotation. But this will be the season when for some Premier League players the game comes grinding to a halt.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">They will still be collecting pay packets of £40,000, £50,000, or even more every week, but they will spend match day sat suited in the stand. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">That's the bizarre effect of the League's new 25-man squad rule as it starts to bite at the clubs who have thrown fortunes at players.</span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="artSplitter"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp said on Monday former England defender Jonathan Woodgate won't get a place in his plans for the season, and that showed up a problem haunting all the major clubs. </span></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Big names like Owen Hargreaves at Manchester United and Fulham's record £10.5million signing Andy Johnson could have their comebacks from injury put on ice until January because their clubs won't waste a squad space on anybody who is not fit.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Free-spending Manchester City, with 33 senior players and plans to buy more, might have no space for the likes of Craig Bellamy and Roque Santa Cruz.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">On Monday night one Premier League manager warned: 'For years the top boys have been able to keep lots of players happy by giving them big money and keep changing the team. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'But what's it going to do to morale behind the scenes when suddenly two or three are told they have no chance of even lacing a pair of boots up on match day?' </span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="artSplitter"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The new rule says each club will have to name their 25-man squad by September 1 - the day after the summer transfer window shuts. </span></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Eight have to be 'home grown', meaning they must have spent at least three years training with an English or Welsh professional club before they reached the age of 21. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/26/article-1297855-089A1B29000005DC-281_306x423.jpg" alt="Tough decisions: Spurs boss Harry Redknapp admits some key stars could miss his squad" width="306" height="423"> </span></div>
              <div class="floatRHS"><span>Tough decisions: Spurs boss Harry Redknapp admits some key stars could miss his squad</span></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>After that the only players not on that list who can play will be any under the age of 21 on January 1, 2010.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The system was agreed by all the club chairmen last September but it seems managers are only now realising the consequences. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Redknapp said of Woodgate, once hailed by Sir Bobby Robson as 'the best defender in the country': </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I couldn't put him in my 25. You can't have somebody in who's never going to play, if he's not going to be fit. He's got to prove that between now and the start of the season and he's a long way off.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">So Woodgate may have played his last Premier League game for the club. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The rule represents a major change for the League. Last season Portsmouth used 33 players, while the average top-flight club used 27, picking 12 English players and seven under the age of 21. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The new rule aims to make room for younger home-grown talent to come through and prevent the biggest clubs stockpiling talent. If they buy a player, somebody else will have to be shown the door. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But players who have years to run on contracts worth massive money won't give up millions of pounds to play for other clubs, so big clubs might have to send them on loan while paying most of their wages. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">However, Redknapp said: 'I think if young players are good enough they'll come through (anyway). You get some kids who will get in the 25 and don't work on their game. You've got to deserve to be there, rather than just having them for the sake of it, token players.'</span></p>

              <div>
              <div>
              <p> Under new rules introduced this season, on September 1 Premier League clubs must name a squad of 25 players to represent the club until January. Eight of those players must have spent at least three years at an English or Welsh club before the age of 21, but an unlimited number of additional players aged under 21 on January 1 can be used.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>The rule is already causing problems for neighbours Manchester City, who will have to sell a number of players or consider leaving them on the sidelines, ineligible for first-team action in the first half of the season.</p>
              <p>Ferguson does not want to use up squad places unnecessarily and Hargreaves, who has suffered a setback in his lengthy recovery from double knee surgery, could be sacrificed. Anderson is also recovering from a serious knee injury and although he is expected to return to training at the end of September, the Brazilian may also miss out.</p>
              <p>"It does give me a problem, but I have just got to wait as long as I can," Ferguson said. "I have to make a decision at some point of course and it depends on when I think those players can come back. Most of it (the squad) is formulated in my mind, but one or two I have to make decisions on."</p>
              <p>"It is an issue for us at the moment," Ferguson said. "What we do not want to do is accelerate the injuries. We may have to leave them out of this difficult game. Other than that it will be a good challenge for us. Hopefully we get the result we want.</p>
              <p>"It is the penultimate game of the tour and the biggest one. We appreciate the record the MLS has against the English sides - they are undefeated in these games."</p>
