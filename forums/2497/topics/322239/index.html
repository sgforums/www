              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>EMMANUEL ADEBAYOR is demanding a new £120,000-a-week Arsenal deal.</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The Togo striker is ready to snub a £30million move to Barcelona or AC Milan but wants the Gunners to <strong>QUADRUPLE</strong> his wages. That would make Adebayor, 24, Arsenal’s highest earner.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Barca and Milan are willing to match his salary demands if he requests a transfer. Emirates boss Arsene Wenger is adamant Adebayor is staying put. Adebayor only agreed a two-year extension to his current £30,000-a-week deal last season.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Italian agent Vincenzo Morabito insisted last night a deal with Milan was ‘70-80 per cent’ likely. But he said Arsenal would not sell until they find a replacement — with rumours surrounding Peter Crouch, Roque Santa Cruz and Germany forward Michael Gomez.</p>

              <h2>ADEBAYOR IN MILAN U-TURN</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00518/ade_682x400_518614a.jpg" alt="" width="682" height="400"></div>
              <p><br></p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Conflicting messages are coming out of Arsenal after striker Emmanuel Adebayor pledged his long-term future to the club at midday, before just over an hour later, in an interview with <em>Sky Sports News</em>, conceding he could still sign for Milan.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The assembled press must have thought Adebayor was set for a stay at Emirates Stadium after his press conference, but when quizzed later on whether there was any chance of a move to Milan he replied: "Nothing has been decided yet. We will decide next week."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Togo international Adebayor has been the subject of fevered speculation all summer, with Milan having declared their interest in bringing him to Italy. Arsenal have remained tight-lipped on the player's future but now Adebayor has come out to comment on his situation in north London; albeit with sentiments that will likely confuse all parties.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On Thursday, super agent Vincenzo Morabito stated that the forward was '80 per cent certain' of joining Milan but this prediction appeared to be somewhat ill-founded, at least when Adebayor spoke at a press conference. He said: "I have three more years with Arsenal, I have a good team there, I have a good contract.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The most important thing is to keep enjoying myself. Of course (I am staying) I have three more years. "You can see people changing clubs because of money, because they want a change of atmosphere or to get their names in the big leagues. I just play football to enjoy myself. I play because I love it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We all have the same ideas and we all want to achieve something. We have a good boss which is Arsene Wenger, he tries to bring this atmosphere to the dressing room where we feel like brothers and like family.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Those are the reasons that give us a chance to play the football we play. We play good football, now we look forward to winning trophies." Adebayor's comments would likely have been well received in the capital but later, in a one-on-one interview with <em>Sky Sports</em>, the player was considerably more ambiguous with regards his future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I am a footballer, I have a three-year contract at Arsenal but as you know, a lot of clubs are interested in me," he told <em>Sky Sports News</em>. "At the moment we are just going to sit down and talk and decide what to do. "Nothing has been decided yet. We will decide next week."</p>

In a briefing that then followed with the written press he was much more candid. </span></span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">While he insisted he was not motivated by money, he is attracted by the prospect of playing for a club he considers bigger than Arsenal. <br><br>'I had a dream of playing for Arsenal, and Arsenal are one of the loveliest clubs in the world,' he said. 'When I go back to </span></span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Africa</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"> it is obvious that a lot of people love the club.

But we will sit down next week and decide what is good for my career.</span></span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">While Adebayor says he has some loyalty to Wenger after the Frenchman rescued him from what was a difficult time at </span></span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Monaco</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">, he points to the profit Arsenal will make if they sell him.</span></span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"></span></span></p>

              <h1 class="art-headline">Emmanuel Adebayor tells Arsenal: "Don't moan, you'll be making millions when you sell me."</h1>
              <h1 class="art-headline"><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/06/27/article-1029946-067FBEAB0000044D-881_468x336.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="336"></h1>
              <p class="art-headline"> </p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Emmanuel Adebayor last night rocked Arsenal by saying he was ready to quit and added: "Don't moan, you'll be making millions when you sell me."</strong></p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">The Gunners are refusing to give him the £120,000 a week he wants, sparking a £28million bid from AC Milan and a £25m offer from Barcelona. Adebayor, 24, admitted it would not be a wrench for him to turn his back on Arsenal and Arsene Wenger because the Gunners cannot meet his pay demands.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Adebayor, who would pocket a basic wage of £80,000 a week after tax at the <span style="font-family: Georgia;">San </span>Siro, said: "It won't be a difficult decision. If Arsenal sell me, they are going to get £40m, maybe £47m and they bought me for £7m. "So everyone is getting the benefits. They have to make a good decision and I have to make a good decision as well."</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Adebayor's intention to quit follows Matthieu Flamini walking out of the Emirates to join Milan on a free transfer and Alexander Hleb also poised to leave for Barcelona. As Adebayor spoke last night in Vienna there was a big smile on his face - but huge menace for Arsenal in his voice. And as he demonstrated he felt no debt of loyalty to Arsene Wenger or the Gunners' fans, the shadow of impending doom began to descend on the Emirates.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Losing Matthieu Flamini and Alexander Hleb was always going to hurt Wenger and his team. But to also see their 30-goal top scorer exit because they simply cannot afford to keep him would be a further hammer-blow.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">And while Wenger rescued Adebayor from a nightmare at Monaco barely 18 months ago, the Togo striker clearly feels there is no need to pay back his manager. Adebayor said: "Arsene is like a father to me. That is why I love him a lot. He put me where I am today, no doubt about that. "But he bought me because he believed in my quality. He didn't buy me because I'm from Togo or because I needed money or because I look beautiful. He bought me because he thought I could do something good for the club."</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Adebayor, speaking at an adidas presentation, added: "I have a three-year contract with Arsenal but a lot of teams want me to play for them. I'm surprised and flattered, by that. "I came from Togo seven years ago and now I have a lot of big clubs trying to buy me. It's up to me and my agent Stephane Courbis to sit down next week and find a good solution, to do what's right for my career.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"I'm in a position that I don't know where to play but that's normal. If you told me seven years ago when I was playing in Togo without a pair of football boots that I'd have a choice of playing in Spain or Italy it would seem crazy.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"Arsenal need to tell me what they want as well. I have a promise from Arsene that they will call me next week. I'm waiting for their answer and then I'll decide. I need to know before I come back to train on July 21. I need to know by then."</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Adebayor's body-language and demeanour, as much as his words, suggested that decision had already been made.</p>

              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger has insisted he will not meet Emmanuel Adebayor next week for talks on the striker's future at Arsenal. The Gunners boss is adamant the Togo international will still be at the Emirates Stadium next season and said he does not plan any further talks.</strong></p>
              <p>AC Milan are pursuing the striker and Adebayor claimed on Friday he will meet Wenger next week before deciding on his future - he is demanding a pay rise to a reported £120,000 a week. But Wenger said he already met Adebayor some time ago and has no plans to meet him again.</p>
              <p>The Arsenal manager said: "He's under contract and that's quite simple. I can tell you as manager of Arsenal FC I'm not worried. "Of course I expect him to be at Arsenal next season - he's under contract."</p>
              <p>Asked if he was going to meet the striker next week, Wenger replied: "No - I've already met him."</p>
