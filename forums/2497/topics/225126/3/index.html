            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Newcastle 2-1 Watford: Martins bags winner</strong></span><br><br>Newcastle striker Obafemi Martins enhanced his blossoming reputation with a superb double to kill off stubborn Watford.<br><br>Butt tangles with Alhassan BanguraThe 22-year-old Nigerian international snatched a 2-1 victory four minutes from time with a blistering drive from substitute Damien Duff's cross to deny the Hornets a precious point on Tyneside.<br><br>Martins, who now has eight goals since his #10million switch from Inter Milan, had headed the home side in front on 49 minutes to set the stage for what his side hoped would be a comfortable victory.<br><br>However, Hameur Bouazza's 57th-minute equaliser sparked a Watford fightback which might have amounted to even more before the Newcastle's new number nine took a leaf out of predecessor Alan Shearer's book to claim the headlines at the death at St James' Park.<br><br>Much has been said about the muscular approach adopted Adrian Boothroyd's men, but they played enterprising football which never allowed the hosts to relax and will count themselves unfortunate to have left the north-east empty-handed.<br><br>The news that Newcastle's 37-year wait for a trophy had technically ended - the Magpies are awaiting official confirmation that they will be awarded the Intertoto Cup after surviving longer in the UEFA Cup than any of the other qualifiers - cut little ice at St James' Park.<br><br>Manager Glenn Roeder, while happy to accept any silverware that might come his way, played down the achievement, although the fact that Saturday's game was his side's 30th of the season dating back to July 15 illustrated just how hard his players have worked to keep fighting on all fronts despite crippling injury problems.<br><br>However, the momentum Newcastle have established in recent weeks brought the home fans to St James' Park brimming with confidence as Boothroyd's side, without an away win since their return to the top flight, headed north.<br><br>The return of both Kieron Dyer and Emre from injury, with skipper Scott Parker and Duff on the bench, simply served to increase the anticipation, although their was an air of frustration around the stadium by the time the half-time whistle sounded.<br><br>That the scoreline was 0-0 was perhaps no surprise - the Hornets had scrapped out goalless draws in each of their last two games - but the fact that the Magpies had struggled to break them down, and then failed to trouble goalkeeper Richard Lee unduly when they did, was a disappointment.<br><br>Only once was Lee in real trouble, saving with his legs as Dyer's swerving 16th-minute shot almost caught him wrong-footed.<br><br>The home side showed flashes of their best form as Dyer, Emre and Martins linked well down the left, but genuine chances were few and far between.<br><br>The Nigerian poked a weak shot straight at Lee after a thrilling build-up and Nicky Butt blasted a drive wide of the far post after bursting into the box, but there were few real scares for the visitors despite Roeder's men enjoying the greater share of possession.<br><br>Indeed, Shay Given had to be at his best to turn over Darius Henderson's dipping 39th-minute shot and 19-year-old Paul Huntington, once again playing at right-back, saw a little more of Bouazza than he would have liked.<br><br>The visitors re-emerged in determined fashion as both Alhassan Bangura and Bouazza went close in quick succession, but they fell behind with 49 minutes gone.<br><br>Butt picked out James Milner in space on the right and his cross was tailor-made for Martins, who had pulled away from Danny Shittu, to head powerfully past Lee.<br><br>However, Watford refused to throw in the towel and Given had to make a good save to deny Bouazza on 54 minutes after he had turned Steven Taylor.<br><br>And they got their reward three minutes later when Henderson flicked on Ashley Young's corner and Bouazza stabbed the equaliser home from close range.<br><br>The goal simply served to increase the visitors' confidence and Newcastle were forced to endure something of an onslaught as the game wore on.<br><br>Given saved twice from Henderson within seconds as the Hornets pushed for a winner with the game opening up.<br><br>Milner had a glorious to snatch victory 15 minutes from time when he was played into space on the right, but he could not keep his well-struck shot down.<br><br>With Duff and Parker both having joined the fray, hopes of a rousing finish were high, and Martins duly obliged four minutes from time when he controlled Duff's pass and blasted a shot into the roof of the net to send the home fans home happy and relieved.<br></div>

Today's match was attended by a meagre 16,322.<br><br>There was little drama or entertainment until the Blades conjured a goal in the third minute of injury time.<br><br>Keith Gillespie's cross from the right wing to the far post was marginally over-hit, but Stephen Quinn collected the loose ball.<br><br>The young left-winger swiftly played a low ball into the six-yard box where Hulse had pulled away from marker Fitz Hall, allowing him the time and space to lift a shot into the roof of the net.<br><br>Unsurprisingly, the Wigan players headed to the dressing room with boos ringing in their ears from the disgruntled fans.<br><br>Before the goal Jewell's side had shaded the exchanges, playing a 4-3-3 formation with Henri Camara the spearhead, flanked by Emile Heskey and Lee McCulloch.<br><br>But there was little penetration, with the untested Paddy Kenny shielded by a resilient United defence, with centre-back Claude Davis inspirational on his return to the side.<br><br>There were half chances - if that - for Camara and McCulloch, with the best opportunity a clearance from visiting captain Chris Morgan which rebounded a yard wide after striking Heskey and then Camara.<br><br>United had offered nothing in return until Hulse scored his first away goal of the season, with his other four coming at Bramall Lane.<br><br>The goal forced Jewell into a change at the interval, reverting to 4-4-2 with Camara making way for right-winger David Cotterill.<br><br>Blades manager Warnock has become renowned for his half-time team talks, inspiring his side after poor performances before the break.<br><br>On this occasion his words will undoubtedly have been different, leaving Jewell to carpet his players after a lacklustre showing.<br><br>What followed was considerably more entertaining.<br><br>Kenny was finally tested in the 48th minute, making a flying save in turning aside a 20-yard half-volley from Denny Landzaat.<br><br>Ten minutes later Wigan should have been level as Kevin Kilbane robbed right-back Rob Kozluk and charged into the area, but his drive was blocked by an advancing Kenny.<br><br>On the hour there followed a remarkable incident as referee Peter Walton initially pointed to the spot as he believed Wigan captain Arjan de Zeeuw - back after four games out with a toe injury - had handled in the area.<br><br>De Zeeuw was furious, claiming the Gillespie cross he was trying to cut out had struck his thigh, and asked Walton to consult his assistant Andy Halliday.<br><br>The Northamptonshire official did so, and after a few moments in consultation with Halliday, over-ruled his own decision.<br><br>The Blades should still have had a second four minutes later, sparked by a thunderous Gillespie drive Kirkland could only parry.<br><br>As the ball dropped at the far post, Danny Webber appeared odds-on to score from just two yards out, but was brilliantly denied by Emmerson Boyce.<br><br>It proved to be Boyce's last act as he was soon replaced by David Wright who had Wigan's only other chance of the game eight minutes from time, powering a header past the left-hand post.<br><br>There was further controversy in the five minutes of added-on time, again involving Morgan who had been elbowed by Juan Pablo Angel towards the end of Monday's 2-2 home draw with Aston Villa.<br><br>On this occasion Morgan was thumped in the face by McCulloch as they challenged for a corner, with the centre-back emerging after treatment with a cut underneath a swollen right eye<br></div>
