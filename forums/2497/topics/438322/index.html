              <p>And Sinclair, 22, said: "Would I have got a chance at Chelsea under Andre Villas-Boas?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has <em>ordered</em> manager Andre Villas-Boas to field his youngsters in the Carling Cup. </strong></p>
              <p>Villas-Boas revealed the new philosophy is seen by the Blues' Russian chief as a way of developing their best young players.</p>
              <p>It means the likes of Josh McEachran, Romelo Lukaku, Ryan Bertrand and Oriol Romeu will play against neighbours Fulham on Wednesday night, instead of established first teamers.</p>
              <p>Abramovich’s new attitude towards the competition perhaps gives Villas-Boas hope that the club's trigger-happy owner is ready to be more patient and build a lasting legacy.</p>
              </div>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>“It’s a club philosophy. A decision the owner wants, to promote talent," said the Portuguese. "But there is a responsibility to try and win trophy as well. I think there is prestige in the competition.</p>
              <p>“Arsenal have been doing it for years. We can discuss if it has been useful or not for the talent. But I think it has been, they [Arsenal] reached the final last year and a couple of semis. Important to get feeling of competition for them.</p>
              <p>“The Carling Cup is an opportunity for us to put our best young talents across and give them experience for us. It’s not a completely new approach as we did it last year.</p>
              <p>“We want them to have these opportunities. It’s a good challenge, as Fulham are a Premier League team, and it gives us an idea of where we stand.”</p>
              <p>Chelsea won the Carling Cup twice under Jose Mourinho and the Special One put a great deal of importance on it, as it represented his first ever trophy at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>And it is clear Villas-Boas is happy to buy into the new attitude to the competitiion, especially after trying to sign young players to lower the age of the squad.</p>
              <p>McEachran is a shining example of young talent breaking through at Chelsea, while Belgian forward Lukaku is from the other end of the scale, having been signed for £16m this summer.</p>
              <p>Fielding youngsters in the Carling Cup has had limited success for Arsenal but, last season, Arsene Wenger used more experienced line-ups as they got to the final, where a shock loss to Birmingham delivered a devastating blow for the rest of the campaign.</p>
              <p>Villas-Boas, unlike Wenger, certainly won’t survive six years without a trophy and to gain success he may have to be ruthless with some of his old guard.</p>
              <p>Frank Lampard, now 33, was substituted at half time against Manchester United on Sunday and is the player feeling most heat in that regard at the moment, but Villas-Boas has given the England midfielder a vote of confidence.</p>
              <p>“He is a fantastic player, he will be a key player for the rest of the season," he said. "I think he can adapt his game, see that different kind of versatility in other players, but it’s not an age or slowing problem.</p>
              <p>“Frank has played 90 minutes in all games before with maximum intensity with extremely good physical stats as always in career.”</p>
              <p>Chelsea: Turnbull; Ferreira, Chalobah, Luiz, Bertrand; Romeu, McEachran; Malouda, Kalou; Drogba, Lukaku.</p>

              <p>Liverpool is the same too.</p>
              <p>The only problem with Chelsea is that coaches don't believe their youngsters... secondly, the youngsters might just plainly be cui thats why.</p>
              <p>Kakuta... honestly I think hes a 50-50.</p>
              <p>The only good prospect coming through Chelsea rank is Josh Mceachran.</p>

              <p>Something have to change if they are serious in getting youngsters through...</p>
              <p>I recalled when Roman first came to Chelsea, they not only spent a lot of money on first team players, they also spent lots of it to develop their youth squad as well...</p>
              <p>They went around the world looking to bring in the best or highly potential youngsters to the club even to a stage where they paid large transfer fee for youth players and also were reported to the FA and Uefa for poaching in other cases...</p>
              <p>Those fellows they fought so hard to bring over from Leeds and the trouble they got into with Ken Bates... whom they eventually settled with outside the FA so as to keep his mouth quiet... I think they released those guys already cos they didn't make it to the first team after so many years... And who can forget the problem Kakuta got them... All the court case finally saved them from having to serve 2 windows ban cannot deal in any transfers deals as punishment...</p>
              <p>The real shocker is after 7 yrs, Terry remain the only one to come out from the youth squad to make it to the first team... The so called Jose McEachran, I have watch very little of him but from what I have seen, I think he is still over-rated at the moment... He is still not a Cleverley and a long way from a Jack Wilshere... But I feel as he is the only likely potential in Chelsea's youth squad, he gets mentioned more times then he is worth... He needs to be playing more games first, perhaps loaning him to a premier league side will help in his development...</p>

              <p>I dun think his wealth will ever run out in his lifetime when he is alive. the only way he loses his wealth is the russian government convicted him life time jail and confiscated his wealth in Russia, but I dun think he parked all this money and assets in Russia, probably some in england, some in switzerland with UBS, some in US etc.</p>

              <p>Well perhaps you're right....but if you look at utd's strongest 1st team, then you won't find many home grown. Home grown as in really from the bottom of the hierachy. Not snared away from another team as they emerged as fledgelings.</p>

              <p>Come on... You cannot compare like this... To already get talented kids in before they are 16 or 18 and train them into top players by the time they reach their early 20s is already something... The youth development is definitely important as it saved you money and with young players, there normally comes with some excitement too...</p>
              <p>If you are looking for a totally home state/club created kind then it's not possible to be a 'big' club...</p>
              <p>But right now, they have the likes of Fletcher, Welbeck, Evans, Gibson all came from their own academy not to forget Wes Brown, Scholes, Gary Neville who just left...</p>
              <p>So to get a player in at 12, 14, 16 or 18 years of age and develop into a first team player at a top club isn't easy cos the expection and level is much higher than at a mid table club...   </p>
              <p>And it's not just English clubs... Do you think Barcelona whom many always said promote from their youth development really develop their own state/club players?</p>
              <p>We look at their players... Andres Iniesta, <span><span style="color: #000000;">Lionel Messi</span><span style="color: #000000;">, Sergio Busquets, Pedro Rodriguez... Are not self-developed if you are not aware...</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span style="color: #000000;">Then there is Gerard Pique and</span> Víctor Valdes... They can't be consider Barcelona's cos they all left and develop elsewhere before being bought back when they got better...</span></span></p>
              <p>Even captain Carles Puyol and all along known as the Barce boy Fabregas (want to go home, want to go home) were not the product of Barce's too if you want to distinguish with your method...</p>
              <p>The only one truly self develop by Barce is Xiva...</p>
              <p>Like this even Barce only have one self-develop player only...</p>
              <p>At least currently at United, those in the works are Ravel Morrison, Ezekiel Fryers, Reece Brown... Base on your mothod, these are truly self-develop I guess...</p>

              <p>fifa should stop big and rich clubs from signing young players of other clubs. this will force clubs to develop young players in their own academy and also give smaller clubs a chance.</p>
              <p>see how all the good young players are being snatched by rich clubs.  this is killing the game and smaller teams.</p>

              <p>players can only be transferred above the 'minimum age' set.</p>
              <p>poor clubs can keep their young player, good or otherwise.  they can only be sold upon reaching the 'minimum age'.</p>
              <p>smaller clubs can hence survive without having their good young players snatched away just because rich clubs come with the money.</p>
              <p>without 'transferrable' young players all clubs would be forced to nurture their own from the academy.  and not buy young players from smaller clubs' academies and then nurture.</p>
