              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>PETR CECH and Avram Grant will hold crunch talks that will decide if they have futures at Chelsea.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Keeper Cech has rocked the club by demanding a pay rise claiming a top club is waiting with a £32m bid. And SunSport can reveal Blues boss Avram Grant will meet Roman Abramovich on Friday to hammer out whether he stays or goes as boss. That means he may know he is out of a job <strong>BEFORE</strong> the Champions League final a week tomorrow.</p>
              <p class="article">Cech, 25, has two years left on his £50,000-a-week deal. His agent Pavel Zika said: “A very big European club is ready to pay £32m for Petr. At the end of the season we will examine his contract to see if we can improve it.”</p>
              <p class="article">Grant has yet to be told Chelsea’s plans despite asking on several occasions. The feeling within the club is Red Rom will give the Israeli the chance of returning to his role as director of football and go for Barcelona boss Frank Rijkaard.</p>

              <p>Its either the 2 Milan or Barce...</p>
              <p>But then again, goalkeepers are not known to earn a lot of money... Cos can only play 1 keeper normally and there are plenty of them not just in Europe but all over the world... Even their transfer fee isn't the biggest in today's going rate... But Cech do deserve more than the $50k tho... Its about time he ask for more...</p>

              <h1>Cech set to cash in with new £90,000 per week contract at Chelsea after Champions League final in Moscow</h1>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/05_03/CechOrange1305ES_468x477.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Petr Cech wants to commit his long-term future to Chelsea and will begin talks with the club over a new contract after the Champions League Final next week. Cech has established himself as arguably the best keeper in Europe since he joined Chelsea for £7million from Rennes in 2004.</strong></p>
              <p>The Czech international, who is believed to be earning around £70,000 a week, is wanted by a host of clubs across the continent, but is keen to stay at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>Chelsea are happy to open negotiations with the 25-year-old and his agent Pavel Zika, and are ready to offer him a rise of about £20,000 a week to secure his signature, which will bring him in line with other top earners at the club.</p>
              <p>A source close to the keeper said: “We will be talking about Petr's contract with Chelsea after the Champions League Final. "He is happy at Chelsea and sees his long-term future there.” He only has two years left on his current contract, but the club will offer him a two-year extension that will keep him at the club until 2012.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Didier Drogba admitted yesterday that complacency had cost Chelsea the League title to Manchester United. The two points his team conceded to Bolton on Sunday brought the number lost in the final moments at Stamford Bridge to eight.</p>
              <p>Drogba, who confirmed he would be fit from a knee injury for the Champions League Final, said: “That is enormous, far too many to claim to be champions. “It certainly shows an excess of self-satisfaction, a lack of concentration.”</p>

              <h1>Milan Set For €48m Cech Offer</h1>
              <div class="PhotoBox">
              <div id="Articolo_ei1_p1"><img id="Articolo_ei1_i1" style="border-width: 0px; width: 200px;" src="http://goal.com/images/18728_news.jpg" alt="Milan Set For €48m Cech Offer"></div>
              <div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With Nelson Dida seemingly set to be released on a free transfer,
              and doubts still remaining over the ability of Zeljko Kalac, Milan have
              identified the signing of a new goalkeeper as their primary transfer
              target this summer.</p>
              <p>A host of names have been linked with a move to San Siro, most
              notably Fiorentina’s Sebastien Frey, Celtic’s Artur Boruc, and PSV
              Eindoven’s Heurelho Gomes.</p>
              <p>Latest reports in Italy suggest that Milan are now set to table a
              huge offer to Chelsea for Czech shot-stopper Petr Cech. Last week,
              Cech’s agent Pavel Zika, told Czech newspaper Pravo that a big European
              club were ready invest heavily in his client.</p>
              <p>Zika said: "I know quite a large European club is ready to pay over
              30 million euros for Petr Cech. It is an important sum for a
              goalkeeper. At the end of the season, we will consider the current
              contract of Petr and see whether we can improve it."</p>
              <p>While many believe that these statements were intended as a
              bargaining chip into contract negations, reports in Italy insist that
              Milan are serious about signing Cech.</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old, who has won 56 caps for his country, is widely regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the world.</p>

              <p>but i have a feeling his assumption is closer to the truth than most</p>

              <p>only milan can pay the transfer fee and wages an who still need a world class keeper.</p>

              <p>Sometimes I wonder how these salary demands get kick started. I mean, do these players have a year-end appraisal on their performance and future expectations?  I can imagine one between Cech and Peter Kenyon:</p>
              <p>Kenyon: Well done Petr, tough season, pushed Utd to the end but just stopped short of it. You have been immense.</p>
              <p>Cech: I'm glad you thought so cos I have been the most outstanding keeper in the BPL, if not Europe. What's Buffon and Casillas compared to me? VDS is just another Cech poser. I'm definitely worth more than fat Franks and should be paid the same wages.</p>
              <p>Kenyon: (Realising his folly of singing praises too early) well.... you did ship in that howler in the last minute against Bolton that my gran could have saved.  (Clutching at straws now) You did concede 26 goals!</p>
              <p>Cech: Its all your fault for signing Ben Haim and Alex as back-up defenders. Cudicini was a hopeless back-up keeper. Alright, I get yer drift. Just another 20k quid extra a week will do me fine.</p>
              <p>Kenyon: (Visibly relieved that Roman's vast coppers should not notice a difference of another million quid a year) Excellant! I'd always felt you deserved a raise.</p>
              <p>Cech: Cheers baldy, let me inform Milan of this piece of good news.  My agent needs to negotiate a little more.</p>
