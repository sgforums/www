            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/3g.jpg"><br><br><strong>DAVID BECKHAMÂ’S Â£128million deal with LA Galaxy could spark a Stateside invasion by other top European stars. </strong><br><br>The former England skipperÂ’s incredible five-year switch from Real Madrid to the American club will signal the end of his career as a Â‘seriousÂ’ footballer. But having seen what is on offer, BeckhamÂ’s mates will be scrambling to get a piece of the action as their careers come to an end.<br><br>So how long before some of the Real Galacticos and other big names roll into town and become the Galaxicos?<br><br>Step forward RealÂ’s fading Brazilian striker Ronaldo. A possible comeback from retirement for Zinedine Zidane and Portuguese ace Luis Figo, now plying his trade in Saudi Arabia. Who knows, even a swansong to put a smile on the face of BecksÂ’ best mate Gary Neville.<br><br>How about a move for AC MilanÂ’s one-time pin-up boy Paolo Maldini. Or maybe German skipper Michael Ballack who, judging by his Chelsea form, looks like he is already preparing for retirement in the sunshine.<br><br>AmericaÂ’s Major League Soccer has what is being dubbed Â“the Beckham ruleÂ” Â— which means one player per team can be paid over and above the salary cap, which is just over Â£1m a year per team.<br><br>But the view is if BeckhamÂ’s switch is a success, the rulebook will be hurled out of the window. MLS is backed by BeckhamÂ’s major sponsor, adidas, and is looking to try and recapture the glory days of the North American Soccer League of the 1970s.<br><br>That was when the New York Cosmos reigned supreme with Pele and Franz Beckenbauer strutting their stuff. But the real challenge is to sustain the interest after the initial surge of enthusiasm.<br><br>Soccer is hugely popular with younger kids and the womenÂ’s game is booming. But it has never sustained a big following among US sports fans brought up on the NFL, baseball and basketball.<br><br>When America staged the World Cup in 1994, grounds were packed out. When the womenÂ’s World Cup final was won by the USA in the Pasadena Rose Bowl in 1999, 90,000 were there to see it including US President Bill Clinton.<br><br>The scorer of the winning penalty, Brandy Chastain, whipped her top off and swung it round her head. That got soccer on the front pages all right!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Beckham's really on a crusade</strong></span><br><br>Beckham is determined to put American Â‘soccerÂ’ on the map and he has already persuaded his Real Madrid team-mate Ronaldo to join him in the MLS next season.<br><br>The Brazil striker will join New York Red Bulls in the summer and Luis Figo, who is seeing out the remaining year of his contract at Inter Milan, is also being lined up for a move to the States.<br><br>Figo was offered a deal to join Saudi Arabian side Al Ittihad next season, but it is understood that the Portugal midfielder has also been persuaded that his future lies in America.<br><br>BeckhamÂ’s decision has already raised the profile of the MLS and it is understood that league chiefs are investigating the possibility of increasing the number of Â‘designatedÂ’ players to two per team.<br><br>MLS clubs are currently allowed one Â‘superstarÂ’ signing each, but American soccer chiefs believe they can raise the gameÂ’s profile if they stimulate a player drain from Europe.<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Beckham could end up owning MLS team</strong></span><br><br>Sources close to Beckham have revealed that he wants to leave a Â‘legacyÂ’ in the United States long after his playing career has finished and it also raises the extraordinary possibility of a team in the MLS being rebranded in his honour.<br><br>That would allow one of the worldÂ’s most recognisable faces, who will earn a staggering Â£70,000 a day while at LA Galaxy, to exploit the marketing potential of a team linked with his name. Under MLS rules, a club could be set up for Beckham at the end of his contract if the league decide to create a new franchise. Last season Chivas U.S.A. were formed to attract Mexican immigrants to the competition.<br><br>BeckhamÂ’s contract negotiations, completed in just 10 days, ran smoother than Friday nightÂ’s official unveiling to his new LA Galaxy team. When the hitches in a satellite link from Madrid were ironed out, Beckham revealed he had spoken to film star friend Tom Cruise on how to handle the media furore which will accompany his arrival.<br><br>He said: Â‘I was on the phone to him for about an hour last night and an hour the night before. I asked for his advice because heÂ’s a wise man and a very good friend. To have friends when we arrive in LA is going to be a big help.<br><br>Â‘IÂ’m not as recognised in the U.S. as I am around Europe and other parts of the world but, hopefully, playing for Galaxy will change that. Â‘IÂ’d like to take it to another level. IÂ’m a player who works hard on the pitch. IÂ’m a team player. IÂ’m not coming to be a superstar Â— I am coming to be part of a team and to work hard and, hopefully, win things.Â’<br><br></div>
