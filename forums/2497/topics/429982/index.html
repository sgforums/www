              <p>By Chris Harris<br><br><a title="Bacary Sagna (3) player profile" href="http://www.sgforums.com/first-team/players/bacary-sagna"><span style="color: #000000;">Bacary Sagna</span></a> admits that Arsenal are "too nice" and must be more ruthless if they want to turn their potential into trophies.<br><br>The Gunners' slim title hopes were finally extinguished on Sunday with a 3-1 defeat at Stoke City and, not for the first time this season, Arsène Wenger's side were vulnerable to set pieces.<br><br>More than half the goals Arsenal have conceded this term have come from corners or free kicks and they fell behind at the Britannia Stadium when Jermaine Pennant's delivery was allowed to reach Kenwyne Jones.<br><br>"I think we are too nice, we have to fight a bit more," Sagna told Arsenal TV Online after the game.<br><br>"We have to push them as much as they push us and be a bit more 'killer'. We are not defending as well as we have to and against big players like they [Stoke] are it is very difficult.<br><br>"It can be put right on the training ground because it is in our mind. We know we are very good players but sometimes we have to fight a bit more. <br><br>"We didn't do that as much as we did it last week [against Manchester United]. We have to put in performances week after week and fight even more.<br><br>"We didn't deserve to win on Sunday. We didn't give enough, we didn't play as we can and that's what happens when you don't give the maximum - you get beaten everywhere."</p>
