              <p>rooney siam, he cannot play world class football at all. He is over rated.</p>
              <p>Rooney not in the class of zidane, older and younger ronaldo, henry, torres.</p>
              <p>Rooney is just an average player.</p>
              <p>Once ronaldo leaves, united will be in trouble, although they prove me wrong time and time again.</p>

              <p><br>i can't really agree that ManU needs a fast striker, i would think they would need a target man kind of striker, a true No. 9, Teves &amp; Ronney can only be effectively if they have someone to play to.</p>
              <p>my opinion of Robinho is that he is more of a winger or wide striker who will cuts in from the flank and add weight to the final part of the team, can't really be a standalone kind of striker, BTW, Nani seems capable of filling what Robinho can do and is alrealy in the team and proved suitable for English type of game.</p>
              <p>it would be the best if Real is to offer full cash for Ronaldo which would allows ManU to buy players who they badly wanted then to have someone they're forced into having.</p>

              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo's agent, Jorge Mendes, stands to earn an
              astonishing £10million if he can engineer the Portugal winger's world
              record £70m move from Manchester United to Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>Despite
              the player's declaration of his desire to leave Old Trafford, United
              boss Sir Alex Ferguson will refuse to be forced into showdown talks
              with his star player.</p>
              <p>Mendes, known as 'The Octopus' because of the number of moves he has
              a hand in, can expect the huge commission if he clinches Ronaldo's exit
              from Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>It would be the most lucrative deal of a
              summer in which he has already brokered Chelsea's recruitment of Luiz
              Felipe Scolari as manager and which promises to bring further fees for
              his involvement in potential deals involving Deco and Ricardo Carvalho.</p>
              <p>When
              Ronaldo returns to England this week for his foot injury to be
              assessed, there will be no one on hand at United with the authority to
              deal with the issue of his desire to go to Spain. Ferguson has told
              friends he will not break his holiday in the South of France, while
              chief executive David Gill is also away, leaving Ronaldo, Mendes and
              Real sweating on the deal they are so keen to strike.</p>
              <p>United
              remain adamant they will not sell the double Footballer of the Year,
              who gave the clearest indication yet that he wishes to join Real
              following Portugal's elimination from Euro 2008 on Thursday. Ferguson
              told friends: 'There is no way I'm changing my plans for anyone.'</p>
              <p>But
              Real believe it is only a matter of time before United have to talk and
              are preparing a formal offer of just over £70m for Ronaldo, smashing
              the previous record of just under £50m which they paid Juventus for
              Zinedine Zidane in 2001. They will also propose £40m cash plus Brazil
              forward Robinho, who has given his consent to be a makeweight.</p>
              <p>The United boss has remained silent in the face of speculation that
              his relationship with Ronaldo has been damaged beyond repair and
              intends to see out the remaining week of his holiday before
              entertaining any thoughts of communicating with the midfielder.</p>
              <p>'If and when he does, he will regard it as just another piece of essential club business,' added a United source.</p>
              <p>United
              and Ferguson's public stance of opposing any transfer remains, but the
              feeling inside Real is that the main obstacle to the deal has been
              removed now that Ronaldo has gone public with his wish to move to Real.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo had said: 'It is a dream, a step forward, you can call it what you want. For me it is a great opportunity.'</p>
              <p>Real
              have drawn up a shortlist of three possible homes in Madrid for Ronaldo
              on which he could lavish a basic salary of £150,000-perweek, plus
              further fortunes from his image rights.</p>
              <p>Nani, Ronaldo's team-mate
              for club and country, believes his departure is inevitable saying: 'The
              loss of Cristiano Ronaldo will be bad news for United. In the Portugal
              camp, Cristiano advised us that his decision was clear and that now he
              will try new challenges.'</p>
              <p>Even if a deal is not brokered soon,
              Ronaldo's injury makes it unlikely he will join United on their
              four-match African tour next month.</p>

              <h1>Real Madrid tell Cristiano Ronaldo: play dirty</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/graphics/2008/06/22/sfnfro122afp.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p class="story"><strong>In a further twist to the summer's long-running transfer saga, sources close to Real Madrid have revealed that the club have made it clear to Cristiano Ronaldo that, after <span style="color: #000000;">announcing his "dream" of joining them,</span> he should now attempt to force Manchester United's hand into selling him or formally demand a transfer.</strong></p>
              <p>It is alleged that Real president Roman Calderon and the Bernabeu hierarchy expect further developments this week, perhaps even by Monday, and while they are delighted that the Portuguese wasted no time in fulfilling the first part of his instructions on Thursday evening, The Sunday Telegraph understands they now expect further, steely action from their transfer target in order to help them do the deal.</p>
              <p class="story">However the Spanish are likely to find resistance within Ronaldo's camp, particularly given the impact of formally asking for a transfer has on a vast range of codicils within a professional player's contract, relating to bonus payments and agent payments. If he asks for a transfer many financial bonuses due to him, and his representative Jorge Mendes, would be void.</p>
              <p class="story">Madrid's argument is that if they are willing to pay up to £70million for him and then pay a net weekly wage of £150,000, both of which are true, then his specific obligation is to keep on making life close to unbearable for United.</p>
              <p class="story">Ronaldo will return to Manchester for assessment on a foot injury that he has been carrying in the last weeks of the season. If he does need minor surgical treatment, sources close to Madrid allege that Real would be unhappy with him having it in England.</p>
              <p class="story">The Sunday Telegraph also understands that Madrid may have leaked the story at the beginning of May. José Manuel 'Pipi' Estrada, a famous radio and newspaper journalist, reported stage by stage what was happening in the Ronaldo deal beginning on May 7 in the football newspaper Marca. "Ronaldo has taken a decision," he wrote. "He's going to tell United he wants to leave... He's given a personal guarantee to Real Madrid Director of football Pedja Mijatovic and his assistant Carlos Bucero." Crucially he warned that there would be a declaration of intent before the Euros and then a fuller statemtent when Ronaldo's tournament was over. Estrada was well briefed.</p>
              <p class="story">One of the unfairly branded culprits is the last person to move from Old Trafford to the Bernabeu. Valter di Salvo was publicly shunned by Carlos Quieroz for quitting and taking over as Director of Performance at Madrid 12 months ago and during the season, as Ronaldo has repeatedly phoned him as a friend, the Italian has warned the winger not to make the move unless he is "1,000 per cent" sure that he wishes to say goodbye forever to Manchester United.</p>
