              <h1>AVB hits back over 'persecution'</h1>
              <p>Andre Villas-Boas believes Chelsea's Champions League win over Valencia gives a "slap in the face" to their critics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span class="base-gallery-pic"><a class="thickbox" title="Villas-Boas: Watched Drogba inspire Chelsea" href="http://images.football365.com/11/12/800x600/Andre-VillasBoas-Didier-Drogba-Chelsea_2687705.jpg"><img src="http://images.football365.com/11/12/640/Andre-VillasBoas-Didier-Drogba-Chelsea_2687705.jpg" alt="Villas-Boas: Watched Drogba inspire Chelsea"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></span></a></span></p>
              <p class="base-text-caption"><em>Villas-Boas: There's only one team in the country at the moment, and that's Man City, the approach to them is if they qualify they qualify, and if they don't they don't.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The Blues manager avoided an early exit thanks to a Didier Drogba-inspired 3-0 win over the Spaniards.</strong></p>
              <p>The 33-year-old broke the deadlock with a third-minute drive and, after Ramires prodded home at second, secured victory by neatly flicking in a Juan Mata through-ball in the second half.</p>
              <p>Victory confirms progression to the knockout stage as Group E winners, which Villas-Boas hopes will quieten the naysayers.</p>
              <p>"It helps to score straight away in the game," Villas-Boas said. "It gave the team the right emotional stance for the rest of the game and gave a full boost in confidence.</p>
              <p>"To get the second not long afterwards made the team even more confident on what was happening.</p>
              <p>"In terms of the result and what happens in us finishing top, it's fantastic. It's against all odds.</p>
              <p>"Nobody, or anybody here, would have bet on us finishing top, but it's happened and it is very, very gratifying for the team.</p>
              <p>"The team were excellent. It is a win of human values, of team spirit, solidarity, responsibility, strength of character, ability to take criticism, resilience, and this is a great win for Chelsea players.</p>
              <p>"They deserve a respect that they don't get.</p>
              <p>"We've been continually chased by different kinds of people, but today we've given everybody (those critics) a slap in the face."</p>
              <p>Villas-Boas has seen his squad selection, philosophy and position come under increasing scrutiny recently.</p>
              <p>The Portuguese manager believes the column inches dedicated to Chelsea is part of a wider "persecution" and called it "out of this world".</p>
              <p>Asked whether he detected anger among players, Villas-Boas retorted: "No, I just think the reaction has been over the top.</p>
              <p>"There's only one team in the country at the moment, and that's Man City.</p>
              <p>"I sincerely hope they qualify, but the approach to them is if they qualify they qualify, and if they don't they don't.</p>
              <p>"We don't get that margin from you guys. That's not the same as with us. I will never criticise your editorial choices, but it is the reality.</p>
              <p>"People take perspectives that are out of this world, from criticising our players to criticising choices.</p>
              <p>"We see a Manchester United defender (Gary Neville) today say in the preparations for the game and says things like 'I don't want to be one of the Chelsea players today', 'I couldn't play this game' and 'It is a difficult game for them'.</p>
              <p>"This is out of this world for me, I don't believe this.</p>
              <p>"It continues the persecution of Chelsea, continues aggression to one club.</p>
              <p>"We have become your target, we have to accept it. Tomorrow, it's unfortunate for you guys because you'll have to report on a brilliant win for Chelsea and finishing first.</p>
              <p>"Tomorrow is difficult for you guys. I'll never pick a fight with you guys."</p>
              <p>While relieved to secure victory and stem the tide of negativity, Villas-Boas had to sacrifice his ideals for a place in the Champions League knockout phase.</p>
              <p>Chelsea defended uncharacteristically deeply and invited the Spanish side on, hoping to grab goals on the counter-attack.</p>
              <p>"I think there is a phrase that is interesting: the person that you are is a triumph in the person you want to be," Villas-Boas added.</p>
              <p>"Today it was a win of personal values and human values.</p>
              <p>"I think in the way we set out our philosophy, there are human values that you cannot put away.</p>
              <p>"Today they showed themselves to an unbelievable expression.</p>
              <p>"Yes, I think it is a different strategy, but the same philosophy in human values."</p>

              <p>Blues currently trail the Premier League leaders by 10 points — and dare not let that gap get any bigger.</p>
              <p>And boss AVB admitted: "If we win or draw against City on Monday then we continue to challenge for the Premier League.</p>
              <p>"But, if we lose... then it becomes extremely difficult.</p>
              <p>"Thirteen points is a big deficit to recover. Not impossible, but it would be a massive gap for us to close.</p>
              <p>"Manchester City are outstanding every week and they understand the importance of this game at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>"They are the leaders and they will be a massive challenge for us. They've already played at United and Liverpool and are still unbeaten and now they come to Chelsea.</p>
              <p>"If they get the win they want, they will almost come out of the game with the assurance that there is one less team in the running for the title. Getting back to seven points would be ideal for us.</p>
              <p>"A draw would also maintain the gap and allow other teams to get nearer to them.</p>
              <p>"We all agree Tottenham and Manchester United are up there challenging them.</p>
              <p>"Even if we lose, there will be no quitting from us. Let's see where we all are at the end of this month.</p>
              <p>"At the beginning of January, then we will know who is still challenging for the title."</p>
              <p>Villas-Boas is full of admiration for City's superstars and believes they have raised the bar in terms of consistency this season.</p>
              <p>The Portuguese coach added: "At the moment, Chelsea has the same points as the eventual champions did at the same stage last year — and the eventual champions of three years ago. So our numbers in terms of title contenders are not so poor... but the exception this time is Manchester City.</p>
              <p>"They are the media darlings at the moment and their record-breaking start has overshadowed what some of the other teams have been doing.</p>
              <p>"But that is fair because their start to this season has been immense and the praise is deserved because of Mancini's work.</p>
              <p>"He has endured extreme suffering in the past to get things right. He is a humble person and now he's on the right route to success.</p>
              <p>"It is difficult to find a weakness in the City side and the further unbeaten they go in the League, the more they will believe this is their year.</p>
              <p>"We'll have to see how much pressure Tottenham can put on them with their game in hand and how much it means for United to defend their title from their Manchester rival.</p>
              <p>"We have to think about what strategy we take into Monday's game because we've seen many teams try different things against City and no one has beaten them."</p>

              <h1>Samir Nasri: only Manchester United can stop Manchester City winning the title not Chelsea</h1>
              <h2>Staying in tune with their most famous fans, Manchester City are trying not to look back in anger but a sense of frustration still pervades the inquest into why they went from the feast of the Champions League to the finger buffet of the Europa League circuit.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02080/samir-nasri_2080956c.jpg" alt="Samir Nasri - Samir Nasri: only Manchester United can stop us winning the title not Chelsea" width="460" height="287"></p>
              <div class="artImageExtras">
              <div class="ingCaptionCredit"><span class="caption">Happy at City: Samir Nasri believes that Chelsea cannot upset Manchester City's charge to the Premier League title</span></div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="firstPar">
              <p><strong>Ambitious players like Samir Nasri want to look forward as well, focusing on Chelsea in the Premier League tomorrow, but the wounds from last week’s exit from Europe’s top club competition still require dressing. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>Always one of the more thoughtful dressing-room talkers, the Frenchman argued that English clubs are at a disadvantage to their Spanish counterparts. “The problem is you lose too much energy when you play in the Premier League,’’ reflected Nasri.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>“Even when you play the team on the bottom it is difficult. Barcelona, when they play Almeria or someone, win 8-0. In the <span style="color: #000000;">Premier League</span> you don’t win 8-0 against Norwich or another team.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>“It is a more demanding league at all levels. In Spain last year the difference between the first [Barcelona with 96 points] and second [Real Madrid, 92] and the third [Valencia] was 21 points. But Barcelona and Real are good teams. They show it every year in the Champions League.”</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>Yet Chelsea, and Nasri’s old club Arsenal, reached the knock-out stage. Nasri indicated that those two were not challenging for the title. “Us and Man United give everything and it’s difficult,’’ he said.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>So would the humiliation make City hungrier? “No, no, we were hungry from the start of the season. They invest a lot with the new players to win the Premier League and this [objective] will not change. At the start we wanted to win everything. Now we’ll be focused on the Premier League and the <span style="color: #000000;">Europa League</span> because it’s a trophy and we have the quality to win it.”</p>
              <p>And so to the Bridge. “Chelsea are in good form as well so it will be an interesting game but we’re prepared for this and will be fighting on Monday.</p>
              <p>"It’s difficult against Chelsea but it’s difficult against Tottenham, United and Liverpool and we had great results against those teams, so I don’t know what we have to fear about Chelsea.</p>
              <p>"We are confident about our quality and we’ll try to play the same game Liverpool did against them in the League. If you press them high and you play your football they’ll be in difficulties.”</p>
              <p>Never short of an opinion, Nasri does not see Chelsea as City’s biggest rivals for the title. “No, no. <span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span> – they have more experience. How they will handle the disappointment of the Champions League we will see.</p>
              <p>"Tottenham are in good form and have good players. With [Emmanuel] Adebayor and Scott Parker they changed their team.’’</p>
              <p>So have City, playing with more fluidity and intensity this season, copying the Barcelona style of winning the ball high up the pitch to score freely. Sergio Agüero leads the way with 11 in the League followed by Edin Dzeko (10), Mario Balotelli (seven), David Silva and Adam Johnson (both four).</p>
              <p>“Our model is Barcelona and the way they press really high,’’ continued Nasri. “When you get the ball in the other half it is always easier because you have less to run and you are more fresh in the last 30 metres. It’s the way we want to play.” Swift interchanging of attackers has been a formidable feature of City’s season. For a creative type like Nasri, the blur of blue around him gives him many options.</p>
              <p>“Yes, you can see that. I had six assists in the Premier League last year with Arsenal and I have the same already with City. You have lots of changing of positions when you have the ball in the last 30 metres.’’</p>
              <p>Nasri nodded when mention was made of Roberto Mancini’s public comment about the need for City to be tighter at the back. “He’s being saying that to us as well!’’ smiled Nasri ruefully, giving an insight into the demanding Italian. “He’s someone who is never happy with the result. When we won 5-1 he wants his team to have a clean sheet as well.</p>
              <p>“So he taught us how to defend and we agree. If we want to be one of the biggest teams in the world we have to improve as a team how to defend.”</p>
              <p>When Mancini fields his more buccaneering full-backs, Micah Richards and Gaël Clichy, the onus is on City’s wide players to cover for the overlapping pair. “You can see that with David, James [Milner], Adam or me. We make an effort to help our defenders.’’</p>
              <p>Mancini is making Nasri a more all-round footballer, nurturing defensive qualities to complement attacking ones learned under Arsène Wenger at Arsenal.</p>
              <p>“Tactically Italians are very strong. They are a lot into tactics, how to defend, when you lose the ball where will you be? He told me I know how to play with Arsenal, I play good football, so upfront I know what to do but defensively I have to improve. I’m 24, I can improve a lot.</p>
              <p>“I needed a little bit of time to settle because I changed from Arsenal. It’s not the same mentality and not the same way to play football but the manager showed confidence in me, my team-mates as well. So now I start to play the football I love. I’m confident about the future.”</p>
              <p>That future involves a Euro 2012 collision with England on June 11.</p>
              <p>Joe Hart, Joleon Lescott, Gareth Barry, Milner, possibly Johnson and Richards await in Donetsk. “They are a little bit upset with the result we had in Wembley,’’ said Nasri of France’s friendly win over England last year. The banter has been flowing at Carrington, although no bad tackles. “No!’’ laughed Nasri. “They told me they will wait until the last training session of the season and then they’ll try and do something!’’ He’d better look back.</p>

              <p class="introcopy"><strong>Manchester City pressed the self-destruct button as Chelsea ended their unbeaten start to the Barclays Premier League season and hauled themselves right back into the title race with a 2-1 win.</strong></p>
              <p class="introcopy"><br>City were in cruise control midway through the first half at wet and windy Stamford Bridge, looking every inch champions elect as they tormented their opponents. Mario Balotelli scored inside two minutes and they should have been 2-0 up - seeing a decent penalty appeal turned down in the process - before simply losing their way.<br><br>That allowed Raul Meireles to equalise before half-time after which City simply lost the plot, Gael Clichy picking up two yellow cards in 11 minutes and Joleon Lescott handling in his own box, allowing substitute Frank Lampard to net the winner from the penalty spot.<br><br>The result ended Andre Villas-Boas' run of defeats against other big teams and propelled his side to third place, seven points behind their opponents. Victory capped a week to remember for Chelsea - who beat Valencia to progress in the Champions League - while defeat sealed a week to forget for City, who crashed out of the same competition.<br><br>The opening goal owed everything to the brilliance of Sergio Aguero and a slip from Branislav Ivanovic. Aguero received the ball on the right with his back to goal, carried it inside from the right and played in Balotelli, who shrugged off the wrong-footed Ivanovic, rounded Petr Cech and nonchalantly stroked the ball home.<br><br>City were tearing into Chelsea, forcing errors in their opponents' half, and although the hosts looked to have got a grip when Meireles' drive was deflected over in the 10th minute, they should immediately have been 2-0 down. Ashley Cole conceded possession, allowing Aguero to race goalward and leave Jose Bosingwa in a heap before drilling wide.<br><br>Bosingwa got away with dangling his leg in the box, prompting David Silva to go down, with referee Mark Clattenburg waving away the appeals. Clattenburg also failed to spot an altercation between Yaya Toure and Juan Mata which might have seen either player carded, before Didier Drogba forced the first save of note from Joe Hart in the 25th minute.<br><br>City's workrate had dipped and they paid the price when former academy graduate Daniel Sturridge brilliantly laid on Chelsea's equaliser. The ball was sprayed to the forward out on the right and he tricked his way past Clichy and crossed for the arriving Meireles to crash into the net on the volley.<br><br>No-one ran to the bench to celebrate, putting paid to suggestions Chelsea's players had been asked to. Clattenburg's yellow card was soon out, with Meireles and Vincent Kompany both booked before half-time and Clichy just after for hauling back Sturridge. The left-back saw red two minutes before the hour mark, fouling Ramires. <br><br>Chelsea introduced Lampard for Meireles in the 73rd minute shortly before Ramires became the latest player to see yellow for an ugly tackle on Balotelli. The hosts eventually made the breakthrough seven minutes from time, after Lescott handballed. Lampard smashed the penalty straight down the middle and sent Stamford Bridge into ecstasy.<br></p>

              <h1>Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini accuses Ashley Cole of taunting players in the tunnel after Chelsea win</h1>
              <h2>Roberto Mancini last night accused Ashley Cole of taunting Manchester City’s players in the Stamford Bridge tunnel after last night’s dramatic 2-1 defeat to Chelsea.</h2>

              <div class="ingCaptionCredit"><span class="caption">Not on: Roberto Mancini hit out at Ashley Cole after it was suggested the defender had taunted Man City players after the game</span></div>

              <div class="firstPar">
              <p><strong>“They were really lively after this game because they have beaten a top team and it is very important for them,” the City manager said. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>Mancini then specifically named the Chelsea defender, saying: “I don’t know if Cole said something, I don’t know what he said. I don’t understand. But I think if the Chelsea players are saying we are a top team then this is a compliment.”</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas denied that Cole was to blame. “It is untrue, it is unfair,” he said, declaring that Chelsea’s title challenge was now back on course having narrowed City’s lead over them to seven points. “There is always some troublemaker in our wins,” he added.</p>
              <p>Mancini was also furious at the denial of a first-half penalty to his side when David Silva appeared to be tripped by Jose Bosingwa. “Even outside the stadium you could see that,” he said. “It was the turning point. In the first half he [referee Mark Clattenburg] was three metres behind Silva and did not give the penalty.”</p>
              <p>Mancini added sarcastically that he “agreed” with all of Clattenburg’s decisions but contrasted the failure to award Silva a penalty with the speed in which the official punished Joleon Lescott for a handball, claiming the defender had turned away and could not avoid Daniel Sturridge’s shot.</p>
              <p>The frustration even boiled over on City’s official Twitter account, which had to issue an apology for a remark written by a club employee criticising Clattenburg’s performance, and which was subsequently deleted.</p>
              <p>Mancini was frustrated with his players for not taking advantage of their first-half supremacy, adding they should have scored two or three goals. “I think that we dominated the game,” he said. “It is unusual to come here and dominate like that. We needed to score another goal and after the sending off it was really difficult. But it doesn’t change anything for us. We knew we would lose a game. But I don’t think we deserved to lose this game.” Mancini did not dispute the dismissal of Gaël Clichy.</p>
