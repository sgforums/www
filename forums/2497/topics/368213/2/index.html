              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold">Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger believes that Manchester City will be getting a 'special' player in Emmanuel Adebayor.</p>
              <p>The Togo international is to undergo a medical at Eastlands on Saturday ahead of a reported £25million switch.</p>
              <p>Wenger, who brought <span class="lingo_link" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12.1667px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;">Adebayor</span><img id="lingo_icon" class="lingo_icon lingo_icon_black" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 0pt ! important; padding: 0pt; float: none; position: static; left: auto; top: auto; line-height: normal; background-color: transparent; visibility: visible; width: 12px; height: 12px; background-repeat: no-repeat; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: top; display: inline; cursor: pointer;" src="http://static.lingospot.com/spot/image/spacer.gif" alt=""> from Monaco in 2006, confirmed a transfer is in the offing while
              stating that the returns of injured duo Thomas Rosicky and Eduardo will
              help compensate for his exit.</p>
              <p>When asked if a deal looks more likely than less likely, Wenger said on <em>Sky Sports News</em>: "Yes.</p>
              <p>"He is up at <span class="lingo_link" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12.1667px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;">Manchester City</span><img id="lingo_icon" class="lingo_icon lingo_icon_black" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 0pt ! important; padding: 0pt; float: none; position: static; left: auto; top: auto; line-height: normal; background-color: transparent; visibility: visible; width: 12px; height: 12px; background-repeat: no-repeat; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: top; display: inline; cursor: pointer;" src="http://static.lingospot.com/spot/image/spacer.gif" alt=""> having a medical and we will see what comes out of it.</p>
              <p>"If the medical is positive and he agrees personal terms then it could happen.</p>
              <h4>Fee</h4>
              <p>"We'll miss him, but of course we want to focus on the players that are with us at the moment.</p>
              <p>"We want to wish him well and thank him for everything he has done for the club.</p>
              <p>"I wish him well, I am sure he will give something special to Man City.</p>
              <p>"On
              our side we have Thomas Rosicky back and Eduardo back on Monday in full
              training. We have lost a big striker but gained one offensive player
              and one striker."</p>
              <p>When asked about the alleged £25million fee for
              Adebayor, Wenger said: "I don't know what is good and what is bad in
              today's transfer market. We still have to sign the documents.</p>
              <p>"The price we do not know. And we don't know whether we or Man City will come out with the price."</p>

              <p>The fee for the Togo international has not been
              disclosed, although the 25-year-old is believed to have cost City in
              the region of £25million.</p>
              <p>Adebayor was omitted from the Arsenal
              squad which tackled Barnet on Saturday as he was in Manchester putting
              the final touches on his five-year contact.</p>

              man, who joined Arsenal in 2006, has been moved by the reception
              received by fans and is looking forward to making history at Eastlands.</p>

              ability to compete with the big four.</p>
              <p>"Emmanuel has been one of
              the top forwards in the Premier League since he arrived from France and
              we are delighted he has agreed to come and join us," he declared.</p>
              <p>"Along
              with the other signings we have made in the last two windows he will
              greatly enhance our ability to compete with the top sides.</p>
              <p>"His
              arrival is another clear indication that we are determined to augment
              the players we have here with the best of international talent.</p>
              <p>"He
              adds vital balance and power to our attack. He has everything a top
              forward needs. He is versatile, powerful, quick and agile on the ball.</p>
              <p>"I
              am looking forward to working with him as are the rest of the staff. He

              <h1>Manchester City's spending hits £130m as Adebayor signs<br></h1>

              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/07/18/article-0-05C271A0000005DC-271_468x286.jpg" alt="Emmanuel Adebayor" width="468" height="286"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>City slicker: Emmanuel Adebayor arrives at The City of Manchester Stadium as a £25m signing</em></p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1200589" rel="1200589|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1200589/Manchester-Citys-spending-hits-130m-Adebayor-signs.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester City</strong></span><strong> clinched the most spectacular signing of the summer so far when Emmanuel Adebayor headed north last night to complete a £25million move from </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Arsenal</strong></span><strong>.</strong></p>
              <p>The arrival of Adebayor made up for an embarrassing 2-0 defeat against South African side Orlando Pirates as City's Abu Dhabi owners flexed their financial muscles once again.</p>
              <p>City have now spent £130m in transfer fees alone during 2009 and manager Mark Hughes will be heartened by the news that defensive target Joleon Lescott has told Everton boss David Moyes he wants to speak to them about a move to Eastlands.</p>
              <p>Adebayor travelled to Manchester yesterday for a medical after a nervy 24 hours in which City feared the striker was hankering after a move to Chelsea. But the Togo striker's decision to join on wages of around £170,000 a week proves the club are deadly serious about breaking into the top four next season.</p>
              <p>Hughes confirmed: 'Emmanuel has shown his quality over many years. He is a proven scorer in the Premier League and for us it's all about having different options and carrying a goal threat, whoever we play. We have to get all our players to the right level so that in any given game we have the right combinations.'</p>
              <p>Having added Adebayor to three other attacking players signed in this transfer window - Carlos Tevez, Gareth Barry and Roque Santa Cruz - Hughes will now turn his attention to defence.</p>
              <p>City have already lodged two bids for Chelsea captain John Terry. Although an initial £15m offer for <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/everton.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Everton</span></a>'s Lescott was turned down, the player is keen to talk to Hughes about the City project where he would double his wages to £100,000.</p>

              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>While City fans lick their lips about what will happen once they kick off their Premier League campaign at Blackburn on August 15, their opening game of the galacticos era was a damp squib in the unlikely setting of Polokwane, a town four hours north of Johannesburg in an area better known for safari hunting than sport. </strong></p>
              <p>The 18,000 supporters roared their approval as one of South Africa's top teams, Orlando Pirates, gave City a lesson.</p>
              <p>Although Hughes left several big guns out, and others like Robinho and Micah Richards do not arrive for the three-game Vodacom Challenge until next week, there was enough quality on show with the likes of Stephen Ireland, Pablo Zabaleta, Michael Johnson and Martin Petrov all starting.</p>
              <p>Youngster Ben Mee conceded a 41stminute penalty which South Africa World Cup hopeful Lucas Thwala converted. City's Valeri Bojinov missed a sitter from six yards and Phenyo Mongala sealed the 2-0 victory after 55 minutes.</p>
              <p>Hughes said: 'You could tell our players were at different levels of conditioning and that will improve as time goes on. We have strengthened in midfield and attack in this window; defence is the only area that needs to be added to and we will be concentrating on that.'</p>
              <p>Striker Craig Bellamy is relishing the fierce competition for places. He said: 'This is my last chance to be part of a really big club and have a real good end to my career. I knew when I signed in January what could happen at City. I wanted to be part of it and I still do. If I stay fit, I definitely believe I can fight for a place.'</p>
              <p>City hope Adebayor may join them later in the tour and Hughes plans to play Tevez and Barry in the next game in Durban on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>They only arrived on Friday after a frantic promotional visit to Abu Dhabi.</p>
              <p>Hughes said: 'We are professionals and football is our business. So it's exciting to see what lies ahead.'</p>

              but I'm able to spend the money if we find the right players.</p>

              <p>"If we need to add something we will. Chamakh is one of the
              players we've followed and if we need to go for a striker he's a
              possibility. We're keeping an eye on him.</p>
              <p>"We have Rosicky and Eduardo back so we've lost a big striker but have gained two offensive players who were absent last season.</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p>Former <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> striker Emmanuel Adebayor says he hasn't joined <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> for money.</p>
              <p>"People who think that I have joined City for the money are wrong,”
              he told City's website. “If I had made a move for that reason then I
              would have been playing for Barcelona or Milan last season. They gave
              me bigger offers than Arsenal did for me to stay.</p>
              <p>“I am here because I was impressed by the way the chairman at
              City spoke to me about the ambition of this club. I want to be part of
              a club that is aiming to be one of the biggest in the world.”</p>
              <p>Adebayor, who will join up with his Blues teammates early next
              week, is adamant that he the Blues can bust into the top four sooner
              rather than later.</p>
              <p>“Why can’t we do that this season,” he asked. “We have everything we need. Now is better than in two or three years.</p>
              <p>“The chairman and everyone at City want this club to be one of
              the best in the world. We will fight to be that. I want to win
              silverware and trophies. That is my ambition. The team has got quality
              and a manager who knows what he wants and is a nice guy.</p>
              <p>“I want to show how I can help. Everyone at the club has shown
              me great respect and how they want to build something. I have a lot of
              ambition and want to be part of the City family. I know I have a lot to
              offer the team and I will work hard to make sure I help them.</p>
              <p>“I am happy and pleased to be here when you sign for a new club
              you just want to feel at home as quickly as possible and I do. The fans
              were amazing to me when I arrived.”</p>
