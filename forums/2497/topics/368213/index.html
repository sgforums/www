              <p><strong>Adebayor set for City, Terry next</strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Emmanuel Adebayor is set to become Manchester City's next signing - while another bid for Chelsea centre-back John Terry is on the cards.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>As Carlos Tevez was being unveiled, Adebayor was undergoing a medical and if a work permit is granted for the Togo forward, he could be on the flight to South Africa for City's three-match tour along with a growing number of star names.</p>
              <p>And if that was not enough, Hughes has certainly not given up on the prospect of signing Terry, even though he is currently adopting a diplomatic stance to a situation that may begin to unravel at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea attempt to discover their captain's intentions before they leave for the USA on Thursday.</p>
              <p>"I have had fantastic respect for John Terry since I saw him as a young player when I was at Chelsea," said Hughes. "He is a great player and an outstanding captain. Any manager would covet a player like that.</p>
              <p>"But we have to respect he plays for Chelsea."</p>
              <p>How long for remains to be seen. However, it certainly appears Adebayor's days at Arsenal are numbered.</p>
              <p>City officials remained silent on the prospect of a £25million transfer being speeded through, although Hughes - given his general reluctance to discuss possible new recruits - rather gave the game away by first confirming talks had taken place, then suggesting they were at quite an advanced stage.</p>
              <p>"There has been discussions between ourselves and Arsenal," he said.</p>
              <p>"It is not the right time or place to discuss it but yes, there has been contact and possibly there is a deal to be done.</p>
              <p>"It has not been concluded as we speak. Until it happens, it is not the time or the place to talk about it."</p>
              <p>If the deal goes through, it would bring the number of strikers at City's disposal to 10, four of which would have arrived since January alone, starting with Craig Bellamy.</p>
              <p>Spending since June 2008 would be touching £200million, with Hughes confirming City are still in the market for top-class talent, presumably defenders now with Joleon Lescott another target, in the most amazing spending spree English football has ever seen.</p>
              <p>"The idea is to have players of the highest quality in key areas of the field," he said. "You need the options and flexibility to change things. To have top players in key areas who can produce moments of magic to win games when the team are struggling is invaluable."</p>
              <p>Earlier in the summer, chairman Khaldoon al-Mubarak stated a top-six place was the aspiration for next term.</p>
              <p>However, at that time the Abu Dhabi United Group were preaching caution in the transfer market.</p>
              <p>Either funds that would make Real Madrid appear like skinflints are going to be made available in 12 months' time, or the original policy has changed - and presumably the targets as well.</p>
              <p>"The aim is to be as successful as we can," he said. "We have good players who have ability and potential.</p>
              <p>"Now we must work exceptionally hard as a group to make sure Manchester City get the success they have been longing for many years.</p>
              <p>"But it is a long season and there are other clubs who want the same prizes as ourselves and will work exceptionally hard to make it more difficult for us to achieve what we want.</p>
              <p>"But we feel we can compete. Whether or not we can get to the top table this year only time will tell. But the aim is there."</p>

              <p><span class="main-content"><strong>7.12 </strong> Reports in most of the morning newspapers claim Arsenal striker <strong>Emmanuel Adebayor</strong> is stalling on a move to Manchester City. He has been granted a work
                  permit, but is apparently waiting to see if any other clubs show an
                  interest. Will it be a long wait?</span></p>

              <p>Emmanuel
              Adebayor 
              was offered to 
              Manchester United 
              after negotiations 
              with Manchester City 
              over a £25million move from Arsenal stalled.</p>
              <p>The striker is thought to be 
              demanding £170,000 a week but 
              City have played hardball on 
              wages after establishing that 
              they are the only bidders.</p>

              <h1>Adebayor holds out for £2m loyalty bonus from Arsenal</h1>
              <p>Emmanuel Adebayor last night completed his £22million move to
                                      Manchester City - but remains locked in a battle with Arsenal over
                                      his £2m loyalty bonus.</p>
              <p>The Togo striker is adamant he is due the cash from the Gunners
                                      because he did not put in a transfer request.</p>
              <p>It is a demand that will leave Arsenal fans stunned as it was
                                      Adebayor’s apparent lack of commitment that soured their
                                      relationship with him.  </p>
              <p>The 25-year-old hit just 16 goals last season – as he courted
                                      the attentions of AC Milan – compared to the season before in which
                                      he smashed 30.  </p>
              <p>Adebayor – who will pick up £170,000-a-week at City – said his
                                      goodbyes to the Arsenal players and staff at the Gunners’ London
                                      Colney training ground yesterday.  </p>
              <p>He then travelled to Manchester to finalise the paperwork to
                                      complete the deal.  </p>
              <p>Adebayor’s wages at Eastlands will be around double what he was
                                      earning at the Emirates, with his agents set to pick up around £2m
                                      for their “services”.  </p>
              <p>But he is determined to squeeze Arsenal for one last pay day as
                                      revenge for agreeing the deal while he was on holiday in Togo.
                                       </p>
              <p>It is believed the shocked striker initially threatened to dig
                                      his heels in and refuse to join City after being told a fee had
                                      been agreed for him and that he had to leave.  </p>
              <p>He later relented after realising he had no future at the
                                      Emirates.  </p>
              <p>Andrey Arshavin is confident Arsenal can win the Champions
                                      League next season – even without Adebayor.</p>
              <p>The Gunners’ £15m Russian hitman said: “To win the Champions
                                      League means everything. We nearly did it last season, and I do not
                                      see big problems.  </p>
              <p>“Adebayor is an excellent striker. Everybody knows him and he
                                      can score from nothing. But we have Arsene Wenger. He knows if we
                                      need someone, then he will buy.”</p>

              <h1>Man City fume as Arsenal's Adebayor seeks Chelsea
                                      talks</h1>
              <div>
              <p><abbr><span>Chelsea</span></abbr> have been contacted
                                      by the advisors of <abbr><span>Arsenal</span></abbr> striker Emmanuel Adebayor in the last 24 hours - and
                                      <abbr><span>Manchester City</span></abbr> aren't
                                      happy.</p>
              <p>The <em>Daily Mail</em> says earlier this week Adebayor was
                                      offered to neighbours <abbr><span>Manchester
                                      United</span></abbr> when talks with City over personal terms of
                                      £170,000 a week looked to be in danger of collapse.</p>
              <p>There were indications yesterday that he was finally ready to
                                      agree a move to City and head up to Manchester for a medical. But
                                      the club were amazed to discover that the Togo forward has been
                                      touted to Chelsea as he continues to stall on a £25million move to
                                      Eastlands.</p>
              <p>Adebayor even met Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger yesterday over the
                                      possibility of staying at the Emirates for another season, but the
                                      Gunners are adamant they do not want him back and are keen to
                                      honour the deal agreed with City.</p>
              <p>In spite of the latest twist, City are resisting the temptation
                                      to pull the plug and will hold last-ditch talks this weekend aimed
                                      at resurrecting the transfer.</p>
