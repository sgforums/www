              <p><strong>Mark Hughes is about to be sacked by Manchester City after replacement 
              Roberto Mancini watched today's 4-3 win against Sunderland, according to 
              reports.</strong></p>
              <p>City will make a statement on Hughes' future at 7.30pm tonight. (3:30am)</p>
              <p>Former Inter Milan manager Mancini was at Eastlands to see what looks certain 
              to be Hughes' final game in charge and there are suggestions the Welshman knew 
              his fate before kick-off.</p>
              <p>Hughes' staff are allegedly set to walk out en masse in support of the 
              manager.</p>
              <p>
              </p><p>Hughes has lost only two games all season but a series of draws seem to have 
              made his position untenable and he was clearly emotional as he applauded the 
              crowd at the final whistle.</p>
              <p>Mancini won three Serie A titles with Inter after cup-winning spells bossing 
              Fiorentina and Lazio, but was replaced by Jose Mourinho for failing to win the 
              Champions League.</p>
              <p>He is said to be a friend of City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak.</p>

              <p>Yeah sacked Hughes... he was never the right man for this job, never a proven manager... at most he is capable of handling some mid table teams, that all...</p>
              <p>Mancini is cool... Till today i still wonder why did inter part with him though he won 3 consecutive serie A titles with inter... Is it just because of Mourinho?</p>
              <p>With Mancini in, then we would see 4 great manager battling it out (fergy, ancelotti, wenger and mancini). Also lets not forget we have some mediocre managers in Rafa, redknappe and o'neil..</p>

              <p>Though City have only lost twice in the Premier League
              this season, a run of two wins in 11 matches has proved to be his
              downfall.</p>
              <p>The thrilling 4-3 home win over Sunderland on Saturday, which was watched by <a class=" lingo_link" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12.1667px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;" title="Mouse over ^ icon to search." rel="nofollow" href="http://topics.skysports.com/Roberto+Mancini/?section=football">Mancini,</a><img id="lingo_icon" class="lingo_icon lingo_icon_black" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 0pt ! important; padding: 0pt; float: none; position: static; left: auto; top: auto; line-height: normal; background-color: transparent; visibility: visible; width: 12px; height: 12px; background-repeat: no-repeat; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: top; display: inline; cursor: pointer;" src="http://static.lingospot.com/spot/image/spacer.gif" alt=""> was Hughes' last game at the helm.</p>

              <h4>No evidence</h4>
              <p>"Prior
              to the current season beginning, with significant investment in players
              and infrastructure in place, the consensus between the board and
              coaching staff was that appropriate agreed targets should be set for
              the 2009/2010 season," said <a class=" lingo_link" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12.1667px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;" title="Mouse over ^ icon to search." rel="nofollow" href="http://topics.skysports.com/Al+Mubarak/?section=football">Al Mubarak</a><img id="lingo_icon" class="lingo_icon  lingo_icon_black" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 0pt ! important; padding: 0pt; float: none; position: static; left: auto; top: auto; line-height: normal; background-color: transparent; visibility: visible; width: 12px; height: 12px; background-repeat: no-repeat; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: top; display: inline; cursor: pointer;" src="http://static.lingospot.com/spot/image/spacer.gif" alt=""> on the club's <em>official website</em>.</p>
              <p>"The
              targets were agreed as a result of the player acquisition strategy of
              the club being radically accelerated in the summer as a result of very
              favourable conditions for any buying club.</p>
              <p>"It was also based
              on the fact that the infrastructure of the club had been overhauled
              completely at great cost in order to create the best possible
              environment for the team.</p>
              <p>"A return of two wins in 11 Premier
              League games is clearly not in line with the targets that were agreed
              and set. Sheikh Mansour and the board felt that there was no evidence
              that the situation would fundamentally change.</p>
              <p>"This is a
              particularly difficult announcement given the personal investment over
              the past 15 months on all sides and we would like to put on record our
              respect for and thanks to Mark Hughes and we wish him the best in his
              future career."</p>

              on the appointment of Mancini, Al Mubarak said: "Roberto is a hugely
              experienced manager with a proven track record of winning trophies and
              championships.</p>
              <p>"His experience and track record speak for themselves.</p>

              <p>"My hope is that our incredible fans will join us in welcoming Roberto to the football club."</p>
              <p>Brian
              Kidd has been named as Mancini's assistant, while Hughes' backroom
              staff of Mark Bowen, Eddie Niedzwiecki, Kevin Hitchcock and Glyn Hodges
              have also left the club.</p>

              <p>Getting Mancini is indeed a big risk. He won Serie A title with Inter when all other top Italian team was in bad form becos of scandal.</p>
              <p>But one thing for sure, Mancini is an all round attacking football style manager and not like typical English mananger which they can only thing of attacking from wing. He is a bit like Spanish style manager.</p>

              <p>Why Inter parted with him was, If I recalled correctly, there was once when Inter played Liverpool in the CL, Inter lost and Mancini kind of lost it and said he would quit or step down or something like that only to change his mind a few days later... But by then, the Inter board maybe thought he was unstable and had lost patience with his flip-flop behaviour and decided to go for Jose...</p>
              <p>This Mancini is kind of like Kenny Dalglish... If the pressure gets too great, he can flip kind... But I belief is could be a better manager than Ancelotti... When he took over Inter, Lotti's AC were blown out of the water...</p>

              <p><br>Agreed. After they stunned the heavyweights Man U, Chelsea and Liverpool in this period. Unlike last season, Villans failed to do so. The most they can do was to get a draw. Now, teamwork, buying of better players and early elimination of Europa League have built their strengths better.</p>
              <p>If the current Liverpool owner steps down, surely Ah Ben won't stay Liverpool for long.</p>

              <p>O Neil lost it because they lack the depth last year. For now they got lots of depth, they got Collins, Beye, and Dunne for defence! The also added depth to the horsepower such as Downing and Heskey. They also promoted their own youngster Albrighton.</p>

              <p>Yes they are a better side this season, and they have bought a few new players... But at the same time, they have lost a few too like Barry and their captain Laursen...</p>
              <p>If there is something quite similar to Pool is, They were bought by American owners too. But compare to Pool's American owners, O'Neill had very little funds to buy players... So he made every one counted. Players like Warnock, Collins, Beye and Dunne were all bought on the cheap...</p>
              <p>But it takes time to rebuild if there are little funds... He had to replaced his centre-back pair of Mellberg and Laursen with Dunne and Collins... Replacing his striker Angel with Heskey or Carew at the same time promote from the youth team players like Agbonlahor... He also had to changed his midfield replacing McCann with Sidwell and youngster Milner...</p>
              <p>At the same time he has bought some potential ones for the future in Curtis Davies and Downing like he did with A Young... Overall, good management but I still feel the squad is a little small but better than last year's... If no long term injuries to main players, should be able to get 4th spot... </p>

              <p>Like what someone else has said, O Neil is not a bad manager and shouldn't be called mediocre. Aston Villa has definitely progressed over the years under him. Of his former clubs, Celtic were stronger in Europe under him and at Leicester City, the club's fortunes totally dipped after he left.</p>
              <p>Likewise for Harry Redknapp, his abscence was always sorely felt each time after he left the club. Harry Redknapp is a good man manager and he is always able to get players to work well under him, be it young players or older players whom people think that they have nothing else to offer.</p>
