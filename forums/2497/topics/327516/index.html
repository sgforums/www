              <h1>Chelsea plan world-record swoop to lure Kaka from AC Milan's clutches</h1>
              <h2>Chelsea are set to smash the world record for a transfer fee in order to sign AC Milan's Kaka, however, they are being forced to wait until 2009 before bringing the Brazilian to Stamford Bridge.</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/00791/kaka0815afp_791007c.jpg" alt="Chelsea are hoping to make Kaka the world's most expensive player - Chelsea plan world-record swoop to lure Kaka from AC Milan " width="460" height="288"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The west London club have been pursuing the Fifa World Player of the Year all summer in the hope of finally persuading him to swap Milan for London and were confident that the appointment as Chelsea coach of Kaka's compatriot and the man who handed him his Brazil debut as a 19 year old, Luiz Felipe Scolari, would help to convince him of the merits of such a move.</strong></p>
              <p>However, the Milanese club have been stubborn in their insistence that the playmaker is not for sale at any price, although at the same time they have indicated to Chelsea that they may be willing to do business in the future.</p>
              <p>Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is said to be willing to pay whatever it takes to seal his dream transfer and has requisitioned several leading agents in order to make the deal happen.</p>
              <p>Standing in his way at present, though, is the fact that Kaka put pen to paper on a new five-year contract worth £6.5 million per year after tax only last April, a deal that increases in value every year until 2013.</p>
              <p>If the player was to sign, therefore, he would need to be offered a wage packet in excess of the £135,000 a week that both club captain John Terry and Frank Lampard, after his new deal this week, earn at Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Just last month, Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani stated that his club had turned down an "enormous offer" from Chelsea for Kaka, something that has not been denied by his counterpart at Stamford Bridge, Peter Kenyon, and Chelsea would certainly need to break the current record for a transfer fee, the £48m that Real Madrid paid to secure the services of Zinedine Zidane from Juventus in 2001, in order to land the player.</p>
              <p>But Kaka, despite the fact that Milan are not competing in this season's European Cup following their surprise fifth-placed finish in Serie A last time out, would never agitate for a transfer himself and would only move if Milan gave it the go-ahead.</p>
              <p>A similar strategy was used by Chelsea to lure the former darling of San Siro, Andriy Shevchenko, from Milan, a move nobody thought possible at the time, only for three years of continual talks to finally yield their rewards with his eventual transfer to the Bridge in 2006.</p>
              <p>That means that Chelsea have only one remaining target before the transfer window closes on Aug 31, Kaka's compatriot Robinho. The club had a £19.7m bid turned down by Madrid earlier in the week, with the Spanish champions wanting nearer the £30m mark, but Scolari is said to be happy with his existing squad, although Chelsea still hold out hope of bringing the playmaker to the club after the Brazil international's contract talks with Madrid broke down.</p>
              <p>"He's the type of player who brings some difference to Chelsea and if we can bring that one off then he would add to the squad," Kenyon said.</p>
              <p>"If it doesn't, then we're not going to win or lose because of Robinho."</p>

              <p>i dont think so.</p>
              <p>i dont think kaka will move to chelsea. maybe he can look at sheva again.</p>
              <p>if kaka want to move, i dont think he lack of admirers such as real madrid or barca.</p>
              <p>Seriously, i dont think any top player want to join chelsea.</p>
              <p>especially the club is run like a russian Putin style mafia organisation.</p>
