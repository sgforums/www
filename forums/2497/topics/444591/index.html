              <p><strong><span>Nicolas Anelka quits </span><span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span><span> this weekend, still fuming after a snub from the management over the staff Christmas party. </span></strong>
              </p><p><span>Anelka, who is leaving to join big-spending Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua, was overlooked for last week's silver service lunch at the club's Cobham training ground. </span></p>
              <p><span>Chelsea put on the lavish banquet for the first team squad, reserves and management for Christmas, hiring waitresses especially for the occasion. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>One friend of Anelka, who has spent nearly five years at the club, described his omission as 'an insult' after a successful career at Stamford Bridge. <br></span></p>
              <div id="ext-gen3449" class="moduleHalf"> 
              <div class="sport item"><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ChelseaMail"></a><span>The striker feels aggrieved after playing a big part in the club's recent history, winning the Barclays Premier League title under Carlo Ancelotti and picking up two FA Cups. <br></span></div>
              </div>
              <p><span>Anelka has told friends he has always given 100 per cent for the club and has never caused problems with the management at Chelsea.</span></p>
              <p><span>Boss Andre Villas-Boas had already ordered the Frenchman's locker to be emptied after the club accepted his transfer request earlier this month. </span></p>
              <p><span>Along with Alex, he was excluded from the first-team squad and the dressing rooms at Cobham as soon as the club agreed to sell the pair. </span></p>
              <p><span>They were ordered to park their vehicles in the community car park and had been changing in the academy facilities for training. </span></p>
              <p><span>Anelka has signed a two-year deal to play football in China, but he intends to return to England at the end of the deal. </span></p>
              <p><span>The former France striker, who will join the ninth club of his professional career when he moves to Shanghai Shenhua, has told friends he will retire in England. </span></p>
              <p><span>Defender Alex, who is also quitting Chelsea, has flown back to Brazil and is trying to find another club.</span></p>
