              </p><p><strong>Perspective is a rare commodity in the Barclays Premier League, but Martin 
              O’Neill, win or lose, manages better than most to take a calm overview in the 
              final analysis. Aston Villa’s 3-0 defeat to Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on 
              Sunday, he believes, should be taken in the context of an excellent season at 
              the Midlands club. </strong></p>
              <p>Similarly, the Villa manager takes a considered stance on the reported demise 
              of Liverpool, who visit Villa Park this evening. Rafael Benítez’s side may have 
              slipped out of the Champions League and are well off the pace in the Premier 
              League but, O’Neill says, a revival in their fortunes may be imminent.</p>
              <p>“Liverpool have lost a few games more than they would have thought,” O’Neill 
              said. “Last season, they were terrific. They went through the whole season and 
              lost two games. After three games of this season, they had lost two games, but 
              they are getting a bit of momentum again.</p>
              <p>“It was a big win for them at Anfield against Wolves [2-0] at the weekend. I 
              heard Arsenal were supposed to be imploding last season, just about February 
              time, when I think they were in the middle of a 21-game unbeaten run. They 
              finished the season very strongly and Liverpool are capable of doing the same 
              thing.</p>
              <p>
              </p><p>“They are capable because it’s Liverpool Football Club. Look at Arsenal now. 
              Four weeks ago, they were being written off for the title; now they are right 
              bang in there. That’s what can happen with the top clubs.</p>
              <p>“I’m not too bothered about who says what [after the Arsenal defeat]. I 
              didn’t get too carried away when we went to Old Trafford a couple of weeks ago 
              and won there. It was three points, it was a boost to confidence and it was 
              terrific. But, equally, any side can go to Arsenal and get beaten. I wouldn’t 
              start to think the result was a major shock all over Europe. You can get beaten. 
              What we have to do is fight back against Liverpool.”</p>
              <p>Richard Dunne, the Villa central defender, concurs. Even with Ashley Young 
              absent tonight because of suspension, Dunne sees no reason for panic.</p>
              <p>“We’ve done well, we’ve not got overly confident and started to believe in 
              stuff,” he said. “We can’t let [the Arsenal] result set us back. We just have to 
              forget about it and move on to Tuesday night. There are so many teams who are 
              losing games and then, a couple of weeks later, are back in it. The manager just 
              told us the main thing is how we react to defeats and [tonight] is the perfect 
              opportunity against another side who are pushing for the top four. We have to 
              put in a performance and get back on track.”</p>
              <p>Alberto Aquilani, who made his first Premier League start in the win over 
              Wolverhampton Wanderers, remains convinced that Liverpool are a better team than 
              their form suggests. The Italy midfield player readily admits, however, that he 
              needs to improve his fitness if he is to come to terms with the speed of the 
              English game and become a first-team regular.</p>
              <p>“I really enjoyed the game as it was important for me,” he said. “But I want 
              to improve my fitness. It was so different to anything I have experienced; it 
              was so quick and you never really had much time. The football we played was so 
              fast, but the most important thing was that we won.</p>
              <p>“We need to improve our confidence, we need to keep winning games to move up 
              the table. It is crucial to take things step by step but our aim is now to win 
              three, four and five games in a row. If we can do that, we will see where that 
              takes us. The team does not deserve it’s current low standing. We’ve had 
              difficulties, but we will come out of this.”</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rafa Benitez</span></abbr> admits he may hold back Alberto Aquilani from tonight's clash with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Aston Villa</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Benitez is aware that although Aquilani adds flair and creativity, he
              has been considered too lightweight at times for the English game
              during his opening months at Anfield.</p>
              <p>Benitez said: "Aquilani did well against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Wolves</span></abbr>, but he needs match fitness. He was trying to be involved, passing and creating chances, but the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> is difficult and he will settle down little by little.</p>
              <p>"It is a difficult decision with the Villa game coming so quickly. Some of our players were very tired after the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Wolves</span></abbr> match, while some had little injuries. We will need to assess them all.</p>
              <p>"We will have to manage them carefully but clearly if Javier
              Mascherano is not available for the next three games through
              suspension, then Aquilani will obviously have more chance of time on
              the pitch.</p>
              <p>"But against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Wolves</span></abbr> he was worried about his hamstring, he was concerned and I wanted to protect him. That is why we took him off."</p>

              helping to make his guarantee of a top-four place a reality.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Italian says Liverpool are targeting a five-match winning 
              streak to ease the pressure on their under-fire boss. And that means crushing Aston Villa in front of their own fans 
              tonight to notch up a second successive win.</p>
              <p class="article">Aquilani, 25, finally made his first Premier League start in 
              Saturday's 2-0 home victory over Wolves. And the injury-plagued midfielder is determined to show Benitez 
              his gamble in paying Roma £20million for him will be paid off, by helping the 
              Reds close in on a Champions League spot.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "I enjoyed the Wolves game, as it was so important for 
              me. Now I want to improve my fitness.</p>

              our confidence and we need to keep winning games to move up the table.</p>
              <p class="article">"It is crucial to take things step by step but our aim is now 
              to win five games in a row. If we can do that, we will see where that takes us.</p>
              <p class="article">"Now we have to face Villa and it is a very important game for 
              our season but we are feeling good and it is important that we try to win."</p>
              <p class="article">Aquilani was treated to a standing ovation when he was 
              substituted after 85 minutes against Wolves. And with Javier Mascherano still banned, Aquilani can expect 
              another start at Villa Park.</p>
              <p class="article">Liverpool head to the Midlands bidding to win back-to-back 
              Premier League games for the first time since September 26.</p>
              <p class="article">Villa proved their own Champions League potential with a 3-1 
              win at Anfield in August - the first time Liverpool had lost a home game in the 
              league for over a year.</p>
              <p class="article">Another defeat tonight would be a huge setback to Benitez's 
              pledge to steer Liverpool into the top four once again by the middle of May. But at least history is on their side. They have won seven and 
              drawn five of their last 12 visits.</p>
              <p class="article">The last time Villa beat the Reds on home soil was 2-1 back in 
              February 1998 with a Stan Collymore double. Benitez said: "Villa are a good side. They are doing really 
              well so it's an important game for us.</p>
              <p class="article">"We know they are dangerous from set-pieces so we'll have to be 
              careful. "They have spent some money this season and have some good 
              players with pace - but so do we."</p>

              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Martin O'Neill" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/martin-o-neill"><strong>Martin O'Neill</strong></a><strong> believes </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Liverpool" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><strong>Liverpool</strong></a><strong> are in the 
              throes of recovery following their poor first half of the season and are capable 
              of putting together a long unbeaten run to mount a credible challenge for the 
              top four. The Northern Irishman highlighted Arsenal's resurgence last season, 
              when Arsène Wenger's side went 21 matches without defeat to overhaul Everton and 
              Villa and qualify for the Champions League, and spoke of his belief that 
              Liverpool could do the same over the next few months.</strong></p>
              <p>Liverpool are five points behind Villa following Saturday's victory over 
              Wolverhampton Wanderers and O'Neill senses "they are getting a bit of momentum 
              again" ahead of tomorrow night's pivotal meeting between the two clubs. "It was 
              a big win for them at Anfield against Wolves at the weekend," said the Villa 
              manager, who expects a positive response from his side following yesterday's 
              chastening defeat at Arsenal. "We've got to be right ourselves, but they 
              [Liverpool] are still in there.</p>
              <p>"I heard Arsenal were supposed to be imploding last season, just about 
              February time, when I think they were in the middle of a 21-game unbeaten run. 
              They finished the season very, very strongly and Liverpool are capable of doing 
              the same thing. They are capable because it's Liverpool Football Club. Look at 
              Arsenal now. Four weeks ago they were being written off for the title and now 
              they are right bang in there. That's what can happen with the top clubs."</p>
              <p>O'Neill is aware Villa will come under the microscope in the wake of the 
              defeat at Arsenal, with questions again being asked about their ability to stay 
              the course and avoid a repeat of their collapse last season. The Villa manager 
              maintains, however, that losing against Arsenal is no disgrace and has urged his 
              players to pick themselves up and respond with a victory over Liverpool that 
              would see them regain fourth spot from Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
              <p>"I'm not too bothered about who says what," said O'Neill, who will be without 
              the suspended Ashley Young. "I didn't get too carried away when we went to Old 
              Trafford a couple of weeks ago and won there. It was three points, it was a 
              boost to confidence and it was terrific. But equally any side can go to Arsenal 
              and get beaten, so I wouldn't start to think the result was a major shock all 
              over Europe. But what we have to do is fight back against Liverpool and try to 
              win."</p>

              <p>He shocked me by saying he is 100% behind Ah Ben.</p>
              <p>Surprised that still got local fans standing behind Ah Ben.</p>

              <p>Lucky they won this morning or else Ah Ben can go for early retirement in New Year.</p>

              <p><br>Of course there are plenty of able managers around... You just have to do your homework and find him that's all... Someone like Mancini was consider not good enough for some Pool fans earlier but look at what he have done at City...</p>
              <p>Paying that $20m or maybe lesser I believed they can afford it if they are resolute with going through with it. Many things could be going on behind the scene we are not aware of... Like rumour of Pool looking up Mancini in late Oct or early Nov...</p>
