              <p><span><strong>Manchester City were last night in talks with Edin Dzeko’s agent over the fine details of a £30million transfer from German club Wolfsburg. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Sportsmail understands that Wolfsburg have finally been persuaded to talk over a deal that would include a down payment of €35m (£30m) as well as some performance-related add-ons.</span></p>
              <p><span>The deal is not yet set in stone and cannot be completed until the transfer window opens next week across Europe. </span></p>
              <p><span>However, the fact that Dzeko’s agent — recently a guest of City at the Manchester derby — has travelled to England for talks is indicative of how confident City are of completing what is likely be the biggest transfer of January. </span></p>
              <p><span>City tried all last summer to sign the giant Bosnian striker but were thwarted by the huge fee placed on his head by the Bundesliga club that is owned by car giants Volkswagen.</span></p>
              <p><span>Indeed, as recently as last week, City were being told they would have to pay £38m for him. </span></p>
              <p><span>However, City coach Roberto Mancini has implored the board at Eastlands to do all they can to sign a player he feels could make the difference between winning the Barclays Premier League and finishing in the top four. </span></p>
              <p><span>What is helping Mancini’s cause is the fact that Dzeko himself has made it clear he wants to come to City. As Sportsmail revealed before Christmas, he took the extraordinary step of writing to City confirming his interest back in August.</span></p>

              <p>with their current players and more reinforcements to come, i really think city will be a force to be with reckoned with next season. And I have been watching their games. They had a shaky start to their seasons but the last 4 weeks or so, their teamwork has been improving. With quality players and a good rapport in the play, this kind of team is championship material.</p>
              <p>But then again, now they sit joint top with utd.....it  looks cosmetically pretty to me. They are 2 games ahead of utd. So when it comes to the stage when all clubs have equal no. of matches played, it may tell a different story.</p>

              <p><strong>Manchester City have made contact with Anderlecht over teenage striker Romelu Lukaku to say they are ready to meet the £18million asking price.</strong></p>
              <p>The 17-year-old has been the subject of strong interest from Real Madrid and Chelsea, while Arsenal have also watched him extensively, but Anderlecht's valution has left a limited market with City ready to flex their financial muscle if they can convince him to move to Manchester.</p>
