              <h1>My 10 players to watch in the 2011-12 Premier League season<br></h1>
              <p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
              <p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
              <p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
              <p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
              <p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
              <p style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>These are the 10 players I am especially excited to be watching this season. </strong></span></p>
              <p style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">In some cases, they may be players who are breaking through or settling in and I have tried to mix it up with newcomers as well as established players; but all are challenged to make an impact at their clubs. It's a group of players who really make you realise the season is close. I will be watching to see how they develop. </span></p>
              <p style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-style: italic;">My 10 last season worked out OK. I wonder if these will live up to the expectation. </span></span></p>
              <p><span>
              </span></p><p><br></p>
              <p></p>
              <div class="pageBreak"> </div>
              <p><span><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Phil Jones (Manchester United) </span></strong><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">This lad is quick, covers the ground well and is happy holding in front of the back four as well as playing as a central defender. Manchester United weren't the only club to be watching him - he could have had a pick of five or six - and I am excited about him. He could become a mainstay for England quickly too and looks to be a potential future England captain. </span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br></span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/08/07/article-2023516-0D50CBC300000578-141_468x354.jpg" alt="Big potential: Phil Jones has all the attributes required to be a future England captain" width="468" height="354"></span>
              <p class="imageCaption">Big potential: Phil Jones has all the attributes to be a future England captain</p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Sir Alex Ferguson has now signed Jones and Chris Smalling to challenge the mighty Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand. What I like about Jones especially is that he is confident without being arrogant. He will back himself to find a way into the team and, with Rio missing a number of games through injury last season, Jones may well make a push for being a regular, once he deals with the demands of playing for a big club. He is strong in the tackle, mobile and a modern central defender who is also comfortable on the ball. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span><strong style="background-color: #ff0000;">David de Gea (Manchester United) </strong><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He is a terrific goalkeeper, who arrives with a big fee (£17.8m) and a big reputation - but they are giant gloves to fill at Manchester United, where Edwin van der Sar's footwork was as important as his shot-stopping. At least De Gea will have Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand on guard in front of him but his concentration will be vital. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/08/07/article-2023516-0D57217A00000578-241_468x308.jpg" alt="Big gloves to fill: David de Gea has the unenviable task of replacing Edwin van der Sar" width="468" height="308"></span>
              <p class="imageCaption">Big gloves to fill: David de Gea has the unenviable task of replacing Edwin van der Sar</p>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">When you are Manchester United's goalkeeper, there are often long periods of doing nothing. Then, when you are called into action, you have to be ready. The English league will be different from the Spanish, where he seems to have conceded a lot of goals from distance. In that respect he had the worst record in La Liga last season, but that may be deceiving. He is agile, exciting and has huge promise. How he deals with the mistakes will be crucial, like all young goalkeepers. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">
              </span></p><p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p><span><strong>Luis Suarez (Liverpool) </strong><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">I know the Liverpool dressing room really fancies him and he has what it takes to be a big star in the Barclays Premier League. He is a dynamic match-winner; a goalscorer who looked to have settled quickly after his move from Holland and the Liverpool fans have taken to him. Unlike Andy Carroll, who is still trying to fit in at Anfield, Suarez looks at home. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br></span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/08/07/article-2023516-0D058DB8000005DC-933_468x304.jpg" alt="King Luis: Suarez settled quickly at Anfield last season" width="468" height="304"></span>
              <p class="imageCaption">King Luis: Suarez settled quickly at Anfield last season</p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">A long Copa America campaign for Uruguay might require some rest - and means he has missed Liverpool's pre-season campaign. But it didn't take long for him to look a typical Kenny Dalglish-type signing last season, so his absence from a disappointing pre-season programme shouldn't knock him out of his stride. He's quick, direct, can dribble and finish. What's not to like about him? If Liverpool are to have a big season he will be critical to their chances of progress. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>Rafael van der Vaart (Tottenham) </strong><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Using a bit of inside knowledge from the Tottenham camp, I can share with you that he has looked the part during the pre-season build-up. My dad, Harry, is very happy with the Dutchman's progress; he is flying. He showed glimpses of genius last season and finished as top scorer, but he struggled to last 90 minutes in the dash and crash of the Premier League. Was it a fitness issue or was there a lack of steam? He always seemed like he was touch and go to play in matches and needs to build up his fitness for the season ahead. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br></span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/08/07/article-2023516-0BB6D1A900000578-478_468x286.jpg" alt="Crowd pleaser: The Tottenham faithful took Rafael van der Vaart to their hearts last season" width="468" height="286"></span>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">An eye-catching player, who hits a great free kick. His popularity at The Lane, where they have enjoyed entertainers over the years, is evidence of his ability. He has also played for big clubs throughout his career and knows what it takes to be a winner. A second season can always be more demanding for a player, but he has what it takes to cope with the extra attention and remain a matchwinner. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff; font-size: x-small;">Scott Sinclair (S</span></strong><span><strong>wansea) </strong><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He's been on loan here, there and everywhere without finding a home - until now. Manager Brendan Rodgers has worked on his confidence and given him a platform to use his explosive pace, coming from the left side, where he is told to hug the wing and wait for openings. The problem will be that those openings don't come very often in the Premier League and, against better defenders who will be more comfortable with dealing with his pace, he will have to take his chances when they arrive. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br></span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/08/07/article-2023516-0C562B3100000578-721_468x310.jpg" alt="Key man: Scott Sinclair (right) scored a hat-trick for Swansea in the play-off final (above)" width="468" height="310"></span>
              <p class="imageCaption">Key man: Scott Sinclair (right) scored a hat-trick for Swansea in the play-off final (above)</p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Put him in a red shirt and he would remind you of Theo Walcott and, like Theo, he can run down blind alleys, so he will have to be selective and more versatile. When confident and in form, he is a threat. He covers the ground quickly with a short and explosive stride pattern. He scored a hat-trick in the Championship play-off final, despite rarely being in the game. His frightening pace will be Swansea's biggest weapon in what will be a hard season ahead. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">
              </span></p><p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p><span><strong style="background-color: #ff0000;">Connor Wickham (Sunderland) </strong><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Big, strong, powerful boy who is quick for his size and is a direct, old-fashioned centre forward. A lot of bigger clubs looked at him and some scouts were undecided; I've seen him on good and bad days too. But when he is good, he looks a talent and I am looking forward to seeing him stepping into the Premier League after his time in the Championship with Ipswich. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br></span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/08/07/article-2023516-0D3B1DAF00000578-214_468x300.jpg" alt="Powerful: Connor Wickham could prove to be a bargain for Sunderland" width="468" height="300"></span>
              <p class="imageCaption">Powerful: Connor Wickham could prove to be a bargain for Sunderland</p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The responsibility of leading the line for Sunderland (and stepping into Darren Bent's boots) is a tough challenge for the teenager, but his capture is an exciting one and decent value for money (£8million) too when you consider how much Liverpool paid for Andy Carroll (£35m). I like what Sunderland have done this summer; they have been positive in the transfer market when other clubs have been ponderous. The board have supported Steve Bruce, who I like as a manager. Now his signings have to deliver for him and Wickham's goals will be important. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>Robin van Persie (Arsenal) </strong><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">To put it simply: if he stays fit, he wins the golden boot and Arsenal enjoy a fantastic season. I know I often write about him in my regular <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span> column, but that is because he is a sensational footballer and one of the Premier League's poster boys. He plays on the edge with an arrogance and a swagger. His goals-per-game ratio is excellent, he can score from distance and executes chances with a range of finishing. He strikes the ball cleanly and is lethal all around the box. Arsenal have endured another difficult summer, but he is still there and can be their talisman. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br></span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/08/07/article-2023516-0D3EE2EF00000578-901_468x293.jpg" alt="Talisman: Arsenal are a much better side when Robin van Persie is fit" width="468" height="293"></span>
              <p class="imageCaption">Talisman: Arsenal are a much better side when Robin van Persie is fit</p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Sorry to return to it, but his fitness is so important. He doesn't play enough games. Get him out on the pitch more and Arsenal will win more games. Broke the record last season for scoring in successive away games (nine in nine), which shows us all what he can do... when fit. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>Charles N'Zogbia (Aston Villa) </strong><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Look at his goals record from last season when he scored 10 in a struggling side. He's the reason Wigan stayed in the Premier League. His strengths are that he is quick, dynamic and is an old-fashioned dribbler. Remember the two goals he scored against West Ham in a crucial game at the end of last season that condemned them to relegation. It showed he can perform in pressure games. The next challenge will be to prove he can step it up, deal with the big fee Villa have paid (£9.5million) and continue to run matches. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br></span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/08/07/article-2023516-0D539EFE00000578-777_468x292.jpg" alt="Full of tricks: Signing Charles N'Zogbia may prove to be a shrewd bit of business by Alex McLeish" width="468" height="292"></span>
              <p class="imageCaption">Full of tricks: Signing Charles N'Zogbia may prove to be a shrewd bit of business by Alex McLeish</p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">I like his direct style and he can step into Ashley Young's boots and prove to be an astute signing by Alex McLeish. He can sometimes be moody, which affected him at Newcastle and, at times, during his stay at Wigan. It may explain why bigger clubs than Villa considered him too risky. But he is maturing, exciting and will give Villa fans those edge-of-the-seat moments. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>Adel Taarabt (QPR) </strong><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He will polarise opinions, but Adel could be the most skilful player in the Premier League. He is the playmaker extraordinaire for newly-promoted QPR and Neil Warnock has done well to get the best out of him, allowing his daring play not to be a negative influence on the team pattern. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br></span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/08/07/article-2023516-0D37E62F00000578-120_468x300.jpg" alt="Playmaker extraordinaire: Queen's Park Rangers captain Adel Taarabt" width="468" height="300"></span>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Sometimes they will need two balls; one for him and one for the rest of </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">the team and he will get subbed after 30 minutes one week, then win a match single-handedly the next. How will Warnock incorporate such a maverick into his team, especially away from home where you need to keep it tight? Only a handful of players can do what he can do with a ball. Frustratingly brilliant. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong><span style="background-color: #00ccff;">Sergio Aguero (Manchester City) </span><br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Manchester City's new Mighty Mouse. Once Kevin Keegan's nickname at Hamburg, now Aguero is the new big-name arrival in the Premier League and all eyes will be cast in his direction. A stunning volleyer of the ball, he loves to hit it on the full and reminds me of the technique and expertise of Mark Hughes with that skill. He also loves to get the ball into the box with his back to goal and can hold up the play, or spin and run at defenders. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br></span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/08/07/article-2023516-0D57484D00000578-408_468x286.jpg" alt="Signing of the season?

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">How City play him will be fascinating. They have so many strikers and Roberto Mancini seems to prefer a 4-3-3 formation with two wide, allowing Yaya Toure to gallop through the middle to support. Aguero has played in a 4-4-2 for Atletico Madrid, alongside Diego Forlan, so how will that work with Balotelli and Dzeko; not to mention Tevez, Adebayor, Santa Cruz, Bellamy...? Aguero will be first pick, that's for sure. And he is the most exciting addition to the Premier League for years. Surely City must finish in the top two. </span></p>

              <p>Cannot be on purpose, cos he just looked inexperienced to the situation... Not coming out fast enough, hesitated... Then went down too early like expecting the header to be downwards rather than at a higher level... Formerly, Vds would have stayed standing to cover the higher areas and used his legs if it was a header downwards... The Gal's inexperienced showed when he opt to go down early in order to use his hands for the low shot I think...</p>
              <p>The second one... it's just poor concentration from the gal's part... Yes, the ball was powerful and fast but it was within his space, so no excuse there...</p>
              <p>Anyway, this is normally what you get with a new keeper... Somemore he is totally new not just to the club, but to the premier league and it's style as well... and given his age... more mistakes will be made during the season... It's how fast he learn that's what will matters... He did make 2 very good blocks though... So there may be hope still...</p>
