              <p><span><strong>Chelsea want Guus Hiddink back as part of the rebuilding process that saw them sign Fernando Torres for £50million. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Dutchman Hiddink, who spent three successful months at Stamford Bridge as caretaker manager in 2009, is the man owner Roman Abramovich would like to replace Frank Arnesen as sporting director when his contract expires this summer. </span></p>
              <p><span>Chelsea’s billionaire owner intends to stand by head coach Carlo Ancelotti for at least one more season, but Abramovich is known to be looking for a high-profile figure to bring footballing clout to the club’s executive tier.</span></p>
              <p><span>Chelsea have held talks with Txiki Begiristain, but the former Barcelona sporting director is not keen on the role because Abramovich’s influence does not give him complete freedom to recruit players. </span></p>
              <p><span>West Ham manager Avram Grant has also been linked to the job because of his connections with the Russian owner, but Hiddink would be a popular appointment with the players and fans. </span></p>
              <p><span>He parted company with Russia last year and signed a two-year contract to manage Turkey, but is already under pressure. After three wins, his team have lost their last three and trail Germany and Austria in qualification for Euro 2012. </span></p>
              <p><span>Defeat against the Austrians next month could cost Hiddink his job. Torres, meanwhile, is relieved to have left behind the hysteria surrounding his switch to Chelsea last week.</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>The FA will probe the ugly scenes that saw irate Liverpool supporters throw objects at the Spaniard during his lacklustre debut on Sunday.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Torres was subjected to a torrent of abuse from fans who were still smarting at their former idol’s transfer deadline-day move.</span></p>
              <p><span>The 26-year-old, who yesterday joined up with Spain for their friendly against Colombia, admitted: ‘I’ve spent five very intense days and I come to Spain to enjoy my time with my team-mates and forget the last week. </span></p>
              <p><span>‘I’ve said that I understood how the Liverpool supporters feel. I’ve been a fan of a team and felt the same. But teams are more important than any player. My move, it is so recent, with time the fans will be fairer.’</span></p>

              <p><span>Referee Andre Marriner reported the incidents and FA chiefs will contact Liverpool and Chelsea to ask for their observations.</span></p>
              <p><span>Goalkeeper Pepe Reina has called on fans to forgive Torres, saying: ‘People naturally do not understand it, but I think they should make an effort to keep what he has given the club over the past three years.’</span></p>
