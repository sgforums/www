              <p><strong>Police were reportedly called to the home of Chelsea striker Didier
              Drogba after the Ivory Coast forward's partner became embroiled in an
              argument with their cleaner.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While Drogba was away on international duty, scoring an injury-time
              equaliser for the Elephants in a 1-1 draw in Turkey, his pregnant
              partner - mother-of-three Lalla Diakite - was calling the local
              constabulary to report 32-year-old Candy Price, who was staging a
              sit-in in a car outside their 2.4 million house in Oxshott, Surrey. <br> <br> Housekeeper Price is believed to have stormed out of the luxury pad
              after becoming fed up with the couple's demands, and claiming she was
              owed £430 in unpaid wages.<br> <br> "All I wanted was the money owed to me," she said. "Drogba's partner
              kept telling me she would put it in the post, but she didn't have my
              address. Two representatives from Chelsea asked me to move. They left
              and the police turned up.</p>
              <p>"I explained the situation to the officers, who went inside. They
              came out with a cheque for £430. I'm angry that I had to go through all
              that hassle to get £430 from a man who earns more than £100,000 a week."<br> <br> A spokesman for Drogba later added: "They owed the cleaner no money. He
              is on international duty and his wife is pregnant on her own and
              doesn't speak much English.<br> <br> "The cleaner sat outside shouting threats, banging on the gate, ringing
              the intercom. Didier's wife was scared and called police. They advised
              her to give a cheque to go away, which she did."</p>
