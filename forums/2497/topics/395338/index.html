              <h2>The Premier League have confirmed that they have received an official complaint from West Ham over Fulham manager Roy Hodgson's decision to field a weakened team against Hull last Saturday.</h2>

              <p><strong>Hodgson chose to rest five key players for the 2-0 defeat at the KC Stadium, which allowed Hull to pull level with Gianfranco Zola's relegation threatened side on 27 points.</strong></p>
              <p>Bobby Zamora, Danny Murphy, Damien Duff, Aaron Hughes and Dickson Etuhu all missed the <span style="color: #000000;">defeat but returned for last night's 2-1 win over Wolfsburg, which prompted the </span><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/westham/"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">West Ham United</span></strong></a><span style="color: #000000;"> hierarchy to claim that Hodgson broke Premier League rules. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">A Premier League spokesman said: "We can confirm that we have received an official complaint from West Ham over this matter. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"We will now ask </span><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/fulham/"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Fulham</span></strong></a> for their observations and then the Premier League board will then consider what actions, if any, are appropriate."</p>
              <p>Premier League rules state that all teams must field their strongest side available for all games.</p>
              <p>Should they find Fulham guilty, the Premier League could decide to impose a penalty similar to the £25,000 suspended fine handed to Wolves after Mick McCarthy rested nine of his players for his side's defeat at Manchester United in September.</p>
              <p>Hodgson insisted last night that he had done nothing wrong and was adamant that he would continue his rotation policy for this weekend's match against Wigan.</p>
              <p>"Firstly I don't think West Ham should be picking our team and I think that is a fairly obvious statement," said the 62-year-old.</p>
              <p>"If there is a complaint my conscience is perfectly clear on the subject and as far as I'm concerned we don't have a case to answer.</p>
              <p>"In the last game I selected a team comprising of a defender just sold for £10m (Chris Smalling), a South African international (Kagisho Dikgacoi), who replaced Danny Murphy and I replaced Bobby Zamora with Clint Dempsey, a USA centre forward.</p>
              <p>"I can't understand why, if you have a large squad, it's not allowed for you to change things around. I can't imagine anyone questioning Liverpool, Manchester United or Chelsea for using all the players in their squad."</p>
              <p>Hodgson has also found support from his peers, with Wigan manager Roberto Martinez describing West Ham's move as "foolish".</p>
              <p>The Spaniard said: "As a manager you always make decisions that can help your team.</p>
              <p>"Roy Hodgson and Fulham have had such a successful season, they know exactly what they have got behind the scenes and know what they need.</p>
              <p>"For anyone to criticise another football club when they are in such outstanding form is very foolish.</p>
              <p>"Roy Hodgson has got to make the decisions to help his team achieve their aims for the season."</p>
              <p>The argument is the latest in a series of squabbles between the two clubs. Fulham are suing West Ham for £500,000 - the loss of their league position bonus three seasons ago after Carlos Tevez's goals helped keep the Hammers up and finish a place above Fulham in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>The Premier League fined West Ham £5.5 million for breaking their rules over third party agreements over the deals which brought Tevez and Javier Mascherano to Upton Park but chose not to dock the club any points.</p>
