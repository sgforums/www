                  whats it got to do with the depth of the squad?</p>
              <p>Nani? he is a young talent, might not get to where Ronaldo is
                  today in the future but who is to know if he can? but being in the
                  reserves or as a sub, ManU does have a pretty good backup.</p>

              <p>how good Giggs is? just count how many medals he had over the years of playing for ManU and there was a Nike commerical that had him back flicking a ball with the tag line "watch the devil rise from hell".. just like how Ronaldo (Brazilian) commerical was during his Barca days..</p>

              <p><br>Remember, they are playing for manchestor united. Ok is never enough for Fergie.</p>
              <p>Beckham is 33, Scholes is 34, Keane is 37 and Giggs is 35. Keane would be the biggest worry because he is retired, and at 37, he really cant boss the midfield anymore. Giggs wouldnt be able to last an hour, he would have to be sub after an hour to maintain the pace of the game. Beckham played for LA Galaxy for a couple of years, does he even have the desire to compete in tough matches? Scholes would be decent, but he too cannot last 90 mins for the team to remain effective.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>thats all because ManU boast some of the best talent in football hence they can't have 2nd best.. Keane is in the mould of SAF, he wouldn't wanna go into a match knowing he can't be the best.. in a team of their standard, Giggs and Scholes or Beckham would never be able to hold the 1st 11 tag at such age but in a lesser team they would probably still be playing well into their mid 30s without an issue, just like how Terry Sheringham did..</p></div>

              <p>cos we are talking about players who are relatively slow as they age.. Sheringham is very slow if you ask me, so is Cantona, and just to highlight, generally, midfielder does have a long life span unlessly you're a winger but they're quite a few wingers who is still pretty decent going into the mid 30s.. Beckham was never a fast pace player, so is Keane and Scholes.. the reason for bring up Sheringham is just because he is consider as a discart from ManU after he aged but willing to play for another team, however, Giggs and Scholes probably wouldn't</p>
