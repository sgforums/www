              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Ryan Giggs</span></abbr> knows they can deliver <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> fans bragging rights over <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> with a fourth consecutive <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premiership</span></abbr> title this season.</p>
              <p>“All our fans will be talking about the prospect of becoming the club
              that has won the league championship the most times and that’s
              understandable because of the rivalry we’ve got with Liverpool,” said
              Giggs, who has 11 title medals in a collection that is housed in the
              United museum.</p>
              <p>“But if you ask the players, the big aim this season is to
              become the first club to win the title four times in succession. That’s
              the bit of history we want most of all.</p>
              <p>“Winning three successive titles is special because it is so
              rare. But the great thing about every United team I’ve played in is
              that the players always want more.</p>
              <p>“We’ve done the hat-trick of titles twice now and we want to become the first team to make it four-in-a-row.</p>
              <p>“That would be a special piece of history for us. We know how
              hard it is to win the thing once or even defend it, so to set the
              record would be a great achievement for this team.”</p>
              <p>Giggs also told the <em>Sunday Mirror</em>: “Beating Liverpool
              is important to our fans – just as I know the Liverpool supporters will
              be desperate for their team to win it for the same reason.</p>
              <p>“Fifteen years ago we were a long way behind them and their
              fans loved reminding us about it. When we won the first Premier League
              in 1993, equalling their record didn’t even come into it because United
              had gone so long without being champions. I remember playing in the
              game at Anfield where there was a banner on the Kop saying ‘Come back
              when you’ve won 18’.</p>
              <p>“We didn’t even dream that we would close the gap on them so
              quickly, and to get level with them last season was a big thing for our
              supporters to enjoy.”</p>
