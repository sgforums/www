              <p>Only Birmingham and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Portsmouth</span></abbr> must try again, against their Championship opposition of Nottingham Forest and Coventry respectively, but <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr>, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Everton</span></abbr> and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> all won.</p>
              <p>Difficult, snowy conditions at the Riverside Stadium made conditions bad for both <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Middlesbrough</span></abbr> and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr>, not that the visitor's minded, defeating their Championship opposition 1-0 with a strike from Benjani just on half time.</p>
              <p>Financially troubled <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Portsmouth</span></abbr> fell behind at Fratton Park to Coventry, but hit back on the stroke of
              half-time through Kevin-Prince Boateng to force a replay.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Burnley</span></abbr> were 2-0 up by half time at MK Dons, with goals from Graham Alexander
              and Steven Fletcher, although Paul Ince's League One side did score a
              last minute consolation.</p>
              <p>Nottingham Forest and Birmingham played out a goalless draw at
              the City ground as defensives stood firm. However, Robert Earnshaw did
              waste a golden opportunity to embarrass the visitor's when he blazed a
              second half penalty over the crossbar.</p>
              <p>Managerless <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Bolton</span></abbr> shrugged off losing their manager this week with a comprehensive
              thumping of League Two Lincoln 4-0 at the Reebok Stadium, all the
              strikes coming in the second half.</p>
              <p>In the other all <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premiership</span></abbr> clash, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Aston Villa</span></abbr> recorded a 3-1 win over Blackburn, who had El-Hadji Diouf sent off in the first half for a lunging challenge on Habib Beye.</p>
              <p>Rovers had a marvellous chance to draw level but David Dunne missed a penalty.</p>
              <p>Both side's will now change their attention to their Carling Cup semi-final next week and named changed sides.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Everton</span></abbr> meanwhile made hard work of seeing off League One side Carlisle at Goodison Park before eventually recording a 3-1 win.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fulham</span></abbr> go through to the next round thanks to a 1-0 hone win over Swindon Town
              and it was their in-form striker Bobby Zamora who scored the only goal.</p>

              <p>York had their two minutes of fame as they took the lead against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Stoke City</span></abbr> before the Potters rallied to beat the non-league outfit 3-1.</p>
              <p>The game had been delayed by half-an-hour due to the visitors' coach being held up in traffic due to the bad weather conditions.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> eased into the fourth round after a convincing 4-0 victory over

              <p><strong>FA Cup results</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Tottenham Hotspur</strong> beat Championship strugglers <strong>Peterborough United</strong> 4-0 as the FA Cup exploded into action with a goal fest in round three.<br><br>The Premier League clubs signaled their intention to dominate the competition once again as dreams of a giant killing were slayed.<br><br>Peterborough
              had never beaten their high-flying opponents and failed to break their
              duck at White Hart Lane as Niko Kranjcar, Jermaine Defoe and Robbie Keane secured safe passage for Harry Redknapp’s side.</p>
              <p>It would have taken a performance of biblical proportions for David to beat Goliath at the Stadium of Light after non-league <strong>Barrow</strong> were drawn against Premiership <strong>Sunderland</strong>.<br><br>The
              Blue Square Premier outfit were given a dream draw against Steve
              Bruce’s side but fell behind early on to a Steed Malbranque goal.<br><br>With
              only one defeat in their last 17 games, Barrow gave a good account of
              themselves but fell further behind after half time through Fraizer
              Campbell.<br><br>The former Manchester United
              striker had only scored one goal for his new club before the match but
              bagged his second of the day on the hour mark as Sunderland’s class
              paid dividends.</p>
              <p><strong>Everton</strong> hosted League One <strong>Carlisle United</strong> at Goodison Park hoping a cup win could kick-start their stuttering Premiership campaign.<br><br>David Moyes’
              side took the lead through James Vaughan early on but Carlisle were up
              for a scrap and leveled through Kevan Hurst just minutes later.<br><br>But Everton booked their place in the next round in the closing stages as Tim Cahill and a Leighton Baines penalty secured victory.<br><br><strong>Portsmouth</strong>, winners of the competition in 2008 welcomed <strong>Coventry City</strong> to the south coast but honors were even after a bruising battle at Fratton Park.<br><br>Avram
              Grant’s side fell behind to a David Bell goal on the half hour mark but
              were level before the interval through thanks to Kevin-Prince Boateng.<br><br>Coventry
              looked to take advantage against a Portsmouth side low on confidence
              and dominated the second period but were forced to settle for a replay.<br><br><strong>Burnley</strong> secured their place in the next round with a 2-1 over Paul Ince’s <strong>MK Dons</strong>.<br><br>Graham
              Alexander opened the scoring from the penalty spot and Steven Fletcher
              doubled their advantage ten minutes before the interval.<br><br>A Dean Morgan goal on 89 minutes ensured an uncomfortable finish for Owen Coyle but the Premier League side held on for a place in round four.<br><br>Manager-less <strong>Bolton Wanderers</strong> hosted <strong>Lincoln City</strong> at the Reebok Stadium and failed to break down the League Two side in the first half.<br><br>But they
              were in front just minutes after the restart courtesy of the
              unfortunate Moses Swaibu, who put through his own net on 49 minutes.<br><br>Things got worse for the visitors within a minute as Chung-Yong Lee turned in to double the home side’s advantage. <br><br>A place in round four was secured in the closing stages as Gary Cahill and Mark Davies secured a 4-0 win.<br><br><strong>Fulham</strong> made hard work of League One <strong>Swindon Town</strong> at Craven Cottage.<br><br>In-form
              Bobby Zamora opened the scoring early on but Town keeper David Lucas
              kept his side in the tie after saving an Andrew Johnson penalty on the
              hour mark.<br><br>But one goal proved enough for Roy Hodgson’s side who are in the hat for round four.<br><br>The Premier League’s form side <strong>Birmingham City</strong> traveled to <strong>Nottingham Forest</strong> looking for cup success.<br><br>After a goalless first half Forest were given a penalty but Robert Earnshaw failed to find the back of the net from 12 yards.<br><br>Kevin Phillips looked lively for Alex McLeish’s men but couldn’t break the deadlock at the City Ground.</p>

              <p><strong>They normally have to find room on the touchlines when their teams take part 
              in the most famous competition in football. </strong></p>
              <p>But on Saturday<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/wigan-athletic.html"> Wigan</a> mascot Stripey and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/hull-city.html">Hull City </a>counterpart Roary could take their pick of the best seats at the DW Stadium 
              for an FA Cup third-round tie that attracted only 5,335 fans despite being an 
              all-Premier League affair. And it was not only at Wigan that the magic of the 
              Cup was in desperately short supply.</p>
              <p>Only 7,621 watched Preston North End thrash Colchester United 7-0, Sheffield 
              Wednesday's gate of 8,690 against Crystal Palace was nearly 14,000 down on their 
              average and Portsmouth, who are desperate for funds and could have done with a 
              bumper turn-out against Coventry City, saw a mere 11,214 supporters go through 
              the Fratton Park turnstiles. </p>
              <p>Wigan's average home attendance in the Premier League this season has been 
              around 18,000 but they got nowhere near those dizzy heights for yesterday's 
              clash with fellow relegation strugglers Hull.</p>
              <p>Wigan ran out 4-1 victors but, having had pitiful ticket sales ahead of the 
              game, the club opted to close the South Stand.</p>
              <p>The funeral atmosphere did little to improve the mood of under-fire Hull 
              manager Phil Brown. 'I was a bit surprised the crowd was so low,' he said.</p>

              <h2>Arsenal, who came from behind to beat West Ham 2-1 on Sunday evening, will make the trip to Stoke. The Britannia Stadium does not hold fond memories for the Gunners who lost 2-1 away at Stoke in the Premier League last season, with Rory Delap's long throws wreaking havoc in Arsene Wenger's defence. </h2>
              <h2>FA Cup holders Chelsea defeated Watford 5-0 on Sunday and they will face more Championship opposition in the shape of Preston, who destroyed Colchester United 7-0 on Saturday.  </h2>
              <h2>If Liverpool can overcome Reading in a replay then they will take on Burnley in an all-Premier League tie. Meanwhile, Roberto Mancini's introduction to English football continues with a trip to Glanford Park after Manchester City drew Scunthorpe - a team they beat 5-1 in the Carling Cup in October.</h2>
