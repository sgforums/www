              <p> </p>
              <p><span><strong>Chelsea let relegation favourites Wigan snatch an unlikely 88th-minute equaliser with a comedy of errors at the DW Stadium. Instead of putting Premier League leaders Manchester City under pressure at the top, Andre Villas-Boas must hold a major dressing- room inquest into how Jordi Gomez was allowed to snatch a dramatic leveller.</strong></span> </p>
              <p><span>Goalkeeper Petr Cech was clearly at fault, allowing a tame scuff from Hugo Rodallega to squirm out of his hands and bounce off his knee into Gomez's path. But others were culpable, too. Jose Bosingwa should not have allowed Rodallega to get his shot away in the first place and Ashley Cole seemed to get in his keeper's way as he bent to pick up the ball.</span></p>
              <p><span>AVB himself will also have to answer questions, having made a negative substitution as soon as Daniel Sturridge had given his side the lead after an hour, taking off his most creative player, Juan Mata, for a holding midfielder John Obi Mikel.</span></p>
              <p><span>The result was a draw and instead of being only two points behind Manchester United and four behind City this morning, Chelsea could be nine points off the pace by Sunday night. </span></p>
              <p><span>The feelgood factor garnered by Monday's win against City has evaporated.</span></p>
              <p><span>'We could have gone for the second goal but we preferred to hang on to what we had,' admitted Villas-Boas candidly. </span></p>
              <p><span>'It was three points we expected. We won't blame any individual for the equaliser. We had plenty of players back but there was a loss of concentration. We seemed to lose track of our keeper's position.'</span></p>

              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span><strong>Villas-Boas has made big decisions all season but they did not work out for him yesterday. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Frank Lampard was recalled in place of the injured Ramires but was largely anonymous. </span></p>
              <p><span>Lampard was not even on the pitch when Chelsea scored their goal, receiving treatment on a cut lip when it happened. </span></p>
              <p><span>Poor Fernando Torres was kept shivering on the bench for 90 minutes, seeing first Salomon Kalou, then Mikel and finally Florent Malouda sent on ahead of him. </span></p>
              <p><span>In retrospect, perhaps the £50million striker should have been given the chance to score Chelsea's second goal but he has played just 23 minutes for AVB this month.</span></p>
              <p><span>Chelsea's anguish was Wigan's delight. Nobody gave Roberto Martinez's team a prayer but they might have won it had referee Martin Atkinson ruled Branislav Ivanovic's first-half hand-ball as deliberate.</span> </p>
              <p><span>'We lost eight games in a row earlier in the season, so to come through a test like that shows huge character,' said Martinez. </span> </p>
              <p><span>'It feels like this team are just beginning to know each other and understand each other.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Wigan narrowly edged the first 45 minutes. In the most contentious moment of the half, a Victor Moses shot struck Ivanovic on the forearm but Atkinson ruled it ball to hand.</span> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="artSplitter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/12/17/article-2075427-0F35D5C500000578-992_634x510.jpg" alt="Glum: Chelsea striker Didier Drogba (right) can't hide his disappointment after Wigan's goal" width="634" height="510">
              <p class="imageCaption">Glum: Chelsea striker Didier Drogba (right) can't hide his disappointment after Wigan's goal</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Chelsea knew they had to up their game and Villas-Boas threw on Kalou for Oriol Romeu at the interval. Didier Drogba showed urgency and fired into the side netting.</strong></p>
              <p>Lampard's evening had not gone as planned and he was off the field receiving treatment for a badly cut mouth when Chelsea went ahead.</p>
              <p><span>The England midfielder was behind Mohamed Diame when the big Wigan player leaned back and accidentally caught him in the face with the back of his head. </span></p>
              <p><span>The spillage meant the Chelsea man had to come off temporarily to get cleaned up. And while Lampard was indisposed, Chelsea scored a goal that was ruthlessly executed.</span></p>
              <div id="ext-gen1953" class="artSplitter">
              <p><span>Wigan stood off Cole just inside their own half and the England leftback pinged a terrific diagonal pass to Sturridge, just inside the angle of the penalty area.</span></p>
              <p><span>Sturridge then showed why he is a serious contender for Fabio Capello's Euro 2012 squad. His first touch brought the ball under control and gave him enough room to shoot. His second was an unerring finish across Al-Habsi into the bottom corner. It was Sturridge's ninth goal of the season to make him Chelsea's top scorer this campaign.</span></p>
              <p><span>In front of the dugout, Cole, Drogba and Terry hugged each other and yelped in celebration. On the bench, Torres shivered. No sooner had Chelsea scored than AVB brought on Mikel to provide extra defensive insurance. But the move backfired as Martinez threw on two strikers, Franco Di Santo and Rodallega, and Chelsea started backpedalling.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="artSplitter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/12/17/article-2075427-0F35D0E000000578-545_634x420.jpg" alt="Unhappy return: Frank Lampard was back in the Chelsea team but needed stitches after a clash" width="634" height="420">

              </div>
              <p><span><strong>Di Santo almost levelled after Cech raced from his goal and needed Ivanovic to head away the striker's goalbound shot. And when Sturridge rolled around soon after, Wigan became convinced their illustrious visitors were using gamesmanship to get over the line.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>If that was the plan, and remember Villas-Boas learned at the side of the master of dark arts, Jose Mourinho, it did not work. Chelsea had too many men back and they got in each other's way as Gomez scored.</span></p>
              <p><span>So the two youngest managers in the Premier League shared the spoils. But while Martinez, 38, may feel he can keep Wigan up, the odds on Villas-Boas, 34, winning the league title are lengthening.</span></p>
