              <p><strong>Paul Gascoigne claims he would have been a </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> legend if he had not snubbed the club as a youngster. Gascoigne, 41, says it was one of his greatest regrets that he did not sign for Sir Alex Ferguson, who admitted this week that ‘not getting Gazza’ was his biggest disappointment as a manager.</strong></p>
              <p>‘He was a fabulous footballer and he would have done brilliantly here,’ said the United boss in the New Statesman.</p>
              <p>The young Gazza, then on the verge of joining United from Newcastle, was shown around the training ground but chose to join Tottenham instead - and when he contacted Ferguson years later, he says the Scot did not seem interested.</p>
              <p>‘Maybe if I had stayed at Man U, I might have been still there,’ the former England midfielder tells Sky News tonight.</p>
              <p>‘Look at young Rooney, the Neville brothers and Becks, the way he (Ferguson) just brought them on. I got invited to the academy and it is a magnificent place and you can see the way he treats his players, he treats them with respect but he also makes men out of boys.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Sir Alex Ferguson said in an interview that his biggest regret was not signing Paul Gascoigne</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>‘It took me six years to get back talking to Sir Alex. I called him from Lazio and asked him would he sign us. 'He was with Eric Cantona and he said he would see what Eric Cantona was going to do, but I think everyone knows if you do something to Sir Alex Ferguson the way I did, you don’t get a second chance.’</strong></p>
              <p>Gascoigne has great admiration for the current United squad, picking out Cristiano Ronaldo as the player he views as ‘the new Gazza’.</p>
              <p>‘I think he is doing a lot better this year than he did last year, even though he doesn’t score as many goals. I think Sir Alex has made him a complete player.’</p>
              <p>Gascoigne also revealed that he had recently been invited to visit Diego Maradona. ‘I got a call, they just said Maradona has invited us to stay with him. I said I’d just leave it because he was taking on the job of Argentina coach and he would be busy anyway.</p>
              <p>‘In time I would love to manage Newcastle but you have got to take your badges, you have got to be strong. I am feeling really strong now.’</p>
