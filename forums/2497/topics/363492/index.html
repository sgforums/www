              *Who needs Kaka? Â£45m Aguero is the new Chelsea target*
              .
              .
              
              *Chelsea have made moves to secure the Â£45million signing of Atletico Madrid striker Sergio Aguero, only to be stunned by his wage demands. After losing out to Real Madrid on the signing of Kaka, owner Roman Abramovich is determined to flex his muscles in the transfer market and has turned his attention to the explosive 21-year-old Argentina striker.*
              
              Intermediaries have held talks, but the two parties are haggling over wages. Aguero, who would smash the British record fee of Â£34m for Manchester Cityâ€™s Robinho, is demanding a salary of Â£6.5m a year after tax, which means Chelsea would have to pay him nearly Â£11m a season.
              
              This astonishing figure is even more than the rumoured Â£200,000 a week Kaka will earn at Real Madrid in his six-year deal, worth around Â£10m a season. 
              
              The Stamford Bridge hierarchy believe Agueroâ€™s demands are too high, even for the latest diminutive Argentinian international to be hailed as the â€˜new Maradonaâ€™.
              
              Aguero is engaged to Diego Maradonaâ€™s daughter, Giannina, and is the father of his first grandchild, Benjamin Aguero Maradona, who was born in Madrid in February. The 5ft 7in striker, who was expected to miss his country's 2010 World Cup qualifier against Ecuador later tonight with a thigh strain, scored 17 goals in La Liga last season.
              
              But Aguero and strike partner Diego Forlan, who contributed 32 goals to Atleticoâ€™s cause, have been linked with moves away from the Vicente Calderon this summer. Chelsea, now managed by Italian Carlo Ancelotti, have been keeping tabs on
              Aguero for some time.
              
              The FA Cup winners recognise the need to add some quality young players to their ageing squad and have yet to nail down the deal to keep Didier Drogba.
              
              As revealed in Sportsmail last week, Ancelotti has convinced Abramovich to give the Ivory Coast striker another chance. Drogba was primed to leave following his over-the-top reaction after Chelseaâ€™s Champions League semi-final defeat to Barcelona, but has since been offered a new three-year deal.
              
              Chelsea are also targeting Bayern Munichâ€™s Franck Ribery after accepting their
              two other main transfer targets have slipped through their fingers.
              
              Kaka, 27, Valencia striker David Villa and Ribery were the three original names on Chelseaâ€™s list of summer spending, but the France winger is now the only viable option.
              
              Kaka joined Real Madrid in a Â£56m deal on Monday and Villa, 27, looks set to follow the Brazilian to the Bernabeu.
              
              Real Madrid president Florentino Perez has made no secret of his desire to add Ribery to his new breed of galacticos, but Chelsea remain intent on signing the 26-year-old, who has two years left on his contract at Bayern Munich.
              
              Manchester City will ask for Â£10m in compensation if â€” as expected â€” teenage
              striker Daniel Sturridge quits Eastlands for Chelsea this summer.
              
              City are resigned to losing the 19-year-old to Stamford Bridge after the youngster allowed his contract run down. But it is understood that City will pitch for a â€˜development feeâ€™ of Â£10m when the matter goes before an FA tribunal.
              
              Players under the age of 24 cannot switch clubs under a â€˜Bosmanâ€™ free transfer, a rule designed to ensure that those who develop young talent do not lose it for nothing.
              
              City will make a claim for a downpayment in excess of Â£5m and propose that the remainder of the money comes in performance-related instalments. Chelsea will â€” in all likelihood â€” offer substantially less for a player they have been tracking for three or four years.

              <p>The <em>Daily Star</em> says <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> are closing in on a £40m deal to sign Argentina superstar Aguero – the player they regard as the best forward in the world.</p>
              <p>Blues chief executive Peter Kenyon has been working on a package for
              the past two weeks aimed at taking the 21-year-old Atletico Madrid
              striker to Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>Sources in Spain suggest the two clubs are on the brink of
              agreeing terms for Aguero, who scored 17 goals in 34 appearances last
              season.</p>
              <p>A move could be finalised within the next 10 days.</p>
              <p>One problem could be the wage demands by Aguero’s advisors with
              suggestions, with suggestions the forward wants £160,000 AFTER tax.</p>
              <p>Chelsea would be unwilling to go to anything more than
              £110,000-a-week before tax, but officials in Madrid are confident any
              disagreements can be resolved.</p>
