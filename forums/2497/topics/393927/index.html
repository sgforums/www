              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ALBERT RIERA last night launched an astonishing attack on Rafa Benitez and branded Liverpool a 'sinking ship.'</h2>
              <p class="article">The winger revealed huge rifts in the Reds' dressing room and claimed boss Benitez did not speak to players when there were problems.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "This year has been difficult and he has not changed at all. When you see the ship is sinking and you don't change... "I've been here for two years and I know how he is as a person. He's never resolved a situation with a player by speaking with him.</p>
              <p class="article">"He thinks he is the boss and turns a deaf ear to everyone else. "The dialogue with the players is practically zero."</p>
              <p class="article">Riera, 27, is fuming with Benitez after starting just once since mid-February and is worried that a lack of games might cost him a World Cup spot with Spain.</p>
              <p class="article">The £8million signing from Espanyol added: "When you stop counting as a player like that, it must be something personal. "It's frustrating because you see you can help and he doesn't let you."</p>
              <p class="article">Liverpool's disastrous season is in danger of taking another turn for the worse if they fail to overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit against Lille in the Europa League tonight.</p>
              <p class="article">With a top-four Premier League spot also in doubt this year, Benitez's future is hanging in the balance.</p>
              <p class="article">Real Madrid are rumoured to be interested in hiring the manager. Yet Riera doubts Benitez could provide the exciting brand of play required at the Bernabeu. </p>
              <p class="article">Riera said: "At Madrid, they demand that you play beautiful football so I think it's difficult. "We have never played beautiful football. Effective yes, but never have we played a brilliant style of football."</p>
              <p class="article">Speaking to Radio Marca, Riera left open the possibility of quitting Anfield soon to play in Russia. He said: "I'd like to stay here for the rest of my career but we players live to play. </p>
              <p class="article">"My objective is to go to the World Cup and for that I have to play. "Right now the only market still open is the Russian. I have offers from two teams and, given my situation, that has made me think a lot."</p>

              <h1 class="storyTitle" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-size: 2.8em;">Riera suspended by Liverpool after Benitez attack</h1>
              <h1 class="storyTitle" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-size: 2.8em;"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2010/0317/albertrieralfcshouts_412x232.jpg" border="0" alt="Albert Rieira: Getting a few things off his chest" width="275" height="155"></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Riera has been disciplined by Benitez and told not to return
              to the Merseysiders' Melwood training ground until Monday, with his 
              future at Anfield cast into serious doubt.</p>
              <p>The midfielder launched
               a critical broadside at Benitez, claiming he did not speak to
              him, and told<em> Radio Marca</em>: "The dialogue with the players is 
              practically non-existent. There is a lack of tact.''</p>
              <p>Benitez is 
              believed to be fuming about the timing of the interview, which was
              broadcast less than 24 hours before the crucial Europa League last-16
              second leg at home to Lille, and has taken swift action to discipline 
              the
              player.</p>
              <p>Former Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann blasted the 
              Rieira for
              looking to shift the blame from some mediocre personal performances in 
              the
              current campaign.</p>
              <p>''I didn't read too much into the comments 
              because he's a player who has not
              played too much football over the last six to eight months,'' said 
              Hamann. ''He is clearly frustrated but you have to say since he signed 
              for Liverpool (in the summer of 2008) he has not done enough to really 
              have an opinion on the manager.</p>
              <p>''If Riera is not in the team it 
              is probably because he is not doing enough in
              training or in games. The first question you have to ask when you are 
              not playing is have you done enough to be in the team.</p>
              <p>''It 
              happens too often with players who can't get in the team and the first
              thing they do is blame the manager. They should look at themselves. I 
              can honestly say I have never had a problem with a manager in 15 years 
              of my career and I would never blame a manager for not playing.''</p>
              <p>Hamann,
               who has done some part-time coaching for Liverpool's youth teams,
              admitted Benitez had his own individual style of management but did not 
              have an
              issue with it during his two seasons under the Spaniard.</p>
              <p>''Every 
              manager has his different styles and he may not talk, as other managers
              do, to his players, but at the end of the day I always had a 
              professional
              relationship with him,'' he added. ''I never really needed much 
              conversation with the manager because his team selection told you 
              everything most weeks.</p>
              <p>''I think he was always pretty honest in 
              terms of his team selection, he always
              did what he thought was best for the team.''</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Albert Riera</span> has been suspended by Liverpool for his outspoken attack on manager Rafael Benitez's communication skills and the club, which he described as a ''sinking ship''.</strong> </p>
              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez has responded to Albert Riera's outspoken attack on him by suspending the </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool </strong></span></a><strong>winger until Monday.</strong></p>
              <p>In what amounts to a two-game ban for Riera, the £6million signing from Espanyol has been told to stay away from Liverpool's preparations for Thursday's Europa League last 16 return leg against Lille and Sunday's Old Trafford showdown with Manchester United in the Barclays Premier League.</p>
              <p>Riera, who will also be fined, has infuriated Benitez with the timing and contents of an interview with a Spanish radio station, in which he claimed he had been ostracised, accused his fellow-Spaniard of lacking communication skills and described Liverpool as 'a sinking ship'.</p>
              <p>Benitez is acutely aware that overturning a 1-0 first-leg deficit against Lille and repeating last season's Old Trafford triumph could be crucial to salvaging some respectability from a desperately disappointing campaign, as well as earning himself some breathing space.</p>
              <p>Liverpool's under-pressure boss does not want any distractions and feels let down by Riera, who will be sold at the first opportunity.</p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>According to sources in Spain, Benitez rang Riera's agent, with news of the suspension, as soon as he heard of the interview and verified it had taken place.</strong></p>
              <p>Riera was subsequently informed that he would not be allowed back in Liverpool's Melwood training ground until Monday, when he can expect to feel the full force of Benitez's wrath.</p>
              <p>Riera claims he has received two offers from clubs in Russia, the homeland of his wife Yulia Koroleva.</p>
              <p>He could be set for a swift exit as the transfer window in Russia, which was supposed to close last week, has been extended to April 8.</p>

              <p>But I think Liverpool are back on track. Especially his patient on Aqua man works like charm.  I thought is crazy to let a 17 million pound man left on bench for so long. But looks like is now helping aquilani to get into form.</p>

              <p>Rafael Benitez is determined to offload the Spain winger and can take advantage of the Russian transfer window being extended to April 8.</p>
              <p>But CSKA have distanced themselves from reports that they would enter the race.</p>
              <p>'The Army Club are surprised to learn (from media) that they are candidate for the signing of Liverpool's Spanish midfielder Albert Riera,' CSKA said in a statement.</p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS">
              <p class="imageCaption">'We know of similar cases where CSKA is additionally recommended for a football player seeking a new place of work.</p>

              <p>'However, to those who are trying to bring extra interest to the player, we can give advice (it's free!): to specify an interested party, we would say Barcelona or Manchester United. By the way, this will be more interesting to lovers of rumours.'</p>
              <p>Riera is returning to training at Melwood after he was banned from the club on Thursday for describing Liverpool as a ‘sinking ship’ in an interview with a Spanish radio station and claiming that Benitez refused to speak to him.</p>

              <p><strong>Benitez has responded to the criticism and the winger’s recent bust-up with a reserve-team player by seeking to push through a quick sale.</strong></p>
              <p>The Liverpool boss has been keen to offload Riera for some time and hopes to recoup the £6million he paid Espanyol in the summer of 2008.</p>
              <p>A move to Moscow might also appeal to the unsettled Riera, whose wife Yulia Koroleva is from Russia.</p>

              <p>Liverpool’s hopes of recouping £6m are fading fast. But they are so eager to offload the winger, after his comments on boss Rafa Benitez, that they will allow the loan with Riera, 27, able to seek a club in the summer.</p>
              <p>Talks between the two clubs will continue, but Spartak feel they are in a strong position after Moscow rivals CSKA and Lokomotiv made it clear they would not make a move.</p>
              <p>Riera is anxious to secure a move before the Russian transfer deadline of April 8 because he fears for his place in the Spain national team.</p>
              <p>'Russia seems to me a very interesting option, because, firstly, it is the only prestigious league in which the transfer window is still open, and, second, I expect to earn a place at the World Cup in South Africa if I'm playing there constantly,' said the 27-year-old, whose wife Yulia Koroleva is from Russia.</p>
              <p>'I hope the issue with my transfer will be resolved as early as this week.'</p>

              <p><strong>A loan till the end of June would suit Riera, who could then assess offers in more established European leagues.</strong></p>
              <p>Spartak boss Valery Karpin led the protest when the Russian transfer deadline was put back from March 11, but he could now be the biggest to gain from the last-minute switch.</p>
