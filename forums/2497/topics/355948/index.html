              <p class="small bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NO FEAR ... Giuseppe Rossi</strong></span></p>
              <p class="small bold"> </p>

              </p><h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">ARSENAL fans itching to give Giuseppe Rossi stick because of his links with 
              Manchester United had better think again.</h2>
              <p class="article">Villarreal striker Rossi, 22, says nothing can match the hostility of Athens 
              where the Spaniards overcame Panathinaikos in the previous round of the 
              Champions League.</p>
              <p class="article">Rossi, a £6million buy from United 18 months ago, scored in the tie to get 
              Villarreal through and was also a handful in the 1-1 first-leg draw with the 
              Gunners in Spain.</p>
              <p class="article">He has scored 23 goals in just 50 games for Villarreal.</p>
              <p class="article">A win tomorrow will open up the possibility of a semi-final against United.</p>
              <p class="article">Rossi said: “I know all about playing Arsenal from my time at United and I’m 
              sure their fans will be booing me because of that.</p>
              <p class="article">“But that’s no problem to me because when I get stick, I go even harder to get 
              a goal.</p>
              <p class="article">“In any case the atmosphere won’t be a major influence. Fans in London are 
              nothing like those in Athens and I’m looking forward to celebrating a goal 
              there.”</p>
              <p class="article">Rossi points out that Villarreal nicked a 2-1 win in Greece after drawing 1-1 
              at home — and he is convinced his side can repeat the dose tonight.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “We always seem to score on our travels and if we get the first goal 
              I am convinced we will go through.</p>
              <p class="article">“We actually missed a big chance in the home game when we let Arsenal dominate 
              the ball for too long.</p>
              <p class="article">“We know Cesc Fabregas is the Arsenal star but Emmanuel Adebayor is dangerous 
              always and showed in the first match how he can affect a match with just one 
              movement. He is an excellent striker and we must stop him.</p>
              <p class="article">“We have injuries to Santi Cazorla and Marcos Senna. They are important 
              players but now is the real moment for the rest of us to demonstrate that we 
              have a squad able to save even the worse situations.</p>
              <p class="article">“We have studied every detail of this game. It’s our match of the year and we 
              aim to show Arsenal are not really superior to Villarreal.</p>
              <p class="article">“Other clubs in the Premier League have won in the Emirates Stadium and so can 
              we.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>

              <p class="article">But Villarreal are struggling for form after suffering their third defeat in 
              four domestic games in going down 2-0 at home to Malaga on Saturday.</p>
              <p class="article">Their plight has been complicated by the loss of Spain midfielder Senna — 
              scorer of a stunning goal in the first leg — who suffered a leg muscle 
              strain on Saturday.</p>
              <p class="article">Villarreal midfielder Robert Pires is upbeat before the clash with his former 
              club, who beat Wigan 4-1 on Saturday for their fifth consecutive victory in 
              the English top flight.</p>
              <p class="article">Pires said: “Our squad is one of the best in Spain and in Europe. We can 
              undoubtedly win the Champions League.</p>
              <p class="article">“We are going to try to reach the final in Rome. We know it’s very hard, but I 
              think this squad has a chance of winning this competition.”</p>
              <p class="article">A goalless draw would be enough to seal Arsenal a place in the semi-finals.</p>
              <p class="article">But boss Arsene Wenger has urged his players to take their destiny in their 
              own hands tonight and promised he has no intention of going on the 
              defensive.</p>
              <p class="article">He insisted: “We know we are in a situation where we don’t want to be 
              tentative at all. We want to be decisive but you can only do that if you 
              decide to play in a very positive way.</p>
              <p class="article">“I don’t believe that we are a team who can play for 0-0, that’s not our 
              natural way.</p>
              <p class="article">“I don’t expect any weaknesses from them. I expect some strength from us to 
              say ‘Listen, we have the opportunity to get to the semi-finals, let’s take 
              it.’ I am confident we will and we have the quality needed to do that but 
              you know from their game that they can be dangerous as well.”</p>
