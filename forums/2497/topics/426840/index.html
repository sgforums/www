              <p>Jose Mourinho suffered his first home defeat as a coach since February 23, 2002 with FC Porto, when <strong>Real Madrid</strong> <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/302039">fell 1-0</a> to <strong>Sporting Gijon</strong> thanks to Miguel de las Cuevas' strike.</p>
              <div class="mod-inline image image-right">
              <div style="margin-left: 10px; width: 275px;"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2011/0402/dimariawoe20110402_275x155.jpg" border="0" alt="Di Maria" width="275" height="155">

              <div style="width: 275px;"><br></div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Cuevas, a former Atletico Madrid player, netted the only goal
              of the game in the 79th minute after he broke free on the edge of the area and fired in a right footed shot off the post.</p>
              <p>The
               defeat means Madrid find themselves eight points adrift of Barcelona 
              after the league leaders beat Villarreal, and is a blow to morale ahead 
              of Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg against
              Tottenham.</p>
              <p>Even the return of Gonzalo Higuain after more than four months out through
              injury could not help Madrid, who badly missed key players such as Cristiano
              Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Xabi Alonso.</p>
              <p>Mourinho, who conceded 
              that eight points was ''practically impossible'' to overcome, said after
               the game: ''Our opponents defended, defended and defended. They had one
               chance and they scored one goal. I praised them because they fought a 
              lot and they fought to try to have luck on their side. We had four, 
              five, six chances to score and we couldn't. That's football and 
              tomorrow's another day.</p>
              <p>''We played without the team's most creative players. We lacked
              creativity. We had to try a different style, more direct with long balls in the
              air, and we had more opportunities.</p>
              <p>''If I had wanted to draw the game 0-0 from the start I would have done so. But
              a draw was a bad result. Against Tottenham on Tuesday, it won't be. If we draw
              at home, it would not be a drama because we will have the return to play in
              London.''</p>
              <p>Madrid defender Sergio Ramos added in <em>AS</em>: ''A 
              large part of the league has gone
              away from us. There are very few points left. We can't reproach the team
               for anything. Unfortunately the ball did not go in today. It's very sad
               to lose with so many chances.''</p>
              <p><strong>Barcelona</strong> were made to work for their win, but they picked up a vital three points with <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=301891&amp;cc=5739">a 1-0 victory</a> at high-flying <strong>Villarreal</strong>.</p>
              <p>Goalkeeper
               Victor Valdes was tested early on, making some crucial saves, and the 
              Spanish champions were forced to bring Lionel Messi on from the bench 
              after the break. They eventually made the breakthrough from a set-piece 
              as Sergio Busquets' flick-on fell to Gerard Pique in the box and the 
              Spanish defender calmly chested the ball down before hammering it into 
              the net for his second goal of the season.</p>
              <p>Villarreal almost 
              snatched a point in the 85th minute, but Santi Cazorla's volley was 
              somehow turned over the bar by Valdes from six yards out.</p>
              <p>In the day's other game, Roberto Soldado scored all four goals as <strong>Valencia</strong> came from 1-0 down to claim
              an <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=302044&amp;cc=5739">emphatic 4-2 victory</a> at <strong>Getafe</strong> as they further continued their hunt for an automatic Champions League spot.</p>
              <p>Manu
               gave Getafe a 13th-minute lead and there was little sign of what was to
              come before Soldado levelled just after half-time. It heralded a spell 
              of four goals in 31 minutes and although Adrian Sardinero grabbed a late
               consolation, it was Soldado's night.</p>

              <p>People turn their backs on clubs all the time but nobody does it
              to my favourite club man. Can you imagine if the star player of
              your fave club turns his back on them? What the fark you think of
              this bloke?</p>
              <p>What's your fave club? I honestly believe there's none cos you
              don't talk like you have any.</p>

              <p>does it matter what i think of dwight yorke?? will dwight yorke share my belief that he should be loyal to my fave club because we're the ones that put faith in him and brought him to england??</p>
              <p>people turn their backs on their fave clubs all the time, u talk like this shouldn't happen but it does so just accept it....your own rooney nearly did it twice, torres, carroll, barry all did it</p>
              <p>if every player was like what you said they should be basically a steve bull, the likes of rooney, nani or ronaldo wouldn't have joined man u in the first place</p>

              <p>yorke didnt turn his back, he was asked to go because of his dwindling form due in no small part to his partying ways.</p>
              <p>That's a pretty appalling steve bull analogy too. People turn their backs on clubs all the time, that's true but it happens more often at smaller clubs than larger ones. If i ever had a chance to pull on the man utd shirt, i will never ever leave the club unless they don't want me. Of course, this is something people like you don't understand.</p>

              <p>I was talking about yorke turning his back on villa</p>
              <p>try telling rooney to never ever leave man utd just because he wears the shirt, do you really believe rooney stayed becos he loves man u??</p>
              <p>of cos it happens more often at smaller clubs, who wants to leave a successful club?? how many clubs are there that can make a player at a big club turn their back?? but still there's plenty who leave big clubs, ashley cole, flamini, ibrahimovic twice, robben...</p>
              <p>and out of all people u expect ronaldo who wasn't born in manchester, a petulant brat to never leave man utd??</p>
