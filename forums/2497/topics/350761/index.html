              <p>(adds detail, quotes)</p>
              <p>By Mitch Phillips</p>
              <p>LONDON, March 6 (Reuters) - Chelsea became the first team
              into the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley when they comfortably
              beat Championship (second division) Coventry City 2-0 away on
              Saturday.</p>
              <p>Goals in each half by Didier Drogba and Alex made it six
              wins out of six under new manager Guus Hiddink.</p>
              <p>Chelsea were knocked out by Championship side Barnsley at
              the same stage last season but a repeat never looked likely.</p>
              <p>Hiddink sent out a full-strength side despite the looming
              second leg of their Champions League last 16 tie with Juventus
              in Turin on Tuesday and though they looked dangerous from the
              start, they were gifted the opening goal in the 15th minute.</p>
              <p>Ben Turner failed to get hold of his headed clearance of a
              long ball and Scott Dann then dithered and was muscled off the
              ball by Drogba. The Ivorian striker then went round keeper
              Kieran Westwood and did well to turn in his left-footed shot
              from a tightening angle.</p>
              <p>Coventry, seeking to reach the semi-finals for the first
              time since they won the Cup for the only time in 1987, struggled
              to build any pressure and it was no real surprise when they fell
              further behind after 72 minutes.</p>
              <p>Alex and Drogba, who had both been off the pitch receiving
              treatment after a collision, came back on and immediately joined
              a counter-attack that ended with halftime substitute Ricardo
              Quaresma crossing for the Brazilian defender to sidefoot home.</p>
              <p>Chelsea enjoyed the added bonus of a first appearance since
              August for Michael Essien, who played the last 30 minutes having
              recovered from a knee ligament injury.</p>
              <p>"We can be very satisfied with the win and the way we
              played," Hiddink told ITV. "I think we controlled the game very
              well and then made a beautiful goal to kill the game."</p>
              <p>The Dutchman, whose arrival appears to have given Drogba a
              new lease of life, said he was not surprised by the striker's
              turnaround from the moody figure he cut under Luiz Felipe
              Scolari.</p>
              <p>"He's dangerous but he's good for the team as well," he
              said. "He can still improve and he's working on some special
              training sessions. He likes to do that and it's paying off."</p>
              <p>Coventry manager Chris Coleman said: "Up until the second
              goal we were always pushing but we were playing against a side
              who had won their last five games. We knew what quality we were
              up against, the fans were fantastic but unfortunately we didn't
              get the result."</p>
              <p>Coleman's former club Fulham were at home to Manchester
              United later on Saturday in the day's other quarter-final with
              more Cup action on Sunday</p>
