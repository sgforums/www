And Terry thinks they can repeat the feat on Sunday.</span></p>
              <p>Everyone thought Chelsea have blown their title hopes after a disastrous run before Christmas, but no side has won more league points than Chelsea since the turn of the year.</p>
              <p>"Each season you know you are going to hit a bad spell and it is about how quickly you can get out of it," he told the <em>Daily Express</em>.</p>
              <p>"We got out of it very quickly last year, and have taken a little longer this time - but once again we are right back in the frame.</p>
              <p>He said about the title success of 2009-10: "We ran away at the top very early and people were saying it was over after 10 games, then we had a blip.</p>
              <p>"But we picked ourselves up and hit some good form towards the end. It was probably the best form I have seen, with the results and the free-flowing play. The amount of goals we were scoring was incredible.</p>
              <p>"We showed when we went to Old Trafford and won last year, which was the decisive game, that we could do it. There is no reason why we cannot do it again.</p>
              <p>"There is nothing I want more than to bring back that trophy."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>ALEX FERGUSON hailed his side as the best England has ever seen as they virtually wrapped up a record 19th title.</p>
              </h2>
              <p>Goals from Javier Hernandez and Nemanja Vidic saw Manchester United power six points clear of Chelsea at the top with two games to go.</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>And boss Fergie said: "It's fantastic to be the most successful team ever in the country.</p>
              <p>"The minute we won that first title in my time here in 1992 the door opened - and we've been involved in the first two practically throughout that period. It's a fantastic achievement." </p>
              <p>United now need just a point to seal the Premier League crown and move clear of Liverpool as the most prolific championship winners of all time. </p>
              <p>Fergie added: "For the last 17 or 18 years it has been Arsenal and Chelsea as our nearest challengers and the last few years it has been Chelsea. </p>
              <p>"Arsenal made a great attempt this year but them losing today and this win for us has finalised it.</p>
              <p>"We deserve the title and, hopefully, we'll get that point at Blackburn in our next game on Saturday.</p>
              <p>"But we'll give them 100 per cent respect because they are a good side battling for Premier League survival."</p>
              <p>Fergie is chasing his 12th title since taking over at Old Trafford in 1986.</p>
              <p>It will be his 27th major trophy as manager - with the Champions League final to come against Barcelona at Wembley on May 28.</p>
