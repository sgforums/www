            <div class='col-md body'>Premiership - Petrov confirms Spurs interest<br><br>Premiership - Atletico Madrid winger Martin Petrov has confirmed Tottenham are interested in his signature, even though he is yet to receive an official offer.<br><br>Spurs manager Martin Jol is believed to be a big fan of the Bulgaria international and a summer swoop for the 28-year-old could be on the cards as the Dutchman seeks to strengthen his squad in a bid to improve on last year's fifth place Premiership finish.<br><br>"Tottenham are showing interest in me and I do not hide this," Petrov said. "I can tell you that they are not the only club which has shown interest but as I say this is only interest and observations.<br><br>"There are no concrete talks or offers. I am very happy with this as every good player is pleased when he attracts interest from such big and strong clubs.<br><br>"There have been speculations linking me with Tottenham since last year," he continued. "I am still playing in the number 17 shirt for Atletico and nobody has called me with a transfer offer.<br><br>"The day before yesterday I had a meeting with my agent and he did not mention anything. If there was something he would have told me.<br><br>"For the moment I do not think about any transfers. I have four extremely important games until the end of the season â€“ two with Bulgaria and two with Atletico. I will think after this if there is anything concrete."<br><br>Atleti are competing with Real Zaragoza and Villarreal for a place in next season's UEFA Cup with just two games remaining, while Bulgaria have a pair of crucial Euro 2008 Group G qualifiers against Belarus to navigate over the coming week.<br><br>Should Petrov make a move to White Hart Lane, he could join up with compatriot Dimitar Berbatov. Striker Berbatov has been a revelation since his arrival in north London from Bayer Leverkusen last summer and would love the opportunity to link up once again at club level with his former CSKA Sofia team-mate.<br><br>"I bought a newspaper and saw the rumors linking Martin Petrov with Tottenham," Berbatov said. "I am pleased to see this but these things will be decided on a much higher level than me and him. It is always a good thing to have a compatriot with you but for the moment things remain as they were before.<br><br>Being asked whether there are real chances of Petrov joining him at Spurs, Berbatov said: "Nothing is impossible in football nowadays. We will see."<br></div>
