              <p><strong>Arsenal Football Club is delighted to announce that Robin van Persie has signed a new long-term contract with the Club.</strong><br> <br>Van
              Persie (25), who joined the Gunners from home town club Feyenoord in
              2004, was Arsenal’s leading goalscorer last season with 20 goals from
              his 44 overall appearances.<br> <br>In his five seasons with Arsenal,
              Van Persie, who is capable of turning a match at any time with a
              flourish of his left foot, has made 177 appearances for the Gunners,
              scoring a total of 63 goals in all competitions.<br> <br>The Dutch
              international striker, is also a regular with his national team and has
              scored 13 goals from his 37 appearances, already helping the
              Netherlands qualify for the FIFA World Cup 2010 in South Africa.<br> <br>Van
              Persie, who was an FA Cup winner with the Club in 2005, played an
              integral part in Arsenal’s run to the UEFA Champions League and FA Cup
              semi-finals last season. As well as his 11 Premier League goals, Robin
              scored five times in the Champions League and four in the FA Cup.
              Throughout the season, Robin produced many important and match winning
              performances, most notably scoring both goals in the 2-1 league win at
              Chelsea last November.<br> <br>Arsène Wenger said: “It’s fantastic news that Robin van Persie
              has committed his long term future to Arsenal Football Club, we’re all
              delighted. Robin is a hugely gifted player and has the talent and
              goalscoring ability to win matches at the very top level. We have
              already seen many times what Robin is capable of on a football pitch,
              but at only 25, there is still much more to come from him. Robin has
              the potential to become a true Arsenal great.”<br> <br>Robin van Persie
              added: “I’m so happy to have signed a new long term contract. I’ve been
              at the Club for five years now and there really is a great feeling here
              at Arsenal. We have a top class manager, a squad full of superb young
              players, a world class stadium and brilliant supporters. Arsenal
              Football Club has a very bright future and I want to be part of it. <br> <br>"My
              heart is with Arsenal and I just can’t picture myself in a different
              shirt. I just can’t see it now because I love this Club so much. If you
              look at the last five years, look at the steps I have made every
              season, if you look at the support the Boss and the whole Club gave me,
              the fans gave me, my team mates gave me – this is the right decision."<br> <br>Everyone at Arsenal Football Club is looking forward to Robin’s continued contribution in the forthcoming years.</p>
