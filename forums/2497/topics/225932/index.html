Pardew was dismissed as manager last week, with Alan Curbishley swiftly appointed as his successor.<br><br>Tevez, 22, told the News of the World: "I was surprised to see how long Pardew held on to the job in the end. "In Argentina or Brazil he would have been out long ago. It was clear the team did not react as he wanted - it wasn't going right."<br><br>The Argentine is yet to score a competitive goal for the Hammers since his move from Brazilian club Corinthians last August and has struggled to command a regular first-team place. He added: "I was never given the chances I thought I would be given and I was told to play out of position against my will.<br><br>"I had to sacrifice myself for the team, which I don't think helped. I was playing in ways I did not understand well and I lost a lot from my own game. "It didn't fit where he put me but I wanted to help. "I don't think he had a clear idea about my game or what to do.<br><br>"He was a good football man but more suited to coaching English teams without foreign players with big reputations. "I think that was a big problem for him." Tevez insists he is keen to help West Ham push up the table and is relishing working with new manager Curbishley.<br><br>He said: "I want to win with this team and a lot of people have told me great things about the new coach, so I want to start scoring for him and start helping West Ham win matches. "The fans have been fantastic towards me and I thank them. Now I want to repay them."<br></div>
