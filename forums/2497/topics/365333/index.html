              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez says Liverpool have enough money for one more signing after splashing £17 million on Portsmouth’s Glen Johnson. </strong></p>
              <p>The Pompey full back has agreed a move to The Reds and is expected to put pen-to-paper in the next 48 hours.</p>
              <p>The transfer represents a sizeable chunk of Benitez’s allotted
              funds, but the Liverpool boss says there is room for at least one more.</p>
              <p>“We have a plan,” the Spaniard told the Liverpool Echo. “<strong>We can sign
              one more player if necessary</strong>, but that’s without any players leaving.”</p>
              <p>The arrival of Johnson could pave the way for Alvaro Arbeloa’s move to Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>The Spain international has been linked with a summer switch to the
              Bernabeu, with the Spanish giants reportedly prepared to pay around £8
              million.</p>
              <p>Benitez says he wants Arbeloa to remain at Anfield, but given his
              current contract situation, he may be forced to consider offers.</p>
              <p>“Alvaro Arbeloa has had a very good season but he has one year left on his contract,” said Benitez.</p>
              <p>“If he signs that will be good because we will have more competition, but if we get a good offer we will have to consider it.”</p>
              <p><strong>Benitez revealed he over-paid to secure Johnson’s signature</strong>, but feels the England right back was a necessary addition.</p>
              <p>“Sometimes you have to spend a little bit more,” he added.</p>
              <p>“You can’t compete in the top four of The Premier League unless you spend some money.</p>
              <p>“We were looking for a player of quality and also somebody who is British because of the new Champions League rules.</p>
              <p>“Glen Johnson fits both categories.”</p>

              <p>He did say, ONE MORE SIGNING IF NECESSARY and <strong>That is WITHOUT ANY PLAYERS LEAVING.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This means even with the current players staying put, he can afford to sign one more player so why would he be screwed? We had a pretty solid team anyway, now with Glen Johnson, we have competition for the RB which was a problem last season. So he would have money to strengthen any other position he thinks is needed.</p>
              <p>However, if any one leaves and recently, its talks of Alonso and Masch. If any one of them leaves, it would not be a small sum. I guess it would at least be upwards of 25mil and above for Liverpool to consider. And with that money, I believe we can get excellent reinforcements for any one of them.</p>

              <p>Of cos its best he doesnt leave. But like any player who seems irreplaceable, there will always be someone out there who can step up to the plate. Ronaldo is leaving Man U but I do not think Fergie is in the least worried because with the money he is getting and his experience, what is there to stop him to build another formidable team next season?</p>
              <p>Same here, we will get alot of money for Masch if he leaves, he is an excellent player but not the only player in the world who can do what he does.</p>
