              <p><strong>Yossi Benayoun has marked his transformation at </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span><strong> by agreeing terms on a new contract that will tie him to Anfield until 2012.</strong></p>
              <p>The Israel international has two years remaining on his current deal but, following an impressive ending to last season, has been rewarded with a pay rise and a 12-month extension by the manager, Rafael Benítez. An agreement is in place with the 29-year-old and the contract will be signed ahead of the new season, underlining the extent of the midfielder's rapid recovery at Anfield.</p>
              <p>"I am very happy that we have reached an agreement," said Benayoun. "Of course, to be at a club like this is a dream come true and I want to keep playing here. Hopefully now I can concentrate on the hard work that needs to be done and try to play better and better and win some silverware."</p>
              <p>Benayoun instigated talks on his Liverpool future with Benítez only in January amid concern over his lack of first-team opportunities. He responded to the manager's assurances with the finest spell of his career on Merseyside, scoring seven goals in the final four months of the campaign, including the winner at Real Madrid in the Champions League, and playing an influential role in Liverpool's lengthy pursuit of Manchester United for the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span></a> title.</p>
              <p>The midfielder is the fifth senior player to commit his future to Liverpool in recent months, following Steven Gerrard, Fernando Torres, Dirk Kuyt and Daniel Agger, and Benítez admits stability in his squad – currently threatened by Real Madrid's and Barcelona's interest in Xabi Alonso and Javier Mascherano respectively – was a prerequisite for this summer.</p>

              <p>Rafa is too narrowminded and missed out on an experienced striker like Owen who would have been a great back-up for Torres... Anyway, Keane also hardly played when he was 2nd striker as Pool always plays with 1 striker only...</p>

              <p>No, if you wanna win the title, you gotta have decent players to back up those who get injured. How to keep injuries at a minimum? Those things are unpredictable.</p>
              <p>and I believe Owen was brought in by Fergie as back up only, if wanna play him consistently then not much point giving him a pay-as-you-play contract liao.</p>
