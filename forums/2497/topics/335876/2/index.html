              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">EVERYONE at Arsenal knows we have already dropped too many Premier League points. So we MUST beat Manchester United.</h2>
              <p class="article">We have no excuses for our recent results against Tottenham and Stoke and we cannot afford to lose today. We have to learn from the mistakes we have made in recent games and put things right. At Arsenal, we are wearing the shirt of one of the biggest clubs in the world. As players, we have a responsibility to defend the badge and win trophies. And we all have to take responsibility when things don’t go so well.</p>
              <p class="article">Some people are already saying that if we lose to United then our title challenge is over for another season. But nobody at the Emirates is thinking that. We all believe this is a fantastic opportunity to get our confidence back and show the world we’re ready to fight for everything.</p>
              <p class="article">It is far too early to write off Arsenal. At the moment, we are six points behind the leaders. If we win today, we will be back in the top three and putting pressure on Chelsea and Liverpool.</p>
              <p class="article">United are a great side with many great players. Whenever we play them it is always one of our toughest games of the season. The one thing we can be certain of is that it will be an entertaining football match between two teams who are both trying to win.</p>
              <p class="article">United won’t come to defend with 10 men behind the ball like so many visitors to the Emirates. They will attack, commit men forward and make it an open game with a lot of quality.</p>
              <p class="article">As a professional, these are the games you most enjoy playing. It’s much more fun than against teams who are only interested in defending. But to win the league you have to beat everyone. You can’t just play well against the top teams like United. You have to be focused on overcoming every style of opponent.</p>
              <p class="article">I am always hearing people say it’s the games against your top-four rivals which decide the title race. I don’t agree. Two seasons ago, we had the best record of top-four teams in games against each other. But we still didn’t win the league.</p>
              <p class="article">I believe it is the points you drop against the teams you are supposed to beat which prove decisive. You must try and beat everybody. This season, we have already lost to Fulham, Hull and Stoke — three games we were supposed to win.</p>
              <p class="article">It’s difficult to explain some of those results, and even more difficult to explain how we drew 4-4 with Tottenham last week. When you are 4-2 up with five minutes to go, there are no excuses for not winning the game.</p>
              <p class="article">All you have to do is defend well, put the ball into the corners and run down the clock. You don’t need to play football. Just win the game. We didn’t do that against Tottenham and paid a big price. It’s not just one player. We are all to blame.</p>
              <p class="article">There was huge disappointment after that. To drop points in those circumstances was frustrating for everyone. For our fans, Spurs is one of our biggest games of the season.</p>
              <p class="article">Nobody is perfect. We all want to win every game but that’s impossible. You cannot be 100 per cent in every match over a 70-game season. Right now, it looks as though no team is going to run away with the title race. Everyone has lost at least one league game. But we don’t want to be in a position where we are looking at other teams and worrying about their results. We need to focus on what we are doing.</p>
              <p class="article">One of the criticisms which has been levelled at Arsenal this season is that we are more interested in playing beautiful football than winning trophies. But I can promise you that is not the case. Arsenal’s philosophy is always to play good football and bring enjoyment to the supporters. But to win the game is the most important thing. And the most difficult thing.</p>
              <p class="article">Today we have to make sure the three points stay with us. If we can play good football on the way to beating United, all the better. But the result is more important than anything else. A win today will put everyone in the right frame of mind and show that we can handle the pressure.</p>
              <p class="article">I cannot agree with claims that Arsenal do not have experience to win the title. We might be young but we are not inexperienced. This is my sixth year at Arsenal and my fifth season in the side. As a team, we came of age last season when we went so close to winning the Premier League. That convinced everyone at the club that we have the quality to be champions.</p>

              <div><span><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has admitted the Emirates Stadium will play host to a 'critical' Premier League blockbuster on Saturday - but for Manchester United rather than Arsenal.</strong> </span></div>
              <div><span>.</span></div>
              <div><span>In the build up to an eagerly-awaited reunion between the Gunners and the Red Devils, most of the attention has been on the hosts. Arsene Wenger was outraged by Stoke's tactics at the Britannia Stadium last weekend when his side suffered a third defeat of the season. </span></div>
              <div><span>.</span></div>
              <div></div>
              <div id="articlebody">
              <p>Many pundits feel a fourth at the hands of Ferguson's men could prove terminal for Arsenal's championship hopes and with so many men missing, including star striker Emmanuel Adebayor, it looks a distinct possibility.</p>
              <p>But Ferguson is more interested in his own side and, having lost to Liverpool and drawn with Chelsea, Newcastle and Everton in their first 10 games, he knows United's record is not exactly flawless.</p>
              <p>"This match is critical for us," he said. "We have to win our games and be consistent from now until the end of the season because we have points to make up on Liverpool and Chelsea. "There is no way I am going to be thinking about what is happening at Arsenal. This game is important for Manchester United.</p>
              <p>"We have every right to contest the championship just the same as Arsenal or anyone else, so we will fight for the right to win." Not that Ferguson is unaware of Arsenal's plight. Wenger's team have come under attack for not only their performance in defeat at Stoke last weekend, but the Frenchman's attack on the Potters' approach.</p>
              <p>"When you play against Stoke, if you concede a throw or a corner you need your tin helmets on," Ferguson added. "You know the ball will be in the air and you have to head it. They know their strengths. They are committed and honest but I certainly do not think they are a dirty team."</p>
              <p>In such situations Ferguson tends to fight fire with fire, and that spirit is one of the reasons why he gave short shrift to Scott Brown's complaints about Cristiano Ronaldo apparently kicking him at Parkhead on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>"Has he never been kicked before?" said the Red Devils boss. "There is not a more fouled player in the country than Ronaldo but he just keeps getting up and saying 'Give me the ball'. "It is the courage that distinguishes great players from everyone else."</p>
              <p>Past history suggest Howard Webb will have his work cut out to maintain order on Saturday, even if Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira are no longer centre stage.</p>
              <p>In accepting Wenger's Arsenal have played 'excellent' football for the last six years, Ferguson also feels both sides have changed as the greats of yesteryear called time on their careers.</p>
              <p>"We have different types of player now," he added. "You could say we have more of a football team than we had 10 years ago. "It is impossible replicate every item of a team."</p>
              <p>Ferguson does feel his side's second-half showing at Celtic proves they are approaching their best form. The same cannot be said about Arsenal, although no one in the United camp is taking much optimism from that.</p>
              <p>"Arsenal have had injuries and when you don't have your best players you don't get the best results," observed Ferguson. "Arsene has one or two key players out but if anyone thinks it will be easy, they are wrong. "It will be a tough game, as it always is. Over the years, games between the two clubs have always been very competitive.</p>
              <p>"They are always played at great speed and they are always highly emotional games. "I am sure their fans will be wound up tomorrow because of what has been said during the week. We have to cope with that."</p>

              <h1>Arsene Wenger calls on Arsenal to prove critics wrong against Manchester United</h1>
              <h2>Arsene Wenger called on his young guns to return to winning ways against Manchester United at the Emirates Stadium, and prove to a growing number of cynics that his team are capable of winning trophies.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01110/arsene_wenger_crit_1110042c.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="288"></p>
              <p><span class="caption"><em>Prove me wrong: Arsene Wenger wants crirtics to take note</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Arsenal face United in the lunch-time kick-off following three games without a victory and with a growing list of injuries. But Wenger claimed the challenge to his youngsters was the perfect chance to bounce back.</strong></p>
              <p>“It’s a fantastic opportunity to show, when everyone is doubting us, how strong we are,” said a defiant Wenger. “When people doubt you, the mental strength is maybe the most important quality for playing for a big club. I’m very proud of what my players do and I’m very proud of the job I’m doing.”</p>
              <p>A defeat could widen the gap between Arsenal and the leaders to nine points with less than a third of the season completed and would intensify concerns that Wenger has lost his way and his team are now a soft touch. But he added: “I would not exchange my position with any other manager because I believe in our qualities.”</p>
              <p>United arrive at the Emirates unbeaten in seven League games. Sir Alex Ferguson and his squad will receive increased security after complaining of abuse received from the home supporters during last season’s 2-2 draw. The United manager has called for police action to rid the game of the abusive chants directed at players and managers after urging his team’s supporters to end their abuse of Wenger.</p>
              <p>“There has been a focus on fans’ behaviour, not just towards Arsene Wenger, but to other managers too,” Ferguson said. “I think it’s ridiculous and I believe that the police should be stepping in."</p>
