              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Basil Fawlty would probably accuse Thomas Sorensen of "stating the bleeding obvious" in response to the Stoke City goalkeeper's assertion that Arsenal "lack the spine needed" to mount any kind of challenge for the Premier League title.</strong></p>
              <p>But if the penny had still to drop for Arsene Wenger prior to his team's woeful display at the Britannia Stadium, Sorensen's brutal assessment of Arsenal's failings might just force home the message that English football now views the Gunners as a soft touch, a team that can be 'got at'.</p>
              <p>The Britannia Stadium on a cold, windy November day is no place for the faint-hearted, especially when Rory Delap is producing his A-game with his jet-propelled throw-ins, but Arsenal hearts were faint from the moment they walked onto the pitch.</p>
              <p>It was evident from the looks on the faces of Cesc Fabregas and, particularly, Emmanuel Adebayor, that Stoke was the last place Arsenal's players wanted to be.</p>
              <p>Adebayor's performance was pitiful. Outfought by the muscular Stoke centre-half Ryan Shawcross, the Togolese forward developed an exaggerated limp and slumped to the ground three times, clutching his ankle, following a late second-half challenge by the defender. Adebayor was ultimately replaced by Wenger, but it's difficult to imagine how his efforts would have gone down had he shared a dressing-room with the likes of Adams, Keown, Winterburn and Vieira.</p>
              <p>Those great names of Arsenal's past would have relished this encounter with Tony Pulis's passionate Stoke team because they would have matched the home side's commitment before allowing their superior quality to do the rest.</p>
              <p>This Arsenal team did not want to know, however, and Sorensen – barged to the ground by the petulant Robin van Persie in an incident that led to the Arsenal substitute's dismissal – suggested that Wenger's team lack the steel required to succeed in the Premier League.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01106/arsene-wenger-arse_1106191d.jpg" border="0" alt="Arsenal 'lack spine' claims Stoke's Thomas Sorensen " width="380" height="237"></h2>
              <p><span class="caption"><em>Discussion time: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger had much to ponder during his side's limp defeat at Stoke City</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sorensen said: "Arsenal have shown in the past that they are a fantastic football side, but they are just lacking that bit of physicality. When Chelsea came here, they matched us in the challenges, but Arsenal weren't quite there.</p>
              <p>"That's the difference. Arsenal lack that bit of spine that you need. They want to play all the time, but sometimes you have to work hard and earn the opportunity to play your football.</p>
              <p>"They have excellent players, but once we got the second goal, it felt like we were cruising because they totally lost belief. I think they expected a bit of an easier ride, but no one's going to get that here."</p>
              <p>Ahead of this game, half of Stoke's goals this season had been as a result of Delap's penetrative throw-ins, but Arsenal centre-halves Kolo Toure and Mikael Silvestre were more Cannon and Ball than Adams and Bould in their attempts to deal with the two throw-ins that led to goals for Ricardo Fuller and Seyi Olofinjana.</p>
              <p>Gael Clichy's injury-time goal might have reduced the arrears, but Van Persie's dismissal and injuries sustained by Adebayor, Bacary Sagna and Theo Walcott capped a dreadful day for Arsenal, who, Wenger admits, cannot afford to lose at home to Manchester United this Saturday.</p>
              <p>He said: "There is no better game in which to come back from a defeat from a confidence point of view. It will also give us a chance to show we have quality."</p>

              <h2>WENGER: `WE MUST BEAT UNITED`</h2>

              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger says Arsenal have to win their clash with Manchester United on Saturday.</strong> </p>
              <p>The Gunners suffered their third defeat of the season against Stoke at the weekend, a defeat that cast serious doubts over their chances of mounting a serious title challenge this season. </p>
              <p>Now Wenger realises that they cannot make many more slip-ups, starting with the visit of United.</p>
              <p>"I don't know how many more defeats we can afford," he said. "It's very difficult to say. "We first have to win our next game and we have a chance again when we play Manchester United on Saturday. </p>
              <p>"There is no better game in which to come back from a defeat and from a confidence point of view. It will also give us a chance to show we have quality." </p>
              <p>"Is it a game we can't afford to lose? What manager would tell you they can afford to lose a game? You can never afford to lose but we just want to win." </p>
              <p>Arsenal have a number of injury concerns ahead of that game, with Theo Walcott and Emmanuel Adebayor limping out of the Stoke defeat. Add to that Robin van Persie's suspension following his red card at the Britannia Stadium, and there are plenty of worries for Arsene Wenger. </p>
              <p>However, the state of his squad is apparently not his primary concern at the moment. Wenger told the Arsenal official website: "My biggest worry is that we did not create a lot. We are not used to playing without creating chances and that is very frustrating. </p>
              <p>"They scored on two throws and I know you never want that. But we could not express our strong side in the game, which is to create chances and get them out of position. </p>
              <p>"I don't approve or disapprove [of Stoke's tactics]. They played the game they wanted and they played it very well. At the end of the day, they could express their strong points and we could not."</p>

              <p><strong>Arsenal are hopeful William Gallas and Theo Walcott will be fit to face Manchester United on Saturday.</strong></p>
              <p>Walcott emerged as a doubt after picking up a knock against Stoke at the weekend, a game Gallas missed on account of injury.</p>
              <p>Walcott fell awkwardly on his shoulder and Gunners chief Arsene Wenger described the injury as ‘serious’.</p>
              <p>However, the England international’s problem has responded well to treatment and he is expected to be passed fit for the visit of the champions.</p>
              <p>Emmanuel Adebayor also failed to finish the defeat to Stoke, leaving the field on a stretcher, but there is not yet an update on the Togo star.</p>
              <p>“Gallas and Walcott are short term, Adebayor is a little longer, Eboue as well," Wenger said at a press conference on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>“Gallas and especially Walcott (should have a chance to face United).”</p>

              <h1>Arsenal's Mikael Silvestre in doubt for Manchester United showdown</h1>
              <h2>Arsenal's Mikael Silvestre suffered a suspected broken nose and is doubtful for the visit of former club Manchester United on Saturday.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01108/mikael-silvestre_1108371c.jpg" alt="Arsenal's Mikael Silvestre in doubt for Manchester United showdown " width="460" height="288"></p>
              <p><span class="caption"><em>Ouch: Arsenal defender Mikael Silvestre could miss a match against old team Manchester United with a suspected broken nose sustained against Fenerbahce</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manager Arsene Wenger is already without the injured Emmanuel Adebayor, Eduardo and Tomas Rosicky, while Robin van Persie is suspended for the crucial game. William Gallas and Theo Walcott are rated as doubtful to face the Premier League champions, while goalkeeper Manuel Almunia missed the 0-0 draw against Fenerbahce with a virus, so inexperienced Pole Lukasz Fabianski is on standby.</strong></p>
              <p>Silvestre was injured when he was struck in the face with a forearm from Fenerbahce's Semih Senturk and Wenger, whose week goes from bad to worse, bemoaned his luck.</p>
              <p>"He got Silvestre on the nose, but I don't know whether it was intentional or not," Wenger said. "Silvestre is a worry for Saturday but I don't know if he broke his nose." Wenger admitted that Arsenal were struggling after three difficult games, but that they were not alone. "None of the English teams have won in the Champions League this week and maybe that's because they gave a lot physically in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>"I don't know how Liverpool drew, Chelsea were not sharp physically and we were not sharp. The Premier League is demanding and it's difficult to play in the Champions League after a tough weekend game. We created many chances in the first half but became flat physically in the second half," he said. "We had three tough games over the week. You could see that reflected in the creative side of our game.</p>
              <p>"Fenerbahce were happy to defend in the final third and that made for a 0-0. We are used to creating chances in the last 20 minutes and this didn't come today because physically we didn't have it in us."</p>
              <p>United arrive on the back of seven Premier League games without defeat and Wenger said: "Playing United is always special. It's of massive importance to us and it is vital that we do well in the big games now."</p>
              <p>Cesc Fabregas, one of the few Arsenal players to avoid serious injury since returning from a hamstring problem, warned that players had to be on top of their game to keep their places, despite the lack of numbers at the Emirates.</p>
              <p>"We don't want excuses because we are playing for Arsenal and a lot of players would like to be in our position," the Spaniard said. "We have to make sure we give everything on the pitch."</p>
              <p>"The next match is massive, but we welcome this because it is a big game and big players want to play big games."</p>

              <p><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo wants Manchester United to go for the jugular and get their first ever win at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium on Saturday. The Portugal winger expects a tough test despite the amount of injuries Arsene Wenger has to cope with.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>United lost their visits to Liverpool and also dropped points against Newcastle and Everton this term, and Ronaldo feels Sir Alex Ferguson's side have plenty to prove as they go for a title hat-trick.</p>
              <p>"We want to win the title so we have to get three points there," Ronaldo said. I don't know if it is tough for them at the moment but they will still have 11 players, the same as us, and I know it will be difficult because it always is.</p>
              <p>"But we have a great spirit and we are a great team, so our aim is to pick up three points."</p>
              <p>United had an excellent record at Highbury in its latter years, they have so far managed a single point from two visits to the Emirates, conceding late goals on both occasions.</p>
              <p>"It is a new stadium and maybe it is because of that our record at the Emirates is not as good as it was at Highbury," Ronaldo added. "But do not forget also Arsenal have great talent. We respect them and it is going to be difficult to win there."</p>
              <p>Ronaldo believes Arsenal are not out of the title race. "Last season Arsenal started very well and dropped points at the end of the season," he said. "Maybe this season is going to be different. Maybe they will lose points at the start and then win them in the last bit of the season. But we can't worry about that. We have to think about ourselves."</p>

              <h2>ARSENAL INTRODUCE `EJECTION SQUAD` TO PROTECT FERGUSON</h2>

              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p><strong>Arsenal have agreed to
              protect Sir Alex Ferguson at the Emirates tomorrow by introducing an
              'ejection squad' behind the Manchester United dugout despite
              discovering no cause for the Scot's complaints after last November's
              draw.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Speaking after the 2-2 draw in North London a year ago, Ferguson
              claimed that Gunners fans sitting directly behind him were guilty of
              sustained verbal abuse and expressed his concerns about the lack of
              security.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to The Daily Telegraph, 'An internal Arsenal inquiry
              concluded that the fans were chanting only "Taggart'' at the Glaswegian
              during the 2-2 draw on Nov 3, 2007, and cameras picked up a United
              security man turning provocatively to home fans after Cristiano Ronaldo
              scored.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, the club have confirmed that there will "be an extra
              three stewards in the 'paddock', the row behind the dugout, making five
              stewards in total. At the back of block 32 [behind the away dugout],
              there will be an 'ejection squad', viewing the fans in case there is
              any issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"In addition to those provisions, there will be somebody in the
              control room watching an extra camera that will be monitoring the
              situation around the dugout. It must be stressed that we have never had
              any problems other than this one [last year] and we are all hopeful
              that the game will go off peacefully,'' a spokesman told the newspaper.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Telegraph adds that 'While Ferguson may be mollified that
              Arsenal have taken action to minimise abuse from fans at the Emirates,
              there is still no sign of United addressing the abuse Arsene Wenger
              receives whenever he visits Old Trafford.'</p>
