              <p><strong>Roy Hodgson’s stock is rising at the FA as they prepare for life without Fabio Capello after Euro 2012.</strong></p>
              <p>There has been a growing belief inside football’s ruling body that there should be a move back to an English boss when the job becomes available. At the moment Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp is widely acknowledged as the people’s choice to succeed Capello.</p>
              <p>In fact, Redknapp is the favourite with all the bookies quoting odds on the FA’s line of succession.</p>
              <p>But Sunday Mirror sport can reveal that West Brom manager Hodgson is gaining credibility within FA circles as the heir apparent to Capello’s throne.</p>

              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>A four man short-list is emerging featuring Hodgson, Redknapp, Real Madrid boss Jose Mourinho and Stuart Pearce, currently in charge of the England Under-21 team.</p>
              <p>Over the past couple of years Hodgson’s name has often been mentioned as a potential candidate for the England job without him ever gaining a real upsurge of support. That appears to be changing now.</p>
              <p>Hodgson’s successful time at Fulham, allied to his past experience as an international manager with Switzerland, Finland and the UAE, made him a genuine contender.</p>
              <p>In fact, at one point he was quoted by bookies as evens favourite to eventually land the England job.</p>
              <p>But in the summer of 2010 he joined Liverpool in a move that went badly wrong for both parties. The political and ownership rows engulfing Anfield undermined the new manager.</p>
              <p>Hodgson appeared to struggle to develop a real working rapport with the Anfield staff. And while his transfer resources were limited the impact of his signings was poor.</p>
              <p>After barely six months in the Anfield job he left with the club floundering. And yet, by guiding West Brom impressively out of the relegation zone last spring Hodgson again proved his managerial credentials.</p>
              <p>In recent discussions Hodgson is being cited as a likely front-runner when the task of naming Capello’s successor comes around.</p>
              <p>Even though the FA have declared a preference to appoint a British boss next the FA are considering Mourinho as the outstanding international alternative. The controversial former Chelsea boss has been sounded out in the past but always maintained he would only manage one international team - his native Portugal.</p>
              <p>Stuart Pearce, the Under-21 coach, is also likely to be interviewed for the post but is widely perceived to be the outsider for the job. However, FA sources believe that in terms of continuity Pearce must be considered for the job.</p>
              <p>Paddy Power odds on next permanent England manager:</p>
              <p>Harry Redknapp 6-5</p>
              <p>Roy Hodgson 9-1</p>
              <p>Jose Mourinho 12-1</p>
              <p>Stuart Pearce 9-1</p>
