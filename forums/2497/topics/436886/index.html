              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Bolton manager Owen Coyle has confirmed the club have rejected a 'derisory' bid from Arsenal for defender Gary Cahill.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The 25-year-old is entering the final year of his contract at the Reebok Stadium and Gunners boss Arsene Wenger has been consistently linked with the England international.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Wenger is keen to bolster his defensive options - he is also thought to be interested in Everton's Phil Jagielka, Blackburn's Chris Samba and Germany international Per Mertesacker - and has money available following the departures of Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But Coyle says the two clubs are a distance apart in terms of their valuation of Cahill.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He said: 'There was a conversation between (Bolton chairman) Phil Gartside and a representative of Arsenal.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I'm only passing this on as a third party, but the word derisory doesn't even cover it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'When I make an offer for a player, I'd like to think in the right ball park, but this wasn't even close.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I spoke to Gary Cahill about it before the Macclesfield game, and he knows everything that's going on.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">While Coyle did not confirm how much Arsenal had offered for the player, it is reported that the bid was in the region of £7million.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">That figure was disputed by Wenger when he addressed the press.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Frenchman said: 'If Bolton are not happy with the price they do not have to sell the player. That [£6m] number is wrong... I believe negotiations are between two parties.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Coyle also confirmed that defender Marcos Alonso is facing eight to 12 weeks on the sidelines after suffering a broken metatarsal in the midweek Carling Cup win over Macclesfield.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Spaniard was making his first start since April but joins a defensive injury list that includes Tyrone Mears, Sam Ricketts and Gretar Steinsson.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Coyle said: 'Marcos has fractured a bone in his foot and he will have an operation this morning. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'He will be out for eight to 12 weeks, which is a real blow for him because he was starting to get to grips with the English game. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'He had a terrific pre-season and was pushing to try to get into the starting line-up.'<br></span></p>

              <p><a href="http://www.goal.com/en/teams/england/94/arsenal"><span style="color: #004276;"><strong>Arsenal</strong></span></a><strong> manager </strong><a href="http://www.goal.com/en/teams/england/94/arsenal"><span style="color: #004276;"><strong>Arsene Wenger</strong></span></a><strong> could be set for a war of words with </strong><a href="http://www.goal.com/en/teams/england/100/bolton-wanderers"><span style="color: #004276;"><strong>Bolton</strong></span></a><strong> and their chairman Phil Gartside regarding the transfer of Trotters defender </strong><a href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/england/10619/gary-cahill"><span style="color: #004276;"><strong>Gary Cahill</strong></span></a><strong>.</strong></p>
              <p>It was confirmed that the Gunners bid for the England international and the fee involved was reported to be £6 million (€6.7m), an offer that Bolton boss Owen Coyle described being so low that "derisory doesn't even cover it".</p>
              <p>However, Wenger reacted bluntly to these reports, stating that the rumoured fee was wrong, before confirming the two sides were in negotiations.</p>
              <p>Speaking to reporters, Wenger said: “That number is wrong, it is completely wrong. I believe every negotiation is between two parties and you only have to sell the player if you are all right with the price.</p>
              <p>"In this case the information is below what has been spoken about."</p>
              <p>Gartside reacted angrily to this supposed £6m bid by re-tweeting a fan’s anger on twitter, whilst Coyle, as mentioned, understood the bid to be far below what they were looking for.</p>
              <p>However, Wenger could not understand the anger shown by Bolton, pointing out that if they don’t wish to sell their player then they don’t have to and it is as simple as that, but doesn’t know why the bid – regardless of how small – is “insulting.”</p>
              <p>He continued: "You only have to sell the player if you are all right with the price. It is not true. You can believe Gartside or you can believe me. It's not right. It's not the truth.</p>
              <p>"If Gartside can say I am lying I am ready to confront him. The truth is that we never speak about our negotiations.</p>
              <p>"If a club doesn't want to sell a player it can keep him. When we sign a player we come out here and tell you and keep the price a secret.</p>
              <p>"They do not need to sell the player, they can keep him. If you ask do I want to buy your house and you are not happy with the price you say no, that's it.</p>
              <p>"Why should you feel insulted? I don't understand. If the player is not for sale they can keep him. I don't understand the problem.</p>
              <p>"If we want to buy the player we buy the player. I do not have to explain for how much."</p>
