              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea </strong></span></a><strong>star Ashley Cole was arrested early today after a drunken confrontation with police - handing boss Guus Hiddink a test to his reputation as a tough disciplinarian.</strong></p>
              <p>The Dutch coach must decide how to handle the 28-year-old, who was detained following a foul-mouthed rant at officers in west London.</p>
              <p>The incident comes as his club are preparing for Saturday's FA Cup quarter-final at Coventry, while Chelsea are also chasing Manchester United in the Barclays Premier League and looking for glory in the Champions League.</p>
              <p>Hiddink has reinvigorated Chelsea, leading them to four consecutive victories since taking over as head coach, and the players had been on their best behaviour and displaying a unity lacking under Luiz Felipe Scolari.</p>
              <p>But Hiddink will no doubt be alarmed that one of his top stars should be inebriated so close to a big game. Sources claimed the £82,000 a week England international repeatedly swore at police after emerging from the Collection nightclub in Brompton Road, South Kensington.</p>
              <p>After apparently refusing to tone down his language, he was detained and taken to a police station to sober up. After spending three hours in a custody suite, he was issued with an £80 fixed penalty notice for being drunk and disorderly and allowed to go home. Earlier he had been pictured at a nearby charity event with ex GMTV presenter Fiona Phillips.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/03/05/article-1159663-028182C3000004B0-359_468x286.jpg" alt="Ashley Cole" width="468" height="286"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>This charming man: Cole gestures to Arsenal fans in December 2007</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>It is not the first time that Cole, undoubtedly one of the best full backs in the world, has hit the headlines for the wrong reasons. He was ridiculed for comments criticising his former club Arsenal in his 2006 autobiography.</strong></p>
              <p>A year ago he was criticised for the petulant way he confronted referee Mike Riley during Chelsea's fiery 4-4 draw with Tottenham at White Hart Lane. Cole fouled Alan Hutton before remonstrating at length with the official about the incident, at one point turning his back on Riley in an incident that heightened the need for the Premier League's Respect Campaign.</p>
              <p>His marriage to Girls Aloud singer and X Factor judge Cheryl Cole was put under huge strain last year over allegations of his infidelity.</p>
              <p><br> </p>

              <p>The former Arsenal player was branded a love rat by hairdresser Aimee Walton, who claimed he cheated Cheryl following a drunken night out with his footballing friends in late 2007.</p>

              <p><strong>Ashley Cole has apologised to the police for a X-rated tirade that caused him to be arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a statement released by the Chelsea left-back, Cole said he swore
              out of his frustration with the paparazzi and insisted he would never
              disrespect the police.<span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>However, the England
              international admits he did not heed their warnings to calm down and
              regrets not taking their advice. He also made it clear that he had not
              consumed a vast amount of alcohol.</p>
              <p>Cole declared: "I would like to take this opportunity to apologise to the police officers on duty last night for my language.</p>
              <p>"I
              felt I was being harassed by paparazzi and while complaining to the
              police about this at the scene they did warn me to calm down, a warning
              that I regrettably did not heed.</p>
              <p>"I fully appreciate that
              whatever frustrations I may have had with others that it was completely
              inappropriate to vent those in conversations with the police.</p>
              <p>"However,
              I do want to make clear that I swore in frustration at the paparazzi's
              behaviour. I would never disrespect police officers in anyway.</p>
              <p>"I take very seriously my responsibilities as a professional footballer, this includes keeping my body in the best condition.</p>
              <p>"Although I had consumed some alcohol earlier in the evening on a night out with friends it had not been excessive.</p>
              <p>"But
              I accept that the language I used on this occasion was wrong. I regret
              my actions and how it reflects on myself and Chelsea Football Club."</p>
              <p>The
              28-year-old was arrested in Brompton Road, South Kensington, at about
              2.15am on Thursday morning after emerging from the Collection nightclub.</p>
              <p>Police sources said the officers were already on patrol in the street and were not called to any disorder.</p>
              <p>One source denied reports they were following up a complaint from a photographer over an alleged bust-up with Cole.</p>
              <p>Cole
              was taken to a central London police station and issued with an £80
              fixed penalty notice for being drunk and disorderly before being
              released shortly after 5.30am.</p>
              <p>Cole is likely to be fined by Chelsea.</p>
              <p>The Collection nightclub is a popular haunt on the west London celebrity scene.</p>
              <p>Before
              his arrest last night, Cole had joined Chelsea's first-team squad and
              more than 300 charity workers, celebrities and supporters for the
              second annual Chelsea FC and Armani charity fundraiser.</p>
              <p>Cole,
              who racked up a £1,000 bill at the restaurant with team-mates Terry and
              Michael Mancienne, was "rude" to police after getting frustrated by
              waiting paparazzi, Mr Maraj revealed.</p>
              <p>The manager said the trio had "behaved well" before someone apparently took a picture of Cole inside the restaurant.</p>
              <p>The three players enjoyed a range of drinks, some of which may have been bought for them by other guests, he added.</p>
              <p>"People
              were coming up to them during dinner, men and women. They seemed happy
              and quite polite - all the players came for a quiet night."</p>
              <p>Revealing
              how Princes William and Harry were previously regular guests at the
              bar, Mr Maraj added: "I believe there was a photographer inside who
              took a picture of Cole.</p>
              <p>"He (Cole) was more frustrated than being drunk, because of paparazzi - it must have been something.</p>
              <p>"My
              staff told me he stopped to speak to police as he left. He was
              apparently complaining about paparazzi. My staff said he was being rude
              to the police."</p>
              <p>He added that the Chelsea players regularly visited his venue and always behaved well.</p>
              <p>Cole ate a Japanese steak costing £50, he added.</p>
