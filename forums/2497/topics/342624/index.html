              <h1>AC Milan offer Arsenal £4million for William Gallas</h1>
              <p></p>
              <p class="up"><img src="http://images.mirror.co.uk/upl/m4/nov2008/4/0/EAA9D651-F5E0-66DF-5300978E315B02A6.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p class="up"> </p>
              <p><strong>Italian giants AC Milan are offering bad boy William Gallas a £4million escape route out of his Arsenal hell. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger would be ready to offload him this month - as long as he can get a replacement.</strong></p>
              <p>Juventus are also on standby but AC Milan have come in because they are desperate for a new defender as veteran centre-half Alessandro Nesta has been plagued by injuries this season.</p>
              <p>Gallas is aware of the Italian interest and has admitted he nearly joined AC Milan in the past and playing in Serie A appeals to him.</p>
              <p>It has left Wenger with a major dilemma over the 31-year-old who is still being given the cold shoulder over his outspoken attack on his team-mates this season which has torn the dressing room apart.</p>
              <p>Wenger has publicly insisted Gallas still has a future at the club despite stripping him of the captaincy following his outburst.</p>
              <p>But privately he has never forgiven him and has rarely spoken to him in the past six weeks apart from giving him instructions with the rest of the team.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">AC MILAN have upped their interest in Chelsea star Alex. And the defender’s sale will provide Phil Scolari with cash to splash out on Brazil countryman Kleber.</h2>
              <p class="article">Milan are desperate for a quality centre-back and have also expressed an interest in Arsenal’s William Gallas, 31.</p>
              <p class="article">But, at 26, Alex is a much better investment and the Italian club believe they can get the Brazilian for £10million.</p>
              <p class="article">That would give Blues boss Scolari funds to buy a replacement — and Santos defender Kleber is a bargain at just £2m.</p>
              <p class="article">Scolari gave Kleber his first international cap in 2001. Yet Chelsea face competition from Manchester City, who have the advantage of having Kleber’s friend Robinho already at the club.</p>
              <p class="article">Kleber, 28, said: “I had a year in Europe with Hannover and the experience was great. “Robinho told me he was going to suggest me to the Man City board. If he gets me to play in Manchester, I will be thankful for the rest of my life.</p>
              <p class="article">“It would be a once-in- a-lifetime opportunity. I’d say ‘yes’ straight away.”</p>

              <h1>Milan Ready To Offer Arsenal Cash For Gallas</h1>
              <h2>Italian giants AC Milan are ready to rumble in north London as they increase the pressure on Arsenal to release their renegade French central defender William Gallas.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/41193_news.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Milan are ready to offer under-fire Arsenal stopper William Gallas an escape route from the Emirates as they get set to launch a €5 million bid for him.</strong></p>
              <p>The French defender has reached the point of no return and rumours of an exit have been rife ever since he was stripped of the captaincy. Arsenal do not seem resistant to a sale and the deal could take off during the current transfer window.</p>
              <p><em>Il Corriere Dello Sport</em> claim the San Siro giants are keen on the 31-year-old and they are looking at ways of bringing him to Serie A. The Rossoneri have a number of injury problems at the back and, with Alessandro Nesta facing the possibility of an operation, a defender with experience is needed.</p>
              <p>Vice-president Adriano Galliani has opened the safe and €5m have Gallas' name on it. Milan could also be coaxed into signing on-loan defender Philippe Senderos, also from Arsenal, who could be inserted into the deal in order to further convince the north London club.</p>
              <p>Also, Gallas would be eligible to participate in Milan's UEFA Cup campaign which is good news for Carlo Ancelotti as his side haven't always impressed in the competition this term.</p>
