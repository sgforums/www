              <h2>Barcelona technical director Txiki Bergiristain has declared that
              the club have plunged into crisis after their shocking collapse against
              Real Betis at the weekend.</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/28441_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200"></p>
              <p>For anyone in the Blaugrana camp still holding on to thoughts of a
              temporary blip, there is news. Coming for the very top echelons of the
              club, the message is clear: Barcelona are in crisis.</p>
              <p>During an interview with Catalan television, Txiki Begiristain
              explained that he felt that the players were unable to cope when the
              going became tough in matches and that was why he believes the team are
              in crisis mode.</p>
              <p>He admitted that the club had plans in place to make changes, but
              would only carry those out "at the end of the season" and that Frank
              Rijkaard would "not be going anywhere for now."</p>
              <p>"The fans don't want words. They just want to see the right actions.
              Barcelona have to react," he said. "Rijkaard will not back down from
              his role."</p>
              <p>After Bojan Krkic and Samuel Eto'o had given Barça a commanding lead
              in the Ruiz de Lopera at the weekend, Betis came back and netted three
              times in the second period to record a memorable win. Rijkaard
              had admitted that he was ashamed, while Puyol had opined that
              the collapse was symptomatic of the club's season as a whole.</p>
              <p>Txiki has also admitted that he was stunned the team have lost
              their key characteristic - that of not giving opponents any chance of a
              recovery.</p>
              <p>"This team is used to defending results, like when we won
              the Champions League. Even this year, in the cup, against difficult
              teams like Sevilla, we did the same. But now things have changed, and
              we have entered a crisis," he affirmed.</p>
              <p>"Our defense lacks consistency. The team has the capacity to fix
              this problem, but when their opponents are difficult, they have
              struggled."</p>
              <p>Let alone clean sheets, even if Barcelona conceded just the one goal
              per game since January (they conceded 0.89 per game in 2006-07), they
              would have had 13 more points in La Liga, and would have been six ahead
              of Real Madrid. In addition, they would have been in the Spanish Cup
              final. </p>
              <p>Atletico Madrid have scored four against them, while Betis, Almeria,
              Valencia and Villarreal have all score two or more in what has been a
              shocking defensive collapse. Anything barring a full recovery by
              Tuesday could see Barcelona's season come crashing down.</p>
