In the 62nd minute Florent Malouda appeared to jump into Steve Finnan and Styles pointed to the spot. I can only assume he thought Finnan had blocked Malouda from challenging for the ball. It was a crucial decision and given without an appeal from Chelsea. Styles will have had a long drive home. </strong><br><br>Rob Styles has been dropped from the referees list for wrongly giving Chelsea a penalty at Liverpool. The official will not take charge of a Premier League game this weekend after his bosses ruled he made a mistake and apologised on his behalf to a furious Rafael Benitez.<br><br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/08_02/Essien2yellows_468x208.jpg"><br><span class="small">Rob Styles adds to a penalty controversy by apparently booking Michael Essien twice - without sending him off</span><br><br>Styles made several other mistakes and appeared to show Michael Essien a second yellow card after booking John Terry in the second half. He raised the card twice, the second time with the midfielder immediately in front of him and the defender nowhere near.<br><br>Essien thought he was off but Styles insists he was showing the card to Terry.<br><br></div>

That referee probably had a good excuse cos Mendes took his shot like in his own half or something like from the middle... It was a counter attack move and that ref was way behind him... that said, means that ref had to see something like from 2/3 away from a 100 metres wide field while running to get back as well... and the linesman was not that close either as he too was running back from the upper half of the field when it happened... And as they say, when in doubt, cannot give. Styles's case was much different, he was just right infront of the incident and he seem to have made other mistakes in the match and not just one... Anyway, that case happened many years ago already... New people have taken over not just the FA but i think the referee official too...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

"I think the position is [Rob] is not going to be used next week and he can have a run of low-key games where he can get his form back and it can repair the guy for the Premiership."<br><br>Hackett has also dropped Ian Gosling after the assistant referee failed to award Fulham a late goal against Middlesbrough on Saturday when David Healy's shot crossed the line.<br><br>Hackett will today meet Styles and the fourth official at Anfield, Phil Dowd, to discuss a second controversial incident, involving Michael Essien. The Chelsea midfielder appeared to be awarded two yellow cards only for Styles to claim the second was intended for John Terry.<br><br></div>
