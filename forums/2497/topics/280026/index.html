Atletico's Argentine striker Sergio Aguero put away Yourkas Seitaridis's cross early on but Francisco Gallardo struck a late equaliser when he wrong-footed Costinha and rifled a shot into the far corner.<br><br>The result leaves Atletico with just two points, seven behind city rivals Real.<br><br>Their UEFA Cup rivals Villarreal snatched a late 1-0 win at Real Mallorca thanks to Nihat Kahveci's long range free kick but were fortunate whn a late Mallorca effort was ruled offside.<br><br>Espanyol beat visitors Getafe 1-0 and Deportivo Coruna also won 1-0 at home to a disappointing Real Betis while Pedro Munitis gave Racing Santander a 1-0 victory over Levante.<br></div>
