              <h1 class="art-headline">What are you talking about David... YOU made us wear THOSE suits</h1>
              <h2 class="art-standfirst"><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/41332000/jpg/_41332276_whitesuits203.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="152"></h2>
              <p class="art-p"><strong>Robbie Fowler wants FA Cup Final revenge on David James for being made to look ridiculous in Liverpool's notorious white suits. The Anfield legend, 33, hopes to be fit for Saturday's Wembley date with Portsmouth.</strong></p>
              <p class="art-p">It will bring back memories of Liverpool's 1-0 defeat to Manchester United in the 1996 final when the Reds strolled out posing in Armani cream suits - helping them earn their 'Spice Boys' tag. Fowler insists Pompey keeper James, 37, must take the rap for the embarrassing fashion own goal which none of Liverpool's former stars have been able to live down.</p>
              <p class="art-p">I've still got the white suit, I may wear it for our Christmas fancy-dress bash next year," smiled Fowler, who joined Cardiff on a free last summer. "People still remind me about the white suits all the time. It's one of those things - if we had won the game nobody would have mentioned it but we lost and it has become infamous.</p>
              <p class="art-p">"It was David James' fault we wore white suits, it was his idea. He's bigger than everyone so nobody questioned him and at the time he was an Armani model. "I was only a young player then and I didn't get much say - and I haven't picked the Cardiff suits either.</p>
              <p class="art-p">"I think James knew somebody who could get us suits but I haven't spoken to him ahead of this year's final. "Before both teams got in the final, I spoke to him all the time as he has done fantastic this year but I'll wait until after the game to get in touch. "I know he's got a fair bit of stick over the years but I've always rated him. He did make a few mistakes but everyone's made mistakes and in my eyes, even when he wasn't playing for England, he was still the best keeper in the country."</p>
              <p class="art-p">Fowler lost that 1996 final but lifted the Cup in 2001 when he came off the bench as Liverpool scored twice in the last seven minutes to beat Arsenal 2-1. The striker, likely to be a substitute on Saturday, is determined to grasp what he admits is an unlikely chance for more silverware.</p>
              <p class="art-p">"I thought my days of playing in major finals were gone," he admitted. "When you leave the Premier League and come to a Championship side, an FA Cup winners' medal is far, far from your mind.</p>
              <p class="art-p">"Nobody's given us a hope from the start but we're in the final on merit. "We haven't been lucky in any way, we have played well in every round, so we deserve to be in the final." Fowler hasn't played since December following a hip operation. But the veteran, with six goals in 16 starts, is hoping to win another year on his contract.</p>

              <p class="art-p">There he is along with Liverpool's Spice Boys - Jamie Redknapp, Steve McManaman and Robbie Fowler - strutting their stuff around Wembley in their cream Armani suits.</p>
              <p class="art-p">"I wasn't a Spice Boy, I was too old. The Spice Boys were a collective group who were all under 24, so I was omitted from that heading," insists James, who was 25 when Liverpool lost that day in 1996 to bitter rivals Manchester United.</p>
              <p class="art-p">Unfortunately for the Portsmouth goalkeeper, that's not how everyone else remembers it. But James has always hated being regarded as the stereotypical Premier League footballer</p>
              <p class="art-p">James has come through more ups and downs than most Premier League footballers, not least his turbulent seven years at Anfield where he first earned his nickname 'Calamity James'.</p>
              <p class="art-p">But now, at the age of 37, he is enjoying a career renaissance at Portsmouth and on Saturday is hoping for redemption in the FA Cup Final.</p>
