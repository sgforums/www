The Liverpool boss insists he has had no contact with the Spanish giants but wants assurances that American tycoons George Gillett and Tom Hicks share his ambitions.</strong><br><br>Hicks and Gillett have remained in the background while the nuts and bolts of their takeover have been sorted out. But they are ready to assume control after taking their shareholding in Liverpool to 94.4 per cent.<br><br>Now Benitez feels it is time for them to outline their blueprint for the clubÂ’s future. Benitez said: Â“There are always a lot of rumours in the newspapers and a lot of people have been talking about Madrid.<br><br>Â“I have read in some papers IÂ’ve had meetings with people from Madrid. This is not true. Â“WhatÂ’s clear is IÂ’m very happy at Liverpool. I couldnÂ’t have had more support than IÂ’ve had here, but now we have new people taking over and itÂ’s important I talk to the American owners.<br><br>Â“I have spoken to them once, when they first came to the club, but now I would like to see them again as soon as possible and talk about the future. Â“As IÂ’ve said before, I donÂ’t just want to talk about money to spend on players. Â“I would also like to hear about the plans which will improve the club. Â“We need to do things which not only help for one or two years, but will help the club for the next 100 years.Â”<br><br>Gillett and Hicks will be back in this country on March 31 and are said to be just as keen as Benitez to sit down with their manager and discuss their plans. Even though the Benitez says talks about a transfer kitty are not his only priority, the rumours linking him with a move to the Bernabeu can only strengthen his bargaining position.<br><br>Real made an official request to speak to speak to Benitez last year before they appointed Fabio Capello. It was rejected and Liverpool persuaded their manager to sign an extended contract. But with Real and Capello poised to part company this summer after another disastrous season, Spanish sources say they want to replace him with either Benitez, Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho or Getafe chief Bernd Schuster Â— in that order.<br></div>
