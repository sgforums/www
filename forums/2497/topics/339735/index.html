              <h1>CITY TO LAND £52M VILLA</h1>
              <h2>Mark Hughes will sign Valencia striker in January</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00018/villa_280x420_18463a.jpg" alt="DAVID VILLA - will join City" width="280" height="420"></p>
              <p><em>DAVID VILLA - will join City</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>DAVID VILLA’S record £52million switch to Manchester City will move a step closer when his agent jets into England this week. The Valencia striker will be City’s first world-class signing in January when the transfer window opens. </h3>
              <p>City boss Mark Hughes has targeted the Spanish hit-man and the deal has been rubber-stamped by City’s Arab owners. </p>
              <p>They are determined to make an impact signing in the transfer window and will take advantage of Valencia’s perilous financial position. </p>
              <p>The Spanish side have been hit badly by the global economic crisis and admitted they will be forced to cash in on their major asset in the New Year.</p>
              <p>Real Madrid believed they were in pole position but signed £17m Ajax star Klass-Jan Huntelaar in midweek — and City surged ahead when they made it clear they would instantly match Valencia’s asking price.</p>
              <h4>Contract</h4>
              <p>Villa will join Robinho as the Premier League’s top wage earner on £160,000-a-week as City’s Abu Dhabi owners make good on their promise to buy the world’s best. </p>
              <p>Reports in Spain claimed City representatives have met twice met with Villa’s agent, Jose Luis Tamargo, in Madrid to discuss the move. </p>
              <p>Villa, who turned 27 on Wednesday, has a £125m compensation clause built into his contract at Valencia but the club are so cash-strapped they have been forced to waive that in the face of City’s interest. </p>
              <p>And while he signed a new contract in the summer which ties him to Valencia until 2014, he knows he has no option but to move on.</p>
              <h4>Impressed</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He said: “I will stay at Valencia for as long as the president wants me. If he tells me I have to be sold to save the club, then that is his decision and I’ll look for a fresh challenge.” </p>
              <p>Villa was the top scorer at Euro 2008 with four goals and is also second top scorer in La Liga behind Samuel Eto’o. A source close to the deal said: “It is clear City need a world-class striker and Villa fits the bill. </p>
              <p>“The Arabs have been impressed with him and Mark Hughes is convinced he will do well in English football. “His agent will be flying in on Tuesday and there is every chance talks and a deal will be concluded by the end of the week.”</p>

              <p>If they don't pay extra big money, the stars won't want to join them cos they are still not seen as a big club.</p>
              <p>I am thinking the first few will have to be extra big money cos this way then they can attract the star players... But once they have a group of star players there, other big star players will not need to think twice when City come knocking... By then, these star players will be hoping City come for them instead as the thought of playing with these other global stars is enough to convince them easily, not to mention the big salary to go along with it too...</p>
              <p>For Valencia, I believe its a good time to sell... Their financial problems just got worse if it wasn't already bad before the global economic crisis... Villa's 27 yrs old, a good time to cash in... Having him at the club sitting around for the next 3 yrs won't do them much good also, so take the $52m... It will go a long way in helping the club.</p>
              <p>My take is this news could very well be true thats why Real probably knew they couldn't out bid City so went for the cheaper option in Huntelaar.</p>

              <p>Manchester City can sign Juventus goalkeeper Gigi Buffon - if they commit to paying the Italian great £250,000-a-week!</p>
              <p>The <em>Daily Mail</em> says City’s pursuit of the 30-year-old Italian goalkeeper has stalled because he has missed the last month with a groin injury.</p>
              <p>Buffon, however, is still pursuing the transfer and is expected to
              return to first-team duty with Juventus in the next two weeks. City
              must then decide whether to advance their interest.</p>
              <p>The deal would include a £20m transfer fee, as well as £13m-a-year in salary for a player who currently earns £90,000 net.</p>
              <p>In a sign of their new wealth, the Premier League club - backed
              by the vast riches of the Abu Dhabi royal family - have not baulked at
              the demands.</p>
              <p>City manager Mark Hughes is believed to have endorsed the transfer - on condition Buffon proves his fitness.</p>
              <p>While his new employers may be in a hurry, Hughes has faith in current No 1 Joe Hart and is urging patience.</p>
              <p>Sources in Italy were said to be ‘completely amazed’ that City are prepared to continue with such a vast financial outlay.</p>
              <p>"Juventus are reluctant to sell, but the money is out of this world," said one source.</p>
