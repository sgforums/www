Please bear his age in mind. He can only improve and go on to be an excellent truly world-class player with achievements and medals to prove.<br><br>'And dont forget the MU factor, meaning when you play for MU, the opposing teams already scared of you, no wonder he scored so easily lah.' - I wanna laugh at you man. I could also say Anfield, Stamford Bridge, St. James' park, and even the Emirates. Or even Nou Camp, Santiago Bernabeu, Turin, San Siro, etc. They're all big clubs right? Their stadiums are like cauldrons and obviously if I'm a small team, I'll most likely  be quaking in my boots and psychologically affected. Use your brain, okay?<br><br>Rooney wasn't the villian. It was the whole England squad including Joe Cole, Ashley Cole and Steven Gerard and not forgeting Erikkson who let the whole England camp down.<br><br>Of course, football skills has gotta do with age. Some hot prospects have huge talents, they just need to hone it, put in hard work and have some luck and some on-field and off-field discipline.<br><br>And I won't deny that Drogba's one of the most complete strikers and he still has 4-5 years good in him. But as age catches up with you, it is players like Rooney, Ronaldo and co. who will take over their place.<br><br>Hope I made my points clear.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote>What toking lah you? You lagi stupid sia! wahahaha! Before asking other people to use their brains, measure yours first lah who knows maybe rusty liao leh, you think you can talk nia meh? Are you saying Rooney is going to improve for sure, wahahaha, what a stupid statement, dont think too much lah before it happens. Btw cant blame you lah MU fan thinks like that one, oopss maybe you are not MU fan, lagi worse coz you just hantam anyone here! They think they are the best, will win every match....so i understand also....i am so happy sia got something to laugh at, thanks to you, wahahaha<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I already started watching football since world cup 1970, dont know where were you lah hor, so please wanna talk football, please lah have some background first ok. Please lah dont make me laugh again ok. Ehh, did i put Rooney down? Nope right, what i was trying to tell you was he is just an ordinary footballer, if he is so good, why isnt he the world footballer of the year, you toking majiam he is even better than Kaka! Whether he is gonna improve anot, lets see and wait ok, no point boasting about it....but i still dont get you lah, how important is he to England? I wouldnt go to an extent that he is not important at all, but definitely England can live without him, right? If you wanna argue about that me also bo pian!<br><br>I know and agree with you England failure in the last world cup was not entirely caused by Rooney dismissal in that Portugal match. But please dont tell me he wasnt the villain who made England's life difficult. Also, his temper, haizzzzzz, please lah dont tell me thats good quality ok.....thats bad for a young promising footballer like him ok. You think i am a fool ah? Hahahaha, well cant blame you lah coz your brain rusty liao lah. No wonder you think everyone else is idiot lor.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Btw, you hor never read carefully, i tell you again lah, though i am a liverpool fan, but i never said Liverpool majiam the best team in the world. Btw, i wouldnt be too happy even if they win the EPL coz they just dont deserve it ok. I still think MU, Arsenal and Chelsea are more worthy winners. Example like the CL 2005 final, well they won coz AC Milan were stupid thats all, not because they were better than AC Milan, thats crap. I was not too happy then, maybe you were the one fingering ur butthole when an english team beat an italian team, i know there are many anti-italian out there, but please dont quote me ok, i didnt say you wor! wahahahaha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
