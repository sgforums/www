                  MANCHESTER UNITED and Chelsea are locked in a £20million battle for Everton 
                  teen Jack Rodwell.</p>
              <div>
              <p>Both clubs see the elegant midfielder as a key target and are willing to force 
                  the Toffees' hand with lucrative offers.</p>
              <p>Chelsea have already bid £14m for the starlet, with United valuing him at 
                  £16m.</p>
              <p>But with Goodison boss David Moyes desperate to keep hold of the brightest 
                  talent to come out of the academy since Wayne Rooney, it will take around 
                  £20m to prise 18-year-old Rodwell away.</p>
              <p>He signed a five-year deal in February and is not desperate to leave Everton - 
                  where he has become a permanent fixture in the side.</p>
              <p>However, the lure of Old Trafford and the chance to play alongside Rooney 
                  would certainly be a factor especially as it would mean not having to leave 
                  the North West.</p>
              <p>With doubts over the long-term fitness of Owen Hargreaves, Red Devils boss Sir 
                  Alex Ferguson is keen on another holding midfielder and England Under-21 
                  regular Rodwell is seen as the perfect option.</p>
              <p>United wanted to offer cash plus youngster Matthew James for Rodwell.</p>
              <p>But it was made clear to them that only a straight cash deal would be 
                  considered.</p>

              <p>sure if some clubs dun mind paying 30-40m pounds. man utd bought rooney for 27m pounds when he was 18, good business for an 18 year old kid. I am sure everton will sell if a club were to come in for him, say 30m pounds. good business eh.</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Man Utd boss Ferguson must accelerate plans for Everton’s Rodwell</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> faces bringing forward plans to sign <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Everton</span></abbr> defender Jack Rodwell.</p>
              <p>The <em>Manchester Evening News</em> says the United manager is
              a long-term admirer of the England under-21 international but would
              have preferred to hold off making a move until at least the end of the
              season.</p>
              <p>But with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> manager <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Carlo Ancelotti</span></abbr> likely to spend heavily in January - with the threat of a FIFA transfer
              ban hanging over Stamford Bridge - Ferguson could be forced to move
              sooner than he would have liked.</p>
              <p>Rodwell is his primary domestic target - and he hopes the
              stylish midfielder will be tempted to follow in the footsteps of Wayne
              Rooney by swapping Goodison Park for Old Trafford.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Everton</span></abbr> know they are in a strong position with the 18-year-old having signed a
              new five-year contract in February - but they will find it difficult to
              reject any offer in the region of £20m.</p>
              <p>City are also keeping a close eye on the teenager's situation
              and would love to get one over their Old Trafford rivals, with whom
              they are increasingly going head-to-head in the transfer market.</p>

              <p>The Red Devils managed to lure a young Wayne Rooney from Goodison Park

              <p>It has been said that United would not splash the cash for no
              apparent reason in the next transfer market but it seems as though the
              18-year old is a good enough reason for the Old Trafford club to
              include themselves in winter dealings.</p>
              <p>What might make a move complicated is that United’s main title rivals <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> are also keen on Rodwell.</p>

              <p><strong>The true test of Manchester United’s power in the transfer market will be revealed in January in the battle to sign Everton teenager Jack Rodwell.</strong></p>
              <p>United have spent only £20million of the £80m they received from Real Madrid for Cristiano Ronaldo, but manager Sir Alex Ferguson has been told the club will only spend if the opportunity is too important to ignore.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Rodwell, just 18 and one of English football’s brightest prospects, certainly fits the bill, but the added complication for United is that their main rivals to sign him are Chelsea.</p>
              </div>
              <p>The London club are eager to do business in January after the two-window transfer ban imposed by FIFA in the Gael Kakuta scandal was suspended pending their appeal.</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> are expected to push for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Everton</span></abbr> youngster Jack Rodwell over the next six months.</p>
              <p><em>The Times</em> says Rodwell is being lined up at United as a
              replacement for Nemanja Vidic, who is likely to move to Spain at the
              end of the season.</p>
              <p>Rodwell, the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Everton</span></abbr> utility player, has been identified by United as a star of the future.
              Rodwell, 18, is being used primarily as a holding midfield player, but
              some view him as a central defender in the longer term.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Everton</span></abbr>,
              though, will fight tooth and nail to keep the player, who signed a new
              five-year contract only in February and is not thought to be in any
              rush to leave Goodison Park.</p>
