              <div class="cap">Beckham celebrates Donovan's penalty against Houston</div>
              <div class="cap"><br></div>
              </div>
              <p class="first"><strong>England midfielder David Beckham helped his Los
              Angeles Galaxy side move a step nearer the Major League Soccer title
              with a 2-0 victory over Houston Dynamo.</strong></p>
              <p>Beckham's extra-time
              free-kick was poked home by Greg Berhalter before Landon Donovan sealed
              the semi-final series decider from the penalty spot.</p>
              <p>The Galaxy also overcame two floodlight failures and face Chicago Fire or Real Salt Lake in next week's Seattle final.</p>
              <p>It will be Beckham's last MLS game before rejoining AC Milan on loan.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>The Galaxy's Western Conference Championship clash against two-time MLS
              champions Houston was halted for more than 30 minutes as the south of
              Los Angeles was twice plunged into darkness by a power cut.</p>
              <p>The first stoppage came in the 18th minute when the floodlights at the
              Home Depot Centre failed, with the Carson neighbourhood completely
              blacked out.</p>
              <p>The players were kept on the pitch by referee Terry Vaughan during the delay but play did not resume for another 18 minutes.</p>
              <p>Beckham, who will return to Italy in January, had the first
              clear-cut chance after the resumption, whipping in a curling free-kick
              from 25 yards that was turned round his post by Houston keeper Pat
              Onstad.</p>
              <p>Donovan saw a 20-yard strike saved a minute into the
              second half before Houston's Andrew Hainault was denied two minutes
              later.</p>
              <p>A second power failure then followed, halting play for
              a further 16 minutes, although neither side was able to make a
              breakthrough in normal time.</p>
              <p>It finally came in the 104th
              minute, however, when Beckham's free-kick to the back post was headed
              down by Omar Gonzalez and fellow defender Berhalter steered the ball
              past Onstad.</p>
              <p>Houston's agony was compounded four minutes later
              when substitute Alan Gordon was felled in the area by Ricardo Clark and
              Donovan converted the resultant spot-kick.</p>
              <p>Beckham nearly made
              it 3-0 with a trademark 30-yard free-kick that just curled past
              Onstad's top right-hand corner but by then the Galaxy were home and
              dry.</p>
              <p>Afterwards Beckham praised his team-mates and Tim
              Leiweke, president and chief executive of Galaxy owners AEG, for
              putting the MLS team within reach of their first title since 2005.</p>
              <p>"It's so important for us to do well, we've had so many disappointments
              over the last four years and Tim Leiweke and everybody have put so much
              behind this team," said Beckham.</p>
              <p>"This club and this franchise and the players are doing them proud.</p>
              <p>"We've got a great bunch of guys that are working hard for each other and it's been tough, so we're happy."</p>
              <p>Galaxy had confirmed themselves as Western Conference winners with a 2-0 win over San Jose Earthquakes in October.</p>
