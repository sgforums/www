            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q60/zocos/Liverpool.gif"><br><br>Liverpool will sign the Australia international defender Lucas Neill in a cut-price deal from Blackburn Rovers next month with the Merseysiders' manager Rafael BenÃ­tez aware that the anticipated transfer funds from the takeover of the club by Dubai International Capital will not materialise until the summer.<br><br>Neill, who is out of contract at Ewood Park at the end of the season, will complete his move to Anfield having almost joined on deadline day in August only for the clubs to fail to agree a fee at the last minute. Blackburn had explored the possibility of taking the Liverpool full-back Stephen Warnock in part-exchange.<br><br>BenÃ­tez's move for the 28-year-old Neill reflects the reality that DIC's proposed takeover is unlikely to be completed until nearer the end of January, thus denying him a chance to exploit the winter transfer window. The state-owned private equity firm is still scrutinising the books at Liverpool with both club and company confident that a deal can be struck which will see the chairman of 15 years, David Moores, sell his 51.6% stake at Anfield.<br><br>Company takeover law then dictates that DIC must make an offer for the rest of Liverpool's shares, an offer which would remain open for 60 days. Should they ultimately secure a stake of 90%, they would be able to make the club a private business.<br><br>BenÃ­tez still hopes to benefit from significant transfer funds in the close season though, having met the chief executive of DIC, Sameer al-Ansari, after the recent victory over Fulham, he is aware that he will not be offered a blank cheque to plunder the market. As Parry and Al-Ansari have been at pains to insist, DIC's interest in Liverpool is considered an investment - such as their recent purchase of Madame Tussauds and the Travelodge chain of hotels - with the group attracted to the club partly because the playing squad would not require a radical overhaul.<br><br></div>

If it is not right for us, he will stay.'<br><br>Although the odds appear to be stacked against Neill remaining at Rovers beyond the summer, Hughes has not entirely given up hope of persuading the Sydney-born player to stay.<br><br>'Things change very quickly in football,' he said.<br><br>'Who is to say Lucas won't still be here in the summer and if that situation arises, I will be doing my best to convince him to stay.'<br><br>Hughes is realistic enough about the situation to be looking at options and declared himself 'satisfied' with Ukrainian defender Andriy Nesmachniy, who has just completed a two-week trial.<br><br>Meanwhile, Hughes claims Rovers deserve credit for slashing prices for Saturday's game.<br><br>Adult tickets have been reduced to Â£15, with children gaining admission for just Â£5 as Blackburn try to boost flagging attendances.<br><br>A similar initiative met with some success when Bolton came to Ewood earlier in the campaign and Hughes is hoping for a similar turn-out to the 29,000 who saw his side beat Liverpool on Tuesday.<br><br>'We should be congratulated for trying to get more people through the gate,' he said.<br><br>'We understand it is an expensive time of year for families but we have just had our biggest crowd of the season and if we could get something similar tomorrow, I would be delighted.'<br></div>
