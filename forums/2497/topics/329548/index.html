              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez believes nobody should expect Liverpool to win The
              Premier League in the current climate, because their nearest rivals are
              spending much more money. </strong></p>
              <p>Benitez was speaking after Manchester City became the nation’s
              richest football club, securing the imminent takeover by Abu Dhabi
              United Group.</p>
              <p>While City and United were able to splash upwards of £30 million on
              Robinho and Dimitar Berbatov respectively, Liverpool had to keep to
              their means with the modest £8 million capture of Albert Riera.</p>
              <p>United now have seven players signed for over £18 million, while
              Liverpool have only two, and it is for that reason that Benitez
              believes any title triumph would be more impressive than the efforts of
              the teams around them.</p>
              <p>“We are here to win every trophy, but now we have United, Chelsea
              and City spending big, big money. Also this year, Aston Villa, and then
              you’ve got the quality of Arsenal," explained the Spaniard.</p>
              <p>“Our supporters need to know that we are always doing our best, but
              it cannot be a case of ‘oh you’ve spent £20 million so you should win’.</p>
              <p>“We spent £20 million on [Fernando] Torres last year and £20 million
              on Robbie Keane this year, and people are saying we have to win the
              title now.</p>
              <p>“United has £20 million for Nani, £20 million for [Owen] Hargreaves,
              £18 million for [Michael] Carrick, £30 million for [Wayne] Rooney, £30
              million for [Rio] Ferdinand, £20 million for Anderson, and some of
              these players can sit on the bench.</p>
              <p>“People need to understand that it is not easy to win the title, so
              it is important to support the team and take the pressure away.”</p>
              <p>Benitez has had to take a deep look at how to improve his side’s sum
              of parts this season, hence the signing of a left-side wideman in
              Riera.</p>
              <p>“He's the kind of player all managers like and the supporters will be very happy,” Benitez added.</p>
              <p>"He is good in the air, has a good delivery and a good left foot, he is also strong and he can be really good for us."</p>
              <p>Riera’s time at Manchester City will have left many a fan wondering
              why Benitez has such faith in Riera, but the 26-year-old insists he has
              improved beyond all recognition since then.</p>
              <p>“It was a different moment, when I came to City it was January, so I was joining halfway through the season,” Riera explained.</p>
              <p>“I was 22 years old, I have plenty more experience, I played in a Uefa Cup final, and I’m now a Spain international.</p>
              <p>“Now I am prepared to play for a big big club like this one.”</p>

              <p>Bellamy - I dun agreed that he is a flop as he is the only player that raring to give 110% for every match as compared to his lazy spanish comrade.</p>
