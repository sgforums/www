              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=182"><span style="color: #225fb2;"><strong>Kenny Dalglish</strong></span></a> <strong>has refused to comment on whether Liverpool plan to sign a striker in January, despite being the lowest goalscoring team in the Premier League's top seven this season.</strong></p>
              <div>Liverpool's profligacy has been staggering over the course of the opening 15 games, throwing away points in games they have arguably deserved to win against Sunderland, Norwich, Fulham, Manchester United and Manchester City this season.</div>
              <div>.</div>
              <p>In total they have scored 18 times in 15 league outings, with only <a rel="nofollow" href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/125088/Luis-Su&amp;aacute;rez"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Luis Suarez</span></a> scoring more than two. The £35 million gamble on Andy Carroll is yet to yield any rewards, but Dalglish preferred to sidestep questions over the purchase of a replacement.</p>
              <p>"We did miss some chances [during the recent 1-0 win against QPR), yes, but the goalkeeper saved a lot of them too," said Dalglish on the club's official website. "Do I feel the need to go out and do something about that? Aye, whichever side comes along here next, we'll ask them to come without a keeper. That's the best way to do it, isn't it?</p>
              <p>"Irrespective of what I say, it's not going to stop speculation we are going out in January to sign Joe Bloggs up front, or whoever. I don't need to say anything."</p>
              <p>The potential loss of Suarez, who is alleged to have aimed a middle finger at fans during a recent clash with Fulham, would leave Liverpool even more desperate in the goals department. However, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/23650/Glen-Johnson"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Glen Johnson</span></a> believes accusations of racial discrimination, diving, and obscene gestures are all devised to upset the tricky striker.</p>
              <p>"Luis isn't going to let any of the silly stuff bother him," Johnson said. "People will try everything they possibly can to upset him because he's a good player.</p>
              <p>"No opponent wants him to feel comfortable because if he feels comfortable he will score goals and that's not what they want. Of course he will get everything thrown at him. That's just the way it is.</p>
              <p>"But he's exactly the same - a good professional and a good player. His confidence hasn't dropped. He always works so hard for the team and he plays very well when he's not scoring. But obviously we are much happier when he's scoring. I've been fortunate to play with some very good players and Luis is right up there."</p>
              <p>Having thrown away so many points this season, Johnson is convinced Liverpool are about to embarrass one of their forthcoming opposition, with Aston Villa next up on Sunday.</p>
              <p>"I definitely get the feeling a big win isn't far off," Johnson said. "We're coming close. We had so many chances against QPR to get a healthy scoreline and on another day with a bit more luck you score 80 per cent of your chances and you find yourself 6-0 up.</p>
              <p>"As long as you win the game it doesn't really matter but the way we are playing, it's coming. We only got the one goal against QPR but three points was the most important thing."</p>
