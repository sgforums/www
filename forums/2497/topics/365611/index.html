              <h1>Ronaldo too sissy for Paris Hilton</h1>
              <p><br> <img src="http://fourfourtwo.com/contentimages/news/ronronron.jpg" alt="ronronron" align="right"> </p>
              <p><strong>American socialite Paris Hilton has reportedly dumped Cristiano Ronaldo for being a 'real sissy'</strong>.</p>
              <p>According to a report in the <em>National Enquirer</em>, Hilton ended their budding romance after deciding that Ronaldo was "too in touch with his feminine side."</p>
              <p>"She likes her guys to be macho - and as far as she's concerned
              Ronaldo turned out to be a real sissy," a source told the magazine.</p>
              <p>"She likes her men rugged, it's as simple as that. She thought her
              friends would laugh at her if she dated a guy who walks around with
              flowers in his hair.</p>
              <p>"He was just too uptight for her to find attractive. In the end,
              Paris realised their relationship simply wasn't clicking. Paris got to
              know him and realised he's not nearly hot enough."</p>
              <p>However, the Real Madrid-bound FIFA World Player of the Year was
              quick to deny claims that their relationship ended due to his overt
              meterosexuality.</p>
              <p>"She was a really cool girl and we had a great time talking," he retorted in the report.</p>
              <p>"She lives thousands of miles away and is busy, and I am busy in Madrid so I am not sure if we will be able to see each other.</p>
              <p>"I am just making the most of the short summer I get."</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Paris Hilton angry over rumours with Real Madrid's Ronaldo</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p>Paris Hilton has hit out at claims of a relationship with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Real Madrid</span></abbr>'s world record signing <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Cristiano Ronaldo</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>The hotel heiress ended her six-month romance with Doug Reinhardt
                  earlier this month and shortly after news of the split broke, she was
                  photographed getting close to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Ronaldo</span></abbr> in a Los Angeles nightclub.</p>
              <p>But Paris ranted on twitter.com: "I'm really sick of reporters not only
                  making up stories, but also inventing their own quotes that I never
                  even said. It's ridiculous! They have no credibility. They make up
                  vicious stories, and even though they are so far from the truth, it's
                  still hurtful.</p>
              <p>"They even invent relationships, if I even talk to a guy as a
                  friend, they blow it so out of proportion and act like we are dating.
                  So lame.</p>
              <p>"Sorry for the venting, I'm just sick of all these stupid
                  rumors. I'm trying to focus on my life and work and don't need the
                  extra stress.</p>
              <p>"Plus, I want you all to know the truth. Don't believe what you read, about 90 percent of it is pure fiction."</p>
              <p>Paris' comments come after a source was quoted in the <em>Daily Star</em> that she was unimpressed by <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Ronaldo</span></abbr>'s antics.</p>
