              <p>In the end, all that pretty football get you nothing if your team doesn't have the steel to stomach the tough moments... Every year, Arsenal shoot out of the box very well when there isn't any pressure. The young guns does fantastic playing some nice football... But when the moment comes... (Normally from Feb onwards) They cracked up like a team who doesn't know what to do or how to play during difficult times... And I put this down to experienced...</p>
              <p>Arsenal don't have enough of it in their squad. Wenger's policy of selling those reaching 30 or buying younger and less experienced players is the main course of it... Cos it has been so obvious for the last few seasons already... Experienced players gives you that stability during pressured moments, while lots of young players could go missing when the going gets tough...</p>
              <p>So i think Arsenal's problem is down to their transfer policy... Not sure who is at fault, the board or the manager but I think Wenger also plays a big part of it... Cos he have won it before so i belief he isn't as desperate to win it again but for his ego purpose, he wants to do it with a young side that plays pretty football... Cos if he manage to do so, he could always be remembered as an amazing coach / manager long after he retires.</p>

              <p>let's face it, the risks n net return(winning trophies) for buying (expensive) players for the so-called top 4 clubs in the epl is high and it is going to attract a lot of scrutiny. how much more they can improve by getting in players of caliber is a fine line between success and failure because they are in that apex of the league already. </p>
              <p>arsene chose to groom from within, but we will never know if his hands are tied or that he's so stubborn to want to look outside and believe in his own youth talent pool and capability. for all the attractive football arsenal churns out, 5 years trophyless is a damn long time for a club with a history of achievements that george graham ignited in the mid-80s which arsene continued to a large extent until 5 years ago. arsene also realizes that a lot of the good players are priced out of the market due to the lavishness of teams like chelsea, man u n real madrid. arsene is luckier because he has a longer tenure @ arsenal to be able to put in place a youth academy to plug some of the gaps. </p>
              <p>arsenal is still servicing a 200m pound debts, although they are the only club in epl that's actively reducing it. yanks in liverpool and man u are of the different breed and that's why they are a house build on a stack of cards that could easily blown over if something bad financially happens.</p>
              <p>sad to say, arsenal will continue to be a nearly team in the days of modern football today where money talks.</p>

              <p>So does it mean that Wenger is not reallty that good at signing good players afterall? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Yes, never keep an unhappy player that will disrupt the harmony of the team. A good manager will seek to replace the unhappy player. I think this is where Wenger failed. He failed to acknowledge his team's weakness (Weak (Physically) in the striking department and lousy goalkeepers, incompetent backups for 1st team players) and do fine-tuning.</p>
              <p>Arsenal's ability to hit the self-destruct button seems to quite occasional nowadays. The players seem to lose faith in their goalkeepers.</p>
