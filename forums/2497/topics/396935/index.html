              <h1 class="titlestory">Arsenal throw away two-goal lead in Wigan defeat</h1>
              <p>After seemingly cruising to three points at the DW Stadium, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> conceded three goals in the final ten minutes to lose 3-2 against 
              struggling <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Wigan</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Arsenal’s faltering pursuit of the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premiership</span></abbr> title was all but ended in an 
              extraordinary game at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Wigan</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Goals either side of half-time had put the Gunners two goals to the good
               and looking comfortable for the win to keep their title hopes alive.</p>
              <p>But <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Wigan</span></abbr>,
               battling for their <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premiership</span></abbr> survival, stunned the visitor’s with 
              three late goals, the winner arriving in injury time and virtually 
              ensuring their <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> safety for another season.</p>
              <p>Theo Walcott's neat finish gave <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> the lead just before the break.</p>
              <p>Mikael Silvestre was then allowed a free header to double the lead from a
               corner after 48 minutes.</p>
              <p>The Latics gave themselves hope in the 80th minute when Ben Watson 
              side-footed home.</p>
              <p>Then a mistake from Gunners reserve keeper Lukasz Fabianski in the 89th 
              minute allowed Titus Bramble to head <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Wigan</span></abbr> level.</p>
              <p>Incredibly, two minutes into injury time Charles N'Zogbia's strike won 
              it.</p>

              <p><strong>Three goals in the final 11 minutes gave Wigan arguably the most stunning victory in their Premier League history and slammed the door shut on Arsenal's faint title hopes.</strong></p>
              <p>The Gunners appeared to be coasting to victory on the back of goals either side of half-time from Theo Walcott and Mikael Silvestre, and with it hauling themselves to within three points of leaders Chelsea.</p>
              <p>But after a run of eight defeats and a draw in the league against Arsenal, Wigan added to their maiden wins over Chelsea and Liverpool this season as Ben Watson, Titus Bramble and Charles N'Zogbia conjured an astonishing comeback.</p>
              <p>The remarkable result leaves Wigan seven points clear of the drop zone and seemingly safe, whereas Arsenal can now kiss goodbye to any hope they had of the title after back-to-back defeats in the space of five days.</p>
              <p>Tottenham's victory over leaders Chelsea yesterday had given the visitors a glimmer of hope on the title front, but that has now evaporated, and they have only themselves to blame for a late collapse.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>For 40 minutes here they found themselves frustrated by a Wigan side desperate for points in their battle to stay in the top flight for a sixth successive season.</strong></p>
              <p>After being booed off the pitch on Wednesday following a goalless draw against an already-relegated and understrength Portsmouth side, Wigan were determined to restore the faith of their fans.</p>
              <p>There was certainly an urgency about Roberto Martinez's side, but for 80 minutes they lacked a cutting edge.</p>
              <p>Instead it was Arsenal who were in the ascendancy, initially in the 41st minute as Nicklas Bendtner split covering defenders Maynor Figueroa and Bramble with a through ball of pace and precision.</p>
              <p>After riding Bramble's challenge and pulling away from Figueroa, Walcott then slid the ball underneath the advancing Chris Kirkland for his seventh goal of the season.</p>
              <p>It was deserved as Walcott should have scored minutes prior to that after Abou Diaby had released him in behind Wigan's defence.</p>
              <p>Although left with a one-on-one opportunity with Kirkland just outside the six-yard box, he opted to try and find Bendtner with a square ball, only to pull it behind him, allowing Wigan to clear.</p>
              <p>Walcott could, and perhaps should have given Arsenal a two-goal cushion on the stroke of half time, only to narrowly clear the bar with a rising drive from just inside the area.</p>
              <p>Prior to Walcott's opener Wigan were lively, but barely troubled Lukasz Fabianski, playing in his first league game since the end of last season with Manuel Almunia out with a wrist injury.</p>
              <p>N'Zogbia, rumoured to be a target for Wenger in the summer, was narrowly wide with one curled effort, whilst a low, powerful 20-yard drive was straight at the Pole.</p>
              <p>As a contest, it seemed to turn inside the opening three minutes of the second half, initially after just 40 seconds as Wigan were denied a penalty.</p>
              <p>Referee Lee Mason, who had incurred the wrath of the Wigan fans all afternoon with his decisions, infuriated the locals further by turning a blind eye to Samir Nasri's pull on the arm of Watson.</p>
              <p>Moments later, and from Arsenal's first attack of the half, Kirkland superbly denied Diaby at close range, with the ball eventually running for a corner.</p>
              <p>Nasri proceeded to deliver an outswinger to which Wigan's defence were guilty of falling asleep, allowing Silvestre an unmarked header from the penalty spot beyond Kirkland's outstretched grasp.</p>
              <p>Starting for Thomas Vermaelen, who misses the end to the season with a calf strain, it was Silvestre's first goal for a year since a 4-1 win on this ground.</p>
              <p>Wigan, though, did not roll over and die. N'Zogbia first curled a tame effort that was easy pickings for Fabianski, on his 25th birthday, after being played in by Watson.</p>
              <p>Watson was then denied by Fabianski who was at full stretch to prevent a low 20-yard shot from creeping inside his right-hand post, whilst Hugo Rodallega saw his scuffed shot trickle inches wide.</p>
              <p>Then 10 minutes from time Watson hauled Wigan back into the game with a sidefoot effort from 12 yards after substitute Victor Moses had played the midfielder in from the bye-line. It was the catalyst for the comeback, aided by a howler from Fabianski who fluffed an N'Zogbia corner, allowing Bramble a free header which crossed the line, despite Clichy's efforts to hook the ball clear.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2010/0418/charlesnzogbiaarsenalgoal20100418_350x197.jpg" border="0" alt="Charles N'Zogbia fires Wigan's late winner against Arsenal" width="350" height="197"></p>
              <p><em>Charles N'Zogbia fires Wigan's late winner against Arsenal</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then in the first of four minutes of added time N'Zogbia struck a curling winner from 20 yards to send the majority of the DW Stadium into raptures, and leave Arsenal's followers sickened.</p>

              <p>I think you have been mistaken. I think the reason Wenger was retained is because of his ability to generate income. He has a master's degree in Economics<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><span> </span></sup>from Strasbourg University. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I think why Wenger refused to spend big is because whenever he spent big : Francis Jeffers (2001 from Everton for £8 million - making him one of the club's most expensive signings at that point), Jose Antonio Reyes (2003 from Sevilla for £10.5 million negotiated with top ups, depending on the success of Arsenal, which could have risen to £17 million.) they all turn up to be big time failures.</p>
              <p>In his 14 years of tenture, these are the trophies he won:</p>
              <h4></h4>
              <dl><dt></dt></dl> 
              <ul>
              <li>Premier League (3): <span class="mw-redirect">1997–98</span>, <span class="mw-redirect">2001–02</span>, <span class="mw-redirect">2003–04</span></li>
              <li>FA Cup (4): 1997–98, 2001–02, 2002–03, 2004–05</li>
              <li>FA Community Shield (4): 1998, 1999, 2002, 2004</li>
              </ul>
              <p>He did win the <span class="mw-redirect">2003-04</span> Premier League title in 2004 without a single loss but this is it. That is probably the climax of his career as you all can see that it's going downhill ever since then. This is the 5th straight season Arsenal is going home empty handed.</p>
