              <p>LOL! I just said they are solid and now they gave away 2 goals.</p>
              <p>Nothing is guaranteed in the EPL these days. It was just a few years back where the top four would take leads and that's it. Not now anymore.</p>

              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><span style="font-size: small;">And a seething Wenger said: 'Three home defeats are three too many. What is worrying for me is that we had an opportunity to go top of the league, and when we have to deliver, we can't. That's worrying because that's part of our job.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><span style="font-size: small;">'We put ourselves in the right position and failed - we have to accept that. It is more a mental than a football thing. We were in a position to win the game and we didn't win it and, of course, that is difficult to swallow. We couldn't maintain the focus or the urgency for 90 minutes.</span></span> </p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><span style="font-size: small;">'I put that down to bad luck, fatigue after the midweek international games, some basic errors and a lack of cautiousness.'</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><span style="font-size: small;">Samir Nasri had opened the scoring, having refused to shake the hand of Spurs captain and fellow Frenchman William Gallas, the ex-Gunner, before kick-off due to past differences.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><span style="font-size: small;">Marouane Chamakh doubled Arsenal's lead but Gareth Bale cut the deficit. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><span style="font-size: small;">'It is difficult to accept when you are 2-0 up and you have a freekick but you are caught on the counter- attack,' added Wenger, who also claimed he did not see the Cesc Fabregas hand-ball that led to Rafael van der Vaart's penalty equaliser.</span></span></p>

              <h1>Arsenal 2 Tottenham 3: Shaky Gunners are stunned as Van der Vaart inspires fightback<br></h1>

              <p class="imageCaption">Delight: Samir Nasri celebrates after scoring Arsenal's opening goal</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>To win from two goals down requires character and belief. But to win after being casually outplayed and embarrassingly outclassed demands qualities which Tottenham may not have known they possessed.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">For 45 minutes, Arsenal had played like the team they have always threatened to become. Cesc Fabregas was assembling one of those inch-perfect, jaw-dropping displays which lifts him high above the Premier League herd. Pulling all the strings and stroking all the damaging passes, he was ablaze with inspiration, seemingly incapable of error. And all around him, his lieutenants played their parts with thrilling verve and chilling precision.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">When Arsenal are in this mood, nothing in </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">England</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> comes remotely close to them. Certainly Spurs were incapable of offering them a tackle, much less a spirited argument.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">They took the lead in nine minutes, when Samir Nasri chased a Fabregas chip and Heurelho Gomes made a nervous advance at the ball. The attacker persevered, the keeper lost track and Nasri squeezed the chance through one of those angles which an ordinary player might consider impossible.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/11/20/article-1331538-0C28A223000005DC-280_634x438.jpg" alt="Dutch of class: Rafael van der Vaart celebrates after scoring from the penalty spot" width="634" height="438"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Dutch of class: Rafael van der Vaart celebrates after scoring from the penalty spot</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>The half ended with something remarkable. Fabregas caressed a 15-yard pass with the outside of his foot into space which nobody else knew existed. It was so fine, so subtle that poor Chamakh did not see it until it was upon him. It symbolised the quality of Arsenal’s football, and it was also the last time they had reason to feel good about themselves.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Redknapp worked on his forces at the interval. He restricted the productivity of Fabregas and he coaxed his team to fiercer effort. And the wonders unfolded.<br><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The vital early goal came within five minutes, with a long ball from defence touched on by Rafael van der Vaart to Gareth Bale. Frustrated for 45 minutes, Bale retained sufficient composure to strike a careful finish inside the far post with the outside of his left boot.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/11/20/article-1331538-0C28BF37000005DC-430_634x439.jpg" alt="Arsenal's Cesc Fabregas gives way a penalty to block Rafael van der Vaart's free kick" width="634" height="439"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong></strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Twenty minutes later, a Van der Vaart free-kick was knocked aside by the raised arm of Fabregas. It was the clearest penalty you ever did see and Tottenham were level as Van der Vaart sent Lukasz Fabianski the wrong way.</strong></span> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Still Arsenal should have retrieved the game, but as Arsene Wenger later conceded: ‘When we have to deliver, we can’t.’ Laurent Koscielny missed a mundane header from a few yards, then Theo Walcott came on, missed a decent chance, and was never seen again. And amid all this chaos, Spurs won it.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Leaving his mark: Younes Kaboul escapes the attentions of five defeanders to head past goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski</em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Koscielny lunged at Bale and from Van der Vaart’s free-kick, Younes Kaboul procured the deftest of touches to send the ball bobbing into the corner of the net. A team who had not taken the points at Arsenal since 1993 had emerged clutching all three. In the space of 45 minutes, form had flown out of the window and the shape of the championship had been critically reformed.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Wenger was a dignified loser. ‘If you look at the stats, it’s a mystery how we lost the game,’ he said. Then he realised how hollow that sounded, since football is about far more than the simplicities of statistics.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">‘We put ourselves in the right position, and we failed,’ he said. ‘That is something which is difficult to swallow, but we have to accept it’.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Redknapp started to revive the speech he made to his players on Friday. How Chelsea and Manchester United are not quite the sides they once were. How </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Manchester</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">City</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> are ‘OK, but not what we expected them to be’. And how Spurs are getting closer and closer to teams they once feared.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">He insisted that he meant every word. ‘I wouldn’t be saying this if I had a bad group of players,’ he said. ‘I’m not silly.’ Silly, he isn’t. Yesterday in north </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">London</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">, he and his team made a powerful case. Somebody’s going to win it. Why not Spurs?</span></p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">HARRY REDKNAPP hailed the performance of William Gallas after the Tottenham skipper led his side to a dramatic 3-2 derby day victory over Arsenal.</h2>
              <p>Gallas went into the match under the microscope after Arsenal midfielder Samir Nasri insisted he would snub the former Gunners defender in the pre-match handshake.</p>
              <p>But while the 33-year-old centre-back was indeed ignored, he responded with a commanding performance as Spurs fought back from 2-0 down to seal their first win on Arsenal soil in 17 years.</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>And after the match Spurs chief Redknapp singled Gallas out for praise.</p>
              <p>He said: "I thought William Gallas was just amazing today. He led the team by example and he, for me, was man of the match.</p>
              <p>"I love Gareth Bale and he did well. Younes Kaboul was outstanding but Gallas was top drawer. He was superb today.</p>
              <p>"In the first half we didn't really get hold of the ball. We changed it at half-time, which opened us up even more really.</p>
              <p>"But we started the second half on the front foot, got back into the game and had a great second-half performance."</p>
              <p>Bale, whose second-half goal kickstarted the comeback, claimed Redknapp's decision to bring on Jermain Defoe at half-time was key.</p>
              <p>He said: "For the fans and everybody it's the one game everyone looks out for and to get the victory, especially at the Emirates, is something special.</p>
              <p>"The gaffer said before the game we have got a great squad and a great team and we can match anybody.</p>
              <p>"We didn't have the greatest of first halves but showed what we can do in the second half.</p>
              <p>"We put JD (Jermain Defoe) up front in the second half, sort of went for it a bit, worked for each other and it paid off."</p>
              <p> </p>
