              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Media including sports newspaper <em>Marca</em> and radio broadcaster <em>Cadena Ser</em> reported that Real sporting director Predrag Mijatovic proposed to club
                  president Ramon Calderon that Ramos replace the German who led the club
                  to the Primera Liga title last season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              Madrid's 4-3 loss at home to Sevilla at the weekend was their third defeat in their last four league games and left them in<a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/tables?league=esp.1&amp;cc=4716"> fifth place in the Primera Liga</a>, nine points behind Barcelona, who they face on Saturday night at the Camp
              <p>Reports suggest that Ramos could be in charge by Tuesday afternoon's
                  training session in the Spanish capital, scheduled for 5pm, and lead
                  the team in Wednesday evening's Champions League clash against Zenit St
                  Petersburg.</p>
              <p>The former Sevilla coach has been without a job since leaving Tottenham
                  Hotspur in October, following the Premier League club's worst ever
                  start to the season.</p>
              <p>Earlier Real goalkeeper Iker Casillas admitted his side are ''not capable of winning trophies.''</p>
              <p>Casillas told radio programme <em>El mirador de Punto Radio</em>:
                  ''At the moment the team isn't capable of winning trophies because
                  Barcelona lead us by nine points and it's true that they're playing
                  well.</p>
              <p>''But the season is very long and on top of that...two seasons ago I
                  won the league (at Madrid) when Barcelona had lead us by eight points.
                  We climbed back up and won on the last day.''</p>
              <p>Casillas, who is rated as one of the best goalkeepers in the world, was
                  also quick to hold up his hands and take his share of responsibility
                  for Madrid's dismal campaign.</p>
              <p>''We are going through a bad run,'' he added. ''Defensively we are
                  vulnerable, and I'm the first. In that sense you can't do much more,
                  since they are runs you are going through.</p>
              <p>''At the moment it seems that your opponents will have three chances
                  and score three goals and it's clear that we are all to blame. I have
                  been 10 seasons in the Primera Liga and this, for now, is the worst
                  start I have had.''</p>
              <p>In contrast to Los Blancos, Barca have won 11 of their last 12 league
                  games and are unbeaten since the opening day of the season.</p>
              <p>They have also seen off the challenge of title contenders Sevilla and
                  Valencia in their last two fixtures while scoring seven goals in the
                  process and conceding just once.</p>
              <p>A dejected Schuster seems to have thrown in the towel, with the Madrid
                  coach admitting that ''right now it's not possible to win at the Nou
                  Camp'', but Casillas believes they can take all three points from the
                  highly-charged 'El Clasico'.</p>
              <p>''I think we can win in Barcelona,'' he said. ''Those who go there have
                  to think that they will win. We have to really do this badge proud.''</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Juande Ramos, the former Tottenham Hotspur manager, has replaced Bernd Schuster as manager of Real Madrid.</strong></p>
              <p>Pedrag Mijatovic, the club's sporting director, confirmed the news at a press conference this afternoon after holding discussions with club president Ramon Calderon. Schuster had been hanging onto his job in recent weeks with the Spanish champions currently fifth in the Primera Liga, nine points behind Barcelona who they face on Saturday.</p>
              <p>"We spoke to Schuster this morning about all the difficulties over the past few months," Mijatovic said. "We came to the mutual agreement to take this decision. He took the the decision well.</p>
              <p>"I have to take the opportunity to thank Bernd Schuster for the work he did at Real Madrid. He did an excellent job last season to win the title and the Spanish Supercopa."</p>
              <p>"We can't pinpoint one specific moment that made us reach this decision," he said. "Making a decision like this isn't easy and we had to make a very deep analysis of the situation of the team. Two weeks ago I said that we don't make difficult decisions like this easily."</p>
              <p>Ramos was also introduced to the assembled media at the press conference and confirmed he had been appointed until the end of the current season.</p>
              <p>"I would like to thank the board for their confidence - I face this job with excitement. It's everybody's dream," Ramos said. "I hope I don't let anyone down and that I achieve the successes that this club has set for this season.</p>
              <p>"In most of my previous jobs I have had short contracts," he continued. "We came to a quick agreement and I'm delighted. If I'm happy at the end of the season then I might extend the contract.</p>
              <p>"Both sides are free to see what happens."</p>
              <p>The former Sevilla coach's first task will be to face in-form Barca at the weekend, but he insists the match should be treated like any other.</p>
              <p>"You have to confront every game with the will to win. They are one of the biggest clubs in the world. Barca are playing excellent football and doing well, but Real Madrid have the character and prestige to face any club in any stadium in the world."</p>
              <p>The Madrid board had given Schuster several votes of confidence but Sunday's 4-3 home defeat by Seville was the final straw.</p>
              <p>Ramos will take charge of this afternoon's training session in the Spanish capital, scheduled for 5pm, and lead the team in tomorrow night's Champions League clash against Zenit St Petersburg. The former Seville coach has been without a job since leaving Tottenham Hotspur in October, following the Premier League club's worst ever start to the season.</p>

              <p><strong>Predrag Mijatovic has revealed that the decision to sack Bernd Schuster had nothing to do with the coach's statement that Real Madrid could not beat Barcelona next weekend.</strong><br><br>Los Merengues' sporting director was speaking at a press conference that was hastily arranged after the club chose to rescind the German's contract on Tuesday morning and replace him with Juande Ramos.<br><br>Reports in the Spanish press had stated that Schuster's attempt at mind games about the Barça game had backfired and pushed Mijatovic to take the decision, but he denied that.<br><br>"After several meetings this week I, as sporting director, took the decision and was backed by the board to remove Bernd Schuster," he told reporters.<br><br>"We then spoke to Bernd Schuster this morning about all the problems over the past few months and about all the problems that the team has had over the past few weekss.<br><br>"We reached a unanimous decision to take this decision and he accepted it even though he was sad. "His declarations the other day had no bearing on the decision. Two weeks ago I said that we do not make difficult decisions like this easily.<br><br>"Making choices like is not easy and we had to make a deep analysis of the squad and the situation before taking it." When asked whether he felt the board were to blame for the problems more so than the coach, Mijatovic defended himself and president Ramón Calderón.<br><br>"It is not the president's fault and it is not easy to make the right decisions all the time," he added. "We are all professionals and I do not think that the board are to blame."</p>
