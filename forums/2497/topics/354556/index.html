              <p><strong>MEXICO CITY - Mexico
              coach Sven-Goran Eriksson was fired on Thursday, less than 24 hours
              after his team lost 3-1 to Honduras in a World Cup qualifier.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"This morning we talked to Mr
              Eriksson and announced his departure," Mexican Football Federation
              (FMF) president Justino Compean told a news conference.</p>
              <p>"It's a fact results have not been what we expected."</p>
              <p>Eriksson took over in June from Hugo Sanchez, who was sacked after 16 months in the job.</p>
              <p>Wednesday's defeat in San Pedro
              Sula left Mexico fourth in the final stage of CONCACAF World Cup
              qualifying with three points from three games, below leaders United
              States (seven points), Costa Rica (six) and Honduras (four).</p>
              <p>The Swede's position has been
              the subject of frequent speculation after several away defeats
              including two World Cup reverses in Honduras and one in Jamaica.</p>
              <p>Under his leadership Mexico played five competitive away games, losing four and drawing one in Canada.</p>
              <p>"Results away from home have to
              be better, I'm responsible," Eriksson told the conference. "I have to
              accept this without making a drama out of it."</p>
              <p>The former England coach's overall record with Mexico, including friendlies, was six wins, one draw and six defeats.</p>
              <p>Eriksson took charge with the team already involved in World Cup qualifying.</p>
              <p>Critics warned he would have
              little time to learn about the idiosyncracies of Mexican football and
              the difficult playing conditions in Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
              <p>The team won their first three
              qualifiers, all at home, but were nearly eliminated after losing in
              Jamaica and Honduras and drawing in Canada.</p>
              <p>Mexico squeezed into the final stage on goal difference and then lost 2-0 to United States in February.</p>
              <p>Saturday's 2-0 win over Costa Rica gave Eriksson respite but defeat on Wednesday was the final straw.</p>
              <p>He had also been underfire for
              the number of naturalised players he picked, including Argentine-born
              Matias Vuoso, Lucas Ayala and Guillermo Franco and Brazilian-born
              Antonio Naelson and Leandro Augusto.</p>
              <p>The former Lazio, AS Roma, Sampdoria, Benfica and Manchester City coach replied he was merely following the rules.</p>
              <p>Eriksson also found that many
              of Mexico's European-based professionals were short of match practice
              with their clubs because of loss of form or injuries.</p>
              <p>Former Atletico Madrid coach Javier Aguirre has been tipped by Mexican media as the favourite to take over.</p>
              <p>The team's next World Cup qualifier is in El Salvador on June 6.</p>

              <p><strong>Sven Goran Eriksson’s agent is already teeing up his client for a return to England following his dismissal by Mexico.</strong></p>
              <p>Mexico’s 3-2 defeat to Honduras on Wednesday evening proved to be
              the straw that broke the camel’s back for Eriksson, who was sacked as
              manager of the national team after just ten months in charge.</p>
              <p>Now, less than a season after he was ousted by Manchester City, a
              return to The Premier League could be on the cards. “He would love to
              work in England again,” said agent Athole Still.</p>
              <p>"I never wanted him to take the [Mexico] job. I would think there will be plenty of offers for him.”</p>
              <p>The former England manager was left regretful but pragmatic after his dismissal.</p>
              <p>“Sooner or later patience runs out,” said Eriksson. “It’s a shame, I
              always thought I would be in the Mexico dugout for a World Cup.”</p>
              <p>Eriksson was heavily linked with the vacant Portsmouth manager's
              position - now filled by interim boss Paul Hart - upon Tony Adams'
              deaprture earlier this season.</p>

              <p>MEXICO CITY, April 3 (Reuters) - Javier Aguirre was named as

              <p>April 3 (Reuters) - Factbox on Javier Aguirre, who was
              appointed Mexico coach on Friday to replace Sven-Goran
              Eriksson.</p>
              <p>* Born: Dec. 1 1958 in Mexico City, the son of Spanish
              immigrants.</p>
              <p>PLAYING CAREEER</p>
              <p>* He played for America, Atlante and Osasuna in Spain,
              where he suffered a broken leg during a match in Oct. 1986. He
              returned home to finish his career with Guadalajara.</p>
              <p>EARLY COACHING CAREER</p>
              <p>* Began with Mexico City side Atlante in 1995, helping save
              them from relegation, and then went to study in Spain for two
              years.</p>
              <p>* Joined Pachuca, a small club founded by Cornish miners,
              in 1998 and the following year helped them win the Mexican
              championship.</p>
              <p>* He was appointed Mexico coach in June 2001, replacing
              Enrique Meza after a 3-1 defeat in Honduras.</p>
              <p>MEXICO CAREER</p>
              <p>* After taking over with Mexico in serious trouble in the
              World Cup qualifiers, he guided them to the 2002 finals in
              Japan and South Korea helped by some inspirational performances
              from Cuauhtemoc Blanco.</p>
              <p>* Mexico were also given a helping hand when Honduras
              suffered a shock home defeat to Trinidad &amp; Tobago. Mexico then
              beat Honduras at the Azteca to qualify.</p>
              <p>* Mexico also reach the final of the 2001 Copa America
              where they lost to hosts Colombia in the final.</p>
              <p>* After impressively topping their first round group at the
              World Cup, Mexico suffered a bitter defeat against arch-rivals
              the United States in the second round.</p>
              <p>* Aguirre finishes with a record of 17 wins, four draws and
              six defeats in 27 full internationals in charge.</p>
              <p>SPAINISH COACHING CAREER</p>
              <p>* Joined Osasuna after the World Cup. In four seasons, he
              took them to the final of the Spanish Cup and led them to a
              club best fourth-place finish.</p>
              <p>* Moved to Atletico Madrid qualifying them for this
              season's Champions League. He quit at the start of February
              following a run of seven matches without a win.</p>
