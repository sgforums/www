              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Tottenham</strong></span></a><strong> striker Roman Pavlyuchenko has dropped a bombshell by admitting his dream is to play for </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> - his club's foes in Sunday's Carling Cup final. He revealed he would like to take over from Dimitar Berbatov who he dismisses as an "arrogant snob".</strong>  </p>
              <p>The £13.8million buy from Spartak Moscow claims about wanting to play for Sir Alex Ferguson will unsettle Spurs as they go into the Wembley clash to restore some pride after their dreadful season. </p>
              <p>Asked by a Russian journalist whether he wanted to play for Manchester United, Pavlyuchenko declared: "It would be wrong not to dream about this. "I have realised that the English Premier League is exactly why you should start playing football in the first place. "And Manchester United is the leader of it. Once your first dream comes true you must start dreaming of another target."</p>
              <p>But in saying how pleased he was to team up with Robbie Keane at Spurs, he was scathing about Berbatov, who made the move from White Heart Lane to Old Trafford.  "Robbie Keane returned to the Spurs as if he never left the club," he told Gazeta Daily in Moscow. </p>
              <p>"It's evident that he's a man of authority inside the team which is good for us. He was always liked as far as I can judge. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/02/27/article-0-032BC05C000005DC-892_233x307.jpg" alt="United's former Spurs striker Berbatov" width="233" height="307"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Arragoant? United's former Spurs striker Berbatov</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption">   </p>
              <p>"If Berbatov returned it would be taken quite differently. I heard tales that he was an arrogant snob who after a training session would just throw his dirty boots to the man who takes care of our footwear saying: 'Clean them for me!' </p>
              <p>"No one likes such people. Still he's now playing for Manchester United."</p>
              <p>The Russia international went on to speak about his rivalry with Darren Bent. "There are no bitter feelings between us about being competitors," he said. Yes, in one of his interviews he threatened to leave if he's kept on the bench. But that's natural, no disrespect to me. I treat him as one of my partners. Competition is fine by me."</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Carling fizz: Pavlyuchenko fires home Spurs' third goal in the Carling Cup semi-final triumph over Burnley</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p>Pavlyuchenko said he was determined to show United how good he is in tomorrow's clash. "I very much want to score in that match," he said. </p>
              <p>We lost to them in FA Cup. So the game is very important for us. First of all because it's about a title. In football you need to win titles. "So far I have only won the Russian Cup with Spartak and would like to feel those winner's emotions again. </p>
              <p>"Secondly, it's a ticket to the UEFA Cup. Third, it means a chance to avenge our previous loss. And fourth, it will boost our self-assurance. It's hard to over-estimate the importance of that match." He hit back at critics who say he has failed to score as much in the league as in cup competitions.  </p>
              <p>"They are free to say whatever they want. I can only tell them that to play and score is hard in any game here. "I wasn't inflicted with as many bumps, bruises and scars in my whole career in Russia as in a half a season in England. And I'm 27 years old."</p>
              <p>But he stressed: "I can tell you more: despite all the bumps and problems I'm very happy. I've come into the world where they do everything so that playing football brought joy."</p>

              <p><br><strong>When Sir Alex Ferguson sends a young </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> team out to contest the Carling Cup final against </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Tottenham</strong></span></a><strong> at Wembley today, many will imagine that football's most famous pensioner must have mellowed after so many years of unprecedented success. But not Rio Ferdinand.</strong></p>
              <p>In fact, United's current captain scoffs at the suggestion the Ferguson 'hairdryer' - the 67-year-old Scot's infamous means of scaring the living daylights out of anyone who fails to measure up to his own high expectations - has been consigned to the dustbin of history as a relic of a bygone era.</p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p>For in a wide-ranging interview to be published this week, Ferdinand confirms that the man who today chases the 41st trophy of his managerial career is still well capable of employing the sort of man-management techniques that many assumed had long since gone out of fashion.</p>
              <p>'In the old days, players would expect to get hammered by the manager,' said Ferdinand. 'But they're not as thick-skinned any more. These young foreign kids come in and when the manager lets off, it's like, "Whoah! Where did that come from? That's not allowed". I've seen them turn pink, and black guys turn white. It's not pretty, it's unbelievable!</p>
              <p>'I got the full force after a Champions League game in Benfica. At the time, I was exploding because I thought he was being unfair. But if you talk back to him, he just keeps going louder and louder until you shut up.</p>
              <p>'The worst we've seen is after we have behaved badly on a night out. Then, the fireworks explode and he goes bananas. Everyone's heads are on the floor, desperately trying not to catch his eye. And he's right to do it and we all know that if we do it again, we'll be out the door.'</p>
              <p>Ferguson's enduring intensity and drive are the key to the continuing dominance of United, who will show a real glimpse into their future - even a Ferguson-less future - with their starting team today.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex is well on the way to building his fifth great team, blending homegrown youngsters such as Darron Gibson and Danny Welbeck with his own signings and the best that the wise old heads of the dressing room - 30-year-old Ferdinand among them - now have to offer.</p>

              <p><strong>'People always ask me what he's really like, but it's hard to put it into words,' added Ferdinand. 'He's a winner, full stop. And he's in the know on everything. If you're sneaking off out to a club, he'll find out. And you think, "How did he know?" The answer is that a lot of people want to please him by giving him information on the players.'</strong></p>
              <p>Nobody over the past few weeks has wanted to incur the manager's wrath. All are desperate for the chance to win <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">United</span></a>'s first proper piece of silverware this season - they won the lightly-regarded World Club Championship before Christmas - and that includes Ferdinand.</p>
              <p>'We don't undervalue the Carling Cup,' he said. 'We want to win it. We all want to know what team the manager is going to put out. There will be players in it who will be attempting to win their first trophy and the opportunity to do that does not come too often.</p>
              <p>'Who knows what's going to happen next season? Some of them might have moved on. I've already been on to him about wanting to play, but he wasn't giving anything anyway. Anybody who doesn't play in the match is going to be disappointed, I'm telling you that much. It's another chance to win a medal and I want as many as I can. We won the Champions League last season and the League. Hopefully we can win both again. We want to set ourselves apart from the rest in the club's history.</p>
              <p>'But I don't want to talk about the possibility of winning five medals. I don't want to look that far ahead. We've got the game on Sunday, let's get that one out of the way before we start talking about the next challenge.</p>

              <p><strong>'We will treat </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Tottenham</strong></span></a><strong> with the respect they deserve. They won the trophy last season and are a talented team. We want to beat them. We want to be the best, but we still have to prove we can be.'</strong></p>
              <p>An added incentive for Ferdinand to get a starting spot, of course, is that he would be facing Harry Redknapp, his first manager at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/west-ham-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">West Ham</span></a> and the man who helped him develop from the flash young Peckham kid into England captaincy material.</p>
              <p>As a former team-mate and close friend of the late, great Bobby Moore, Redknapp thought so highly of the teenage Ferdinand that he deliberately used the image of England's World Cup-winning captain to inspire him. </p>
              <p>For now, Ferdinand is concentrating on winning silverware with United. And he would rather do that than get paid £500,000 a week to move across town to moneybags <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester City</span></a> - and not just because they are local rivals.</p>
              <p>'I talked about this with Patrice (Evra) and Wazza (Wayne Rooney) and we were asking each other what we'd do if City came in with ridiculous offers,' he said. 'And none of us would go. 'I wouldn't go to City whatever they offered me because I'm loyal to United, and because . . . what are they going to win? I couldn't wake up in the morning and have people say, "He's sold his soul. For money".</p>
              <p>'I didn't go to United just to make more money. I knew I could win things there that I couldn't at Leeds. I want medals not money. I want to end my career by looking at my trophy cabinet and thinking, "I did OK".'</p>
