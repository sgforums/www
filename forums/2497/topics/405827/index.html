              <h1>Newcastle's Joey Barton insists: I'm as good as any England

              <p>Joey Barton has astonishingly claimed that he is as good as England's
               Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard.</p>
              <p>The 27-year-old Newcastle 
              midfielder is convinced that at his best he is equal to any of the 
              midfielders Fabio Capello included in his World Cup squad.</p>
              <p>Despite
               making just 34 starts in three seasons for Newcastle, Barton boasted 
              that he was 'as good as anybody in this country.'</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Another chance: Joey Barton returns to the 
              Premier League with
              Newcastle this season determined to show his best form and put a
              troubled past behind him</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Newcastle splashed out an amazing 
              Â£5.8million to buy him from 
              Manchester City in 2007, despite his training ground assault on teammate
              Ousmane Dabo, which ended in a conviction and suspended jail sentence.</p>
              <p>The St James' Park club have had precious little return on their 
              investment, with Barton spending months sidelined through injury and 
              having a spell in jail after another assault conviction, for fighting in
              Liverpool's city centre.</p>
              <p>But Barton, who still thinks he has the ability to add to his one 
              England cap, now claims he intends to rediscover his best form and 
              bolster Newcastle's return to the Premier League.</p>
              <p>He captained Chris Hughton's side in Saturday's 3-0 friendly victory 
              at Car lisle and told the <span style="font-style: italic;">Evening 
              Chronicle</span>: 'First and foremost, I want to do well for Newcastle 
              United. 'But watching some of the performances in the World Cup over the
              summer, I think that on form, I'm as good as anybody in this country.</p>

              that I am doing fantastic for this football club. At the end of the day,
              I was an England international as a box-to-box midfield player.</p>
              <p>'I don't say this lightly, but I'm a much more rounded footballer now
              than I was when I first signed for this club. Injuries have restricted

              <p>'If I can sustain fitness for a long period of time, I'm very 
              confident of finding the form that got me in the England squad.'</p>
              <p>Barton has a history of voicing his opinion of the England squad 
              after a World Cup failure.</p>
              <p>After the 2006 tournament, Barton slammed those of Sven Goran 
              Eriksson's players who wrote autobiographies, saying they were simply 
              looking to cash in on the team's lack of success.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Good old Joey.</p>
              <p>Just when you thought it was safe to start preparing for another
              quiet season at <br>St James' Park, the man with the loudest mouth and
              strongest opinions at Newcastle (well among the players, that is) lets
              the world know he is heading back into the Premier League.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/20/article-1296218-0A7F90B8000005DC-300_306x463.jpg" alt=" Joey Barton of Newcastle" width="306" height="463">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>First Carlisle, then the world: Newcastle's Joey
               Barton is ready to answer England's call</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>And so, with just 45 minutes at Carlisle under his belt, Joey Barton
              informs us that he is the solution to all Fabio Capello's woes and
              would have performed far better at the World Cup than any England
              midfielder. (Not that that would be difficult).</p>
              <p>Yes, Barton is back. He is certain to ruffle the feathers of the
              teams and supporters in the top flight after a year away, which was
              mostly spent on the treatment table.</p>
              <p>There are few players 
              who will be
              booed as much as him this year. But you just know he loves it.</p>
              <p>The
               jeers at Brunton Park were rather subdued by Barton's standards
              but the controversial former Manchester City midfielder knows he will
              face much more hostility when he returns to Old Trafford on the opening
              weekend of the season.</p>
              <p>And it is not just his chequered past which singles Barton out when
              he is on opposition territory. Don't forget this is a player who
              divided opinion at his own club after his jail sentence and who was
              fortunate to keep his place in the Newcastle squad at all.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p>It's Barton's mouth not his fists which wind 
              people up now but
              rather like the cantankerous old Yorkshireman in the Harry Enfield
              sketches, Barton has a tendency to 'say what he likes and like what he
              bloody well says.'</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p>This week the 27-year-old turned his attention on England and 
              their World Cup debacle and Barton, with one England cap to his name, is
               convinced he would have done far better than the likes of Gerrard and 
              Lampard in South Africa.</p>
              <p>He said: 'First and foremost, I want to 
              do well for Newcastle United. 'But watching some of the performances in 
              the World Cup over the summer, I think that on form, I'm as good as 
              anybody in this country.</p>
              <p>'I don't say that lightly and I have
               to go out and prove that, but surely every midfielder in this country 
              should be thinking like that?</p>
              <p>'They should be looking at it 
              and saying, "That's where I want to be and that's where I can go".</p>
              <p>'That's
               my goal, and if I break into the England squad, it proves that I am 
              doing fantastic for this football club. At the end of the day, I was an 
              England international as a box-to-box midfield player.</p>
              <p>'I 
              don't say this lightly, but I'm a much more rounded footballer now than I
               was when I first signed for this club. Injuries have restricted my 
              chances to show that.</p>
              <p>'If I can sustain fitness for a long 
              period of time, I'm very confident of finding the form that got me in 
              the England squad.'</p>
              <p>Barton is at least right that he has to 
              nail down a place in the Newcastle side first and as manager Chris 
              Hughton tinkers with his selections in the increasingly testing 
              friendlies over the coming weeks, he can be certain that motor mouth 
              Joey will be doing his utmost to convince him he should start when the 
              season kicks off at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Not so much a quiet word in
               his shell-like, more a megaphone from the top of the Gallowgate. He 
              would not expect anything else.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Opinion divider: Joey Barton's career has been 
              one of injuries, controversy and unfulfilled potential</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>It is only one game into pre-season and Newcastle's players will 
              start to find their feet, stamina and limits over the coming weeks - but
               even at Carlisle Hughton could surely see that Barton and Danny Guthrie
               offer much more energy and creativity in midfield than Alan Smith and 
              Kevin Nolan.</p>
              <p>Nolan at least can play off the lone striker, 
              which will presumably be Andy Carroll, on the frequent occasions Hughton
               is likely to use that system.</p>
              <p>He has conceded he needs extra
               bodies in to see him through difficult months ahead and even if he uses
               him predominantly from the bench, a striker to help Carroll carry that 
              burden has to be a priority.</p>
              <p>It is very early days for Hughton
               and Newcastle. There were some encouraging signs at Carlisle, 
              particularly seeing the bright young talent performing, and there will 
              be some concerns, particularly about the older fraternity.</p>
              <p>And
               then there was Joey Barton, strutting his stuff and looking very 
              comfortable at the heart of the Newcastle team. Letting his football do 
              the talking on the pitch, then letting his mouth run away with him 
              afterwards.</p>
              <p>Yup, he's back.</p>
