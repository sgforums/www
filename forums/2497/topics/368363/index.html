              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ROBINHO has promised Carlos Tevez he will not regret snubbing Chelsea to join Manchester City.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Brazilian forward, 25, is ideally placed to pass comment as he was pursued by the two clubs back in August last year before opting for Eastlands.</p>
              <p class="article">Tevez has been faced with a similar dilemma since deciding to quit Manchester United. The former Old Trafford hero opted for City despite being courted by Chelsea and Robinho maintains he will soon realise it is the right choice.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "What I can say to Carlos is that I had to make the same choice last season. "And I don't regret choosing City. I have not done since the moment I signed. "We all feel like a big family at City and that's another point that I would mention to him.</p>
              <p class="article">"Of course Chelsea is a big club but Manchester City is also huge and we could be even more powerful than them. That is more likely to happen if players like Carlos join us. If he asks me I'll do everything I can to convince him."</p>
              <p class="article">Meanwhile, Robinho is praying his close pal Elano will also stay. The midfielder is set for crunch talks with manager Mark Hughes in the next few days after helping Brazil win the Confederations Cup.</p>
              <p class="article">Inter Milan have shown an interest in the former Shakhtar Donetsk man who had an uneasy relationship with Hughes last season. But Robinho insists Elano wants to stay put and believes he still has a big role to play in pushing City forward.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: "It would be a mistake allowing Elano to leave. It's one thing if the player is unhappy and wants to seek other challenges. "But I believe Elano is happy in England and I would like to have him in the squad next season.</p>
              <p class="article">"I've also heard rumours we are keen on signing Maicon, I would really like it if he joined us at City next season."</p>
