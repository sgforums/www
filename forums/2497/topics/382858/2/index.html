              <p>It is happening bit by bit... The BIG CON JOB... by
              Rafa...</p>
              <p>First, Before the season started, they were seen as
              potential winners for this year's league title... Rafa look smart
              and proud with his new purchased in top earner Johnson ($139k per
              week) and his $20m Italian stallion... <strong>None of the other top 3
              have spent so much dough this season...</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then when the season gets under way, slowly and slowly... They
              start to slip out of the top 2, then 3 then 4 and into 8
              spot... Then came the Champions League... After their 1st
              game, they are still good despite a poor performance... Then 2nd
              and 3rd games later, they are still in with a good
              chance according to Rafa... Then by their 4th game,
              <strong>Rafa said something like remember Istanbul bla bla bla..</strong>. By the
              end of it... Rafa kind of said we believe Lyon will not turn over
              (not exactly his words but something like that lah)... Lyon will be
              professional... Then by their 5th game,<strong> Rafa came out to say we
              need a miracle and more bla bla bla... </strong>before the match...</p>
              <p>And after the matches are settled, and Lyon indeed got
              turned over... More bla... bla... bla came... Like we did our job
              in Hungary only Lyon didn't do theirs for us in Italy... lol</p>
              <p>Now, its over for them in the CL... Time for Rafa to
              face the facts and not give their fans anymore false
              hope... </p>
              <p><strong>Now we are hearing newer stuff like winning the Europa League,
              100% top 4 spots</strong>... More of Rafa's bla... bla... bla... for
              the Pool fans to take... I am just glad he isn't the United
              manager... or I will cry watching my beloved club going down the
              drain bit by bit with his monthly false hope<strong>.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The management are just dumb to continue with him</strong>... And the
              fans have clearly taken their eyes off the real ball (Rafa) and
              instead focusing on the beach ball (Owners)... by looking at
              the owners rather than the man making the team suck... The fans,
              what can you say about them... They are being Con by the master
              distractor...</p>
              <p>Thats why I said it's... The BIG CON JOB... by Rafa on the
              fans...</p>

              <p>You said Liverpool spent more than their top 3 rivals this season. But looking at this, 4.95m isn't that much after all. Liverpool has arguably the weakest squad of the top 4 and of course, there is a need to inject better players into the team.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana;">2009-10 Net spend: £4.95m<br>Players in + fee: Glen Johnson £18m, Alberto Aquilani £20m, Sotiros Kyrgiakos £2m.<br>Players
              out + fee: Paul Anderson £0.25m, Sebastian Leto £1.3m, Sami Hyypia
              Free, Jermaine Pennant Free, Alvaro Arbeloa £3.5m, Xabi Alonso £30m.</span></p>
              <p>Benitez is not carrying out a big con job. You must be having a laugh. By telling fans to remember Istanbul and that they will definitely be in the top 4 is simply instilling optimism. Which club wants a manager who comes in and says thats it, we are out of contention. In times like this, the only thing the manager can do is to raise the morale of the camp. Find me a manager that acknowledges defeat. You will hardly find one. A defeatist will never succeed as a manager.</p>
              <p>The management is not dumb to continue with him. They simply cant afford to sack him. A compensation of 25m pounds would kill Liverpool. They probably see the good in continuing with him. This summer, he reshaped the academy and brought in Barcelona's technical coach who groomed the likes of Messi and Iniesta. This can only bring good to the future of the club. Parry was fired because he's a clown, fucking up all of Rafa's top transfer targets. If he is that bad, Real madrid, Spain's NT would not have come knocking on his door, asking him to take them.</p>
              <p>Despite saying all this, I agree that his decisions at times, have been baffling.</p>

              <p><br>When we talk about spending, we are talking about spending... and not how much he makes or we could end up saying things like United spent <strong>-</strong>$60 million this season or Arsenal spent <strong>-</strong>$30 million... Instead we say United spent about $20m this season and Arsenal about $11m isn't it? Otherwise it makes no sense... Cos how do you spend a minus?</p>
              <p>I don't think its wrong to be positive but giving false hope is a totally different thing altogether... Its not that this has happen once, twice, but so many times even more recently that some of their fans are realizing it now... I am not saying he should be negative... Look at Wenger, does he go out and say so many stuff that give the fans false hope? No, he try to get the job done first and not giving out signs that they will sure win this or that... and when they do well, people will say what a great manager he is... cos expectations wasn't high in the first place...</p>
              <p>I think it serve the players more by keeping his mouth shut and not say stuff like they will definitely be in the top 4... Cos the players don't need the extra pressure after just having been kick out of the CL. Do we see Wenger coming out to say they will be in the top 4 when almost everyone was writing them off at the start of this season? No, he just got his players ready and go for it when everyone wasn't looking at them...</p>
              <p>Sometimes, its better to spend a little more now than lose more in the future... Pool not qualifying is already a problem from Rafa, the club will lose money there... If they don't get into the top 4 at the end of the season... more money is lost there as well... So spending a little more now could actually save them more in future who knows...</p>
              <p>And what is this about the academy? He has been there for more than 5 years, so if anything good was to come out of it, it would have already happen... even a very little but unfortunately, nothing special have come out since he came to Pool. During these last 5.5 years, we only see lots of average players coming from Spain then go back after a short while... United and Arsenal and even West Ham have brought out more good young players in 2 yrs then Rafa have in more than 5.5 years...</p>
              <p>Finally, your last sentence actually summarize everything that is the problem... lol.</p>

              <p>Parry was actually not a clown as Keane was wanted by Ah Ben and not Parry.</p>
              <p>As for why Ah Ben is talking so much, he is being hounded by the press everyday and he is showing crack under this pressure.</p>
              <p>This season will be the result of all his weakness:</p>
              <p>He is a paper manager and dun really know his player well.</p>
              <p>His stubbornness of utilising his pet instead of using on form players will kill him and Liverpool.</p>
              <p>This is causing unhappiness in the dressing room especially babel who have spoken out against him this week.</p>
              <p>He will definitely be shipped out in Jan 2010.</p>
