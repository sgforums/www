              <p class="article">The Reds crashed out of European football's biggest tournament tonight despite beating Debrecen 1-0 in Hungary.</p>
              <p class="article">But Gerrard insists they can go some way to healing the pain by going all the way in the lesser competition.</p>
              <p class="article">The Liverpool skipper said: "Of course it's disappointing, we played fantastically well tonight and despite getting three points we don't progress.</p>
              <p class="article">"Hopefully now we'll be in the Europa League so we'll try to win that.</p>
              <p class="article">"The main prize has gone and to be playing in the Europa League is disappointing but we have to accept that, move on and try to win that competition.</p>
              <p class="article">"The only consolation in this is if we go on and win the secondary one."</p>

              <p>It is happening bit by bit... The BIG CON JOB... by Rafa...</p>
              <p>First, Before the season started, they were seen as potential winners for this year's league title... Rafa look smart and proud with his new purchased in top earner Johnson ($139k per week) and his $20m Italian stallion... None of the other top 3 have spent so much dough this season...</p>
              <p>Some of the Press even go as far as billing them as... "This is it"  hahaha... borrow from Michael Jackson's movie... The year Liverpool will win the league again after almost 20 yrs... All this are base on after watching their last year's performance... They lost to United by only 4 points and this time United are without Ronaldo... So it should be easier for Pool...</p>
              <p>Then when the season gets under way, slowly and slowly... They start to slip out of the top 2, then 3 then 4 and into 8 spot... Then came the Champions League... After their 1st game, they are still good despite a poor performance... Then 2nd and 3rd games later, they are still in with a good chance according to Rafa... Then by their 4th game, Rafa said something like remember Istanbul bla bla bla... By the end of it... Rafa kind of said we believe Lyon will not turn over (not exactly his words but something like that lah)... Lyon will be professional... Then by their 5th game, Rafa came out to say we need a miracle and more bla bla bla... before the match...</p>
              <p>And after the matches are settled, and Lyon indeed got turned over... More bla... bla... bla came... Like we did our job in Hungary only Lyon didn't do theirs for us in Italy... lol</p>
              <p>Now, its over for them in the CL... Time for Rafa to face the facts and not give their fans anymore false hope... </p>
              <p>Now we are hearing newer stuff like winning the Europa League, 100% top 4 spots... More of Rafa's bla... bla... bla... for the Pool fans to take... I am just glad he isn't the United manager... or I will cry watching my beloved club going down the drain bit by bit with his monthly false hope.</p>
              <p>When Pool are finally out of the top 4, I really like to hear what more he have to say to them... Blame Parry for not being there, blame Barry for not joining them, blame cherry for not growing in Liverpool? lol.</p>
              <p>The management are just dumb to continue with him... And the fans have clearly taken their eyes off the real ball (Rafa) and instead focusing on the beach ball (Owners)... by looking at the owners rather than the man making the team suck... The fans, what can you say about them... They are being Con by the master distractor...</p>
              <p>Thats why I said it's... The BIG CON JOB... by Rafa on the fans...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I have my doubts that liverpool will come back strongly to challenge for the league title and CL before the season started and I am right. because all these years, you can see liverpool doing well in one season and faltering in the next season. whatever happened to their treble cup win in 2001 and how did they fare in 2002 the next season? I would say they have no consistency, so they are very inconsistent if you study their trends. alonso leaving and buying the injured italian and out for 3 months also play a part in my prognosis, plus the fragility of torres and gerrard getting injured every now and then, who can they rely on? certainly not lucas or kuyt.</p></div>

              <h1>Rafa Benitez joins the also-rans.<br></h1>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/11/24/article-0-075962E4000005DC-860_468x286.jpg" alt="Liverpool fans" width="468" height="286"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Loyal: Liverpool fans show their support in Debrecen, but their patience will be severely tested now.</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em></em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em></em></p>
              <p><strong>Harry Houdini might have been born here but the city did not become a stage for Anfield’s escapologists on this occasion.</strong></p>
              <p>Liverpool’s luck ran out here and this time all that talk of miracles was silenced in a single sentence of Hungarian in the 29th minute. ‘Fiorentina vezet egy-nullra,’ declared the stadium announcer. Few needed a translator to realise the Italians had taken the lead against Lyon in the corresponding Group E fixture, thus all but rendering David Ngog’s goal an irrelevance.</p>
              <p>A team that lifted the European Cup in 2005, so nearly did so again two years later and ran Manchester United close to the championship last season deserves better than to be undermined by a lack of strength in depth.<br><br>One can only imagine how difficult and depressing it will be when Fiorentina roll into Anfield a fortnight from now. Comfortable Italian qualifiers against a team that should have strolled into the last 16 but somehow made a mess of it.</p>
              <p>If the supporters do turn up, it will be fascinating to see how they respond to the sight of Benitez and a side that, particularly after last season, had promised so much. The evidence so far would suggest the fans remain behind their Spanish manager. A chorus of <span style="font-style: italic;">You’ll Never Walk Alone</span> immediately followed the bitter disappointment of this exit, along with an amusing declaration that they would now win the Europa League final in Hamburg next May. But let’s see how they respond if disappointment follows at Everton this weekend and Blackburn a week after that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/11/24/article-0-07596206000005DC-561_468x341.jpg" alt="Rafa Benitez" width="468" height="341"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Down and out: Rafa Benitez contemplates Liverpool's failure as Steven Gerrard trudges off.</em><br></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>For what it’s worth, it owed something to that revolutionary placenta treatment that Liverpool enjoyed their second win in 11 matches last night.</strong></p>
              <p>Fabio Aurelio was among those who benefited from a trip to Belgrade and it was the Brazilian who delivered the cross that Jamie Carragher nodded down before Ngog struck from close range.</p>
              <p>So poor were Debrecen that they offered little in response, with Ngog almost scoring a second with a long-range effort that forced a fine save from Vukasin Poleksic.</p>
              <p>News was spreading fast of events in Florence, where the Italians hit the post twice in 30 seconds against a Lyon side who had already qualified and were not putting up much of a fight.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">But nobody expected news of a goal to be delivered in quite the fashion it was — directly to every living soul inside the Ferenc Puskas Stadium thanks to a stadium announcer who didn’t seem to mind that it all but killed the game as a contest.</p>
              </div>
              <p>It was no surprise to see Debrecen almost score within a minute of the announcement. No surprise to see Liverpool’s defenders suffer a momentary lapse of concentration and allow Gergely Rudolf to threaten with a header that bounced just wide.</p>
              <p>It was no surprise to see the Hungarians go as close as they did to scoring in the final few minutes. Lyon had not hit back with an equaliser and Liverpool knew damn well it was never going to come.</p>
              <p>‘We could have won all the games we played,’ said Benitez afterwards.</p>
              <p>They could have and they should have. But they didn’t, and it is now up to Liverpool’s manager to work out why.</p>

              <p>I already knew Pool will go not far in the future last season when they lost to Spurs 4:2 in LC match.</p>
              <p>They played mostly 2nd string players that day, but Spurs still out played them totally when you consider that Spurs was actually quite bad &amp; was stuck in the relegation zone at that time.</p>
              <p>So Pool have some(not all) good players in the first team but the rest are just not top 4 standard or even mid table standard.</p>
              <p>Such squad with such poor strength in depth will not go far in the EPL, a few injuries to some first team players like Torres  or StevieG and they are fu&lt;ked!</p>
