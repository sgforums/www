            <div class='col-md body'>Juventus interested in rescuing Heinze from Old Trafford bench<br><br>Daniel Taylor and Louise Taylor<br>Wednesday January 10, 2007<br>The Guardian<br><br>Juventus have become the first club to declare an interest in Gabriel Heinze, the Manchester United left-back who has lost his first-team place this season to Patrice Evra.<br><br>The Italian club's admiration of Heinze was revealed by their head coach, Didier Deschamps, in an interview last night with the French radio station RMC Info. Deschamps is hoping to lead Juventus, who are one point behind the Serie B leaders Rimini, back to the Italian top flight at the first attempt following their demotion last year for match-fixing. He is monitoring Heinze's availability, aware that United have offered Â£5m for the Southampton left-back Gareth Bale.<br><br>Article continues<br>"I saw Gabriel play in France during his time there, so I know him really well," said Deschamps. "He plays left-back at Manchester United, but I don't think it's the position where he can make the most of his abilities. He is better as a central defender. United have several left-backs so if they put Heinze up for sale, and we have the possibility to buy him, I don't see any reason why we can't do just that."<br><br>Heinze moved from Paris St-Germain to Old Trafford in 2004 and won their player of the year award in his first season. However, he has not regained his best form since rupturing cruciate knee ligaments in September 2005, an injury that kept him out for almost all of last season.<br><br>He recovered in time to play for Argentina in the World Cup but was not fit enough to start the Premiership season and, though Sir Alex Ferguson remains an admirer, there is a feeling at the club that he is not the same player as before.<br><br>That belief is clearly not shared by Deschamps, and it is thought there is also interest from the German and French leagues. "He's an outstanding player, a leader and a winner, and on top of that he has a European passport which makes him even more attractive," Deschamps added.<br><br>The Football Association is still awaiting replies from Everton's Tim Howard and Joleon Lescott regarding allegations that they were racially abused by Newcastle United's Emre during a recent Premiership game at Goodison Park. If Soho Square officials, who were alerted to a potential problem between Emre and two of Everton's black players when Dermot Gallagher mentioned the allegations in his report, have still heard nothing by this evening the ruling body's investigation into the matter will be closed. Although Howard is understood to have originally raised the subject with Gallagher, it is thought that neither he or Lescott wants to pursue things any further.<br><br>Newcastle United are negotiating to take Lassana Diarra on loan from Chelsea until the end of the season. The French midfielder, 21, has struggled to break into Jose Mourinho's first XI but is admired by Glenn Roeder and has a friend at St James' Park in his compatriot Charles N'Zogbia.<br><br>Meanwhile Roeder's interest in signing Darren Bent from Charlton has cooled. Newcastle's manager - who hopes to recruit a new defender this week - was disappointed to learn that a knee injury is likely to sideline Bent until the end of February and is almost certain to abandon plans for a Â£12m bid. Newcastle may still try to buy the striker in the summer.</div>
