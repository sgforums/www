              <p><strong>Liverpool fan Michael Shields, who was jailed for 15 years in Bulgaria for the attempted murder of a barman, has been pardoned, his lawyer said on Wednesday.</strong></p>
              <p>Shields, 22, was convicted after a disturbance following Liverpool's European Cup victory in Turkey in 2005. He was later transferred to a prison in the UK.</p>
              <p>His pardon follows a campaign by his family, MPs, clergymen, Liverpool players and many others, who believe he is innocent.</p>
              <p>His lawyer said he would be freed on Wednesday. Shields' solicitor John Wheate said the jailed fan was "absolutely ecstatic" when he was given the news earlier today.</p>
              <p>His parents had been told of the decision in a telephone call with Mr Straw this morning. Mr Wheate said: "I don't know if Michael has been released yet but I can confirm he has been pardoned and will be released today.</p>
              <p>"His parents spoke to Jack Straw earlier this morning and I have spoken to Michael myself. "At first he couldn't believe it after all these years and knock backs. "But now he is absolutely ecstatic and so are his family."</p>
              <p>Mr Shields was arrested with three other men after a Bulgarian man, Martin Georgiev, was seriously assaulted in the Black Sea resort of Varna in the early hours May 30, 2005, after a Champions League match.</p>
              <p>Mr Georgiev had come out of his bar to investigate a fracas only to be punched, kicked and knocked to the ground. He later testified that Mr Shields had deliberately struck him on the head with a rock as he lay on the ground — hence the charge of attempted murder.</p>

              <p><a class="small mask " name="&amp;lid=%7BtrailItemImageAndTrailText%7D%7BJailed%20Liverpool%20fan%20Michael%20Shields%20to%20be%20released%7D&amp;lpos=%7Btrail%7D%7B2%7D" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/sep/09/liverpool-fan-michael-shields-pardoned"><img class="image-in-trail 	" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2009/9/9/1252489728197/Michael-Shields-001.jpg" alt="Michael Shields" width="140" height="84"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Justice Secretary Mr Straw announced his provisional decision not to grant a pardon on July 2. But at a meeting with Shields' parents on August 28, new evidence emerged which convinced him of Shields's innocence, he said in a statement.</p>
              <p>Following that meeting he has recommended to the Queen that Shields be pardoned. Shields will walk free from prison today, he confirmed. Louise Ellman, Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside, who has been campaigning for her constituent Shields's release ever since his conviction, said today: "I am overjoyed at Jack Straw's decision.</p>
              <p>"Michael has suffered a gross miscarriage of justice, incarcerated for four years for a crime he did not commit and for which another man has confessed. "I pay tribute to Michael's family and the people of Liverpool for their remarkable courage and persistence."</p>
              <p>Mrs Ellman added: "Jack Straw has brought justice to an innocent young man. This is a day for celebration." At the family home in Wavertree, Liverpool, his parents and other relatives appeared to be preparing to leave to collect Shields from Thorn Cross Young Offender Institution in Warrington, Cheshire.</p>
              <p>In a statement issued by the Diocese of Liverpool, the Bishop of Liverpool the Rt Rev James Jones, said: "I have always believed in Michael's innocence." I am so happy for him. I saw him a few weeks ago and was impressed by how he has coped.</p>
              <p>"He and his family have been through a terrible ordeal. I hold them in my prayers as they rebuild their lives. "I commend the Justice Secretary for giving this case such close personal attention."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In his statement, Mr Straw said he was told by Shields' parents about a meeting between members of the Shields family and another man accused of the killing.</p>
              <p>Mr Straw was told the man, who is not named, confessed to the attack on the second day of Michael Shields' trial in Bulgaria.</p>
              <p>He said: "I was told in the course of the visit that the man made an oral confession in front of several other people.</p>
              <p>"This episode, I was told, happened on 22 July 2005, a day after the start of Mr Shields' trial in Bulgaria." "I will not set out in this statement all the evidence that has come to light over the last two weeks but suffice it to say that there is very good reason to believe I was being told the truth.</p>
              <p>"This in my view profoundly changed the credibility of the various accounts of what actually happened in this case. "I have concluded, having looked carefully at all the evidence now available, that Michael Shields is telling the truth when he says he is innocent of the attempted murder of which he was convicted in Bulgaria.</p>
              <p>"That being so I have recommended to Her Majesty the Queen that he should be granted a free pardon. Mr Shields is being released from prison today and will return home to his family a free man."</p>
