              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ARSENE WENGER has declared Star Wars on Chelsea and Manchester United by telling his Arsenal kids: The Force is with you.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Gunners will move to within one point of leaders Chelsea if they beat Bolton at home tonight. And Wenger is convinced his team have the advantage over their title rivals after completing a 10-point turnaround during the holiday period.</p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti recently claimed Wenger was a "good magician" for predicting the Blues' Christmas collapse. But the Arsenal boss was more Obi-Wan Kenobi last night as he detected a shift in the balance of power.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "One month ago we were a long way from the top teams, but now we have momentum on our side and the chance to keep that going. "I said when we lost to Chelsea at the end of November that they would drop some points, but I never expected it to happen so quickly.</p>
              <p class="article">"One month has given us a good springboard to go even further. "Why should we stop here when we have taken so many points from our opponents? "We refused to give up. The mental strength and solidarity of my players has been tested and they have come through it.</p>
              <p class="article">"Now I know that within our team we have a great hunger for success. "We are a team that has grown up together and now we want to win things together. "What was most important was how we responded to the opportunity to come back when the other teams dropped points.</p>
              <p class="article">"We have put ourselves in a better mathematical situation and we must keep up that momentum by being consistent. "We are on a good run and we want to test the resistance of the other teams. "We have a good opportunity to get close to Chelsea and we want to take it. "That will make things more interesting for everybody. The title race only starts after Christmas. "I don't think nerves play a part in December. But they will play a big part in March and April."</p>
              <p class="article">Wenger is aware his young team have little experience of going the distance. Their only recent real title challenge came two seasons ago when they choked in the final run-in. But he is adamant his youngsters are better equipped this time.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "I believe we can cope with all the demands, especially with Gael Clichy, Cesc Fabregas and Nicklas Bendtner soon coming back from injuries. "The title race will be different because there are six or seven teams challenging for the top four.</p>
              <p class="article">"We all play each other over the next few months and that means everybody will continue to drop points. "I said a few months ago that 78 to 83 points will win the title and I stick by that. We have played 19 league games and have 41 points.</p>
              <p class="article">"If you multiply that by two it's 82 points over the season and that will be around what is needed. "Nobody will run away with it. That is what makes things so interesting this season."</p>
