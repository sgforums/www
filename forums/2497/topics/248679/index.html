Bigger than winning the Champions League," Drogba said in the newspaper.<br><br>"They are part of the history of Chelsea, they have created so much and I don't believe any supporter can accept next season - or the future without them.<br><br>"We should do everything to make sure they are here.<br><br>"We want to win the European Cup this year but they are players that can help you win it for the next five or six years.<br><br>"How many players have a leader like Terry? He is a rock for us and losing him would break a lot of clubs."<br><br>Joe Cole, meanwhile, has revealed that his return to action following a foot operation in January has stunned medics.<br><br>"The surgeons and all the medical people did a great job on my foot but they said I wouldn't play again this season," he explained.<br><br>"So everything that happens to me now is a huge bonus.<br><br>"As a footballer, your long-term fitness is first and foremost in your mind but the operation was a success and I've been able to come back earlier than expected."<br><br>Cole is now hoping to help Chelsea claim some more silverware after missing their triumphant Carling Cup campaign.<br><br>"Obviously four trophies is a tall order but we're going for it," he said.<br><br>"It's a cliche but we have to take each game as it comes." </span></div>
