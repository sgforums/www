Doctors have today confirmed that the England skipper has broken a metatarsal in his right foot. That is not just a blow for Blues boss Avram Grant, who now has to get their season back on track without his influential captain. It also means Terry is certain to miss Fabio Capello's first game in charge as England manager.</strong><br><br>The defender hobbled off during Sunday's 1-0 defeat at Arsenal after a challenge with Emmanuel Eboue. X-rays have shown that Terry has broken the third metatarsal in his right foot, which is understood to be as bad as it can get. A close friend said: "The doctors were surprised as they said it's very unusual to break that third metatarsal.<br><br>"It's more common for footballers to break the first or fifth metatarsal. "The bad news is they say it will take longer to heal than normal. "They said it could take at least 12 weeks."<br><br>Capello, who was unveiled as new England manager today, will make his Wembley bow with a friendly on February 6 against Switzerland. But doctors believe that will come too soon for Terry to have recovered in time. Chelsea striker Salomon Kalou revealed that Eboue apologised to the defender for the tackle.<br><br>He said: Â“I was saying to Eboue that it was a red card because he did it on purpose - but he denied that. Â“He said he tried to block the ball and it was not on purpose. He said sorry to John. "He didnÂ’t mean to do it but to apologise was a nice thing to do. John will be a big loss and is very important to the squad. "We will miss him and it will be difficult to do it without him but we have the players to do that.Â”<br><br>The third metatarsal bones are in the middle toe, which normally suffer injury through wear and tear rather than a clean break. Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen have broken fifth metatarsals before and took at least six weeks LONGER for both players to get back into action than specialists originally predicted.<br><br>In 2004, Scott Parker broke a second metatarsal and although an eight-week absence was predicted, it was 34 weeks before he made a return.<br></div>

How often have we started to see him getting into trouble on the field... I think its no coincidence with his rise in status in the Gunners team. Starting from last season a few incident already, He had trouble with Lampard in the Carling cup, then sunday Terry... He even insulted a decorated old timer in Mark Hughes Manager of Blackburn on his playing days and then later apologise, maybe after Wenger advise him to...<br><br>I thought he was very lucky to still be on the field on Sunday as he could have got 2 yellow... If he let his new found fame gets to his head... Then he could end up as the next Gazza.<br><br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/lamp.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/fight2.jpg"></div>
