            <div class='col-md body'>Alex Ferguson is confident his lightning strike on the summer transfer market will ensure Manchester United are strong enough to survive any major mishap next season.<br><br>Although United managed to end a four-year drought by lifting the Premier League trophy last season, they were unable to withstand a catalogue of injuries and eventually fell to AC Milan in the Champions League semi-final and Chelsea in the FA Cup final.<br><br>It was a situation Ferguson was anxious to address and after luring Owen Hargreaves, Nani and Anderson to Old Trafford within a fortnight of the season ending, he is now intent on ensuring Argentina striker Carlos Tevez is a Red Devil by the time his side begin the defence of their crown against Reading next month as well.<br><br>And once Tevez is on board, even though Ferguson accepts there are bound to be some departures, the United boss feels he will have the depth of quality to sustain a challenge for honours on all fronts.<br><br>``When it came to the latter part of last season, we just did not have a squad strong enough to handle all the competitions we were in,'' he said.<br><br>``We had a great opportunity in three competitions but we could not stretch our squad far enough to save legs when we needed to.<br><br>``The evidence of last season tells you we need a very strong squad and I feel we have that now.<br><br>``Yes, it is going to take management. No-one is going to play all the games next season and hopefully the players accept that.''<br><br>Whether the likes of Gabriel Heinze, Alan Smith, Kieran Richardson, Giuseppe Rossi and Gerard Pique - who have all been linked with big-money moves away from Old Trafford - are among the consenting voices remains to be seen.<br><br>Ferguson would be a reluctant seller but accepts exits may be an inevitable consequence of his rebuilding.<br><br>``I don't expect anybody to leave but it may happen because some players will view the situation and think maybe they won't get enough games to satisfy them, but there are no decisions made at the moment,'' he said.<br><br>Ferguson stated neither Nani, nor Anderson, the young duo who have arrived from Portugal at great expense, would be exposed too much next term.<br><br>Hargreaves is another matter entirely though.<br><br>Having waited so patiently to get his man, Ferguson is now looking for the 26-year-old to provide the discipline and experience he learned in a decade of service at Bayern Munich.<br><br>``Owen brings a lot of speed to the midfield and a good energy,'' he said. ``He also has a lot of European experience, which not many players have.<br><br>'His time in the Bundesliga brings us something different, which will help us as the season goes on.' end</div>
