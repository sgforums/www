              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>If you think of the Big Four, Ipswich don't normally spring to mind. But the Suffolk club charge more than Manchester United and Liverpool for their top season tickets, according to new research.</strong></p>
              <p>Of the 92 League clubs in England, only Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur are charging more than the Tractor Boys this season.</p>
              <p>The Gunners charge a whopping £1825 for their highest priced season ticket, according to <span style="font-style: italic;">FourFourTwo </span>magazine, while Roy Keane's own brand of champagne football at Portman Road can be seen for £1001 in Section D of the Cobbald Stand.</p>
              <p>Manchester United and Liverpool demand £931 and £785 respectively placing them sixth and ninth in the list, with QPR being the only other non-Premier League side in the top 10 with a ticket worth £699.</p>
              <p>Ipswich's ticket office attempted to justify the price for a side that spent much of last season struggling in the bottom half of the Championship.</p>
              <p>They told <span style="font-style: italic;">FourFourTwo</span>: 'Well, you get the best view, plus a bit more leg room.'</p>
              <p>At the other end of the scale, Barclays Premier League side Wigan's most expensive season pass is £295 - cheaper than at any other Premier League, Championship or League One side.</p>
              <p>According to Wigan, this is due to the proximity of many north-west clubs and with the town having a bigger rugby league following.</p>
              <p>The list has Accrington as the cheapest in the country, with their best seats selling for  £230 a year.</p>

              <p><strong>Manchester United topped the television money list for the 2009-10 Premier League season.</strong></p>
              <p>United's income of £52.996 million from broadcast rights was £167,000 more than title-winners Chelsea and was achieved by virtue of having the most matches broadcast live.</p>
              <p>United had 24 games screened, two more than Chelsea and one more than Arsenal, who finished third in the money table with £51.712 million.</p>
              <p>The league's richest club Manchester City finished fourth, one above their actual placing in the table, to secure £49.627 million with Champions League qualifiers Tottenham £167,000 behind having had two fewer (20) televised matches.</p>
              <p>Liverpool (£48 million) and Aston Villa (£45.9 million) made up the top seven, although the latter suffered from having just 16 live matches.</p>
              <p>Domestic broadcast revenue is separated into three parts for Premier League clubs: half is shared equally, 25% is paid in relation to their final position in the table and the remainder is based on how often the club is shown on television with each guaranteed a minimum of ten live games a season.</p>
              <p>All money received from overseas broadcast rights, sponsorship and licensing revenue is split equally (£10,122,612) between the 20 clubs.</p>
              <p>A Premier League spokesman said: "Selling our broadcast rights collectively, combined with the Premier League's distribution formulas, means that every pound generated centrally has an increased distributive effect both within the league and in relation to our external commitments.</p>
              <p>"This model, based on distributing revenue equitably and responsibly, has been the key factor in the growth of the league over the last 18 seasons. All money received through the sale of our broadcast rights in foreign territories is split equally amongst the 20 clubs.</p>
              <p>"This provides a platform for clubs to challenge in the competition, while rewarding investment and success."</p>
              <p>The three relegated clubs Burnley, Hull and Portsmouth received £33.8 million, £32.6 million and £31.8 million respectively. However, Pompey, currently in administration with debts around £135 million, are unlikely to see much of that.</p>
              <p>Television cash is distributed via a number of different instalments throughout the year and a £7 million payment in January was diverted by the Premier League to pay off clubs owed money by Portsmouth.</p>

              <p><span>The average price of the cheapest ticket at a Premier or Football League ground has risen from £19.01 to £21.24.</span></p>
              <p><span>FSF chairman Malcolm Clarke fears this will price younger fans out of watching live games.</span></p>
              <p><span>He said: 'There's a danger of alienation between fans and players at the top of the game. Younger fans in particular are being priced out and if they don't get the live football bug at a young age, they might not become season ticket-holders.</span></p>
              <p><span>'If you compare prices to other countries such as Germany, there are huge disparities. Season tickets at Borussia Dortmund start from €225 (£183), which includes three Champions League games - at about £8.90 per match - and free public transport. In comparison, our prices are simply unacceptable.</span></p>

              <div id="summary_highlights"><strong>UEFA have implemented their 'Financial Fair Play' rules. How will this affect Premier League clubs and football finances both in the Premiership and beyond?</strong></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 'Financial Fair Play' rule has been created by UEFA in order to bring some parity to football finances around Europe. The Premier League has introduced their own set of financial rules and clubs must be fully compliant by the 2012/13 season if they wish to participate in the UEFA Champions League or Europa League. Will the rules have the desired effect on football finances, Or will the "rampant commercialism" that UEFA President Michel Platini is so concerned about, persist?</p>
              <h3 class="dynamic">UEFA Financial Fair Play Rules</h3>
              <p>Opinion within European football was largely behind Michel Platini, when he stated that the current state of football finances represented a “danger to football”. The largest European clubs, often backed by rich benefactors or carrying vast amounts of debt, were not so convinced, but most spectators could see that changes were necessary.</p>
              <p>UEFA drew up their financial fair play guidelines and they have now been agreed and implemented by their executive committee. Some concessions were made to the leading clubs, including removing the ‘minimum turnover’ element (which would have left any club with a turnover less than 50 million euros exempt) and also phasing the rules in over 3 years. All clubs who wish to participate in European competition in the 2012/13 season must be fully compliant.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div class="body">
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>The rule itself states that clubs must provide detailed accounts each season, and must not run at a loss. This would include debt repayments, so significant borrowing linked to clubs will become extremely damaging. According to figures published via the Guardian newspaper, 14 Premier League Clubs would have breached this particular element of the rule during to 2008/09 season. Loans from benefactors or owners are also no longer allowed, at least not to cover wages or transfer fees. Owners may only purchase permanent shares in a club, and not loan funds.</p>
              <p>Investors will still be able to put money into a club for “long term projects”, this could include training facilities or stadium development for example. Loans must not be used for paying wages or the transfer of players. Although the rule came into effect in May 2010, owners are still able to invest for the forthcoming seasons. The ‘phasing in’ element of the rule, allows investment of up to 45 million euros during 2010. This figure reduces over 3 years until no additional funding is allowed in 2012/13 (Outside of long term projects). Failure to adhere to the guidelines will mean no UEFA license is granted, effectively banning the club from European competition.</p>
              <h3 class="dynamic">Impact on Football Finances</h3>
              <p>Michel Platini and UEFA are keen to stress that the rules are designed to “help, not hurt, football clubs”. The intention is to provide more of a level playing field, thus allowing competition to thrive. The Champions League qualification rules have already been amended to try and ensure different teams are competing throughout tournament. The curb on limitless spending is again designed to create genuine chances for all the qualifying clubs.</p>

              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>In essence the rules can be simplified into a short phrase - A club cannot spend more than it generates. That simple premise will actually please some Club Chairmen who were struggling to see how they could continue to compete. Many are concerned at the constant demands of the fans and the media for bigger spending and higher wages. The current economic climate has crippled many clubs who have large debts and there are signs that some form of normality is returning to football – Except in the case of Manchester City where the owners continue to pour millions of pounds into the club.</p>
              <p>The UEFA Financial Fair Play rule will have a significant impact on football finances and the way that Europe’s super rich club owners operate. Clubs who already comply with the rules have a head start on those where massive, unsustainable wages are being paid, or where huge debts have been linked to the businesses. While many Premier League clubs will be making adjustments, so to will the giants of Spain and Italy, as well as the emerging clubs in Russia and northern Europe where oligarchs have been investing heavily of late. With Champions League qualification still representing the most lucrative opportunity for domestic football clubs, all will be striving to ensure they meet the financial fair play rules.</p>
