              <h2>Error-prone Tottenham goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes, who gave away
              another goal today as Fulham beat Spurs 2-1 at Craven Cottage, has been
              backed by manager Harry Redknapp.</h2>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/33304_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="231"></p>
              <p>Harry Redknapp has said he will stand by blundering Brazilian
              Heurelho Gomes, despite the goalkeeper having contributed to the
              manager’s first defeat as Tottenham manager by gifting Fulham their
              first goal with another howler.</p>
              <p>Fulham beat Spurs 2-1 at Craven Cottage, sending their London rivals
              back into the bottom three of the Barclays Premier League. Fulham's win
              lifted them up to ninth, but they were helped on their way by Gomes.</p>
              <p>He let a cross from Simon Davies slip through his fingers and into the net.</p>
              <p>Gomes stood no chance when Andrew Johnson netted Fulham’s second,
              and although substitute Fraizer Campbell scored a late consolation for
              Spurs, the damage had been done.</p>
              <p>It was Tottenham's first defeat in seven games since Redknapp took
              over, but the ex-Portsmouth manager insisted he would be sticking with
              Gomes.</p>
              <p>"It was a disappointing day," admitted Redknapp. "We started in
              second gear and suddenly looked like we were getting into the game
              until we gifted them a goal.</p>
              <p>"It was a farcical goal, but he's my goalkeeper. He's got to do the job. This is the situation I have.</p>
              <p>"I have Gomes and another goalkeeper, a Spanish lad who is 37, and then you have kids.</p>
              <p>"Gomes is the first-team goalkeeper. His record at PSV Eindhoven
              tells you he was a world-class goalkeeper. He made some great saves
              after the goal, so I have got to keep believing in him and stay with
              him.</p>
              <p>"The goalkeeping coach has got to work with him. I always think
              goalkeepers and their coaches have a special relationship and he's got
              to get into his head this week.</p>
              <p>"Fulham started sharper than we did and deserved the win. Their
              front two of Bobby Zamora and Andrew Johnson were excellent. They gave
              us problems.</p>
              <p>"I brought Aaron Lennon on to try and give us some width but things
              didn't happen for us today. We also look vulnerable from corners at the
              moment which is a problem."</p>

              Redknapp is only saying that becos he is not able to buy another keeper for time being.  Come Jan, he will buy another keeper or get someone to replace Gomes.  Watching him is a comical fella, he is so tall and big, but he can let the ball past his hands as if he has butter coated on the gloves.  
              
              To let in stupid goals like this is really demoralising.

              <h2 id="ctl00_ctl00_Full_Main_Main_stcArticleBodyNew_hHeader" class="football">Harry warning for Gomes</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.setantasports.com/upload/Sport/Football/2008-2009/Prem/tottenham/gomes_down.jpg" alt="" width="356" height="190"></p>
              <p><strong>Tottenham chief Harry Redknapp has warned blunder keeper Heurelho Gomes to get used to an aerial bombardment. </strong></p>
              <p>Gomes has not impressed since joining Spurs
              from PSV Eindhoven in the summer and his stock plummeted at the weekend
              following the blunder which gifted Fulham their opening goal at Craven
              Cottage.</p>
              <p>The keeper somehow let a Simon Davies effort squirm through his grasp and into the net, as Fulham went on to claim a 2-1 win.</p>
              <p>With a lack of options, Redknapp is likely to keep faith with the Brazilian and he has warned Gomes to get used to the pressure.</p>
              <p>“Fulham put four players into the goalmouth
              at every corner, blocked it up and made it difficult for Gomes,” said
              the Spurs chief.</p>
              <p>“He’s going to get plenty more of that. He’s going to get targeted and it’s up to him to deal with it.</p>
              <p>“He took a bang in the mouth against Liverpool on Wednesday which didn’t help but that’s no excuse. He made a bad mistake.”</p>
