              <h1 class="storyTitle" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-size: 2.8em;">Premier League: Defoe stars, Rovers win away</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jermain Defoe hit five goals in the second-half, as <strong>Tottenham</strong> hammered <strong>Wigan</strong> 9-1 on Sunday afternoon. The England striker was in fine form as Spurs
              climbed back into fourth place in the Premier League, but Wigan's
              inconsistent performances continue.</p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2009/1122/jermainedefoe20091122_275x155.jpg" border="0" alt="Jermain Defoe" width="275" height="155">

              <p class="photoDesc">Jermain Defoe smashed a seven-minute hat-trick</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Peter Crouch opened the scoring with a stooping header inside ten
              minutes, then Defoe scored his first two goals within three minutes of
              each other just after half-time to put Spurs three up. Paul Scharner
              got one back, in controversial circumstances as he clearly used his
              hand to control the ball before lashing past Gomes and into the roof of
              the net.</p>
              <p>However, Defoe restored the three-goal cushion with his
              hat-trick straight
              away from an Aaron Lennon cross and the winger added the fifth himself.
              Defoe then capped off proceedings by bagging his fourth and fifth late
              on - leaping ahead of Fernando Torres at the top of the Premier League
              goalscoring charts in the process.</p>
              <p>David
              Bentley's free-kick and Niko Kranjcar added the final blows in an
              incredible game that piles pressure onto Wigan boss Roberto Martinez.</p>
              <p><strong>Blackburn</strong> ended a run of ten successive defeats on the road by beating <strong>Bolton </strong>2-0 and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=269793&amp;cc=4716">gave a welcome boos</a>t
              to the absent Sam Allardyce in the process. Allardyce is scheduled to
              have surgery on a heart condition and missed the derby against the club
              he played for and managed.</p>
              <p>His team did him proud though with
              influential midfielder David Dunn capping a superb performance by
              making the breakthrough. Bolton's misery was complete when full-back
              Sam Ricketts scored a bizarre own goal in the second half</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A team that won chelsea 3-1 lost to tottenham 9-1.... OMG!!!</p>

              <p>The defenders are more at fault than Kirkland. They offered him little protection.</p>
              <p>Hope this will go on to boost Spurs' confidence to do well consistently for the rest of the campaign. A top-4 finish is not impossible!</p>
              <p>By the way i watched this match live last night, and it was history in the making. I believe it's the 2nd highest winning margin in the history of the premier league, after Man Utd's 9-0 demolition of ipswich around a decade ago. Defoe also joined Andy Cole and Alan Shearer as the 3rd player ever to hit 5 goals in a single match.</p>
              <p>When the camera zoomed into Harry Redknapp's face after the 8th or 9th goal went in, he looked almost too embarassed to celebrate with his staffs.</p>

              <p>Wigan Athletic's playing staff have offered
              to reimburse the entrance fees for all supporters who travelled to
              White Hart Lane to witness their 9-1 destruction at the hands of
              Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday.</p>

              <p>Spurs
              equalled the record for goals scored in a Premier League game when
              producing a ruthless second-half performance, with Jermain Defoe
              scoring five goals to equal the record jointly held by Andy Cole and
              Alan Shearer.</p>
              <p>After suffering such acute embarrassment, Wigan's
              players will now personally refund the admission price paid by every
              Latics supporter who attended the game in North London.</p>
              <p>"We
              feel that as a group of players we badly let down our supporters
              yesterday (Sunday), and this is a gesture we have to make and pay them
              back for their tremendous loyalty," Melchiot told the club's official
              website.</p>
              <p>"There's not a lot else to say, just that as a group of
              professionals we were embarrassed by the way we performed. We feel it
              was below our standard and this is something we feel we owe to the fans.</p>
              <p>"Now
              we have to draw a line under the game, focus completely on training
              this week and bounce back on Saturday. We are professionals, we will
              take it on the chin and move on, but it's important that we do not take
              our supporters for granted."</p>
              <p>Wigan manager Roberto Martinez said
              after the game: "It was unacceptable and unexpected. The way we
              defended in key moments was not good enough. I am embarrassed as it's a
              result we don't want to be associated with. We need to move on quickly
              and give a good reaction in the next game."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Tottenham Hotspur's remarkable 9-1 victory over Wigan Athletic was
              the second biggest victory since the formation of the Premier League in
              1992/93.</p>
              <p>Only Manchester United have bettered that score with their 9-0 thrashing of Ipswich Town in March 1995.</p>

              Â 
              </div>
              <p>Spurs' result was all the more remarkable as they were only 1-0
              up at half-time, making them the first team to score eight goals in one
              half.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.premierleague.com/page/PlayerProfile/0,,12306%7E8915,00.html">Jermain Defoe</a> joined <a href="http://www.premierleague.com/page/PlayerProfile/0,,12306%7E5891,00.html">Andy Cole</a> and <a href="http://www.premierleague.com/page/PlayerProfile/0,,12306%7E5962,00.html">Alan Shearer</a> as the only players to score five goals in a Premier League match.</p>
              <p>However the Tottenham Hotspur striker is out on his own as the only man to net five in one half.</p>
              <p>Shearer was the last man to hit five in one match. He achieved the
              feat in Newcastle United's 8-0 win at home to Sheffield Wednesday in
              September 1999.</p>
              <p>Cole became the first player to register five goals in a Premier
              League fixture when he enjoyed a field day against Ipswich Town in
              March 1995.</p>
              <p>That 9-0 scoreline at Old Trafford remains the biggest win in Premier League history.</p>
              <p>Here we look back at the top five victories.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="clubBold">Man Utd 9-0 Ipswich</div>
              <p>This Old Trafford fixture in March 1995 looked an obvious home win -
              but no-one could have foreseen the Premier League record scoreline.</p>
              <p>Manchester United went into the match three points behind
              leaders Blackburn Rovers while George Burley's Ipswich Town side were
              second from bottom and eight points adrift of safety.</p>
              <p>Roy Keane opened the scoring on 15 minutes before Andy Cole
              hit a classic hat-trick, netting three in succession after 19, 37 and
              53 minutes.</p>
              <p>Mark Hughes made it 5-0 two minutes later and quickly added his second before Cole got his fourth on 65 minutes.</p>
              <p>Paul Ince made it 8-0 with 18 minutes remaining and Cole rounded
              off an astonishing afternoon with his fifth three minutes from time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="clubBold">Spurs 9-1 Wigan</div>
              <p>With the score 1-0 at half time at White Hart Lane, you would have
              been forgiven for thinking this match was going to be decided by the
              odd goal.</p>
              <p>But after the break, a rampant Spurs side emerged from the dressing
              room, putting a further eight goals past Wigan goalkeeper Chris
              Kirkland, who would later be praised for making a string of fine saves
              that prevented the scoreline from being even greater.</p>
              <p>After Peter Crouch netted the opener in the first half, his strike
              partner Jermain Defoe scored five goals in the second period, the only
              player to do that in a match since Alan Shearer for Newcastle United in
              1999. The former West Ham man scored his first three goals in seven
              minutes the second fastest hat-trick in Premier League history, as
              Harry Redknapp's side cruised to their biggest win for 32 years.</p>
              <p>The victory sent ambitious Spurs fourth, to the Champions League
              qualification places and level on points with local rivals Arsenal.</p>
              <p>The returning Aaron Lennon was to prove majorly influential, setting
              up three of the home side's goals and netting one of his own, with
              Kirkland also on the score-sheet for an own goal, and Niko Kranjcar
              putting the icing on the cake with a ninth on 90 minutes.</p>
              <p>Paul Scharner had pulled one back for the Latics near the hour mark, but it was little more than a consolation. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="clubBold">Newcastle 8-0 Sheff Wed</div>
              <p>Bobby Robson could not have wished for a better first home match as
              Newcastle United manager as his rampant side rattled in eight without
              reply at home to Sheffield Wednesday in September 1999.</p>
              <p>With his side out to impress the new manager, they ended a run of 14
              successive Premiership matches without victory in emphatic style.</p>
              <p>Talismanic captain Alan Shearer scored a first-half hat-trick in 11 minutes, before adding two more in the second half.</p>
              <p>Defender Aaron Hughes scored the opener at St James' Park after just
              12 minutes, to get Robson's return to the club off to a flyer.</p>
              <p>Shearer had the impressive Kieron Dyer to thank for his super quick
              hat-trick, with the England man proving the creative force in the
              Magpies' midfield.</p>
              <p>And as the second half started in much the same vein as the first,
              Dyer was rewarded for his troubles, getting a fifth goal early on, with
              Gary Speed making it six 12 minutes from time.</p>
              <p>But there was still so much more to come from the home side, with
              Shearer adding another two to his tally in the last nine minutes to
              complete a remarkable afternoon on Tyneside.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="clubBold">Nottingham Forest 1-8 Man Utd</div>
              <p>Had it not have been for the introduction of super-sub Ole Gunnar
              Solskjaer, this match may well have ended a mere 4-1 to the away side.</p>
              <p>After first-choice strike pair Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole had each
              netted a brace, Solskjaer came on to put his own stamp on the match,
              scoring four times as Manchester United produced a magnificent
              Premiership record away win.</p>
              <p>Yorke had put the visitors ahead after just 85 seconds, before Alan Rogers had equalised for Nottingham Forest on six minutes.</p>
              <p>But Ron Atkinson's men were shown what life in the top-flight is all
              about when Andy Cole first restored the Red Devils' lead straight from
              the restart, and then extended it just minutes after the break, netting
              the rebound after Forest keeper' Dave Besant had saved a shot from
              Yorke.</p>
              <p>Yorke's second came midway through the second half, slotting home
              into an empty net after Jon Olav Hjelde had inadvertently diverted
              Jesper Blomqvist's low cross onto his own post.</p>
              <p>Solskjaer replaced Yorke on 71 minutes and an already one-sided
              match became a rout. By the first minute of stoppage time, the
              Norwegian had sealed his hat-trick, before adding a fourth with just
              seconds remaining.</p>
              <p>The result left Forest rooted to the bottom of the league, while Sir
              Alex Ferguson's United marched on to win the Premier League title among
              an historic treble of trophies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="clubBold">Middlesbrough 8-1 Man City</div>
              <p>Middlesbrough ended the 2007/08 season in some style, putting eight
              goals past Manchester City on what was to be the Blues' manager
              Sven-Goran Eriksson's last match in charge.</p>
              <p>Neither side had much to play for, with Middlesbrough already safe
              from relegation and City unable to reach the UEFA Cup qualifying places.</p>
              <p>But that did not stop Gareth Southgate's men from giving their home
              fans a delightful memory to help get them through the long,
              football-free summer months.</p>
              <p>Riverside hero Stewart Downing fired home a 16th-minute penalty
              after Richard Dunne was sent off for bringing down Tuncay Sanli, with
              Afonso Alves slotting home the second from 14 yards eight minutes
              before the break.</p>
              <p>A superb volley with the outside of his left foot from Downing,
              another strike from Alves, a deflected long-range effort from Adam
              Johnson, Fabio Rochemback's 30-yard free-kick and a goal from Jeremie
              Aliadiere were followed by a consolation for Elano before Alves
              completed his hat-trick.</p>

              <p><strong>Wigan Athletic's players are to refund fans' tickets for Sunday's humiliating 9-1 reverse at Tottenham.</strong> </p>
              <p>A White Hart Lane horror show saw Roberto Martinez's side endure the proverbial run-around in the capital. </p>
              <p>Having had time to assess their performance in North London, Wigan's players have come to the decision to refund their travelling supporters. </p>
              <p>Captain Mario Melchiot accepts the level of their performance was unacceptable and hopes this gesture at least partially atones for such a heavy defeat. </p>
              <p>"We feel that as a group of players we badly let down our supporters yesterday, and this is a gesture we have to make and pay them back for their tremendous loyalty," read a statement from Melchiot on the club's official website. </p>
              <p>"There is not a lot else to say, just that as a group of professionals we were embarrassed by the way we performed, we feel it was below our standards and this is something we feel we owe to the fans. </p>
              <p>"Now we have to draw a line under the game, focus completely on training this week and bounce back on Saturday. </p>
              <p>"We are professionals, we will take it on the chin and move on but it's important that we do not take our supporters for granted."</p>
