Andriy has always been my first choice for Chelsea since I arrived.

I guess he thought that this would be his last contract so might as well get as much as possible otherwise after his playing days are over, where to get this kind of money weekly?<br><br>Whatever it is, he is made for the next 3 yrs regardless he plays well or not, stay at chelsea or not. cos his contract cover him for another 2 yrs plus.
