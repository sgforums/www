              <p>Barcelona all but secured their spot in the Champions League 
              semi-finals and a probable showdown with arch rivals Real Madrid after 
              building a huge 5-1 first-leg lead over Shakhtar Donetsk.</p>
              <p>Following
               on from Madrid's 4-0 thumping of Tottenham, Barca appear to have done 
              all the hard work in their home quarter-final tie after another 
              memorable European night at the Nou Camp.</p>
              <p>Andres Iniesta, Dani 
              Alves, Gerard Pique, Seydou Keita and Xavi were on the mark for the 
              Catalan giants, while Shakhtar's sole reply came from Yaroslav Rakitskiy
               when they were already 3-0 down.</p>
              <p>Barca coach Pep Guardiola had 
              admitted he had a bad feeling about this match, but his fears will have 
              been eased after seeing his take the lead after just 99 seconds through 
              new father Iniesta.</p>
              <p>The Spanish World Cup winner, whose wife gave 
              birth on Sunday, slotted a low shot past visiting goalkeeper Andrei 
              Pyatov at his near post after picking up a loose ball in the area.</p>
              <p>However, 10 minutes after that goal, Barca survived two huge scares in quick succession as they rode their luck at the back.</p>
              <p>The
               first opportunity saw Luiz Adriano beat stand-in Barca centre-back 
              Sergio Busquets to a through-ball but then fire wide with only Victor 
              Valdes to beat.</p>
              <p>Then, just moments later, a bad attempted 
              back-pass from Dani Alves forced Valdes to race out of his goal and, 
              although he beat Luiz Adriano to the ball, his clearance went straight 
              to Willian whose first-time shot from 30 yards out dropped just wide of 
              an open net.</p>
              <p>Barca survived though and almost profited from some 
              slack defending themselves in the 19th minute, as Messi robbed Mykola 
              Ischenko of possession on the edge of the Shakhtar area but his 
              attempted chip over Pyatov was saved.</p>
              <p>Barca, who also went close 
              through a Messi free-kick and a David Villa shot, were celebrating a 
              second goal soon enough though as Alves netted after latching onto an 
              inch-perfect pass by Iniesta.</p>
              <p>Iniesta's lofted ball in towards the
               penalty spot might have been collected by Pyatov but, as the goalkeeper
               waited for the ball, Alves nipped in to steal possession before 
              slotting into an empty goal.</p>
              <p>That was the score Barca led by at 
              half-time, but the 2006 and 2009 European champions wasted no time in 
              trying to build on that advantage at the start of the second period.</p>
              <p>Messi
               and Xavi both had efforts saved before Guardiola's side made it 3-0 in 
              the 53rd minute through Pique following a training-ground move.</p>
              <p>Xavi
               cut a low corner back towards the edge of the area to meet the run of 
              Pique, who had escaped his marker, and the Spain centre-back's 
              first-time shot took a deflection off Rakitskiy before beating the 
              wrong-footed Pyatov.</p>
              <p>At that point Barca looked to be cruising 
              into the semi-finals but Shakhtar gave themselves a glimmer of hope 
              after netting an away goal in the 58th minute, with Rakitskiy making the
               decisive touch at the right end this time.</p>
              <p>Darijo Srna's 
              free-kick into the area was flicked on by Rakitskiy at the near post and
               Valdes was unable to keep the ball out as it flew into the far side of 
              the goal.</p>
              <p>Shakhtar's hope was short-lived however as Barca immediately went down the other end and restored their three-goal lead.</p>
              <p>Messi
               beat his man before rolling a pass across the edge of the area to the 
              unmarked Keita, who slammed an unstoppable shot into the near top corner
               of the net.</p>
              <p>Barca survived another let-off with nine minutes 
              remaining when Luiz Adriano struck the inside of the far post, and if 
              that had gone it in would have made for an interesting second leg.</p>
              <p>However,
               the ball stayed out and Barca all but killed the tie off by notching a 
              fifth goal in the 86th minute when Xavi slotted in Alves' pass.</p>
