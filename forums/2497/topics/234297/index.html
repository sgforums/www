            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/sp3_28_01.jpg"><br><br><strong>JOHN TERRY will NOT quit Chelsea over Jose Mourinho's internal war with the Stamford Bridge hierarchy.</strong><br><br>The Blues' inspirational skipper is adamant that he will put pen to paper on a new Â£120,000-a-week deal with the Champions Â— no matter what happens. Terry is a huge fan of boss Mourinho and has offered vocal support during the recent in-fighting at Stamford Bridge involving owner Roman Abramovich and the board.<br><br>But he has also told club officials and friends that he will sign his lucrative new contract regardless of what the future holds for Mourinho. One close pal revealed: "JT is going nowhere and he's been quick to make the situation clear. "He loves Chelsea and he'll prove that by signing a new contract shortly.<br><br>"Of course he wants Mourinho to stay Â— Jose made John club captain and has since led the club to brilliant back-to-back Premiership titles but if Mourinho goes there's no way John would follow."<br><br>The news will come as something of an embarrassment to Mourinho, who claimed that Terry would only sign if he was staying in control. After clinching a place in the Carling Cup final last week, Mourinho said: "Terry has told me that it would be very difficult for him to play for anyone else.<br><br>"He wanted to play for me until the end of his career. He accepts my football philosophy and that makes him comfortable. "He came to me and asked if I will be here next season because he wanted to know before he signed his new contract. My answer was Â‘I think so.'"<br><br>But our man added: "That was Mourinho playing mind games. John did have a chat with him and asked him if the rumours about him leaving were true. "Mourinho told John he wanted to stay and that was just what JT wanted to hear. But the bottom line is that he was going to sign anyway. He's Chelsea through and through."<br><br>Terry has missed nine matches after back surgery but could play a part in today's FA Cup fourth round home clash with Nottingham Forest. He's hoping to go one better than 2000 when he was stuck on the bench as Chelsea beat Boro 1-0 in the final.<br><br></div>

But Mourinho, asked if he is confident he will still be in charge at the end of the season, told BBC1: "I don't have to be confident. I have a contract that runs until 2010, and that's a very important thing.<br><br>"I am manager today and until the end of the season and I believe I will be manager until 2010," he said, just before Chelsea's FA Cup fourth-round tie at home to Nottingham Forest. Mourinho is aware that a string of potential successors at Stamford Bridge is being discussed in the media but is adamant he is not being unsettled by the speculation.<br><br>He said: "If I believe, from what I read in the press, there are contenders - but I don't get influenced by the press. The players feel I am the same - same desire, same commitment." Pressed on the constant talk of disharmony between himself and Abramovich, Mourinho told BBC's Gary Lineker: "The only thing I can tell you 100% is everyone at this club wants to win. So when I read a few things suggesting we are not on the same side, it's completely untrue. We all want to win.<br><br>"Yes we [he and Abramovich] speak. He speaks to me and to (chief executive) Peter Kenyon. "Roman is not in London for quite a long time. But he is chairman of this club and he doesn't have to give any explanations about his personal life - and when he is back (in London) he is always welcome in our space, in our dressing room."<br><br></div>

Terry won't leave chelsea cos its his home club. If jose left and he was to follow, he won't get the same respect whichever club he goes to, he will just be another foreign player to the club.<br><br>Right now he is like the boss on the field. He is well respected and like by the fans and Whichever coach comes in he will still get the respect but if he goes, he will lose all of this<br><br>Moreover, no club in europe would be willing to pay $120 - $150 thousand pounds a week for a defender cos he is no Beck, there won't be any or much returns trying to market him.</div>

Â“It would be very difficult to be a manager here after what IÂ’ve done.Â” A host of top names have been linked with the Blues following a stormy month of fall-outs.<br><br>But after leading his men into the FA Cup fifth round, Mourinho insisted Roberto Mancini and Co would be wasting their time trying to emulate him at Stamford Bridge. He added: Â“I know there are 11 or 12 names on the list to replace me. But I am coping well in this situation. The players can be my witnesses for that.<br><br>Â“I have a contract that runs until 2010 and thatÂ’s a very important thing.
