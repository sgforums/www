              <p><strong>New deal for Bale</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Gareth Bale has signed a new four-and-a-half year contract at Tottenham.</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/media/ALeqM5jYaz2WAVSbChSJiZJW8jNrGJv7yg?docId=N0099641300555573210A&amp;size=s2" alt="" width="186" height="186"></p>
              <p>The
               21-year-old winger has earned a global reputation this season after 
              some outstanding displays in the Champions League, highlighted by his 
              hat-trick against Inter Milan at the San Siro.</p>
              <p>Manager Harry 
              Redknapp told the club's website: "It's great to have Gareth sign a new 
              contract at the club. He is a fantastic player and the type of player we
               need to be keeping at Spurs. Gareth is now one of the top left sided 
              players in the world, he really is an amazing talent and can only get 
              better. He is a smashing lad as well which is equally as important."</p>
              <p>Bale's
               achievements have led a host of European clubs, led by Inter, to cast 
              admiring glances in his direction, but Redknapp has been adamant he is 
              not for sale - a position strengthened by the new deal.</p>
              <p>"He has got his whole future ahead and he has everything going for him," Redknapp added.</p>
              <p>The
               Wales international joined Spurs from Southampton at the age of 17, and
               has since made 112 appearances, scoring 17 goals. Most of those have 
              come since he moved forward from his original left-back position to play
               on the wing, a switch that rejuvenated his career which at once stage 
              appeared stalled as he struggled for a place in the side.</p>
              <p>"I am 
              enjoying my football at Tottenham. I want us to keep going forward as a 
              team and hopefully we can achieve big things," Bale said.</p>
              <p>"We have
               got a great squad that is still young and we are going places. It is 
              great to commit to this club and hopefully we can achieve what we 
              believe we can with this squad. The players want what the fans want, and
               performing in front of these fans is a special experience.</p>
              <p>"I 
              definitely believe we can challenge for a title very soon. That is why I
               have signed. Every year as a minimum we are aiming to qualify for the 
              Champions League so we are definitely going in the right direction.</p>
              <p>"We
               have proven in the Champions League this season that we can compete 
              with the best and we are in the last eight now and there is no reason we
               can't go further this season and in years to come."</p>
