Rafa BenitezÂ’s men topped the Fair Play table last season after managing to avoid a single red card in the Premier League. But the Merseysiders came out swinging during SundayÂ’s bad-tempered friendly with Feyenoord in Rotterdam.</strong><br><br>Nine players were booked and the game ended with a 20-man brawl. Hot-head Steven Gerrard was lucky not to be sent off for slapping Feyenoord defender Theo Lucius during the melee. Alonso, who was cautioned for his role in the bust-up, insists Liverpool have to stand up for themselves if they want to end their 17-year title drought.<br><br>He said: Â“We are a team and we face a lot of things from the opposition and whatever might happen we have to try to deal with it all together. Â“I donÂ’t think itÂ’s a case of being the cavalry when a team-mate gets involved in something Â— it just means we should not pull out of a situation. Â“We must be aggressive and not let sides create chances against us, not by kicking but by being strong as a group.Â”<br><br>Boss Benitez says winger Harry Kewell should be fit for the new season. The Aussie star hobbled off during the second half against Feyenoord, sparking fears that he had aggravated the foot injury which restricted him to just three games as a sub last season. But Benitez insists the 28-year-old will be ready for SaturdayÂ’s league opener at Aston Villa. He added: Â“We were protecting him by taking him off against Feyenoord. HeÂ’ll be fine for Saturday.Â”<br><br>Skipper Gerrard is relishing taking centre stage in LiverpoolÂ’s bid to bring the Premier League crown to Anfield. He has played much of the pre-season in his favoured position at the heart of the midfield, after two seasons largely on the flanks. Gerrard said: Â“The manager knows thatÂ’s where I want to play and IÂ’ll get my chance in the middle. Â“ThatÂ’s where I believe I have the most to offer for the team. Â“WeÂ’ve trained hard and want get off to a flier at Villa.Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it's lucky for Liverpool that Gerrard isn't sent off. Or else next season they'll be really struggling at the opening few matches.<br><br>I think many will disagree but i think Liverpoo lose spark lwithout Gerrard.<br><br>Cheers.<br>CK</div>
