              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ARSENE WENGER tried to rally grumpy Arsenal fans by telling them: At least we're not like Liverpool.</h2>
              <p>The Emirates boss is under fire after his side's run of four games without a win saw them slump to seventh in the table.</p>
              <p>Gunners have gone eight years without winning the Premier League and six years with no silverware at all.</p>
              <p>But Wenger hit back by taunting rivals Liverpool, who have not lifted the title since 1990.</p>
              <p>He said: "I don't look at the table. Never. It's very tight, it's like that.</p>
              <p>"We are in January and it can happen that we are seventh. But we are in a competition with Liverpool, who have not won the league for 22 years.</p>
              <p>"You have always to be humble and fight hard and support your team.</p>
              <p>"I believe that we have played some great football this season and we have to focus on that. Football is a happy moment where people come together to watch the team they love.</p>
              <p>"I am here to make all of the fans happy and when I do not manage to do it I am, of course, not happy.</p>
              <p>"What is most important is that we have our fans happy at the end of the season.</p>
              <p>"I know it is always a depressed job to judge the immediate situation, but we have a longer target — to go until May with a determined attitude with belief.</p>
              <p>"Overall I feel this team is strong mentally. We are ready for a fight and that is the most important thing."</p>
              <p>Arsenal have never failed to qualify for the Champions League, But they face Blackburn today five points adrift of fourth-placed Chelsea and a massive 12 behind bitter North London rivals Tottenham.</p>
              <p>The Frenchman added: "It is a worry because nobody guarantees you will be in the Champions League.</p>
              <p>"Nobody has been in it more than us. We have played 15 years on the trot in the Champions League and we play AC Milan in the last 16 in 10 days' time.</p>
              <p>"My wish is that the next 16 years will be exactly the same for the club and the fans will be happy."</p>
              <p>Wenger also blasted the Emirates boo-boys who have targeted Andrey Arshavin.</p>

              Arsenal is totally depended on Robin VP's form and goal to stay in the top10 of the table.
              
              At least Liverpool's game is not depended on specific player only.

              <p>Wenger is good in converting low price player into star player.</p>
              <p>But, asking him to buy a expensive player is not his practise.</p>
              <p>It is his frugal way that arsenal manage to keep their debt low.</p>
              <p>The fan have to recognise this point before they boo him off.</p>
              <p>It is not forgetting that Arsenal is performing well in CL before the AC Milan defeat.</p>
              <p>They are still affected by the defeat in San Siro stadium so they did not have any energy left to fight Sunderland.</p>
              <p>The only manager that will be removed at the moment is AVB and possible Ah Ken.</p>

              <p>Removing Wenger could be Arsenal's biggest mistake. The reason being Arsenal are doing really great these past few years in the accounts part of the club... They have risen to become the second most profitable English club and No.5 in Europe.</p>
              <p>So it depends on how you look at it, If their board are only looking at profits, Wenger has done wonders, despite no titles. If people think Moyes ca do the same, better think again... Cos Moyes hasn't done anything like Wenger, bringing in young or even youth players and develop them over the years and eventually can be sold for $20 to $30m kind.</p>
              <p>Moyes style is to get the average players or better than average but their age are mostly into their late twenties with no really aftersale value later...</p>
              <p>So if the Arsenal board are going to continue their minimum spending policy, Wenger is the only man for them... Anyone else could take them out of the top 4.</p>

                              <p>Wenger is good in converting low price player into star

              <p>But, asking him to buy a expensive player is not his

              <p>It is his frugal way that arsenal manage to keep their debt

              <p>It is not forgetting that Arsenal is performing well in CL

              <p>They are still affected by the defeat in San Siro stadium so
              they did not have any energy left to fight Sunderland.</p>
              <p>The only manager that will be removed at the moment is AVB and

              like zocoss said wenger is perfect if the club is only after profits.  but then a football club that wins nothing is nothing to fans.  after all its the fans that gives the clubs their revenue.
              
              i just wonder how much longer arsenal fans can take it.
              
              dalglish and AVB obviously cmi too.

              <p>The threat of Wenger is two direction - from his fans and his players.</p>
              <p>RVP should be leaving Arsenal if they do not buy any more good players.</p>
              <p>But, sacking Wenger would not solve the problem as Arsenal is still having a youth team.</p>
              <p>It would be impossible for the new manager to do miracle with the present team with no funds injected.</p>
              <p>If the owners wanted for cup glory, they would have sacked Wenger and buy new players.</p>
              <p>I believe the owners would still retain him as he is still making money for the club.</p>
              <p>Arsenal would remain the top team but misses for the titles and cup competition.</p>

              <p>Arsenal is actually a very well run club. They are being self-sustaining which is very important in today's game as even having a rich owner in future may not be totally good due to the Uefa's fair play rule.</p>
              <p>I recalled they were about almost $300m in debts when their stadium first completed. But today i think it's about $100m left... That's a lot to bring down in just a few short years. They don't have a rich owner or a company who is clearing their debts for them like Chelsea and Liverpool so that they can spend whatever profit they generate... They are only depending on themselves... Imagine if they had not been holding back and splash the cash season after season, their debts today could still be $300m or more like what Pool were under G&amp;H. And big money players also come with big salaries don't forget...</p>
              <p>So, i think the time will come when they start to comeback into the top again but for now, due to their debts, I think it's impossible to see them going for the title. But they have been in the top 4 for as long as i can remember since Wenger came, so can't fault him too much.</p>
              <p>As i say, they are a very well run club. But i am not too sure is it by choice or because they have no other option... Their disadvantage is having too many shareholders and directors with a different agendas in the last few years... Some are only there to make money, some are waiting for their share value to continue to go up before cashing in... And some are only waiting to reap the end rewards... No one seems seriously interested in wanting to win trophies or titles like what we see from City and Pool's new owners. Only Wenger and that Russian shareholder who unfortunately has no say in how the club is run as the current directors have block him out...</p>
              <p>Like i have always said, in order for Arsenal to do well again, a new owner or a single owner must be in place... In other words, it has to start from the board level.</p>

              Liverpool won the carling up again on penalty shootout.
              They won the fa cup against west ham and cl against ac Milan on penalty shootouts too right?
              Always so lucky!!!

              <p>Well, have to say full marks to Mr Wenger for getting his facts right though...</p>
              <p>A 4th place finish is definitely far better than winning the Carling cup... or even together with the FA cup.</p>
              <p>The money generated from qualifying alone is probably more than winning both domestic cups. Somemore you get to play against the best of Europe...</p>
              <p>Arsenal definitely need to keep Mr Wenger.</p>
