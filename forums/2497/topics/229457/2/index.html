Jewell is desperate to strengthen his squad following a seventh successive Premiership defeat that has plunged the club into the relegation reckoning. He said: "The offer has been accepted by the club, we're now waiting for the player to say yes or no."<br><br>The Latics boss has been frustrated in his attempts to bolster his squad and halt Wigan's slide down the table, which culminated in Sunday's 2-0 defeat at the hands of Everton.<br><br>Jewell revealed: "If there is a team that has tried to get more players, made more phone calls, had more meetings and been let down more than we have then I would like to know who they are.<br><br>"The last three weeks have been unbelievable because we have got close to getting players in on so many occasions, only for them to fall through for differing reasons."<br><br>Fulham signed Diop from Lens in July 2004 for an undisclosed fee but injuries have limited him to only 13 Premiership appearances for the Cottagers this season. He signed a contract extension last April to keep him at Craven Cottage until 2009 after being linked with Arsenal and Juventus.<br><br></div>

Last week, the Hammers made a Â£4m offer for Upson, which was turned down because Birmingham boss Steve Bruce feared his departure would send "negative vibes" through the club. And Bruce has made it clear it will take a "mega bucks" offer for him to allow Upson, who has 18 months left on his contract, to leave before the summer.<br><br>Bruce has confirmed his interest in Sheffield Wednesday defender Madjid Bougherra although there has been no formal bid for the Algerian international. "I spoke to their manager a week or so ago about a couple of their players and Bougherra was mentioned but that's as far as it has gone," he added.<br><br></div>

The Welsh international midfielder, 27, was deemed surplus to requirements at Goodison Park and is keen to get started on a deal that runs until 2010.<br><br>"The style of play that manager Chris Coleman has developed here will suit my game," he told the club's website. Davies joined Everton from Tottenham for Â£3.5m in May 2005 and has made 53 appearances, scoring a solitary goal in a spell hindered by injuries.<br><br>"I'm really happy to have joined Fulham as Chris is a manager I know and admire very much," added Davies. "I've wanted to come back to London for a while now so it's a good move for me, and I'm eager to train hard and contribute as much as I can to the rest of the season's campaign."<br></div>
