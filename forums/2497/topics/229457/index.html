Arsenal, Liverpool and Aston Villa have all been linked with Young, 21.<br><br>Boothroyd said: Â“I have had three Premiership clubs on the phone making verbal bids for Ashley Young, but I have turned them all down. Â“As it stands, I absolutely do not see him leaving this month.<br><br>Â“But tomorrow, Ashley might come up to me and say Â‘IÂ’ve had enough.Â’ But he is not daft and he knows this is the best place for him to be. Â“If and when the time is right, and he wants to go, he will go. But the price has to be right.Â”<br><br>Watford are rock bottom of the Premiership but Young has still sparkled this season. And Boothroyd is hoping to add more firepower to his threadbare squad after bidding for three players himself yesterday.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>SOUTHAMPTON</strong> are prepared to make Gareth Bale their highest paid player after turning down bids from Spurs and Manchester United.<br><br>Wales left-back Bale, 17, will be handed a new deal until 2009. Saints dismissed TottenhamÂ’s Â£3million bid before rejecting UnitedÂ’s Â£5m offer.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>SPANISH midfielder Ivan Campo</strong>, 32, will not quit Bolton for Athletic Bilbao. His agent Miguel Angel Cermeno said: Â“He has no intention of leaving.Â”<br><br><strong>TORE ANDRE FLO</strong> confirmed he will play for Leeds until the end of the season. The 33-year-old Norwegian striker hit 50 goals for Chelsea from 1997-2000.<br><br><strong>MARK VIDUKA</strong> is set to snub West Ham and opt for a summer move to Italy. The Middlesbrough hitman, 31, has been offered a deal by Genoa for next season and is likely to sign a pre-contract agreement with the Serie B club next week.<br><br>Spurs and Newcastle have also made inquiries as Boro have only just opened talks about an extension to his Â£40,000-a-week contract.<br><br><strong>PORTSMOUTH </strong>are lining up a Â£1.5million move for top Nigerian defender Taye Taiwo.<br><br>Marseille left-back Taiwo, 21, had talks with Pompey boss Harry Redknapp last week. PompeyÂ’s Nigerian striker Kanu recommended his national team-mate to Redknapp. TaiwoÂ’s elder brother Waheed confirmed: Â“My brother went to London to discuss his possible move to Portsmouth.Â”<br><br><strong>Sylvain Distin</strong> has indicated he could extend his stay at Manchester City.<br><br>The 29-year-old French defender is out of contract in the summer and yet to pen a new deal. It has led to constant speculation his days at the club are numbered. Distin said: "Many clubs want me. It's nice but I don't rule out staying at City. "I consider myself lucky to be playing in the Premiership, both from a financial and a sporting point of view. "Here the whole stadium cheers when there's a good tackle."<br><br><strong>Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso</strong> has dismissed speculation linking him with a return to Spain. The 25-year-old, who arrived from Real Sociedad during the summer of 2004, has instead vowed to play his part in reeling in second-placed Chelsea in the Premiership.<br><br>Alonso told the club's official website: "I do not speak about the rumours of my return to Spain. "I have a contract signed with the Reds and I am happy at this club. "Now Liverpool are playing to our best level of the season. This is perfect for the beginning of the year with the next big challenges.<br><br>"To get to third place is very important for morale for us after the problems in the first months of the league. Now our objective is to consolidate the effort."<br><br><strong>David Beckham</strong> will not leave Real Madrid during the current transfer window and is about to reopen talks over a new deal at the Bernabeu, according to the former England captain's spokesman.<br><br>Speculation has been rife that the 31-year-old will quit the Spanish giants this month after finding first-team opportunities hard to come by this season. But, rather than fishing for a move away from the club he joined in 2003, the player's spokesman, Simon Oliveira, has claimed discussions on a two-year extension to his current deal, which expires in June, will open next week.<br><br>"There is a significant deal on the table from Real," he said. "It's slightly more than he's on at the moment. "They are the only club we are genuinely talking to at the moment and another meeting is scheduled for the second week of January."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Transfer Window - day four</strong><br><br>Former West Ham bosses Glenn Roeder and Alan Pardew are on a collision course in the race to sign Upton Park marksman Marlon Harewood. Both Newcastle and Charlton require more firepower to climb the Premiership table with the Magpies also interested in Middlesbrough striker Mark Viduka now that Everton have insisted James Beattie is not for sale.<br><br>Harewood needs a change of scenery as he has struggled for form this season, along with the rest of the Hammers squad, and new boss Alan Curbishley is preparing to clear the decks in the next few weeks in a desperate bid to prevent the East End club from sliding into the Championship.<br><br>Outspoken Israeli midfielder Yossi Benayoun is also on his way with Portsmouth interested if Boro beat them to the Â£4million capture of West Brom midfielder Zoltan Gera.<br><br>Meanwhile, Newcastle are also in need of players to strengthen their defence and Manchester United's England international Wes Brown and Middlesbrough's Chris Riggott top the options they are currently examining.<br><br>Watford boss Adrian Boothroyd has revealed three Premiership rivals have asked about the availability of attacker Ashley Young, who is valued at around Â£5million. The England Under-21 international interests Liverpool, Spurs, Arsenal and Aston Villa and Boothroyd knows he will have to fight tooth and nail to keep his young prospect.<br><br>"As it stands today, I absolutely do not see him leaving the club this month," the Hornets manager said. "If and when the time is right, and he wants to go, he will go. But the price has to be right and it has to mean the club will be improved."<br><br>A groin injury to Pompey left-back Noe Pamarot may prevent Andy Griffin turning his loan spell at Stoke City into a permanent move. Harry Redknapp is short of defenders and will have to bring a couple in before letting Griffin leave as Dejan Stefanovic is struggling to recover from a knee operation he underwent in November.<br><br>"Hopefully we can get one or two new players in because losing Pamarot leaves us a bit short at left back with Dejan still a long way from fitness too,' the Fratton Park boss said.<br><br>Manchester City have received a boost after discovering Sylvain Distin may spurn the attentions of rival Premiership clubs to stay at Eastlands if they offer him an acceptable new contract. His current deal expires in the summer but the 29-year-old Frenchman revealed: "Several clubs are asking for me and that's very nice but I won't rule out staying at City. "I consider myself lucky to be playing in the Premiership, both from a financial and a sporting point of view."<br><br>Reading are closing in on versatile Colchester player Greg Halford, who is just as comfortable in midfield as he is in defence. And the smart money is on boss Steve Coppell going back to former club Crystal Palace to buy Republic of Ireland striker Clinton Morrison as a back-up to Kevin Doyle while Dave Kitson continues to recover from injury.<br><br></div>

Liverpool have long been linked with the Australia international full-back, yet they are not the only club chasing the services of the 28-year-old.<br><br>However, there is every possibility Neill will stay at Blackburn until the end of the season and move on for free in the summer as Hughes knows his chances of finding a suitable replacement are remote.<br><br>Hughes explained: "There's been interest, as I felt there would be when a player of his calibre becomes available. "We've been offered significant amounts of money, but I can't spend it. That's the situation we find ourselves in.

He shot to prominence after a spectacular loan spell at Scottish Premier League outfit Falkirk earlier this season, which yielded 16 goals in 18 games.<br><br>The loan ended on January 2 and sparked a race for his signature among several clubs - but Stokes opted for promotion-chasing Sunderland.

It is said that Chelsea view Martins, who joined Newcastle from Internazionale in August, as a potential pacy partner for Didier Drogba.<br><br>"This is agent-driven, it is not from Obafemi Martins or Chelsea," said a senior figure at Newcastle, who pointed out the close working relationship between the Newcastle chairman, Freddy Shepherd, and Chelsea's chief executive, Peter Kenyon. The club are emphatic that Martins is not for sale.<br><br>Chelsea may well be in the market for a striker, given their over-reliance on Drogba for goals this season and the relative failure of both Andriy Shevchencko and Salomon Kalou, both bought last summer, to make an impact. The Ukrainian in particular has provided scant return for a Â£30m investment, and the Ivorian striker Kalou was among those recently singled out for criticism by Jose Mourinho after a string of mediocre performances. The club have been linked with a move for the Tottenham forward Jermain Defoe, who also fits the profile of a small, fast foil to Drogba's powerful game.<br><br>A move for Martins, 22, has apparently been the subject of discussion on the Chelsea training pitches as players speculate as to who might be added to the squad. Newcastle do not want to give the story credibility by publicly commenting on it.<br><br>Martins signed a five-year contract when he arrived from Internazionale for Â£10.1m in late August and has handled the burden of inheriting Alan Shearer's No9 jersey with increasing confidence over the past five months. He has nine goals in 22 starts and Newcastle's manager, Glenn Roeder, believes his best form will be seen after his first season in English football. Martins is said to be happy on Tyneside but with Michael Owen still recovering from long-term injury Newcastle can ill afford to lose their main striker.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/Oneill.jpg"><br><br><strong>O'NEILL LINES UP SWP &amp; ASHLEY</strong><br><br>MARTIN O'NEILL has emerged as the new front-runner in the chase for England Under-21 winger Ashley Young, despite having a Â£6.9million bid rejected by Watford. The Aston Villa boss, whose team were dumped out of the FA Cup by Manchester United, was also set to win the race to take Shaun Wright-Phillips on loan from Chelsea.<br><br>O'Neill has overtaken Spurs and Liverpool in the scramble for Young, who has at least five Premiership clubs vying for his signature. Arsenal and Sheffield United are also interested in Â£10million rated Young, the most gifted player produced by the Hornets since John Barnes 25 years ago.<br><br>But O'Neill has a Â£20m transfer kitty after being given a licence to spend heavily by Villa's billionaire American owner Randy Lerner. And with Vicarage Road boss Aidy Boothroyd refusing to part with Young if he is only going to sit on the bench at another club while Watford struggle for Premiership survival, O'Neill can offer regular first-team football.<br><br>Boothroyd is not obliged to sell, and brought Young on as a substitute against Stockport in the FA Cup on Saturday, saying: "I don't care whether he's cup-tied now because I'm not interested in other people's cup runs. I've made it clear I don't want Ashley to go, but other clubs are interested in him and I can understand that because he's a wonderful player.<br><br>"He's quick, a set-piece specialist, can play left, right or down the middle, has an exceptional work ethic, can make goals and score them from all areas.<br><br>"But for him to leave, he would have to tell me he wants to join a 'big six' club - and it would take an awful lot of money for that to happen."<br><br>O'Neill is confident of taking Wright- Phillips on loan for the rest if the season. He has beaten strong competition from Newcastle and West Ham, who offered Â£10m and Â£70,000-a-week, but Wright-Phillips is thought not to want a permanent move as he believes he can still be a success at Chelsea.</div>

Saints have turned down bids in the region of Â£5m from Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur, but they are disappointed that the 17-year-old has not yet extended his existing contract which runs until 2008.<br><br>Senior sources at St Mary's fear they could eventually be left in a weak negotiating position if Bale decides he wants to leave and his contract has been allowed to run down. Having nurtured Bale through the academy, Southampton do not want to risk losing him cheaply. They remain hopeful that he can be persuaded to sign a new contract by the end of the week, although the indications from the Bale camp are that this is unlikely.<br><br>Southampton's manager, George Burley, regards Bale as vital to the club's hopes of promotion to the Premiership and is desperate to keep him at the club until at least the end of the season. Bale, himself, has indicated that he currently does not want to follow his former academy room-mate Theo Walcott into the Premiership.<br><br>He is understood to be happy to stay with Southampton, where he will play regular first-team football, and review the situation in the summer. If Southampton do decide to sell, United would appear to be in pole position, although Arsenal and Liverpool are also believed to be monitoring developments.<br><br>Bale has been the driving force in Southampton's promotion push this season, scoring five goals from left-back. Last year, he become the youngest-ever Wales international and is tipped by Burley to have the ability to become the best full-back in Britain.<br></div>

The Swedish star has been told he has no future at the Emirates Stadium and is likely to snub a move to West Ham to move to Italy with AC Milan and Juventus both interested. The Hammers are still eager to do business with the Gunners and a pressing to sign Cameroon defender Lauren to help with the battle against relegation.<br><br><strong>Alan Curbishley</strong> yesterday completed the Â£2million signing of Scotland midfielder Nigel Quashie from West Brom and will today decide whether to allow Nigel Reo-Coker to join Tottenham.<br><br><strong>Spurs</strong> are interested in the tough midfielder but are not willing to pay Â£5m for him. Martin Jol also wants to strengthen his attack with Mido sidelined with a groin injury and has been looking at Kilmarnock striker Steven Naismith, who has scored nine goals for Killie this season.<br><br><strong>Portsmouth</strong> have cash to spend on transfers, despite reports they are skint, and Harry Redknapp is challenging Blackburn Rovers for Belgian striker Emile Mpenza. His top priority, however, is Udinese midfielder Sulley Muntari although the Â£8m asking price may be a bit steep so Pompey want to bring him in on loan before deciding whether the Ghana international is worth the money.<br><br><strong>Liverpool </strong>have begun a legal battle to complete the transfer of Javier Mascherano from West Ham. The midfielder played for Brazilian club Corinthians after last year's World Cup before moving to Upton Park and FIFA regulations mean he cannot play for another club this season. Liverpool's lawyers have been briefed to argue no-one is suffering from the governing body's restrictions except the 22-year-old.<br><br><strong>Claudio Reyna</strong> is heading back to the United States where he is likely to play for Major League Soccer's New York Red Bulls.<br><br>The 33-year-old will agree to cancel the remaining six months of his contract with Manchester City, saving manager Stuart Pearce around Â£600,000 which can be redirected towards paying the wages of a new recruit, probably on loan.<br><br><strong>Newcastle</strong> misfit Albert Luque is wanted by PSV Eindhoven, who have asked to take him on loan for 18 months<br><br></div>

I do not want to be sold in January. I want to wait until June to see what happens.<br><br>"I am happy in Manchester with my work and I want to try and get back in the team, but it is the coach who picks the 11."<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Â£2m Ben Haim is too much for Chelsea</strong><br><br>Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon attempted to pacify Jose Mourinho last night by releasing a statement detailing the reasons behind the club's decision to pull the plug on their attempts to sign Tal Ben Haim.<br><br>Mourinho's fragile truce with the Chelsea board was back in the balance after the club claimed that they could not reach an agreement with Bolton after nearly two weeks of talks.<br><br>Bolton wanted Â£2m for the defender, who is out of contract at the end of the season, but Chelsea were not prepared to back their manager's judgement and offered a fraction of that figure.<br><br>Manager Sam Allardyce has now warned rival clubs they will not be allowed to pick up in-demand centre-back Tal Ben Haim on the cheap and unless their valuation of the player is met by next week he will stay at the Reebok.<br><br>"At the moment it looks like he will be here for the rest of the season," said the Wanderers boss. "We have not had an acceptable offer from any club at the moment.<br><br>"Unless that changes in the next few days we won't be accepting anything, probably going into next week, because whatever comes in that week means we would have no time to go out and spend that money on somebody else."<br><br>Allardyce admitted he was looking for a replacement for the centre-back but did not have the money to bring one in unless the club received a transfer fee for Ben Haim.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Birmingham reject Hammers' Upson bid</strong><br><br>Birmingham have rejected a Â£4million bid from West Ham for central defender Matthew Upson. Blues boss Steve Bruce has constantly stressed he is under no pressure to sell Upson during the January transfer window.<br><br>And in any case the bid made by the Hammers falls well short of Blues' valuation of the former Arsenal player - believed to be around Â£6million.<br><br>Alan Curbishley has injury worries regarding the defensive trio of Daniel Gabbidon, James Collins and Anton Ferdinand and was hoping Upson could solve his problems.<br><br>Upson's former club Arsenal would be entitled to a 25 per cent cut of any fee above the Â£2.5million City paid for him in January 2003.<br><br>Bruce is hoping Upson will help Championship leaders Birmingham gain promotion back to the Barclays Premiership and then have a rethink about his future after rejecting a new five-year contract last season.<br><br>Bruce's number two Eric Black has emerged as a possible candidate for the vacant Coventry post after Micky Adams was sacked yesterday.<br><br>Black previously had a spell in charge of the Sky Blues but was ousted to allow Peter Reid to take over the reins nearly three years ago.<br><br>Bruce does not want to lose the services of Black and has consistently praised the part he has played in City's revival this season<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Bayern exits may mean Hargreaves stays</strong><br><br>The chances of England midfielder Owen Hargreaves joining Manchester United in the summer have become even more remote with Bayern Munich set to lose the services of several midfielders.<br><br>On Tuesday, Sebastian Deisler announced his immediate retirement and that, coupled with the impending transfer of Ali Karimi to Al-Ahli, has left Bayern short of cover in the squad.<br><br>The situation will become more acute in the summer when Mehmet Scholl intends to retire and Hasan Salihamidzic will complete an agreed move to Juventus.<br><br>That will leave Bundesliga champions Bayern with just four recognised midfielders in Mark van Bommel, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Andreas Ottl and Hargreaves.<br><br>Bayern general manager Uli Hoeness has indicated that the situation will mean that players will not be allowed to leave.<br><br>"It is not the case that we are care-free," he said. "We have got to start being careful with our squad."<br><br>Instead, Bayern will themselves be in the market for midfield reinforcements, but Hoeness added that academy prospects would also be given their chance.<br><br>"Sometimes enforced restructuring like this is not a bad solution," he said.<br><br>United have been interested in Hargreaves since his impressive performances for England during the World Cup in Germany last summer.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Bobby Zamora could soon be leaving West Ham to provide insurance for Reading as they seek to continue their impressive start to life in the Premiership. </strong><br><br>Royals boss Steve Coppell realises that goals are of paramount importance if his club are to compete with the big boys in the top flight.<br><br>Bobby Zamora could soon be leaving West Ham to provide insurance for Reading as they seek to continue their impressive start to life in the Premiership.<br><br>Royals boss Steve Coppell realises that goals are of paramount importance if his club are to compete with the big boys in the top flight.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Former Liverpool and Portsmouth midfielder Patrik Berger wants to quit Aston Villa before his contract expires in the summer. </strong><br><br>The Czech Republic star has just completed a loan spell with Stoke City and wants to move to the continent to play out the rest of the season.<br><br>Villa boss Martin O'Neill revealed: "His agent had mentioned about the possibility of him going somewhere abroad for the last few months. If that materialises, fine.<br><br>"If not, then he just gets his head down here and the team will get picked on merit as far as I am concerned. If he is doing well enough, then he will be back in contention."<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Bolton boss Sam Allardyce is unhappy he has lost the race to sign Birmingham midfielder David Dunn. </strong><br><br>He has been pipped by Blackburn's last ditch bid for the player who grew up a crossfield pass away from Ewood Park.<br><br>"It looks like he's going to Blackburn," said Allardyce. "He's told me that's where he wants to go - simple as that.<br><br>"At the 11th hour they have pinched him. We are extremely disappointed but there is not a lot we can do about it.<br><br>"I always feel let down when you have got so far down the road spending so much time showing the player this is the best place to be to get his career back on track.<br><br>"But it was not quite a big enough pull compared to the town where he was born and bred."<br><br>Meanwhile, Allardyce has told Chelsea their Â£2m offer from defender Ben Tal Haim is nowhere near enough.<br><br></div>
