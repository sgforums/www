              <p><strong>Roy Hodgson was given an astonishing £7.3million pay-off by Liverpool after his six month reign at Anfield.</strong></p>
              <p>The manager may not feel he had a chance to shine with Kenny Dalglish in the background, but he was compensated handsomely.</p>
              <p>When Fenway Sports Group bought Liverpool in October they were reluctant to look for a new manager and the pay-off Hodgson was due must have come into their thinking.</p>
              <p>The golden goodbye means Hodgson earned £8.8m in total during his time at the club, which works out at £45,833 for each of the 192 days he was in charge.</p>
              <p>He was back in work by Valentine’s Day at West Bromwich Albion — and inflicting more pain on his former club with a 2-1win.</p>
              <p>It cost Chelsea £12.6m to jettison Luiz Felipe Scolari and his assistants in 2009 and Mark Hughes is thought to have been paid £3m after his sacking by Manchester City.</p>
              <p>But it is not just the biggest clubs who are paying for changing their minds about their appointments. Sam Allardyce, who was paid £3m after he was sacked by Blackburn last December, received the same when he left Newcastle in 2008.</p>
