              <p>England defender Jonathan Woodgate believes his new club Tottenham's 11th place in the Premier League is a 'false position'.</p>
              <p>The 28-year-old finally moved from Middlesbrough to Spurs yesterday - and although the details of the deal have yet to be announced, Woodgate is likely to cost Juande Ramos' side in the region of £7million.</p>
              <p>The clubs earlier confirmed they had reached agreement for the 28-year-old, who joined Boro from Real Madrid in August 2006 - initially on loan, with the move made permanent in April 2007</p>
              <p>Woodgate has made 19 league appearances for the Teessiders this season.</p>
              <p>He told Spurs' website: 'I think it's a false position in the league, with the quality we've got. I hope we can climb up the league and get as high as we can.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'The group of players we've got here is exceptional - young players, and experience as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'They've got a great future. Obviously they are in Europe and in the (Carling) Cup - and the manager is excellent. He's won things with Sevilla, and a lot of the players are fantastic as well.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Newcastle also made enquiries about Woodgate regarding a return to St James' Park, but Magpies boss Kevin Keegan had to admit his chances of signing the defender had faded.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The player insists he always wanted to join Spurs once he realised the identity of the club who had made an offer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'There was an offer in this transfer window,' he recalled. 'When I knew it was Spurs - it's a good club and it's going forward with the new manager as well and they have got a lot of exciting players.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I'm delighted to come. I've been given the chance to speak to the club. It's what I wanted to do from the start really.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Boro manager Gareth Southgate - who has the likes of Emanuel Pogatetz, David Wheater and Robert Huth available as cover at centre-half - agreed to sell Woodgate because his head had been turned by the chance of a transfer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Southgate told Boro's website: 'You're looking for everyone at your club to want to be here and be part of it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'We wanted to give Jonathan the opportunity to speak to other clubs - because when clubs call you about a player it usually means the player knows about it anyway.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'We were then asking a question of Jonathan - do you want to be here and be part of what we want to do or do you want to head off?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'It seems he wanted to head off.'</p>
