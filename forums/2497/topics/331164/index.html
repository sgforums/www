              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Robbie Keane insists he is not worried about his failure to score for Liverpool since his £20million summer move from Tottenham.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The Republic of Ireland striker has gone seven
              games without a goal for his new club, and also scored just once in his
              final eight games for Tottenham last term.</p>
              <p>Keane has netted for the Republic of Ireland this term, but is determined to break his duck for Liverpool.</p>
              <p>He said: "Obviously I realise I have not scored yet and that is
              something that I want to do, but it is also not something I am too
              worried about.</p>
              <p>"If I was a young lad and a bit naive, then I would probably be
              really worried about it, but as long as the team is winning and I keep
              working hard, then that is all I can do.</p>
              <p>"I know I will get my reward for all the hard work I have put
              in. I think my first goal is just around the corner. Hopefully when
              that does come, many more will follow."</p>
              <p>Keane started on the bench in midweek against Marseille, and
              manager Rafael Benitez was guarded about whether he would select the
              striker against Stoke on Saturday.</p>
              <p>Benitez said: "We want Robbie to score soon, yes. And if he is selected against Stoke, maybe that will be the time.</p>
              <p>"But I am not concerned about this, his effort and work for the team is outstanding."</p>
              <p>Keane, 28, also took time to settle in at White Hart Lane during
              the 2002-03 season when Glenn Hoddle bought him from Leeds for a
              £7million fee.</p>
              <p>He did not produce his first goal in a Tottenham shirt until
              halfway through October against Blackburn, but after that he went on to
              score 80 goals for the club.</p>
              <p>Keane believes the continued support of the Anfield crowd will help him along.</p>
              <p>He said: "The crowd have been brilliant to me since I came here.
              It has been everything I expected, what with being a Liverpool fan
              already.</p>
              <p>"They are always the 12th man behind the ball and were roaring us on against Manchester United last week.</p>
              <p>"They have really been great to me, and I can feel everyone
              pushing me on to get my first goal and hopefully that will be sooner
              rather than later."</p>
