              <p><strong>England striker Peter Crouch accepts he will probably have to consider quitting Liverpool in the summer to get regular first-team football.</strong></p>
              <p>The 6ft 7ins forward scored an impressive opening goal in the 1-1 Barclays Premier League draw with Arsenal at Emirates Stadium on Saturday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, Crouch feels he is likely to be back on the Anfield bench for tomorrow night's second leg of their Champions League quarter-final with the Gunners, when leading scorer Fernando Torres is expected to lead the attack again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Liverpool have offered the 27-year-old, who arrived from Southampton in a £7million deal during 2005, a new contract.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yet Crouch, who has 25 England caps, intimated his future could well lay elsewhere if he cannot hold down a first-team place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I would love to stay, it is a fantastic club and I love everything about it, but I have got to be realistic,' said Crouch, who has just seven Premier League starts this season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'If I want to have any aspirations of playing for England, or furthering my career, then I have to be playing - and that doesn't seem to be the case at the moment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I will have to look at it - but that's certainly something I won't be doing now, I will be doing it at the end of the season.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Crouch, though, insists his current focus in on helping Liverpool progress in Europe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'At the moment I am concentrating on winning something for Liverpool and playing some part in the end of the season,' he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'We have got a Champions League run-in now and it's exciting for us, and all my efforts are focused on that.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reds boss Rafael Benitez made eight changes for the Premier League match on Saturday, and looks set to tinker with his side again tomorrow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Crouch, though, is expecting to be back on the bench.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'It's pretty clear I probably won't start,' he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'Obviously if the manager plays one up front, he is more than likely to go with Fernando - and rightly so, he's been fantastic this season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'Before when he was rotating at least I was getting a game here and there. But the manager's obviously stuck with a formation now that seems to be working, and credit to the players that have been playing in that system.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'We have certainly been playing well and I think we have got a great chance of going through to the semi-finals now in Europe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'But for me, I will just have to obviously keep working hard and try and change his mind.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Crouch revealed: 'It can be disheartening, but you have to keep going.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I am one of those players that will keep going, I keep working hard in training, and, if called upon then hopefully I'll do what I did at Arsenal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'At a big club there is always that pressure. Even if you start every game, if you don't perform, you know you are going to be out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'But maybe me more so, with the fact that I haven't played that much this season, so, when I do, I have to make sure that I do well and do the business to try and stay in.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After holding the Gunners to a 1-1 draw twice in the space of four days, Crouch believes Liverpool will have a psychological edge tomorrow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'We have got to take confidence from the fact that we've played two away games now against Arsenal and certainly not been outplayed at any time,' said the striker.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'We have given them a good account of ourselves, could have won either game, it could have gone either way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'Now, when we are at Anfield and with the crowd behind us, we feel we can beat anyone.'</p>
