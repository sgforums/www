              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span><span> are continuing to pay £500,000 a month to keep two of the premier signings made during the Roy Hodgson era away from Anfield. </span></strong></p>
              <p><span>The Merseysiders are still meeting the majority of the bloated wages awarded to Joe Cole and Christian Poulsen, even though both players are on loan in France.</span></p>
              <p><span>Liverpool are paying £70,000 of Cole's £105,000 weekly wage as he rebuilds his career with Lille. </span></p>
              <p><span>And they are letting Denmark's Poulsen play for Evian this season, with the French club contributing only £15,000 of his £65,000-a-week deal. </span></p>
              <p><span>The deals mean Liverpool will pay £6million-plus on the two players' salaries over the course of the season, which hampers Kenny Dalglish's activities in the January transfer window. </span></p>
              <p><span>He is interested in a number of players but may have to sell the likes of Dirk Kuyt, a target for Galatasaray, to finance any moves.</span></p>
              <p><span>Cole was signed in the summer of 2010 by Liverpool's former managing director Christian Purslow to try to earn the club some positive publicity during a troubled time under owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett.</span></p>
              <p><span>But the move backfired as Cole was sent off on his debut against Arsenal and proved unable to win a regular first-team place under Hodgson or Dalglish.</span></p>

              <p>Hope Ah Ken can stop shopping his future players from England or team lower than Liverpool.</p>
              <p>They do not have the winning mentality like big club and like to relax one corner all the time.</p>
              <p>Even with all the possession, Liverpool do not have any one to unlock stoke defence this morning.</p>
              <p>Unless Ah Ken can buy a top striker in Jan, Liverpool can say farewell to CL and KD next season.</p>

              <p>roy hodgson buys were rubbish. granted cole is free, but his wages are astronomical.</p>
              <p>poulsen and that left back were rubbish buys. how to succeed with these type of players.</p>
              <p>iif he was still around, I wonder how much cash he will splurge on rubbish players.</p>

              <p>Hodgson buys rubbish. Kenny is not much better also. Liverpool has been buying flops over and over again.</p>
              <p>With the money for carrol and downing, there can be so much better choice.</p>
              <p>Now the owner also hestiate to give kenny the money to buy any more player le.</p>
              <p>With gerrard getting closer to his retirement, i really wonder who will kenny find to replace him in the team.</p>

              <p>Stevie is unique and hard to find any replacement for him.</p>
              <p>When he played, Adam really pale in comparison.</p>
              <p>The buys that Ah Ken have yet to impress except for Luis. (They were more in waste of money with their work rate which is why they are from bottom team)</p>
              <p>They are bought cos they are made in UK.</p>
              <p>More chance should be given to Shelvey instead of Adam.</p>
              <p>It is mid-month and Ah Ken is still draggin his feet in finding a out to out striker.</p>
              <p>It will be a matter of time for Henry to show him the green sign at the end of the season.</p>

              <p>Unfair to blame Roy as his only big money buy <span style="color: #000000;">Meireles (If you consider $11m to be big money) was rather good but somehow he was sold off without making a loss though. Joe wasn't his buy, just like Suarez isn't Dalglish as what was mentioned on fanzone. They both were in negotiations with the board to come over before the managers were appointed... Joe was former managing director's buy while Suarez was said to be Comolli's choice. Kenny is probably credited for all the English and PL players like Henderson, Carroll, Downing, (the real big money) and of coures Adams, Enrique...</span></p>
              <p>Yesterday, Pool played with 5 defenders, 3 centre-backs woh... Like back to the good old days of the 80s and 90s period.</p>
