Hammers boss Alan Curbishley is eager to thrash out a permanent deal for the Argentine striker. But TevezÂ’s magnificent recent displays have alerted Chelsea and Liverpool.</strong><br><br>The player is still partly owned by Kia JoorabchianÂ’s and is only on loan at Upton Park until the season ends. Joorabchian is far from happy with the way he has been treated by West Ham since his efforts to buy the club failed last year.<br><br>A Chelsea bid of around Â£15million would persuade Joorabchian to cash in. Liverpool, who have already taken TevezÂ’s pal Javier Mascherano from West Ham, are also keen.</div>

And Tevez has given a clear indication his future is in the balance.<br><br>'I have stopped learning English as I don't know where I am going to end up next season,' he told The Times.<br><br>'But yes, it was hard to settle (in England).<br><br>'The language is an issue - and I will learn English if I stay in this league - and, of course, the football here is different compared to Brazil or Argentina. In my opinion, it's the most difficult competition in the world. That may be why so few people make it over here.<br><br>'Every Saturday you get kicked and you end up going home with marks all over your body.
