              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger has hinted that Thierry Henry will return to Arsenal
              in some capacity in the future but it appears unlikely that the man
              voted the club’s greatest ever player will return to don his boots.</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/arsenal/henry-wenger.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>Henry left Arsenal to join Barcelona in the summer of 2007 and The
              Gunners have missed his drive, experience and all-round excellence with
              Wenger even admitting his side may have won the league last season had
              they held onto their captain.</strong></p>
              <p>But the Gunners boss expects the striker – who scored a record 226
              goals in 380 games in Arsenal colours – to return to the club, perhaps
              in a coaching capacity.</p>
              <p>"Is there ever a chance Thierry will come back? Of course,” said Wenger.</p>
              <p>“This club always wants players of his quality to come back. It will
              be difficult for him to come back as a player because in 2010 he will
              be 33.</p>
              <p>"But he has a very strong link with the club. He had a massive influence here - and we had a massive influence on his career."</p>
              <p>Reflecting on Henry’s departure to Barcelona two years ago, Wenger
              lamented the impact that the captain’s departure had on a side that so
              nearly took the Premier League title before Henry’s replacement,
              Eduardo, suffered a horrific injury.</p>
              <p>“It was his decision,” Wenger added. “I tried to convince him to stay.</p>
              <p>“He said: ‘The way you are going you will have a great team in two
              or three years. But I can’t wait that long. I am 30 years old.’</p>
              <p>“Last year we had 83 points and with him we might have got the extra points that would have won us the championship.”</p>

              <p>I seriously doubt it is henry who wanted to leave Arsenal. Given Wenger record of selling off his aging star. And only like to groom young star with no regards to experience player. It was in fact Wenger who show half heartened attempt to keep Henry.</p>
              <p>It is only after 4 seasons never won any major title that prompt wenger to say this kind of b*stard words.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am glad Henry left Arsenal and he is now on his way to complete his treble which Wenger will never able to help Henry achieve.</p>
              <p>Serve Wenger right!</p>

              <p><br>Useless? He score so many important goals that Barcelona miss him badly during Chelsea match. If with Henry, I bet Chelsea cannot cope with 3 very pacy striker.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do u know many Samuel Eto goal was crossed in and assist by Henry. In the first place, did u watch La Liga before u make such comment?</p>
