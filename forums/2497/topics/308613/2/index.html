              <p><strong>TAYLOR: EDUARDO TACKLE NOT MALICIOUS</strong></p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p>Birmingham central defender Martin Taylor has insisted there was "no malicious intent" in his tackle which has left Arsenal striker Eduardo with a suspected broken leg. Eduardo, who will be 25 on Monday, was stretchered off after Taylor's third-minute challenge in the 2-2 draw at St Andrews and was immediately taken to hospital.</p>
              <p>Taylor was given a straight red card and now faces an automatic three-match suspension. But Gunners manager Arsene Wenger claimed the former Blackburn player "should not be allowed to play again" in a blistering attack on the player, a comment he has now retracted.</p>
              <p>Birmingham responded on Saturday evening by issuing a three paragraph statement in defence of Taylor who was left "distraught" by the extent of Eduardo's injury according to manager Alex McLeish. The statement reads: "The club are saddened that such a fantastic game of football has been marred by a serious injury sustained to Arsenal player Eduardo.</p>
              <p>"But Martin Taylor is adamant there was no malicious intent in the tackle and he is deeply upset by the extent of Eduardo's injury. "Having reviewed the incident, this (no malicious intent) is clearly the case. The club and Martin Taylor would like to send their very best wishes to the player for a speedy recovery."</p>
              <p>Wenger retracted his earlier comments on Saturday evening, saying: "It was a highly emotional afternoon and we were all shocked by the injury to Eduardo. "On reflection, I feel that my comments about Martin Taylor were excessive. I said what I did immediately after the game in the heat of the moment."</p>

              <p>“I don't remember the incident very well and it is not something that I want to see again on television or in the newspapers.

              <p>“I am unsure at the moment of the extent of the injury and how long I will be out of action for but I know that I won't be able to play for Arsenal for the rest of the season or be ready in time for the Euros this summer.

              <p>Taylor was heavily criticised by Wenger on Saturday for the tackle that broke Eduardo's leg, before the Arsenal boss retracted his most scathing comments.</p>
              <p>And Taylor's team-mate Stephen Kelly came to the defence of his captain.</p>
              <p>"I think Mr Wenger's comments after the game were so harsh," said Kelly.</p>
              <p>"That is disgraceful talk from Arsene Wenger. It is terrible. You know the way Martin is. He slid along the ground.</p>
              <p>"He has gone in with one foot. You see players going in week in and week out, diving in with two feet, and lunging and that sort of thing is a disgraceful challenge.</p>
              <p>"It is a terrible thing for Wenger to say, especially about someone like Martin."</p>
              <p>Kelly added: "It wasn't a malicious tackle and the reason the ref has sent him off is because he has seen Eduardo has broken his leg.</p>
              <p>"I don't think you can send a player off for that. That's football. It can happen. It is an accident."</p>

              <p class="article"><strong>The Birmingham star’s tackle broke Eduardo’s ankle and shin and put the Arsenal strike ace out for at least A YEAR.</strong> <strong>Distraught Taylor insists it was an accident and Eduardo is said to have accepted the explanation. </strong></p>
              <p class="article">Taylor went to visit the Croatian hitman in Birmingham’s Selly Oak Hospital on Saturday after the 2-2 draw at St Andrew’s but could not see Eduardo as he was undergoing surgery. Taylor returned again yesterday morning and was able to explain in person that he meant no malice in the challenge.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Eduardo, 25 today, has now been moved to a hospital nearer his London home. At first it was feared he had broken his left ankle, shin and leg. But SunSport understands only two of the three are shattered. Yet he still faces at least 11 months’ recovery and recuperation from his horror injury before he can consider training again.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Gunners manager Arsene Wenger has withdrawn initial comments after the game, when he declared Taylor — who received a straight red for the challenge — should be banned from football for life. Last night Birmingham boss Alex McLeish expressed his sympathy for Eduardo but was staunch in his support for Taylor, 28.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">McLeish said: “Our thoughts are with Eduardo and we wish him well in his recovery. But Martin Taylor is a fabulous guy and, 100 per cent, did not do anything wrong.</p>
              <p class="article">“He is distraught but he’s a fair player and this was a terrible accident. He doesn’t need to apologise. We’ve had a lot of support and I can say the whole of football is behind Martin.”</p>

              <p>Gunners striker Nicklas Bendtner, who spent last season on loan at Birmingham, believes Taylor would not have deliberately looked to inflict an injury on Eduardo.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Danish international said: 'We obviously have to think about Edu who is terribly hurt. We wish him all the best.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I know Martin Taylor and he is not a player who goes in to hurt people - never. He is really calm. I've been told he is very upset and I know he would be like that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'But in football things like this happen. Even though he is not one who does bad tackles, this was a bad tackle and he deserved to be sent off. The referee had no choice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I could see from the players' reaction that it didn't look very good. I could see everyone running on to the pitch, I thought something was wrong. It made us all really sad.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Taylor has already issued a statement insisting there was 'no malicious intent' in his challenge on Eduardo.</p>

              <h1>Forgiving Eduardo out until Christmas</h1>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/02_03/2302arsenal1PA_468x315.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Eduardo has forgiven Birmingham defender Martin Taylor for the tackle that will leave him on the sidelines for nine months.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Arsenal striker, who broke his fibula and dislocated his ankle joint in the appalling collision at St Andrew's on Saturday, will not be able to start running again until the summer at the earliest.</p>
              <p>Although Arsenal are confident the Croatia forward will make a full recovery after surgery on Saturday evening in Selly Oak Hospital, there are no guarantees he will be able to play at the top level again.</p>
              <p>Eduardo spent his birthday in a London hospital — he turned 25 yesterday — coming to terms with the challenge that has left him in plaster.</p>
              <p>The Brazilian-born player, who received a visit from Taylor on Sunday evening, said: "It was an accident and I don't believe he wanted to hurt me.</p>
              <p>"These things can happen in football. I see this as a risk of professional football. That is sport. Sometimes you go up, sometimes you go down. There are very nice moments and there are very ugly moments.</p>
              <p>"My birthday is not important. My family are by my side and that is all the celebration I need. My wife and family cried a lot and that was hard for me. They were afraid, but they have calmed down a lot."</p>

              I think you really have misunderstood something here, there's nothing wrong with my post. While you're at it, why don't you take issue with The New Paper as well?
