              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Arsenal striker Eduardo suffered a broken leg in the third minute of their Premier League encounter against Birmingham at St Andrew's.</strong> </span></p>
              <p>The Croatian went down after a challenge from Birmingham's Martin Taylor, who was shown a straight red card for serious foul play.</p>
              <p>Eduardo, 24, remained on the pitch for seven minutes as medical staff attended to him before he was stretchered off.</p>
              <p>He was put straight into an ambulance and taken to Selly Oak Hospital. </p>
              <p>"Arsenal have confirmed that Eduardo has broken the lower part of his left leg and is now in hospital, where they will take a decision very shortly on whether to operate," said 5 Live's Ian Brown.</p>
              <p>The seriousness of the injury was apparent as both sets of players and medical staff looked shocked while Eduardo was treated on the pitch.</p>
              <p>Speaking on 5 Live, ex-Everton captain Kevin Ratcliffe said: "Looking at the players, especially (Cesc) Fabregas and Adebayor, realising the seriousness of the injury their heads went down immediately."</p>
              <p>The Brazilian-born striker looks certain to miss out on Croatia's participation at Euro 2008 in June.</p>

              <h2>WENGER WANTS LIFE BAN FOR TAYLOR</h2>
              <p><img src="http://clientimages.teamtalk.com/08/02/240/Birmingham_v_Arsenal_Arsene_Wenger_Eduardo_st_666139.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180"></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></p>
              <p><strong>Livid Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger called for Birmingham defender Martin Taylor to be banned for life after his horror tackle left Eduardo da Silva with a broken leg.</strong></p>
              <p>Eduardo was taken to hospital following the sickening challenge just three minutes into Saturday afternoon's Barclays Premier League game at St Andrews which finished 2-2.</p>
              <p>Taylor was said to be "distraught" at the incident, with Blues boss Alex McLeish insisting the defender had no intention of hurting his opponent.</p>
              <p>But Wenger was having none of it.</p>
              <p>"This guy should never play football again," he fumed. "What is he doing on the football pitch?</p>
              <p>"I've gone along with the idea for a long time that to stop Arsenal, you have to kick Arsenal. I knew that was coming for a long time now."</p>
              <p>Of Eduardo's injury, Wenger added on Sky Sports News: "His injury is very, very bad. More than the season is over."</p>
              <p>Blues boss Alex McLeish said of the challenge: "Martin's distraught about the lad's injury."</p>
              <p>"It's certainly not in Martin Taylor's make-up at all to commit a malicious tackle."</p>

There is no excuses for showing studs like that, if you don't want to injure the other player, you should retrieve back the tackle when you know that you're getting the leg and not the ball, but apparently he seems to follow thru with the tackle, not very clever. I am playing in the amatuer league and i know when i can't get the ball and going to get the leg, he's a professional and i dun see why he can't react in a less malicious manner. This tackle is really sickening.</p></div>

              <div class="sh"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says his initial comments that Birmingham captain Martin Taylor "should never play football again" were "excessive".</strong> </span></div>
              <div class="sh"></div>
              <p class="sh">Wenger claimed the third-minute tackle which broke Eduardo's leg and earned Taylor a red card was "horrendous".</p>
              <p class="sh">But later on Saturday Wenger said: "I feel that my comments about Martin Taylor were excessive. I said what I did in the heat of the moment.</p>
              <p class="sh">"It was a highly emotional afternoon and we were all shocked by the injury."</p>
              <p class="sh">Eduardo, 24, remained lying on the pitch for seven minutes as medical staff attended to him before he was stretchered off and taken to hospital.</p>
              <p class="sh">He underwent surgery later on Saturday and will miss the rest of the season, with Wenger fearing a "much longer" absence.</p>
              <p class="sh">Birmingham manager Alex McLeish sprang to the defence of Taylor.</p>
              <p class="sh">"Martin's not a dirty player. He's distraught over Eduardo's injury," he said.</p>
              <p class="sh">"I've seen the challenge and, yes, the studs land on Eduardo's ankle. In slow motion these tackles always look bad but he's not a malicious player - Eduardo was just too quick for him," he explained.</p>
              <p class="sh">"The referee's done his job, it's a sending off, but Taylor's not a malicious player."</p>
              <p class="sh">Birmingham released a statement later on Saturday saying the club were "saddened that such a fantastic game of football has been marred by a serious injury".</p>
              <p class="sh">It added: "Martin Taylor is adamant there was no malicious intent in the tackle and he is deeply upset by the extent of Eduardo's injury.</p>
              <p class="sh">"Having reviewed the incident, this (no malicious intent) is clearly the case. The club and Martin Taylor would like to send their very best wishes to the player for a speedy recovery."</p>

              <p>Smith injury didn't came about because he was blocking a shot, The shot was powerful indeed but it wouldn't have broken his foot, it was because he was rushing forward and his studs were caught in the turf causing the break and that powerful shot just added to his injury. Just like in this case too... <span style="color: #000000;">Eduardo foot was also caught in the turf too when the tackle came in. Thats why his injury became more serious. Had his studs not got caught in the turf, perhaps that tackle would have been quite common in the EPL... RVN commented that that injury to Smith was the worst he had seen, He could actually see Smith's leg bone sticking out of his flesh... And Smith took like about 1 yrs to get back into playing... </span></p>
              <p>Its unfortunate that such things happen to a player but its part of the game and Eduardo won't be the last guy to meet with this kind of injury... Dyer, at 28 yrs of age, suffered a double fracture to his lower leg during West Ham's 2-1 Carling match too... Dyer had his leg broke too and is expected to be back in 9 months...   </p>

              "Eduardo was just too quick for him" this is an excuse.
              It is intention to hack the striker down at all cost. U see all the tackle flying in is aiming at the players most of the time, ball always roll faster than their flying tackle. This kind of tackle commonly found in team like blackburn, they din really play the ball.
