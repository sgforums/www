You would imagine they will bring their strongest team as there is no need for them to be rotating and resting players. "So it is down to us. I always say that if you are up against one of the top sides, if they play well then we lose. So our number one priority is to try to stop them playing well. "We have man-marked them in the past but it is not just one player, potentially it is six or seven because their movement is so good."<br><br>Manchester United assistant manager Carlos Queiroz:<br>"It will be a difficult game for us but we would like to think we can perform as well as we did against Newcastle (a 6-0 victory). "Steve Coppell is doing a very good job there. "Reading are a team that never rests and they are very well organised. "They also have players who can score goals like (Dave) Kitson and (Kevin) Doyle. They are both doing very well.<br><br></div>

We have full respect for any opponent but we also are quietly confident we can give them a good game."<br><br>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger:<br>"There is a real hunger and we are all on the same wavelength. We have the same love for the game, and that drives you on. "You feel there is a potential in the side and that you want to win, but they want to win as well. We have taken a step forward this season. "That makes me believe we can win trophies at the end of the season."<br><br></div>

Wayne Rooney gets into space to lift home his opener at Old Trafford</span><br><br><strong>WAYNE ROONEY left it late to keep Manchester United top of the table.</strong><br><br>The England star netted on 77 minutes to finally kill off Reading, who will feel gutted they did not take a point.<br><br>Cristiano Ronaldo made sure of the win a minute from time.<br><br>But the Royals were left to rue a host of missed chances as they slumped to their third straight home defeat.<br><br>United boss Alex Ferguson admitted he was relieved to have won the game.<br><br>He said: Â“By the end we were quite happy to get through it.<br><br>Â“Considering the number of opportunities we had, maybe our decision-making in the final third of the field wasnÂ’t at its best.<br><br>Â“We kept making chances, but you do start to worry when the game goes on and you havenÂ’t scored.<br><br>Â“Credit to Reading, they keep going at you all the time and I think thatÂ’s an important result for us.Â”<br><br>Reading boss Steve Coppell conceded United's class finally told in the end.<br><br>He said: Â“For 70 minutes we gave as good as we got.<br><br>Â“If we had nicked three points it would have been history here, that is how big the opposition are. A point here would have been terrific for us.<br><br>Â“But you look at their incisive individuals - and by that I mean Ronaldo and Rooney.<br><br>Â“By and large we handled the other nine well but over the course of 90 minutes their appetite will create openings and opportunities. In the end it was one too many.Â”<br><br>Ronaldo was up to his old tricks from the off as he worked space on the edge of the box before pulling his shot, while another run from halfway ended with a strike just over the bar.<br><br>Leroy Lita forced Edwin van Der Sar to rush off his line to block, with Nemanja Vidic diving in to divert Dave Kitson's follow-up.<br><br>Carlos Tevez was next to try his luck but Marcus Hahnemann turned his effort behind.<br><br>Reading responded and after Van der Sar's weak punch on Stephen HuntÂ’s deflected free-kick, Kalifa CisseÂ’s low shot was deflected wide for a corner.<br><br>Hahnemann then produced an astonishing diving save from an Owen Hargreaves free-kick which looked destined for the corner until the American hurled himself across goal and tipped it wide.<br><br>Van der Sar had the backtracking Rio Ferdinand to thank for clearing Kitson's first-time 40-yard effort after the keeper had scuffed a clearance.<br><br>Ryan Giggs replaced Park Ji Sung at half-time and virtually his first act was to swing in a dangerous corner which had Reading at sixes and sevens.<br><br>HahnemannÂ’s punch hit KitsonÂ’s back and the ball was on its way in when Cisse made an acrobatic interception to hook it clear from under his own bar.<br><br>Ronaldo ballooned a shot over the bar and Hahnemann was at full stretch to deny Rooney.<br><br>Hunt then threw himself in the path of a Giggs shot from the edge of the area, while at the other end Van Der Sar got up to keep out Kitson's attempted lob.<br><br>United finally made the breakthrough 13 minutes from time when Rooney directed Tevez's lofted centre beyond Hahnemann.<br><br>Carrick headed wide as chances continued to arrive.<br><br>Hahnemann saved from Ronaldo before Royals winger James Harper broke from midfield only to drag his shot wide of the far post.<br><br>Reading continued to pile forward but Ronaldo skipped clear and coolly slotted past Hahnemann to wrap up the win.<br><br><strong>Reading:</strong> Hahnemann, Murty, Ingimarsson, Cisse, Shorey, Doyle, Hunt, Harper, Convey (Matejovsky 80), Lita (Long 83), Kitson. <strong>Subs not used:</strong> Federici, Rosenior, De la Cruz. <strong>Booked:</strong> Convey.<br><br><strong>Man Utd:</strong> Van der Sar, Brown, Ferdinand, Vidic, Evra, Ronaldo, Carrick, Hargreaves (Nani 70), Park (Giggs 46), Rooney, Tevez (Fletcher 81). <strong>Subs not used:</strong> Kuszczak, OÂ’Shea. <strong>Booked:</strong> Ferdinand. <strong>Goals:</strong> Rooney 77, Ronaldo 90.<br><br><strong>Att:</strong> 24,135<br><br><strong>Ref:</strong> Steve Bennett (Kent).<br><br><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00421/adebayor_682x400_421816a.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">All ads up..
