            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Guus Hiddink has spoken of his admiration for Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, even if the Russia boss is currently playing down talk of a future move to Stamford Bridge.</strong><br><br>Hiddink has developed a good relationship with Abramovich through his role with the Russian national side and speculation persists that he is being lined up as Jose Mourinho's long-term replacement in West London.<br><br>The Dutchman is committed to leading Russia to Euro 2008, potentially at England's expense, but, having received substantial support from Abramovich in his current role, Hiddink is likely to be a prime contender for the Chelsea job should Mourinho decide to move on next summer.<br><br>Hiddink has also been mooted as a potential candidate for the English national job, but for now the former Holland, South Korea and Australia boss remains fully committed to the latest country to harness his talents.<br><br>"Chelsea? England? It's all rumours," Hiddink told The Times. "I have my contact, of course, but not regarding any position with Chelsea.<br><br>"They are doing what they do; I enjoy very much working in Russia and I work until the end of my contract."<br><br>However, Hiddink has made no secret of his good working relationship with Abramovich, a situation that is unlikely to dampen talk that he could eventually take the reins at Chelsea.<br><br>"Every now and then we have our contact [with Abramovich], which is good and very open," Hiddink added.<br><br>"I like very much his attitude, his thinking. He's very down to earth and I love to have this contact with him every now and then.<br><br>"I have not made up my mind [where to work next] because I stick every day to my job.<br><br>"After 2008, we will see what happens. And I am already 60 years of age. But I have the drive, the will to work with young people. In our profession, you cannot look into the future too much."</div>
