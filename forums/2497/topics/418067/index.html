              <p>The French midfielder said he cold-shouldered his compatriot for a <strong>YEAR</strong> during their time together at Arsenal after defender Gallas criticised him in his autobiography.</p>
              <p>And Nasri, who refused to shake hands with Gallas before last month's North London derby, said he will snub him once more when the teams meet again in February.</p>
              <p>Nasri, 23, said: "I never said 'hello' to Gallas for a year in my own dressing room.</p>
              <p>"Why should I have to shake his hand on TV just because he has gone to Spurs?</p>
              <p>"That is not me. I am not a two-faced so-and-so. When I don't like someone I tell them to their face and I don't shake their hand. We don't like one another, the entire world knows this, and he even wrote about it in his book.</p>
              <p>"After the Spurs game I heard him saying it was 'my loss' that I hadn't shaken hands with him.</p>
              <p>"My loss? What the hell is all that about? He has forgotten how he bitched about me."</p>

              <h2 class="sub-heading padding-top-5 padding-bottom-15">The Arsenal defender has been stripped of the captaincy after an interview in which he exposed the club's problems</h2>
              <p class="sub-heading padding-top-5 padding-bottom-15"> </p>
              <p class="sub-heading padding-top-5 padding-bottom-15"> </p>
              <p><strong>William Gallas is likely to have played his last game for Arsenal after he was stripped of the club captaincy and dropped from the squad to play Manchester City for criticising his team-mates in an interview while on international duty with France this week. </strong></p>
              <p>The 31-year-old defender was also fined £180,000, two weeks' wages, by Arsène Wenger when he reported for what he thought would be clear-the-air talks with his manager.</p>
              <p>In the interview that cost him the captaincy and put a question mark over his future at the club, Gallas claimed that two Arsenal players - believed to be Robin van Persie and Theo Walcott - fought in the dressing-room at half-time during the 4-4 draw with Tottenham Hotspur last month and that team morale at the club has suffered this season because of the bad attitude and behaviour of one unnamed player.</p>
              <p>Gallas arrived at Arsenal's training ground in Hertfordshire yesterday expecting to be let off with a slap on the wrist or a fine but Wenger decided to act. Gallas tried to explain that his comments had been taken out of context and that their real meaning had been lost in translation but Wenger believed that he could no longer rely on a player who had broken the unwritten rule that what goes on in the dressing-room stays there.</p>
              <p>Wenger called time on Gallas's 15-month spell as captain after it emerged that he had also complained about the behaviour of a France team-mate, believed to be Samir Nasri, the Arsenal midfield player, in his autobiography, which was published in France this week. In the book, he describes tensions in France's squad during Euro 2008 caused by a young midfield player he refers to as “S”. French newspapers reported last night that “S” was Nasri. Gallas describes a confrontation with “S” on the training pitch in Switzerland. “Are you speaking to me? Who do you take yourself for? You're only 20 [which Nasri was at the time]... I am not your friend,” Gallas says he told the player. The player responded: “I'm not your friend, either,”</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Former France team doctor Jean-Pierre Paclet has defended Chelsea striker Nicolas Anelka's role in Les Bleus' World Cup meltdown and blamed Arsenal's Samir Nasri for causing problems in the team in recent years.</strong></p>
              <p>Nasri was not included in the squad for the World Cup, but Paclet alleges that the 23-year-old was a source of a disquiet which dates back further than June after upsetting captain Patrice Evra and senior professionals Thierry Henry, William Gallas and former Marseille team-mate Franck Ribery.</p>
              <p>''Here was a kid with a dozen caps looking down on players with a hundred. Scarcely believable,'' Paclet claimed in extracts from his book <em>L'Implosion</em>. ''His behaviour gets on the nerves of almost everybody and he has the gift of really annoying Henry, Gallas and Patrice Evra.</p>
              <p>''Most of all, the relationship between Nasri and Ribery was very tense, from the time they were together at Marseille. They were more like kids in a playground rather than professionals on a pitch.</p>
              <p>''Ribery would cause general laughter if, say, he put salt in my coffee. If he did it to Nasri, there would be no sense of humour from him.''</p>
