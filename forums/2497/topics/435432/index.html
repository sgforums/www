              <h1>Welbeck &amp; Cleverley on target as celebrity Red Devils side torn apart in charity match</h1>
              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> </span></p>
              <p>The match was organised by former 
                  Marseille goalkeeper Pascal Olmeta for his children’s charity and 
                  although the first half produced some entertaining football, once the 
                  majority of the United players were replaced by a selection of guests 
                  and celebrities, the floodgates opened.</p>
              <p>The first real attempt in the match resulted in a goal as United 
                  failed to clear a Morgan Amalfitano corner properly after 20 minutes and
                   the ball dropped nicely to <strong>Nicolas N’Koulou</strong> who pulled off a brilliant left-footed volley.</p>
              <p>Marseille added a second in the 34th minute through <strong>Jordan Ayew</strong> as the 19-year-old managed to bundle the ball past several defenders, 
                  owing to a favourable ricochet, before side-stepping Evra and finishing 
                  past Barthez in the United goal.</p>
              <p>United took just two minutes to hit back, however, as Cleverley played a clever through-ball between two defenders for <strong>Danny Welbeck</strong> to run on to and he made no mistake as he placed the ball into the bottom far corner.</p>
              <p>A minute later United found themselves level as Welbeck turned provider as he played <strong>Cleverley</strong> through on goal who finished brilliantly as he stroked the ball into the corner of the net.</p>
              <p>Marseille took the lead once again less than 60 seconds into the second half as <strong>Benoit Cheyrou</strong> controlled a cleared corner before lashing it into the top corner of the net from range.</p>
              <p>The hosts restored their two-goal lead in the 59th minute as <strong>Alou Diarra</strong> diverted a corner goalwards with a near-post header, and that lead was extended three moments later as <strong>Ayew</strong> pounced on a defensive error to score easily from close range.</p>
              <p>United, who by the 70th minute had just four of their own official 
                  first-team players on the pitch, lost another goal 20 minutes from time 
                  as <strong>Loic Remy</strong> eased past a defender and slotted home from seven yards out.</p>
              <p>With 10 minutes to go, Marseille grabbed their seventh of the night as <strong>Remy</strong> got on the end of a cross from the right-wing and unleashed an unstoppable header towards the top far corner, whilst <strong>Cheyrou</strong> grabbed his second of the match four minutes later as he headed home at the far post.<br><br><br>http://www.goal.com/en/match/64492/marseille-vs-man-utd/report</p>

              <p><br>Don't blame Barthez... Yes, the guy has retired for almost 4 yrs already... Anyway he did very well in this match considering the players on his team, and I think he only let in 2 goals as the second half was a different keeper...</p>
              <p>Basically is wasn't even United who played against Barcelona in the States just on Sunday only... This was some celebrities along with some youngsters and retired footballers like David Ginola with a few United reserves thrown in thats all... while Marseille was playing their 1st team players... They didn't even wore the United jersey to play...</p>
              <p>Anyway, some of United's players are in Holland for VDS's Testinomial today and Scholes on Friday in England...</p>
              <p>On a good note, Wellbeck is looking better and better... I am very impress with his improvement... Probably the most improved United youth player in the last 2 yrs...</p>
