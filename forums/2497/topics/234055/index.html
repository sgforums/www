Drogba rapped: Â“On ShevchenkoÂ’s side I donÂ’t really sense the desire to collaborate. "I think that as a big signing he believes he is obliged to justify his transfer fee with goals at any cost. I love to share but when I give, I appreciate it when I get something back.<br><br>Â“ThatÂ’s what happened with Hernan Crespo. But letÂ’s say it is a little different this season. Â“That is a real pity because everyone would have something to gain if we really worked together. I have tried to understand his position and get an explanation.<br><br>Â“IÂ’ve never been afraid of competition and did not see him as a threat. Â“We know we are not rivals because, unlike in the past years, there is room for two in attack this season. Â“I understand it is a really difficult situation for him to handle. But you have to think of the team first.Â”<br><br>Boss Jose Mourinho has fallen out with owner Roman Abramovich over his failure to get the best out of Shevchenko, who hit two Carling Cup goals against Wycombe in midweek but has just three league goals.<br><br>Drogba revealed in yesterdayÂ’s SunSport he fears MourinhoÂ’s reign is coming to an end. But Blues defender Ashley Cole said: Â“We all hope Jose sorts out whatever differences he has and stays.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s not affecting me personally but results havenÂ’t gone well lately and maybe Didier thinks itÂ’s down to that.Â”<br></div>

The 25-year-old told Czech daily Sport the switch fell through due to Shaun Wright-Phillips' reluctance to leave the champions for Villa Park.<br><br>Baros said: "I agreed [to the move] with Chelsea. It was practically a finished thing. Everything broke down over the fact Wright-Phillips did not want to go to Aston Villa. "And coach Martin O'Neill told me that without any replacement, he would not let me go as he would not have any strikers left."<br><br>Baros, who signed a three-and-a-half-year deal at the Stade Gerland with Norwegian John Carew going in the opposite direction, admitted talking to Blues coach Jose Mourinho after the goalless Premiership game at Villa Park on January 2.<br><br>"We just spoke about the match," said the former Liverpool frontman. "Just after the game in the tunnel he told me that he wanted me to join the team and asked me if I was interested. I told him so. But it did not happen in the end."<br><br>When asked if he was sorry the move did not come off, Baros The Czech Republic international replied: "I would be sorry if I went to a worse club, but now I am at Lyon."</div>
