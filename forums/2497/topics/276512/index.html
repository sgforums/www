            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Football Association has confirmed they will be looking into possible racial abuse directed at Middlesbrough's Mido, during the Tees-Tyne derby on Sunday at The Riverside.</strong><br><br>Newcastle fans subjected the Egyptian to a torrent of abuse during the 2-2 draw, and it is now claimed that some chants were Islamophobic.<br><br>"We will certainly be looking into it," an FA spokesman told the Guardian.<br><br>Both Mido and Gareth Southgate have reacted angrily to referee Mike Dean's decision to book the striker after he celebrated in front of the visiting fans after he scored.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Southgate anger</span></strong><br><br>"I find it strange that 3,000 people can abuse one person and nothing is done," said Southgate.<br><br>"On the other hand when the boot is on the other foot, it gets him into trouble.<br><br>"In terms of civil liberties I find that strange. We had to calm Mido down at the end of the first half."<br><br>Mido was also at a loss to understand his yellow card.<br><br>"I was very frustrated when the referee gave me a booking," he said.<br><br>"I don't think I deserved a yellow card but that is football, I suppose, and you have to get on with it.<br><br>"I don't understand why I was booked, though. I'm told it was for security reasons but I don't see how that is possible. I don't see why what I did affected the security of the fans. I just put my finger to my mouth to say 'quiet'."<br><br><strong>Anger</strong><br><br>Mido himself admitted he was angered by the chants, saying "I heard it; it was clear and I could understand what they were saying.<br><br>"I'm used to it from opposition fans but I just think this was ridiculous.<br><br>"I don't know why they do it. I just think they were maybe taking the p*** and maybe some of them were drunk or something, I just don't know. It made me want to score goals. I was very delighted to score once and wanted another."<br><br>Middlesbrough are due to confirm on Tuesday whether they will be making their own official complaint on the matter.</div>
