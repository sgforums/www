              <p><strong>As Liverpool progressed to their ninth European Cup semi-final with a 5-3 aggregate victory over Arsenal last night, a match enjoyed by 41,985 spectators crammed into Anfield as well as the millions watching on TV, just where were the club's two estranged American owners?</strong></p>
              <p class="story">Well, conviently or not, they were thousands of miles apart on different sides of the world as the match kicked off. Co-owner George Gillett, who was due to attend the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final at the Emirates Stadium last Wednesday only for heavy snow in north America to prevent his private plane from leaving the runway, was present on Merseyside to watch his side qualify for a last-four showdown with Chelsea.</p>
              <p class="story">The Colorado-based businessman was accompanied by his son Foster and watched the absorbing contest from the Anfield directors' box alongside Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry.</p>
              <p class="story">In the hours leading up to the match, Gillett, who is said to favour selling his share in the club to Dubai Investment Capital, was reported to have held meetings with senior staff at Anfield, including one with commercial director Ian Ayre at his Old Hall Street offices.</p>
              <p class="story">Meanwhile, his fellow American owner Tom Hicks, who was in attendance in north London on both occasions last week as Liverpool twice drew 1-1 with Arsenal, sadly could not join his compatriot, instead choosing to fly home to Dallas the previous day to watch the opening match of his Texas Rangers baseball team's new season.</p>
              <p class="story"><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/graphics/2008/04/09/hicks10409ap.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p class="story"><span style="color: #333399;">Texas Rangers owner Tom Hicks watches his baseball side take on the Baltimore Orioles in Arlington while Liverpool's contest with Arsenal at Anfield.</span></p>
              <p class="story"> </p>
              <p class="story"><strong>On his decision to attend the baseball, Hicks had said: "Opening day in baseball is like a national holiday. I would never miss our home opener, but I will have the Liverpool game on my TV. I saw two great games over there last week."</strong></p>
              <p class="story">Sure enough, the Texan was true to his word as, while taking in the Rangers match against the Baltimore Orioles in Arlington, he was also somehow managing to keep a close eye on his 'second' team's progress at Anfield - quite a feat in itself.</p>
              <p class="story">However, if there had been any technical glitches in the transmission across the Pond then Hicks need not have worried as he could always have called up his son, Tom Jnr, who was representing his father in the directors' box at Anfield.</p>
              <p class="story">But while Liverpool were going through, the Rangers were taking an 8-1 hammering, which may persuade Hicks that's he's better off on Merseyside.</p>

              <p><br>He looked for replacements because ah ben wasn't performing at that time... Even their football under him isn't attractive. Many Pool fans were asking for benny to step down...  To think that he actually went to look for a "big name" manager shows that he is actually interested in the club's future... CL alone is probably whats saving benny his job but its the league title that the Pool fans want badly and benny cannot or don't seem to be able to deliver despite being there for almost 4 yrs now...</p>
              <p>Gillett could be having problems with Hicks because he wants to sell and if Hicks don't agree he cannot sell as well... Gillett is the one that want to cash in and make over 50 million pounds and return to the USA from his one year plus of ownership... Money that would have been useful for the club... Hick seem to have a longer term plans for the club... Gillett on the other hand seems to be touting Liverpool to the Arabs like some cheap carpet...</p>

              <p><br>Obviously there hasn't been much results to go with... 4 yrs on and benny still hasn't been able not just win but to even get close to winning the premier league title... Its not as tho he hasn't been given money to spend in the transfer market... Since 2004 he has spend more than any other manager except Jose... I can only imagine the call for benny's head if they gets knock out or don't win the champions league this May...</p>
