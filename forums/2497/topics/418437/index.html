              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez is expected to be sacked as Inter Milan boss in the next 48 hours after launching an astonishing attack on club owner Massimo Moratti.</strong></p>
              <p>The former Liverpool manager hit out moments after Inter’s 3-0 Club World Cup win over Africa’s TP Mazembe, as he used the post-match press conference to pour out months of pent-up frustration.</p>
              <p>There were shades of his bitter war of words with ex-Liverpool co-owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett, towards the end of his time at Anfield, as he accused Moratti of showing favouritism to predecessor Jose Mourinho and fumed: 'Last year, Moratti spent 80 million euros on five players, but this year he has spent nothing for me.</p>

              <p><strong>'I don’t know why that has happened, but it has left me 100 per cent disappointed. I deserve more respect.</strong></p>
              <p>'In August, the club promised me three players, but none have arrived. I have had to shoulder all the blows and responsibilities.</p>
              <p>'It seems to me there are three options now for the club. One, 100 per cent support for the coach and four or five new players to build a stronger team. Two, carry on like this, without a project or any planning and go ahead with one person to blame.</p>
              <p>'Three, speak to my agent and reach an agreement. Simple.'</p>
              <p>Benitez’s blunt ultimatum for Moratti to back him or sack him looked like backfiring, as Inter’s long-serving president made it clear he took a dim view of the outburst.</p>
              <p>He vowed to savour Inter’s triumph but made it clear he was in the mood to end Benitez’s San Siro reign, after barely six months, once they returned to Milan.</p>
              <p>Asked if Benitez had ruined the Inter party, Moratti said: 'No, for the moment, no. His comments are not suitable for the situation, but, for now, this Inter fan is a happy man.</p>
              <p>'I am not going to talk about Benitez or his future for the moment.</p>
              <p>'But clearly, this is not the moment to ask for reinforcements, and it is not something we will decide now.’</p>
              <p>Benitez has kept his home on Merseyside and made no secret of his wish to return to Liverpool for a second spell in charge.</p>
              <p>Current boss Roy Hodgson is under pressure, after a poor start, but new owner John Henry would be wary of taking on a coach with a track record for picking fights behind the scenes.</p>
              <p>If Benitez is sacked, the FA will be bracing themselves for an approach for Fabio Capello from Inter.</p>

              <p>Realise that ALL of current Inter players are under Jose Mourinho de. Actually, the credit of historic 5 goes to him, not Benitez, Benitez just 'assists' him.</p>
              <p>If I not wrong, Inter Milan has many players compared to other Serie A teams, but what happened to them now???? Now 'many' players gone.... Ended up city rival Milan climb over their head now, shameful......</p>

              <p>I agree. But to be fair to Rafael, his Inter has a series of injuries. But then again, not as if other teams have no such problem as well? I'm reading from some other articles or forums that ppl are trying to help Rafael find an excuse by saying his squad had alot of shit injuries, I can't bring myself to buy this excuse.</p>

              <p>Thank for the South American representative to be eliminated faster in semi-finals aka the shocking moment.

              <p>Yes, among the teams that are playing in the tournament, the South American representative would be the one that can post the most threat. But they exited early. So for Rafael to win the cup is something of 'expected'.</p>
              <p>The way to the cup is then something great, by winning the 2009 CL at Madrid's home.</p>
