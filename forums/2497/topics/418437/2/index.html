              <p>Players who play in Europe have far more higher egos than those who play in S American. This is not healthy either. But when Benitez was in charge of Pool, he led them to WFF, but then lost to a Brazil team in grand finals........</p>
              <p>In recent years, S American teams only won two times, the rest by Europe.</p>

              <p>I agree. But to be fair to Rafael, his Inter has a series of
              injuries. But then again, not as if other teams have no such
              problem as well? I'm reading from some other articles or forums
              that ppl are trying to help Rafael find an excuse by saying his
              squad had alot of shit injuries, I can't bring myself to buy this
              excuse.</p>

              <p>Same here. It's always an excuse after another excuse. I don't recall a time when he said, "ok, i screwed up it's my mistake" it's always someone's mistake. </p>
              <p>Under Jose's Stint as manager, he and Inter's owner were in unison (till at the very end where he wanted to go to RM and even then the owner wished him well.) and Jose does not reallyspeak bad about his ex boss or players. That's how he gained support from his players and they work hard for him. Rafa..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">?</p>

              <p>Star-studded players + bad manager -&gt; Fail to win any honour of glory. However, Antecolli managed to lead Chelsea double despite his inability to help AC Milan more trophy recently &amp; finished 3rd mostly.</p>
              <p>vice versa -&gt; Might have chance to get more honury, just like Hodgson last year. But what happened to him now??? Make Liverpool more worse........</p>

I am on holiday and I am surprised by all this sack news. I am still the Inter coach.<br><br>"I am not happy with the situation that I am living in with Inter, but I am still the coach and will return to Italy."<br><br>Benitez was caught offside when asked what he made of the sack stories.<br><br>"I am surprised by all these voices in the papers," he said.<br><br>Despite Benitez's claims, there was no vote of confidence when Moratti was prompted to expand on his plans for the coach this morning.<br><br>"I don't want to create anyone any drama," said the president.</span></span></p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Benitez's agent, Manuel Garcia Quilon, was also quick to defend the coach, reiterating that the Spaniard was going nowhere.</p>
              <p>He said: "Benitez is under contract with Inter and the situation is the same as it was before. Benitez said what he said and he does not need to explain himself further. I have not been contacted by anyone."</p>
              <p>With names such as Fabio Capello and former Roma coach Luciano Spalletti being touted as possible replacements, Benitez position is looking untenable.</p>
              <p>He has received support from the head of the Italian Coaches' Association. Renzo Ulivieri told La Repubblica: "He has my support but he doesn't need it because he can stand on his own two feet.</p>
              <p>"He is a world club champion. If he asks for respect it's because obviously he has been lacking it. He has only asked for normal things."</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Rafa Benitez has come out fighting for his job and claims he has made Inter Milan more entertaining than under Jose Mourinho's uber-successful regime.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large;">The Spaniard, speaking from Liverpool where he is spending the Christmas holidays, dismissed reports that he had been sacked after publicly challenging club president Massimo Moratti to back him in the transfer market.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large;">Sources told <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>that Benitez would be axed this week, while Milan-based <span style="font-style: italic;">Gazzetta dello Sport</span> echoed that the decision had already been taken, with thoughts turning to who would take over the hot seat.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large;">However, Benitez told Spanish radio station Onda Cero: 'I have not been sacked. I am quite surprised by some of the headlines I read in the papers. In fact, many people called me to ask whether I was sacked, but it is not true.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large;">The former Liverpool boss has even been brave enough to repeat his call for new signings when the transfer window opens in January, though Moratti refused to respond to calls for 'three or four' additions at the weekend.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>'My plan was to add a few more players useful for us, younger players for the future and in a couple of years reduce the mountain of salaries we pay currently,' explained Benitez. 'People told me that this was the best football they had seen Inter play for 20 years.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large;">'We are like the Barcelona of Italy. But to continue to win and do well, you need to make important purchases. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large;">'The injuries have affected us, and we don't want this to happen again. As the market will start soon, this was the right time to speak openly about buying.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large;">Moratti responded with a 'no comment' when leaving Abu Dhabi, where Inter won the Club World Cup on Saturday and followed it up with a statement to that effect on the Inter website today.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Former Roma coach Luciano Spalletti is the favourite for his job after leading Zenit St Petersburg to the Russian Premier League title and six wins out of six in their Europa League group. England boss Fabio Capello is also a candidate Moratti has tried to snare before.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large;">Benitez said: 'I don't want to put the president under pressure, but I had spoken to him in the past about my project. Moratti, with whom I have a correct and respectful relationship, liked it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large;">'The president has to take a decision regarding the line we want to follow. While I am here (at Inter) I will work in the best possible way in order for the team to continue to win.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large;">Jose Mourinho won the European Cup along with an Italian League and Cup double, while Benitez's Inter are languishing seventh in Serie A and finished second in their Champions League group behind Tottenham.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large;">However, the club have suffered an injury crisis and Benitez has blamed the poor physical shape of his players.</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez's sacking by Inter Milan will be confirmed on Wednesday, and the former </strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> </span>manager faces further humiliation after it emerged that failed AC Milan coach Leonardo has been lined up to replace him. </strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span> revealed on Monday how Benitez had talked himself out of a job by turning on owner Massimo Moratti in the wake of Inter's Club World Cup triumph in Abu Dhabi, and the San Siro chief ended the Spaniard's reign in a phone call on Tuesday night, six months into a two-year contract.</p>
              <p>The news was relayed to Benitez at the home he has kept near Liverpool and will be ratified in an official statement this morning.</p>
              <p>Benitez was frequently at odds with owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett during his time at Anfield and must have known what was at stake when he challenged Moratti's authority on Sunday, effectively calling on the owner to back him with transfer funds or sack him.</p>
              <p>Benitez said: 'Last year, Moratti spent 80million euros on five players, but this year he has spent nothing for me. It has left me 100 per cent disappointed.</p>
              <p>'It seems to me there are three options now for the club. One, 100 per cent support for the coach and four or five new players to build a stronger team. Two, carry on like this, without a project or any planning and go ahead with one person to blame. Three, speak to my agent and reach an agreement. Simple.'</p>
              <p>Unsurprisingly, the all-powerful Moratti chose the latter option and delayed implementing his decision only for fear of handing Benitez the initiative in any dispute over a pay-off.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/12/21/article-1340677-0C8BFAF4000005DC-647_468x286.jpg" alt="Divided: Moratti (R) and Benitez with FIFA president Sepp Blatter in Abu Dhabi" width="468" height="286">

              <p><strong>He was still choosing his words from the club's offices in Milan and, asked whether Benitez was still in charge, said: 'At this precise moment, he is, yes.' </strong></p>
              <p>The phone call soon followed and, as Benitez reflected on a brief stay at the European champions, his mood will not have been helped by a clear signal that Leonardo is heading back to the San Siro to fill his boots, despite his time as AC Milan boss ending with Silvio Berlusconi firing him.</p>
              <p>Moratti was eager to take former Roma coach Luciano Spalletti back to Serie A but a £5m compensation payment to Zenit St Petersburg, on top of personal terms, was prohibitive.</p>
              <p>Instead, he will turn to Leonardo, and his motives say much about a personality that was always likely to put him at odds with Benitez, given the former Liverpool manager's craving for control.</p>
              <p>A San Siro source said: 'Leonardo was just behind Spalletti on Moratti's list of candidates, but he is available and he knows the club after his time at Milan. Also, Moratti grew to like and admire Leonardo for the work he did here. He felt he conducted himself extremely well under difficult circumstances and was harshly treated when Milan got rid of him.</p>
              <p>'But there is more to it than that. Berlusconi is more than just a local rival. Moratti does not like him as a political figure, and the thought of taking on a coach Milan sacked and turning him into a great success with Inter is too good to resist. If he can pull it off, he would see it as a double victory.</p>
              <p>'He likes to be in control, and Benitez never had a chance of surviving once he took him on and gave him an ultimatum. There was only ever going to be one outcome.'</p>
              <p>With Benitez choosing to keep his home on Merseyside and making no secret of his wish to manage Liverpool for a second time, rumours were rife that Roy Hodgson may have to make way for a homecoming that would divide opinion among the club's vast support.</p>

              <p><strong>New owner John Henry, who bought out Hicks and Gillett in an acrimonious power struggle earlier this season, would surely be wary of taking on a coach with a track record for picking fights behind the scenes. </strong></p>
              <p>Benitez has had a torrid time since taking over at Inter from Jose Mourinho, whose side won the Champions League, the Serie A title and the Coppa Italia last season.</p>
              <p>Inter have struggled to show such dominance this season and are 13 points behind leaders AC Milan.</p>
              <p>They are through to the last 16 of the Champions League but only after finishing runners-up to Tottenham, who soundly beat them 3-1 in the group stage at White Hart Lane.</p>

              <p>When it comes to Rafa for Pool fans, it can be quite confusing... Cos he did brought them some glory by winning the CL in his first year, while there are those from every club Pool fans included who belief you are only as good as your last season... So it has been like 5 seasons Rafa has brought them nothing but more disappointment after another...</p>
              <p>I know some Pool fans who refused to credit Rafa with Pool's CL win even till today... Some thinks it's Houllier's team that won it, others think it's Gerrard who got them the win in the first place, while some non Pool fans thinks it's Lotti's mess up at half-time that gave it away... Whatever the reason, I guess all 3 played a prominent part...</p>
              <p>And I think there are probably some who felt Pool shouldn't even have been in the final after Luis Garcia's 'ghost goal' against Chelsea in the semi final... lol.</p>
              <p>But whatever it is, Rafa got the benefit of being the man who took them there and we can't change history...</p>

              <p>hmm that one imo is 50-50. He had the tactics then which adapted
              with the game. On the other hand, there was gerrard who inspired
              that famous comeback.</p>

              <p>Bingo, I agree with you. But he might just be lucky to get the tactics right for that night.</p>
