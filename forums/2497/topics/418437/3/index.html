              <p>Reports that Rafael Benitez has been sacked by Inter Milan have begun to emerge from Italy and England, but <em>Nerazzurri</em> president Massimo Moratti has stated that he is still the club's manager.</p>

              <p><strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/855599?cc=5739"></a></strong></p>
              <p>Speculation
               has been rife in recent days that the parting of ways of Benitez and 
              Inter is inevitable, though the Spanish boss claimed on Monday that 
              rumours he had been sacked were not true.</p>
              <p>"I have not been 
              sacked," Benitez said. "Many people that read the newspapers today have 
              called me up to ask me if I had been dismissed. It's not true, I am 
              surprised that it has been reported as a done thing.</p>
              <p>"I am currently on holiday to rest and then to begin again. For months I have heard and read things that are not true.''</p>
              <p>New
               reports that he had been sacked emerged on Tuesday, just four days 
              after he led Inter to the FIFA Club World Cup title in Abu Dhabi.</p>
              <p>But <em>Nerazzurri </em> owner Massimo Moratti denied that Benitez had been fired, saying: "At 
              this moment the manager of Inter is effectively still Benitez. That is 
              factually correct, if I'm not wrong."</p>
              <p>"I read about all these other names in the media, but the club won't contact any other coach until the situation is clarified."</p>
              <p>Former
               AC Milan manager Leonardo has been touted by the Italian media as a 
              controversial favourite to replace Benitez should the Spanish boss 
              leave.</p>
              <p>Benitez, 50, is currently on holiday in Liverpool as Inter have begun their winter break.</p>
              <p>Inter
               have been decimated by injuries and are 13 points adrift of city rivals
               AC Milan in the Serie A title hunt, albeit having played two games 
              fewer than the<em> Rossoneri.</em></p>
              <p>They next take to the field against Napoli on January 6, after the league's winter break.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think the media is trying to generate more income + page views by doing this sort of publicity. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>sometime ago, someone put in clauses and other shit which made it clear that if the club fired him, he would be compensated.. and if he wanted out, he would pay the club a certain amount of money...</p>

              <p>Benitez
               had been under heavy pressure after the side slumped to seventh in 
              Serie A and, although the Club World Cup success this month appeared to 
              have handed him a reprieve, he issued an ultimatum to president Massimo 
              Moratti in the aftermath demanding backing in the transfer market.</p>
              <p>Benitez,
               who left Liverpool in the summer after a disappointing season in the 
              Premier League and Champions League, was handed the task of succeeding 
              Jose Mourinho after their Treble-winning season.</p>
              <p>His reign began 
              badly, losing the European Super Cup to Atletico Madrid, and the side 
              were never able to replicate the form of the previous season. Inter 
              finished second, behind Tottenham, in their Champions League group, 
              leading to a meeting with last season's beaten finalists Bayern Munich 
              in the next round.</p>
              <p>Following his ultimatum, reports surfaced at 
              the start of the week that Moratti had moved to axe the coach, but it 
              was not until Thursday morning that the decision was officially 
              confirmed.</p>
              <p>A club statement read: "Inter Milan and Rafael Benitez 
              can announce that they have reached a mutually satisfactory agreement 
              for the early termination of his contract.</p>
              <p>"Inter thank Rafael Benitez for his work in leading his team to success in the Italian Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup."</p>
              <p>Manchester
               City manager Roberto Mancini, dismissed by Moratti after winning his 
              third successive Serie A title in 2008, earlier on Thursday said he 
              believes Benitez has been harshly treated.</p>
              <p>"The difference is that I was at the club for four years," he told <em>La Stampa</em>. "Benitez will have been there for six months if it's true that he is being sacked.</p>
              <p>"As
               a colleague, I am sorry for him. Despite the problems Rafa's had, he's 
              won the Italian Super Cup and the Club World Cup and I am sure that 
              Inter will re-enter the title race.</p>
              <p>"They weren't doing badly, but then again neither was I and that year we won the <em>Scudetto</em> again."</p>
              <p>Benitez
               has been on holiday in Liverpool in recent days, leading to speculation
               he could return to Anfield, although Roy Hodgson believes that is 
              unlikely.</p>
              <p>"It would be surprising," he said. "If he was the right 
              man for the job then it would have been wiser not to let him go and then
               bring him back.</p>
              <p>"This job will always have lots of people linked 
              with it. When you occupy one of the top jobs in the country, it would be
               very strange if other people were not linked with your job. I'm sure 
              there are people who are very envious of my position and would very much
               like to take my place."</p>
