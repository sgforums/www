              <p>ok, lets not make this a big fuss</p>
              <p>what i meant was kuyt should not be a solo striker; he can have Maxi to share the goalscoring burden. wouldn't this be better and we could add another goal or 2?</p>
              <p>and meanwhile, i still hope rafa will push the team up with the pressure of being sacked (of course not getting sacked).</p>

              <p>You know why? Because Rafa is working for one of the biggest team in football with rich history and high expectation (understandable after 20 yrs without EPL trophy, and the bragging right gonna be snatched away from ManU also).</p>
              <p>He will be a hero if he work as a manager at mid to bottom teams.</p>

              <p>i now support rafa.<br>for real.</p>
              <p>like what sg_forum said, rafa has high expectation to work with, because liverpool is a top 4 club, he is expected to win games.<br><br>if rafa took charge of like, leciester for example. he will not be expected to do big things.</p>
              <p>further like sg_forum had said again, liverpool has not won the trophy for very long, and all the more pressure is heaped on rafa's shoulder. we should support him rather than going against him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>like some forumers do here, i'd emphasize some.</p>

              <p>My stand against Ah Ben will not change just because he won a match.</p>
              <p>He achieved greatness with Ah Hou's squad.</p>
              <p>He is too ultra-defensive and rely too much on uncreative players like Kuyt to play.</p>
              <p>Without Torres and Stevie, he cannot make it to top four.</p>
              <p>Liverpool cannot become 1st with him around.</p>

              <p>but there r also some who say beating manu is just 3 points, wont make a huge difference except in terms of confidence, morale bla bla bla.</p>
              <p>anyway if u notice liverpool always play better, or rather higher chance of winning when kuyt was playing as a striker. be it lone or partner torres.</p>
              <p>he is a good distraction to draw defenders away from torres. anyway he was a striker at feyenoord and in his earlier liverpool days. dont know why the hell he suddenly become a right winger when babel n benayoun is around. now even got maxi! mayb he is too hardworking for his own good</p>
