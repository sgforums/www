              <h1>Robinho Calls Press Conference</h1>
              <h2>The immediate future of Robinho may soon be known, as the Real Madrid want-away has called a press conference to be held later today...</h2>

              <p><strong>Robinho has had a foot in the exit door at the Santiago Bernabeu virtually all summer. Initially tipped to join Manchester United as part of the proposed (and now defunct) deal to bring Cristiano Ronaldo to <em>los Blancos</em>, the 24-year-old has been a fixture on Chelsea's radar over the past few weeks.<br></strong><br>The Brazilian forward recently declared his desire to make the switch to Stamford Bridge, and a deal worth just over £28million appeared to be sealed earlier in the week. Indeed, the Blues had already begun selling shirts emblazoned with Robinho's name when <em>los Merengues </em>announced that they hope to keep the player.<br><br>Real's surprise U-turn came only days after they insisted they will not force Robinho to stay, and <em>Sky Sports News</em> reports that the former Santos star will hit back with an announcement of his own this afternoon.<br><br>It is believed the <em>Selecao</em> man will reiterate his wish to join Chelsea, but he could in fact reveal a plan to take matters into his own hands - such as buying out his own contract.<br><br>Robinho will not feature in Real's La Liga opener against Deportivo La Coruna this afternoon.</p>

              <h2>Robinho has stated that he has told Real Madrid that he wants to leave and believes that the club are only trying to keep him because they have failed to buy a replacement.</h2>
              <p>The Brazilian forward held a personally arranged press conference on Sunday after being left out of the squad to face Deportivo and took a swipe at Los Merengues.<br><br>Chelsea have made it clear that they are willing to pay him €6m-per-year and have made two bids, but Madrid will not sell until they have bought a new player and that has infuriated Robinho.<br><br>"I have told Schuster and Pedja that I want to leave the club," Robinho told reporters. <br><br>"My agent has gone to the club a thousand times to speak to them and the club has not shown any interest in keeping me.<br><br>"Now that the club have failed to sign anyone else, suddenly they want me to stay."<br><br>Robinho then stated that Schuster had not made him feel at home or that he was invaluable, despite reports that the German is keen to hold on to the player.<br><br>"Schuster is not my father, he is only my coach," he continued.<br><br>The one option that the former Santos star now has is to buy out his own contract and then move to Stamford Bridge, but with the price of that move costing €50m Chelsea are weighing up their options.<br><br>If Robinho is not granted his wish to leave the Bernabéu then he has admitted that he will grudgingly continue to play for Madrid adding: "I will, but it will be not be fun."</p>

              <h1>Madrid Slam Chelsea Over Robinho</h1>
              <h2>In an angry statement on their official website, Real Madrid have hit out at Chelsea for what they deem as unacceptable conduct regarding Robinho. The Brazilian winger re-iterated today that he wished to leave Spain to join the Blues...</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/12146_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="180"></p>
              <p><em>Calderon upset with Chelsea<strong> <em>taking pre-orders on Robinho shirts.</em></strong></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The player himself held a press conference earlier today, stating that he wishes to leave Real for Luiz Felipe Scolari’s Chelsea. The 24-year-old was thought to be moving to Chelsea last week, but the deal hit snags after Chelsea started to take pre-orders on Robinho club shirts, believing the deal to be all but completed.</strong> <br><br>This angered Real Madrid and club president Ramon Calderon in particular. The Blancos still do not want to sell the Brazilian forward, and have rejected several moves by Chelsea for him.<br><br>However, recent developments, not least the appearance on the Chelsea store website of Robinho replica shirts, have not gone down well at the Bernabeu: “The club refers to an earlier statement on the subject, when we said that if the player's final decision was to unilaterally end his contract, we would have no option but to accept it,” read a statement on Real's official club website. <br><br>“Real deplore the way Chelsea's directors have acted despite knowing perfectly well the decision not to sell the player, making statements and even going so far as to sell shirts with the player's name on through their official website,” the club website statement continued. <br><br>The proposed transfer now hangs in the balance. With Madrid unwilling to sell, but Robinho wanting to move, the decision will seemingly come down to Ramon Calderon, and whether he decides to accept a Chelsea offer for the Brazilian or not.<br><br>On the strength of this statement it seems unlikely that he will, even though coach Bernd Schuster has omitted the former Santos man from his squad to face Deportivo.</p>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p>Chelsea have 'refuted' Real Madrid's criticism regarding their conduct in the bid to sign Robinho. Brazilian striker Robinho held a press conference on Sunday to reiterate his desire to join Chelsea before the transfer window closed.</p>
              <p>Real responded by issuing a statement which hit out at Chelsea's behaviour, particularly an incident which saw shirts bearing Robinho's name go on sale on the club's website. But the Blues have now defended their interest in Robinho, having made a formal offer, and say the shirt incident was 'a regrettable accident'.</p>
              <p>"There is nothing wrong with publicly confirming our interest in a player when the club involved is well aware of it, has been in receipt of two bids and is negotiating to sell the player," read Chelsea's statement.</p>
              <p>"So we completely refute any criticism from Real Madrid. "As for the issue regarding the website, Real are well aware this was a regrettable accident by an external supplier which was rectified as soon as it was brought to our attention and not a single shirt was sold."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Chelsea manager Luiz Felipe Scolari admits he is uncertain if Robinho will be part of his squad for the rest of the season. Scolari has expressed a wish to work with his compatriot, but is leaving the transfer negotiations in the hands of Blues chief executive Peter Kenyon.</p>
              <p>"About Robinho, it is not my business," said Scolari. "I don't know nothing. You know what I know - zero! "Ask Peter Kenyon or (Real Madrid president Ramon) Calderon. I didn't think about Robinho in the last few days because I needed to train my players. "He is not my player. When one player is my player I will say something."</p>
