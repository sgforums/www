              <h1>William Gallas, David Beckham and Shaquille O'Neal star in our Top 10 sporting feuds</h1>
              <p></p>
              <p class="up"> </p>
              <p class="up"><img src="http://images.mirror.co.uk/upl/m4/nov2008/2/9/BB3AC1D3-D6F9-D178-194BCACD57F06484.jpg" border="0" alt="Gallas 450" width="450" height="140"></p>
              <p class="up"> </p>
              <p><em>Arsenal skipper William Gallas has opened a can of worms at The Emirates by slagging of his team mates left, right and centre. They lack commitment and the desire to win, he moaned, and with these words the Frenchman immediately ostracised himself from the rest of the Arsenal dressing room. Good work, William. He’s not the first sportsman to have a gripe with a team mate though…</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>1) Trouble in the England camp</strong><br>Shortly before Sven-Goran Eriksson took charge of England in 2001 there were two problems within the England camp that FA chiefs hoped the Swede would sort out: gambling, and a rift between the Manchester United and Liverpool players. The Scousers and the Mancs wouldn’t sit on the same table as each other at dinner and refused to be near each other on the team bus. Sven soon resolved the problem by uniting all squad members with a common goal: losing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>2) Andy Cole v Teddy Sheringham</strong><br>Rarely have two people who hated each other so much played so beautifully together as Manchester United’s strike duo Andy and Teddy. The legendary rift between the pair started in 1998 when Sheringham publicly blamed Cole for Bolton's goal in a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford. The pair barely communicated off the pitch for the next three seasons.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>3) David Beckham v Sir Alex Ferguson</strong><br>Staying at Old Trafford, David Beckham's simmering feud with boss Alex Ferguson was the catalyst for his departure from the club in 2003. Fergie was unhappy with Becks’ flash lifestyle and seemingly punished him for his fame. Tension between the pair reached breaking point when Fergie ordered Beckham to fly from London to Manchester ahead of the World Club Championship in Japan. After joining his team mates in Manchester the entire squad flew to Tokyo - via London.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>4) Joey Barton v Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard<br></strong>Following the fall out from the 2006 World Cup, bad-boy Joey Barton found himself called into the England squad. Good news for Joey, you think? Think again. Young Barton was ostracised in training by a handful of players after he had the cheek to attack their World Cup dairies and hastily cobbled together autobiographies. The Man City midfielder had particularly enraged Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard who he claimed shouldn’t have written books after their terrible displays. Apparently he was most upset that ‘Totally Frank’ didn’t feature a chapter about Lampard's</p>
              <p></p>
              <p class="up"> </p>
              <p><strong>5) Emlyn Hughes v Tommy Smith</strong><br>Former Liverpool players Emlyn Hughes and Tommy Smith didn’t get on during their playing days and this rift continued after they’d retired. During his after dinner speech routine Smith would joke that Hughes’ self-styled nickname was 'Crazy Horse', but he was known in the dressing room as ‘Thrush’, because he was an irritating… you can work the rest out yourself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>6) Claude Davis v Ade Akinbiyi</strong><br>Sheffield United team-mates Claude Davis v Ade Akinbiyi weren’t very matey in 2006 when Davis pulled out a cut-throat razor during a training ground bust-up. Well, Sheffield are known as the blades…</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>7) Steve Smith v Ken Lucas</strong><br>Footballers in America have it in them to turn on their own team mates too, as Carolina Panthers' wide receiver Steve Smith proved this summer. His feud with defensive back Ken Lucas came to a head during training camp when Smith broke Lucas’ nose with a punch to the face.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>8) Wasim Akram v Waqar Younis</strong><br>Cricket is not without its infighting as the Pakistan national side has proved countless times over the years. One of Pakistan’s most famous feuds was between Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. The two simply didn’t get on and couldn’t stand to be in the same room as each other. ‘Convenient’ injuries meant they often wouldn’t appear on the same team sheet, or in fact be in the same country as each other.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>9) Martina Hingis v Anna Kournikova</strong><br>Female tennis players can be very bitchy indeed. No more so than Martina Hingis and Anna Kournikova who never saw eye to eye. Hingis was by far the better player, but Kournikova has the modelling contracts and media attention. Early on in their careers The Russian is reported to have told Hingis after a heavy defeat: “You won, but I'm prettier and more marketable than you.” Oooh, catty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>10) Shaquille O'Neal v Kobe Bryant</strong><br>The Shaq-Kobe feud is so famous that it has its own Wikipedia entry. The LA Lakers stars played together from 1996 to 2004 and spent most of that time hating each other’s guts. O’Neal even wrote a rap in honour of Kobe titled “Tell me how my ass tastes”. Enough said.</p>
