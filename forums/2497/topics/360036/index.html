              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Manchester City manager Mark
              Hughes does not believe he is getting the praise he deserves for his
              first year's work at Eastlands.</span></strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/09/04/330/Mark-Hughes_2151199.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>

              </span></p><p><strong>The Blues head to Tottenham on Saturday needing a victory to maintain their hopes of qualifying for next year's Europa League. </strong></p>
              <p>Spurs are also in the same position, despite a tepid start to
              the campaign under Juande Ramos, Harry Redknapp eventually being called
              in to sort the mess out.</p>
              <p>Redknapp has been credited with Spurs' revival, further
              enhancing a reputation that blossomed at Bournemouth and West Ham
              before he added the FA Cup to his CV at Portsmouth last season.</p>
              <p>Hughes notes no such accolades coming his way, even though he
              felt the team he inherited from Sven-Goran Eriksson not only lacked
              quality but also sufficient strength in certain areas to challenge for
              major honours.</p>
              <p>"If you look at all the managers in a similar position in the
              league to us, they seem to get a lot of plaudits," observed Hughes.</p>
              <p>"I don't get many. That is predictable and understandable I suppose.</p>
              <p>"Harry Redknapp has done a good job at Spurs. But I feel it is
              very similar to myself, it's just that he gets a bit more credit than I
              do."</p>
              <p>Hughes recognises analysis of his own work tends to be more critical because of the vast wealth he has been afforded.</p>
              <p>It means City are linked with all the top stars in Europe, Real
              Madrid legend Raul the latest big name the Eastlands outfit have been
              forced to distance themselves from as potential deal makers spring up
              claiming to act on behalf of the club.</p>
              <p>"That is the world we live in," he shrugged.</p>
              <p>"What we have to do is make sure people understand the process
              we go through when we want to acquire players. We have worked really
              hard to send that message out.</p>
              <p>"At the moment a lot of people are flying around professing to
              have mandates to do deals for Manchester City. It was always going to
              happen I suppose."</p>
