            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Jose Mourinho has admitted that he would love to have Benni McCarthy at his displosal once again.</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.football.co.uk/shared/images/players/players_17920.jpg"><br><br>Jose is known to be a great admirer of the South African, who was a key member of his hugely successful Porto side.<br><br>He made a Â£1.8million from Porto last summer, and has been one of the best newcomers in England (along with Berbatov), scoring 18 times.<br><br>The Chelsea boss admits that he is a big fan of the striker, and that he asked Blackburn about him.<br><br>"Benni had a great first season," Mourinho told The Sun. "He quickly settled into the English game.<br><br>"He is the kind of striker every coach wants, and I am no exception. IÂ’ve worked with him successfully in the past at FC Porto. I do like Benni.<br><br>"IÂ’m not surprised about his achievements. He could score goals anywhere. If he stays injury free, heÂ’ll surpass his achievement of last season."<br><br>He then lifted the lid on the approach, revealing that McCarthy was also keen on the move.<br><br>"I saw the possibility of us reuniting at Chelsea, but he has a contract," revealed the Portuguese.<br><br>"I could tell that he wanted to play for me again, because we had a wonderful time together [at Porto].<br><br>"But Blackburn said he was not for sale and you have to respect that."<br><br>That hasn't stopped Chelsea before, but with the mega bucks no longer behind him, Mou is trying out the 'softly softly' approach this time around.<br><br><span class="small">source:goal.com</span></div>
