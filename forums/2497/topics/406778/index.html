              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger last night became the first high-profile manager to hit out against the new rule limiting Barclays Premier League clubs to a squad list of 25 senior players, claiming it is a 'disastrous decision for football'.</strong></p>
              <p>The Arsenal boss criticised the changes, designed to encourage homegrown development, and declared his astonishment that the PFA had sanctioned regulations which are likely to force footballers out of work. </p>
              <p>'This is a disastrous decision for football and for the players,' said Wenger. 'I was quite amazed the union accepted it. I'm not a big fan.</p>
              <p>'First, it puts many players without clubs. That's the mathematical consequence. Secondly, it puts the clubs in a weak position in the transfer market because when you already have 25 players and you buy another one, you know you now have to get rid of one.</p>
              <p>'You have to calculate when you buy a player how much it costs to get rid of one. The big clubs will always have 25 top players and you will not stop that by this kind of decision. When the big clubs employ a player and he has to go to a smaller club there are only two solutions: the smaller club has to pay above their own potential or the big club pays part of his salary. In either case it's not satisfactory.'</p>
              <p>Once again, Wenger has been under fire from his own fans for resisting the temptation to spend a lot during this transfer window.</p>
              <p>Arsenal have signed defender Laurent Koscielny for £10million from Lorient and Marouane Chamakh on a free transfer from Bordeaux but the manager admits he would like to recruit at least one more experienced centre half.</p>
              <p>'We have lost Mikael Silvestre, William Gallas and Sol Campbell and only signed Koscielny until now,' said Wenger. 'Johan Djourou is coming back from injury and so you could say we have signed two, but number-wise we are still short.' </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/30/article-0-0A6BA614000005DC-304_468x364.jpg" alt="Cesc Fabregas" width="468" height="364"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><em>He's staying put: Cesc Fabregas wore a Barca shirt when he celebrated Spain's World Cup win with Pepe Reina but he is going nowhere, insists Wenger</em></div>
              <p><strong>Wenger would also like to sign a goalkeeper, with Fulham's Mark Schwarzer high on the wish-list, but said: 'Frankly, we are not close to signing anybody, so I can't say this player or that player will be ours next season.</strong></p>
              <p>'It's almost the beginning of August and we have the quality of players to fight at the top. Look at our squad and we have international players in every position, two internationals in every position.</p>
              <p>'We' re looking outside to strengthen the squad and if we find the right players we will do it. There are always two periods of activity in the transfer window, very early and very late. I always did business very early and I always did it very late. The transfer market overall is very quiet. Clubs are very tight with money. I don't think Manchester City reflect in general the financial state of international football.'</p>
              <p>Behind his transfer policy is Wenger's refusal to hinder development of youngsters he rates. 'We have to remind ourselves that we decided to go with a very young team three or four years ago and we have developed this team,' he said. 'Two years ago, we were quite far away but last year, in April, we were two points away from the top. We should be closer again because that development is part of a young team.</p>
              <p>'I know that in England when you do not win the championship it's always about buying but what is important is that we improve. We're not a team at the end of a cycle. We are at the start of a cycle. Our future will be decided not only by who we buy or need, but also by how much we improve.'</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">It is in the soul-searching aftermath of an England failure at a major tournament that thoughts invariably turn towards the next generation, the young players who will one day, at long last, drive the nation to glory. The debate, however, can lead to further introspection. In the </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Premier League</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> years, with clubs' squads bloated by overseas players, where is the opportunity for homegrown talent?</span></strong></p>
              <p>Things could be about to change or, at least, a step is to be taken in what is hoped will prove the right direction. As of this season, following Premier League legislation that has been some years in the making, clubs will be forced to include eight homegrown players in a senior squad of no more than 25.</p>
              <p>Homegrown players are defined as those having been trained at a club or clubs in England or Wales for three years before the end of the season in which they became 21.</p>
              <p>Homegrown players do not have to be English. Cesc Fábregas, for example, <span style="color: #000000;">Arsenal</span><span style="color: #000000;">'s Spain midfielder, qualifies, having moved to north London as a 16-year-old. It ought to be pointed out, though, that of the 300 scholars currently at Premier League academies (the 16-18 age group) 245 are English.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Under the new legislation, clubs are also permitted to register and play an unlimited number of under-21s. The theory is that when injuries and suspensions bite in the senior squad, managers will have to turn to youth. It is expected that particularly over the second half of the season, substitute benches will be dotted with academy players.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">If clubs cannot fill their quota of eight homegrown players, then their senior squads will be short. The champions </span><span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span> for example, only have five homegrown players (John Terry, Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard, Ross Turnbull and Michael Mancienne). As things stand, the manager, Carlo Ancelotti, will have to name a senior squad of 22 and opportunities will increase for his under-21s. That the players most likely to step up are Gaël Kakuta, Fabio Borini, Jeffrey Bruma and Patrick van Aanholt – in other words, overseas youngsters – is a moot point, and one reflected at other clubs. English players, though, must embrace the competition.</p>
              <p>"We'll reflect on this regulation in five or 10 years' time and think it was exactly the right thing to do," said Huw Jennings, the Fulham academy director. "It's not just about the England team, although that is the focus after the World Cup, it's about young players, who are the long-term lifeblood of the game and it's about strengthening the Premier League. Young players should emerge on merit, not because of tokenism, but if we have fewer players in the squads it will create more opportunities."</p>
              <p>It is hoped the new regulations will have pluses that go beyond the encouragement of homegrown and academy players and provide clubs with the incentive to continue investing in their youth-development programmes. They might also discourage them from stockpiling senior players and so offer an economic benefit.</p>
              <p>"While the sporting factor of encouraging youth development was the main driver behind [the new regulations], it is anticipated that there will also be financial benefits in operating with a smaller pool of contracted players and a higher number of young players developed in England," said Mike Foster, the Premier League general secretary. "It is also hoped that a by-product of the new system will be a bigger pool of players for England to choose from."</p>
              <p>But not everyone is convinced. "They mess about with everything, don't they?" said <span style="color: #000000;">the </span><span style="color: #000000;">Tottenham Hotspur</span><span style="color: #000000;"> manager, Harry Redknapp. "And what difference is it going to make? It's no different really. If the young players are good enough, they'll come through. And if you're having to play them just because they're young and English but they're not good enough, then the league won't improve. They've got to be good enough, wherever they're from.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"You might also get some kids who get in the 25 and then put their feet under the table and don't work on their game. You've got to deserve to be in there, rather than just having them for the sake of it, token players."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">One of the principal arguments against the legislation is that it could leave players over the age of 21 out in the cold. If they are not named in the 25, they cannot play until squad changes are permitted in the next transfer window. The </span><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester City</span> manager, Roberto Mancini, has 32 senior players at his disposal – following the sale of Javier Garrido to Lazio today and he is under pressure to sell seven of them before the end of August.</p>
              <p>"I am quite surprised the players' union accepted this rule as it could put many players out of a job," said the Arsenal manager, Arsène Wenger. "They want to fight against unemployment but they stop us employing footballers. There is no room to move [in the transfer market]. Is 25 enough, given the injuries? It is an artificial rule that I don't like."</p>
              <p>"One of the worries," added Jennings, "is the premium that will be placed on the movement from club to club of players who qualify as homegrown. Their price will be driven up, there would be an inflated view of them and I don't think that is healthy."</p>
              <p>Concerns have also been expressed about clubs effectively stockpiling their under-21 players to guard against selection crises, rather than loan them out to gain the first-team minutes that can be vital for their development at that stage. It is not always possible to insert instant recall clauses into loan deals.</p>
              <p>Yet it ought not to be forgotten that it was the clubs who voted in the legislation at their September meeting of last year. "I've heard that the [club] owners are only interested in the product, but they sanctioned this," said Ged Roddy, the Premier League's director of academies. "They recognise that if we can develop our own players, then we have a much stronger product. We want to get more homegrown players into our first teams. The more we do, the more chance we have of an outstanding England team in the future. This is more than a half-step forward."</p>
