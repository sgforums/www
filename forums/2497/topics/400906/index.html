              <h1>Joe Hart adds to fears over the 'terrible' World Cup ball that he 
              just can't catch</h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Joe Hart hopes that whoever gets to play in goal for England has a 
              head for heights because he believes that coping with FIFA’s new match 
              ball could be a major problem.</p>
              <p>Hart, 23, is confident he can 
              handle the pressure if Fabio Capello gives him the nod ahead of the more
               experienced David James and Rob Green.</p>
              <p>But handling the 
              official Jabulani ball, named after the isiZulu word for ‘be happy’, is 
              another matter, particularly after altitude training showed how it will 
              work a few thousand feet above sea level where England play their first 
              game.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Barking mad: Joe Hart is enjoying the challenge 
              that the new World Cup ball creates</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar has already called the ball ‘terrible’,
               saying it looks like it comes from a ‘grocery store’, while Capello 
              said: ‘It’s terrible for keepers as it’s always moving.’</p>
              <p>Hart’s
               verdict is succinct.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/29/article-1282499-09A7EC32000005DC-419_306x423.jpg" alt="Training hard: Hart has impressed during drills and was a safe 
              pair of hands against Mexico" width="306" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Training hard: Hart has impressed during drills 
              and was a safe pair of hands against Mexico</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>‘They’re doing anything but staying in my gloves,’ he said with a 
              smile. ‘It’s hard work with them, but good fun. It makes the game 
              exciting and I think that’s what they are trying to do with it.’</p>
              <p>And
               the altitude? </p>
              <p>‘It’s been all right. Obviously it has not been as
               high and intense 
              as it will be in South Africa. We’ve had our little gas masks on in the 
              evening, everybody’s bought into it and respects that it’s going to be 
              different.</p>
              <p>'It’s just exciting to see. I think we’re about 900 metres up where 
              we’re training, the air’s pretty thin and the balls fly fast. I think 
              there’s an awful lot of respect between the keepers.</p>
              <p>‘Whoever Mr Capello chooses, the other two will be right behind him, 
              myself included. We’re a unit, we’ve got to be behind each other.’ </p>

              <h2>2010</h2>
              <p>The
               Jabulani, the official football for the 2010 World Cup, was developed 
              by adidas in conjunction with academics at Loughborough University.</p>
              <p>The
               revolutionary design features eight moulded panels and a ‘grip and 
              groove’ texture, which is claimed to provide ‘unmatched flight 
              characteristics’.</p>
              <p>Eleven colours are used on the ball, 
              representing a team’s 11 players as well as the 11 official languages of
               South Africa and the 11 tribes that make up the Rainbow Nation.</p>
              <h2>1540s</h2>
              <p>The
               oldest football still in existence was made from a pig’s bladder 
              covered with leather.</p>
