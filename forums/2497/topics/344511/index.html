              <p class="small bold"><em>Scolari is offering £15million plus Anelka, Malouda, Kalou and a centre-back, for Robinho.</em></p>
              <p> </p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">PHIL SCOLARI last night put his entire squad up for sale — and wants to exchange four of them for Manchester City’s Robinho! </h2>
              <p class="article">I can reveal Scolari is trying to get the Brazilian to Chelsea after missing out in August. And the struggling Blues boss even invited clubs to make an offer for any of his players. </p>
              <p class="article">Scolari said: “I know many managers and assistants are calling the players saying this or that. Now is the time for ALL of my players — call and buy.” </p>
              <p class="article">He is offering £15million plus <strong>FOUR</strong> players, Nicolas Anelka, Florent Malouda, Salomon Kalou and a centre-back, for Robinho. His chances of success seem non-existent, with City relying heavily on Robinho to persuade his Brazilian team-mate Kaka to join them from AC Milan. </p>
              <p class="article">But Scolari believes there is a chance Kaka may turn down City’s offer, leaving Robinho unsettled. Scolari added: “Every day I look in the papers about contact for players. OK. Pay what the club wants and go. “If you don’t go, stay here. But stay because this job is very good and because you love the club. Finish. If not, for any player I have youngsters. If I lost 3-0 or 5-0 it’s the same.” </p>
              <p class="article">Robinho knows of Chelsea’s interest but has started to feel an affinity with City where he has a strong rapport with the fans. However, he also has a big affection for Scolari. </p>
              <p class="article">SunSport revealed on Thursday that Kaka has insisted if he does join City, Robinho must never be sold while he is there. That is because Kaka also knows of Chelsea’s continuing pursuit of the striker. </p>
              <p class="article">Scolari was furious when Chelsea lost out to City in the £32.5m battle for Robinho’s services on the very last day of the transfer window. He has vowed ever since that if he could find a way of getting Robinho out of City he would. </p>
              <p class="article">A source close to Robinho said: “This is an amazing twist to what’s going on with Kaka. City have to keep Robinho if Kaka is to go there but if Kaka stays at AC Milan then Robinho will have a decision to make.”</p>

              <p><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00711/Phil_Scolari_711119a.jpg" alt="Phil Scolari" width="280" height="390"></p>
              <p><em>Scolari, is he looking for a way out of Chelsea and a £10million pay-off?</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">THROUGH his increasingly erratic and controversial rants, it is getting more difficult to decipher just what Phil Scolari wants. Does he want man-to-man marking or zonal defending? Both, apparently. </h2>
              <p class="article">Does he think his players are giving him everything on the pitch or not? He can’t make up his mind. Drogba or Anelka? Depends on who he has had a row with that day. </p>
              <p class="article">On Tuesday, he accused most of his players of performing well below 100 per cent. Yesterday, though, he was even more scathing and said his players had lost the heart to play for Chelsea. And in that one sentence Scolari went too far. </p>
              <p class="article">Questioning the commitment of men like John Terry, Frank Lampard, Ricardo Carvalho and Petr Cech is unforgivable. Players who have won trophies for the Blues and who have given their all for the club while doing so. Men who put their bodies on the line every time they play. </p>
              <p class="article">It is also the quickest way to lose the dressing room. And we all know what comes next when that happens — the sack. </p>
              <p class="article">Scolari keeps telling us he is no fool — so why is he behaving like an idiot? Is it because what he really wants is a way out of Chelsea and a £10million pay-off? </p>
              <p class="article">Judge for yourself from this selection of his ramblings yesterday. When asked why he thought his players had lost heart he replied: “I don’t know why. Maybe because of some offers outside.</p>
              <p class="article">“Do you believe in the Devil? Some players maybe believe some things are good somewhere else and now is the time to come and take from us. “If they are not transferred they need to play, to love Chelsea, to play with their heart, here. </p>
              <p class="article">“On Wednesday we won, not because we played fantastic but because of the heart. We loved the club, we wanted to win.” All very well except the only players who have been the subject of persistent transfer speculation are Didier Drogba and Wayne Bridge. </p>
              <p class="article">So why are all of his players dicing with the Devil? </p>
              <p class="article">Scolari authorised the sale of Bridge to Manchester City and, as SunSport reveals today, HE is trying to offer Nicolas Anelka, Florent Malouda and Salomon Kalou in exchange for Brazil star Robinho. </p>
              <p class="article">In the case of Drogba, bombing him from the squad for the second time in a week has alienated his best striker. It has also seen questions asked among other senior players who would much rather have the Drog on the bench instead of four academy rookies this afternoon. </p>
              <p class="article">And if you think that makes no sense, what about his explanation of how the team intend to defend against Stoke today? Again, the Brazilian coach described in detail the threat posed by Tony Pulis’ direct and combative Potters. He even cited their 11 goals scored from free-kicks and throws, calling them “the most dangerous side in the world from a set-piece.”</p>
              <p class="article">Really? Well, he changed his defence to a zonal system against Southend and lost another goal to a corner. Scolari accepted responsibility for that but claimed that he will use zonal AND man-marking against Stoke, despite the two being exactly opposite. He said: “I need two or three options. Before I only marked man-to-man, not zonal. </p>
              <p class="article">“Now I have zonal and man-to- man. If this or that happens tomorrow, we will discuss before the game. “We trained today — 45 corners, 45 throw-ins, 45 free-kicks. “But tomorrow we need good conditions for this and not to concede a chance to this team.” </p>
              <p class="article">When it was put to him that his players prefer man-to-man — as they have for the last five years — he became very flustered. “No,” he said. “They prefer what I decide. You are the coach? </p>
              <p class="article">“They prefer what I decide because I am the man who’s in charge. “They can decide when they are the coach. But now it is me who decides, finish.” </p>
              <p class="article">But won’t switching from one to the other confuse them? </p>
              <p class="article">“No, no, no, no,” said Scolari. “When we play in this position it’s this and that position it’s another thing. “We will change depending on which kind of set-piece. “It might be confusing for you, for the Press. But when I train for two hours there’s no confusion.” </p>
              <p class="article">The proof of that particular pudding will come this afternoon, when Stoke midfielder Rory Delap launches one of his long throws towards the Chelsea penalty area. As for the rows he has had with Drogba, Anelka, Alex and Carvalho — it is all the figment of the media’s imagination, according to the Blues boss. </p>
              <p class="article">Of course it is. It is also the last refuge of the desperate manager to blame the Press, his players, the referee, etc. Whether or not there is any reason for the madness of Big Phil remains to be seen. One thing is for sure, however, results and not words will decide his fate as Chelsea manager.</p>
