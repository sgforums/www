Allardyce delivered the shock news to Trotters chairman Phil Gartside and is adamant he will not change his mind. The news will stun Bolton players and fans ahead of their match with Chelsea at 7.45pm today.</strong><br><br>Big Sam has been in charge at Bolton since October 1999. He has performed miracles on a shoestring budget, turning the club from First Division no-hopers into a Premiership force to be reckoned with. His amazing achievements at the Reebok Stadium even put him on the brink of becoming England boss last year when Sven Goran Eriksson resigned. It is not yet clear exactly why Allardyce has decided to quit. There could well have been a disagreement internally about the future direction of the Lancashire club.<br><br>Allardyce has been constantly frustrated by the financial restraints put on him despite Wanderers being a top-flight club for six years. BoltonÂ’s board fear Allardyce may have been tapped up by a member of the consortium bidding to take over at Manchester City. A member of the Eastlands board is believed to support the Ray Ranson bid and a move for Allardyce. But I understand Allardyce has told Bolton that is not the case, nor the reason he wants to leave the club he also served as a player.<br><br>However, the news will certainly alert City, who look set to part company with Stuart Pearce in the summer. Newcastle have also been long-term admirers of Allardyce. Toon manager Glenn RoederÂ’s own future is also far from certain. In AllardyceÂ’s first season in charge, he took the Trotters to the last four of both the League Cup and FA Cup. The following season he took them up in the play-offs and has since made them regular challengers for a European place.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/sp2_29_header.jpg"><br><br><strong>SAM ALLARDYCE will be jobless after an amazing blunder over his decision to quit Bolton. Sport of the World understands he resigned at the Reebok after being ASSURED he would become the new Manchester City boss. But Allardyce was MISLED into believing his pal and former City star Ray Ranson is guaranteed to take over the Premier club. </strong><br><br>However, we can reveal former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra dramatically emerged as favourite to take charge at City after a rival Â£100 million offer was submitted. He is unlikely to hire Allardyce, preferring to look for a top European coach in the mould of Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho. Allardyce handed in his resignation to Bolton chairman Phil Gartside last week. Gartside was livid and immediately sent Allardyce home on gardening leave. But in a bid to cover up the astonishing behind-the-scenes row, Big Sam joined his squad at Stamford Bridge for the clash with Chelsea.<br><br>Significantly, Bolton assistant boss Sammy Lee faced the press after the game, with no sight of Allardyce. He said: "It's just speculation. Sam has been ill and didn't travel down with the team that came down this morning. That is ONE of the reasons for my appearance."<br><br>Allardyce has a Â£2m escape clause in his current Bolton deal, which his pal Ranson was prepared to pay. But Allardyce was unaware of the interest from former Thai PM Shinawatra, thinking Ranson's Â£90m bid already had the support of influential City director Dennis Tueart.<br><br>However, the decision over who wins control of the club - and therefore Allardyce's future rests with City's major shareholders, John Wardle and David Makin. Unfortunately for Big Sam, they remain unconvinced by Ranson's business plan and his ability to plough enough money into rebuilding the club, even if he takes over.<br><br>As revealed last week, they wrote to Ranson informing him of their concerns. But the former City player continued with his plan-and even convinced Allardyce he would replace current boss Stuart Pearce. Wardle and Makin own nearly 30 per cent of the Premiership club. The next largest shareholders are Mark Boler, who owns 18.75 per cent, BSkyB who own 9.9 per cent and Francis Lee who owns around seven per cent. Ironically, Tueart owns no shares.<br><br>Lee is believed to be ready to back Ranson and has told him he will sell his shareholding-and possibly join his takeover team-but with Wardle and Makin refusing to sell, that support is irrelevant. Sport of the World has also learned that City have reported Ranson to the Takeover Panel citing concerns over comments made through the media.<br><br>They feared that his public approach could affect the share price-particularly as they had still not received a formal approach by 5pm on Friday-when the Stock Exchange closed. Shinawatra's bid will be discussed at an emergency City board meeting this weekend. His bid is highly attractive to the Eastlands board and is almost certain to be backed.<br></div>
