              <div class="content">
              <p>New Chelsea boss Carlo Ancelotti plans to go back to former club AC Milan for Brazil whizkid Alexandre Pato.</p>
              <p><em>The Sun</em> says Ancelotti, 49, has already offered Milan £30 million for 19-year-old striker Pato.</p>
              <p>The Italian made it clear yesterday he is driven by a ruthless desire to win the Champions League.</p>
              <p>The former Milan boss has an impressive record in the European Cup having won it twice as a player and twice as a coach.</p>
              <p>He said: "Chelsea has a great record with five semi-finals in six years. But now we have to win."</p>
              <p>Pato is central to his plans as he will bring pace and a goal threat.</p>
              <p>David Beckham said of his Milan team-mate: "He is only 19 and I think he can become one of the world's greatest players."</p>
              <p>Ancelotti added: "He has an incredible shot and great speed. He is twice as fast as a normal athlete."</p>

              <p>Chelsea boss Carlo Ancelotti says he would happily raid former club AC Milan for their stars.</p>
              <p>"I would happily take many players from Milan with me as I have an extraordinary relationship with them,” he told <em>Radio Rai</em>.</p>
              <p>When asked if he could make a move for midfielder Gennaro Gattuso,
              though, he said: "He is a symbol of the club and it is right that he
              stays."</p>
              <p>However, Andrea Pirlo and Kakha Kaladze have both been linked

              <h2>CARLO ON £1M TO WIN IN EUROPE</h2>

              <p><br><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p><strong>Carlo Ancelotti will reportedly be given a £1m bonus for winning the Champions League.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chelsea's new manager has made it clear that his priority is to
              make them European champions for the first time, having won it four
              times as a player and a manager.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Daily Express claim that he will be richly rewarded for his
              efforts - a £1m bonus is in the offing on top of his £6.5m-a-year
              salary. They claim that another £1m will come his way for winning the
              Premier League, while other incentives could earn him close to £10m.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reports suggest that Ancelotti could go back to AC Milan for
              Alexandre Pato and Kaka, while Portsmouth right-back Glen Johnson could
              make a £12m return to Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Other names mentioned are Emmanuel Adebayor and Xabi Alonso.</p>

              <p class="article">The new Stamford Bridge boss, confirmed as Guus Hiddink's replacement yesterday, believes the pair could help him win the Champions League. </p>
              <p class="article">SunSport can reveal Ancelotti, 49, has already offered his old club AC Milan £30m for 19-year-old striker Pato. And the new boss also gave Chelsea the nod to offer Portsmouth £12m for Johnson - ironically the first player Blues owner Roman Abramovich bought when he took over. </p>
              <p class="article">Ancelotti made it clear yesterday he is driven by a ruthless desire to win the Champions League. The former Milan boss has an impressive record in the European Cup having won it twice as a player and twice as a coach. </p>
              <p class="article">He said: "Chelsea has a great record with five semi-finals in six years. But now we have to win." Pato is central to his plans as he will bring pace and a goal threat. </p>
              <p class="article">David Beckham said of his Milan team-mate: "He is only 19 and I think he can become one of the world's greatest players." Ancelotti added: "He has an incredible shot and great speed. He is twice as fast as a normal athlete." </p>
              <p class="article">Johnson, who first moved to Chelsea for £6m from West Ham in 2004, is also wanted by Liverpool and Manchester City. Also on Ancelotti's radar is Russia's attacking midfielder Yuri Zhirkov as he attempts to bring beautiful football AND major trophies to Stamford Bridge.</p>

              <p><strong>Reported Chelsea target Alexandre Pato has dismissed speculation
              linking him with a big-money move to the Premier League outfit,
              insisting he wants to stay with Milan and “win everything” on offer.</strong></p>

              <p><strong>Following manager Carlo Ancelotti’s departure from San Siro for
              Stamford Bridge, 19-year-old Brazilian Pato has been tipped to follow
              in the Italian’s footsteps, with an incredible £45 million price tag
              having been mooted.</strong></p>
              <p>Having scored 15 goals in Serie A in only his second campaign with
              the Rossoneri, Pato has had praise lavished on him, but wants to remain
              in Milan to continue his pursuit for success with the club.</p>
              <p>He told Gazzetta dello Sport: "I have read the reports linking me
              with Chelsea, but my agent and the club deal with this type of thing. I
              want to win everything with Milan."</p>
              <p>Aside from the issue of his own future, Pato commented on his fellow countryman Kaka’s reported move to Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>"I just hope that everybody will be happy in the end: Kaka, Milan
              and Real. Or, perhaps, even Chelsea, who are also interested in
              'Ricky'," he added.</p>
              <p>"I'm sure that Kaka will make the right choice for him and for Milan."</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p>The agent of Alexandre Pato has opened the door to a move to Chelsea for the AC Milan striker.</p>
              <p>“Milan have to decide Pato’s situation,” agent Gilmar Veloz told <em>Antenna 3 television</em>. “We are enthusiastic about Chelsea’s interest in the player, but the final decision is entirely down to Milan.</p>
              <p>“Pato has a contract with Milan, but if the club reached an agreement with Chelsea, then we would be willing to negotiate.”</p>
              <p>It is reported Carlo Ancelotti wants to bring The Duck with him to London and the club has offered £45m for the teenage hitman.</p>
              <p>“At the moment, I cannot give any guarantees to the fans that Pato will remain at Milan,” warned Veloz.</p>
              <p>“I do not own the club and so only a spokesman for Milan can answer that question.”</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p>Chelsea have made a new offer for AC Milan striker Alexandre Pato.</p>
              <p>The <em>Daily Express</em> says Chelsea tabled an improved
              £38million offer for Pato last night as they conceded defeat in their
              pursuit of his AC Milan team-mate Kaka.</p>
              <p>Blues owner Roman Abramovich immediately acted to line up his
              fall-back option and Chelsea upped their initial offer of £31m for Pato
              to £38m, and offered the 19-year-old Brazilian, known as ‘The Duck’ a
              contract worth £5m a year.</p>
              <p>Pato’s agent, Gilmar Veloz, said last night that the teenager is keen to be reunited with new Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti.</p>
              <p>Veloz said: “We are pleased about Chelsea’s interest in Pato,
              but Milan have the final decision. The player has a contract with them,
              but if they came to agreement with Chelsea we would be open to start
              negotiations.</p>
              <p>“At the moment I cannot give guarantees to the Milan fans that Pato is staying.”</p>
