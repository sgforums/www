The guy comes, takes your car, uses it for 10 days and leaves it in the middle of a field without any petrol.<br><br>Â“National team managers have the law with them and they have practically all chosen to act the same way. The easy way.<br><br>Playing 12 or 14 qualifying games in 10 or 12 months is madness.Â”<br><br>Surprisingly, Wenger revealed ex-England boss Sven Goran Eriksson did show respect for clubs.<br><br>Wenger added: Â“Sven is the only one who called regularly, who came by and talked. But he had managed big clubs and knew their problems.<br><br>Â“I never have the others on. They give you back the players and you never know what state theyÂ’re in.Â”</div>

"I could list them all but I would not have enough fingers on two hands to count them."<br><br>"But I repeat there is no agreement with Arsenal or another club, whether through me or Pape Diouf."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Germany U-21<br>0-2 England U-21, October 10</strong><br><br>Theo Walcott scored two outstanding goals to book England's place at next summer's European Under-21 Championship finals in Holland. The 17-year-old replaced Gabriel Agbonlahor with 16 minutes remaining and both teams down to 10 men. Ten minutes later Walcott showed a deft touch to control Leighton Baines' long pass before racing through the centre to sidefoot past goalkeeper Michael Rensing. That put England two up on aggregate after a 1-0 victory in last Friday's first leg. In the final minute, Walcott added the coup de grace. Collecting the ball on the halfway line, his blistering pace took him past the German defence and a curling shot into the far corner settled the tie. Arsenal defender Justin Hoyte also featured as a substitute on Tuesday night; he came off the bench after 67 minutes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Theo Walcott should be in the senior team now, considering that he plays better than downing on the left and more creative too. But then again, better he don't join them at the moment or he may end up like the other players under McClaren... useless and no fighting spirit!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Bulgaria 1-1 Holland</strong><br><strong>Robin van Persie</strong> rescued a point for Holland as Marco van Basten's side came from behind to draw with Bulgaria in Sofia. Martin Petrov gave the hosts an early lead but the in-form Arsenal forward equalised just after the hour mark. Van Persie had already hit the crossbar before the break and finally got his goal when he nodded in AndrÃ© Ooijer's right-wing cross from close range. Van Persie played the full 90 minutes and will remain with the Dutch squad for Wednesday's qualifier against Albania.</div>
