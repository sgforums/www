              <p> </p>
              <p>Robbie Keane appears determined to salvage a Liverpool career which looks to 
                                                            be in severe jeopardy following his exclusion from the squad for last 
                                                            Sunday's FA Cup Merseyside derby squad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Keane was said to have impressed manager Rafael Benitez with the intensity of 
                            his training at the club's Melwood training ground yesterday morning. His 
                            session was "fantastic," according to the Liverpool manager. The 
                            omens do not appear favourable for a player who, having not appeared in 
                            Liverpool's third-round visit to Preston either, is still not Cup-tied. But 
                            the 28-year-old's absence from Anfield for Liverpool's 1-1 draw with Everton 
                            is less significant than it seemed. Any player not in the squad for the 
                            match was given Sunday off and that, rather than a personal protest, was why 
                            he did not appear. Keane would also have known that he would have become an 
                            unwelcome centre of attention had he watched the match from the stand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Though Harry Redknapp said yesterday that he had "a lot of time" for 
                            Keane, there appears to be no realistic prospect of the Irishman taking a 
                            road back to Tottenham even though Spurs could conceivably write off the 
                            £10.8m outstanding on the initial £20.3m deal to smooth the way. Redknapp 
                            has not mentioned Keane to his chairman, Daniel Levy.</p>
              <p><strong>Benitez's reasons for sticking with Keane include his need for striking 
                            reinforcements, with Torres troubled with hamstrings all season, as well as 
                            his personal reputation in the transfer market which is already on the line 
                            with none of his summer buys having flourished and Andrea Dossena having 
                            also laboured badly. Benitez might characterise Keane as the summer signing 
                            he coveted far less than Aston Villa's Gareth Barry – whom he was denied – 
                            yet it was he who persuaded the club's American owners after Crouch's 
                            departure that a striking replacement was a top priority and, with the club 
                            aware that Spurs would not part company for less than £20m, that a 
                            substantial outlay would be necessary. Keane's age was discussed at the 
                            time, but Tom Hicks and George Gillett were persuaded by their manager's 
                            argument that he was injury free and that you pay a premium for strikers.</strong></p>

              <p>Watching the drama prevailed this season, I am sad to conclude that as long as Ah Ben is the manager, Liverpool can never win the league title.</p>
              <p>I made a mistake in my previous entry by thinking that Keane was signed by Ah Ben.</p>
              <p>Keane was actually Parry's pet.</p>
              <p>Keane was condemned due to the petty reason of Ah Ben trying to show the Boss that Parry have made a wrong buy and he should be given full control on the sale and buy on the players.</p>
              <p>For the past few months, Liverpool have suffered severe point loss due to the pettiness of the manager in not deploying Keane.</p>
              <p>Keane would have to be played after he hit his form at Bolton game.</p>
              <p>But, he was left behind and insulted on international tv when he was seen warming up and have to put his jacket back as he was not used.</p>
              <p>Although he have make a few boo boo by missing simple chances, I cannot denied the fact that he need to PLAY to gel with the team.</p>
              <p>As torres will not suddenly be lethal after his injury, Keane need to hit his form for Liverpool to have any chance at the title.</p>
              <p>If Liverpool is to become another newcastle, Ah Ben would be solely responsible for the slip-up during mid-season and the final season.</p>
              <p>His pettiness and shallow mind cannot be tortured at Anfield.</p>
              <p>Bring on Jose !</p>
