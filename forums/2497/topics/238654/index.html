            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson has admitted that he found Tuesday's events in France difficult to digest.<br><br>Manchester United claimed a 1-0 win over Lille courtesy of a controversial Ryan Giggs free-kick, but the victory was overshadowed by a number of other incidents.<br><br>Lille's players took exception to the goal and appeared to attempt to walk off the field before being persuaded to play on, while the French club's fans rained down objects onto the field - one of which struck Gary Neville on the head.<br><br>There was also a frightening incident earlier in the game, as a number of United fans were forced to scale the perimeter fence amid fears there would be a crush in the stands.<br><br>United are set to issue a report to Uefa about the incident, as fans were sprayed with tear gas by riot police, and Ferguson claims he has never before witnessed such behaviour from Lille's players and fans.<br><br>"It was intentional," Ferguson told Sky Sports News about Lille's attempted walk-off. "We should have taken the throw-in right away and got on with the game.<br><br>"It created such a melee of bodies on the touchline and the game was stopped because of it."<br><br>Neville came off the field with a head wound and the incident left a nasty taste in Ferguson's mouth.<br><br>"I have never seen anything like it in my life," he added. "It was intimidation of the fans, it made it hostile.<br><br>"Gary Neville was struck on the head by an object.<br><br>"They started bombarding all areas of the pitch and I have never seen anything like it, so I don't know how to digest it.<br><br>"Obviously Uefa will do something, but it is in their hands."<br><br>United director of communications Phil Townsend confirmed the club will seek answers about the treatment of their fans.<br><br>He said: "We will obviously make our reports of our officials' observations. Uefa will have theirs, the safety officials from this ground and this club will have theirs and the police will have a say."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>lille are bad losers. the goal disallowed was a valid call cos clearly there was a push on vidic. but however they do have a pt on giggs goal. the ref was looking away and made no hand signal for the free kick to be taken.<br><br>same thing happen to chelsea when they played at highbury but you dont see them walk off the pitch. but for something like this to happen in the ucl is really despicable.<br></div>
