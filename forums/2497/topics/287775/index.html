            <div class='col-md body'><strong>DIDIER DROGBA has told Michael Ballack he should have signed for title rivals Manchester United or Arsenal.</strong><br><br>The outspoken Chelsea striker reckons Germany captain Ballack got it wrong when he joined the Blues on a free from Bayern Munich.<br><br>Drogba insisted: Â“ItÂ’s hard for Ballack at Chelsea because this club is special.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m convinced he would have had a much easier time at Manchester United or Arsenal because they benefit from their well-balanced team Â— he would have been a better fit there.<br><br>Â“At Chelsea, we depend on our individuals. So, maybe Chelsea is not the right club for Ballack.Â”<br><br>Ballack, 31, was amazingly left out of the Champions League squad list by the Blues and Drogba admits he was stunned by the omission.<br><br>He reckons club politics played a big part in denying the three-time German Player of the Year a Champions League squad number.<br><br>Ballack is currently recovering from ankle surgery.<br><br>But Drogba, 29, admitted: Â“I was very surprised he was not nominated because he was one of our team leaders. Of course he still is a leader now.<br><br>Â“His experience and his strength in the air make him indispensable. But I donÂ’t know what happened between him and the front office.Â”<br><br>Drogba also lashed out at critics who insist the reason for snubbing Ballack was that he is too similar a player to England midfielder Frank Lampard.<br><br>Drogba insisted: Â“I believe that Ballack and Lampard can harmonise well. They have proved it a couple of times in the Champions League already.<br><br>Â“Against Barcelona and Porto, both played fantastically. They are experienced and intelligent enough to play together.Â”<br><br>Ivory Coast international Drogba is being chased by a string of Italian, French and Spanish clubs after insisting he wants to leave Stamford Bridge following the departure of Jose Mourinho as manager.<br><br>But the powerful hitman revealed he would be ready to join German giants Bayern Munich because of the clubÂ’s European tradition.<br><br>He said: Â“A club like Bayern Munich is historic.<br><br>Â“The representatives are former Bayern stars and thatÂ’s the right way to play the first fiddle on an international level.<br><br>Â“I have to admit, that I envy players like Franck Ribery or Luca Toni because they are under contract in Munich.<br><br>Â“As a player, itÂ’s your duty to continue the tradition of such a club Â— but the most important thing is to have fun.<br><br>Â“In Germany they play very offensively, there are a lot of goals, the stadiums are modern and full.<br><br>Â“That counts for me. When I entered the Allianz Arena in Munich during the World Cup, I was flattened by the atmosphere.Â”<br><br>Drogba, who netted 33 goals last term, was furious after the club sacked pal Mourinho but has since said he will continue to give his all for the team.<br><br>Now former World Player of the Year George Weah has backed Drog to put his unrest behind him and prove he is the No 1 striker on the planet.<br><br>Weah said: Â“IÂ’m excited seeing the way Didier is exploding in the top league in England. It has afforded him an opportunity to show that heÂ’s world class.<br><br>Â“I think heÂ’s a very focused player despite the rumours about his planned exit from the Premier League. He has tried to be calm and deliver the goods.<br><br>Â“He could become the World Player of the Year one day.<br><br>Â“I like seeing African players taking after me.<br><br>Â“I respect Didier a lot for showing such skill every week and staying off controversy.<br><br>Â“I think he loves Chelsea and canÂ’t dump the team in the way they are speculating.<br><br>Â“He might have been facing some pressure but thatÂ’s what comes with stardom.<br><br>Â“He will let everybody know when he wants to leave Chelsea and not just disappear through the back door. He is a classy striker with a great range of skills that is very rare.<br><br>Â“Any club that has him must count themselves lucky because he is committed and very hard working.Â”<br><br>French champions Lyon are one of the teams who have targeted Drogba.<br><br>Chairman Jean-Michel Aulas last night admitted they want to capture the Blues hotshot.<br><br>Asked if Lyon would try to sign the superstar, Aulas said: Â“Everything is possible in football. Didier Drogba is an exceptional footballer who loves France.Â”<br><br>Chelsea winger Florent Malouda, who joined from Lyon last summer for Â£14million, is a close pal of DrogbaÂ’s.<br><br>But Aulas admits MaloudaÂ’s exit meant Lyon lost a trump card in their bid to lure Drogba back for a second stint in France. Drogba caused a huge furore at Chelsea after launching a furious attack on the club.<br><br>The forward said his first choice is a move to AC Milan or Inter but he has also left open the possibility of a return to France Â— where he excelled for Marseille before joining Chelsea in a Â£24m move.<br><br>His agent Etienne Mendy said: Â“ItÂ’s no secret that Didier likes Milan, he often visits the city during his time off.<br><br>Â“But we cannot rule out the other big Italian side Â— Juventus.<br><br>Â“His relationship with Chelsea isnÂ’t as good as it was under Mourinho but Drogba is a professional and knows he plays for a club, not a manager.Â”</div>
