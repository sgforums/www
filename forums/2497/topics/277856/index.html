HeÂ’s a real pain and getting away with too much. We need to mark him as a player we need to look out forÂ’.<br><br>Â“We watched EnglandÂ’s warm-up games and it was pointed out the way he used his arms. I tried to defend him, being English.Â”<br><br>But PollÂ’s words went unheeded as Crouch was booked against Paraguay and consistently cited for fouling during the tournament.<br><br>PollÂ’s revelation will stun the FA, who may now believe referees were instructed to penalise the England team before a ball was even kicked.<br><br>The ex-Premier League ref from Tring admitted officials can be influenced by the guidelines given to them by their bosses.<br><br>Speaking on Radio Five Live, Poll added: Â“You have to ask yourself as a ref if you are looking out for him all the time or only when he has done something that draws your attention.<br><br>Â“To prepare is fine but to pre-judge is not. And, low and behold, Crouch did get booked in Germany.<br><br>Â“He has been picking up cautions since and is out of SaturdayÂ’s match.<br><br>Â“Players need to be aware that referees individually, or as a refereeÂ’s team, can be tactical as well.Â”</div>
