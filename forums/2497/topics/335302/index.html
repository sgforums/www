              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">DIEGO MARADONA is ready to become the shock new boss of Argentina. The Argy legend will iron out a few minor issues before accepting the position.</h2>
              <p class="article">Maradona, whose Hand of God goal sent England out of the 1986 World Cup, said: “The offer has attracted me a lot. "As soon as it is confirmed, I will start working, but I can say I am very proud.</p>
              <p class="article">“We have to keep talking. There are some things to resolve. This is just beginning." Maradona has already started assembling his coaching team. Pedro Troglio, coach of Paraguayan club Cerro Porteno and Maradona's former international team-mate, claims he has been approached about joining the new set-up.</p>
              <p class="article">Troglio said: “I am extremely happy but I must keep my feet on the ground. “The world’s best player has called me. “It was a huge surprise. Being aware that your name is included as possible coaching staff is amazing but we’ll have to wait to see whether Diego is selected.”</p>
              <p class="article">Maradona would take the role of coach, with his '86 World Cup-winning coach Carlos Bilardo as general director. Bilardo said. “Are things getting started? Yes.”</p>
              <p class="article">The pair were approached by Julio Grondona, head of the Argentine Football Association. Grondona has led the search for a coach following Alfio Basile’s recent resignation. Maradona's first game as boss would be against Scotland at Hampden Park on November 19.</p>

              <h1>Maradona: I Laugh At My Critics</h1>

              <h2>New Argentina national team coach Diego Maradona has hit back at those who say he is not experienced enough to lead his country.</h2>
              <p>Maradona yesterday beat off competition from Carlos Bianchi, Miguel
              Angel Russo and Sergio Batista to be named the surprise successor of
              Alfio Basile as coach of Argentina.<br><br>Speaking from his home in Buenos Aires, El Pibe d'Oro has described his happiness at this appointment.<br><br>"This is something I have wanted for a long time," said Maradona. "I dreamt of it.<br><br>"Speaking
              yesterday with my daughter [Gianina], I told her that her [unborn] son and this [job] are the best gifts that I could
              ever receive in my life."<br><br>Sections
              of the Argentine press have massacred the decision to appoint Maradona,
              who has had next-to-no experience as a coach since retiring from
              playing, and has also had some well-documented personal troubles.<br> <br>"I laugh at those who say that I have no experience," said Diego, who will turn 48 tomorrow.<br><br>"I
              have more than 20 years of experience with the national team. Football
              hasn't changed, everything is already invented. I don't think anyone
              can surprise me on the field.<br> <br>"For those who say I have little experience, I say to them that I
              have [Carlos] Bilardo by my side, who has more experience than anyone else.<br><br>"The
              appointment could not arrive at a better time of my life. This is the
              right time, I'm more mature. I'm very calm, knowing that we have
              incredible players to make all the country smile when they see the
              national team
              playing.<br><br>"I'll take all the time to appoint my assistants."<br> <br>Asked about his others commitments [like exhibition matches] he concluded: "I dedicate everything to the national team now."<br><br>Maradona
              famoulsy led Argentina almost single-handedly to World Cup glory in
              1986 as a player. Twenty-four years later he will now try to do the
              same as a coach in South Africa.</p>
