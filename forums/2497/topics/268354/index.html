The Dutch winger, 23, is now waiting to learn if Chelsea will accept the offer. RobbenÂ’s dad and agent Hans said: Â“I know Real have made a bid to Chelsea for my son. "When you are talking about Real Madrid, it has to be said that itÂ’s one of the best clubs in the world. Â“Who wouldnÂ’t want to play for Real Madrid? My son wants to play at clubs that can win the Champions League and Real Madrid is one of them.Â”</strong><br><br>RealÂ’s offer is virtually the same amount Chelsea forked out to land Florent Malouda from Lyon. The Spanish giants are anxious to thrash out a deal. President Ramon Calderon is reeling after Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas rejected RealÂ’s advances last week.<br><br>Calderon promised to sign Fabregas and Robben during his electoral campaign last summer. And he is desperate to deliver at least one of the stars to appease anxious fans. But Blues manager Jose Mourinho has insisted Frenchman MaloudaÂ’s arrival will not force Robben out at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>And the Dutch winger has made it clear he is happy to stay if RealÂ’s offer is rejected Â— even though he has so far failed to agree a new contract with the Blues.<br><br></div>

This which represent a Â£4m profit on the fee Chelsea paid PSV Eindhoven for his services three years ago.</strong><br><br>RobbenÂ’s lawyer Ton Smit was in Madrid last week sorting out the details. Robben was still in Los Angeles yesterday with Chelsea but he will quit the camp as soon as he gets the green light. And he may be pulled out of tonightÂ’s clash against Suwon Bluewings.<br><br>A friend of RobbenÂ’s told SunSport: Â“The deal is just about done. "Arjen should be a Real player very soon and Chelsea are ready to let him go.Â”<br><br>Meanwhile, Blues midfielder Joe Cole is urging Mourinho to go back to a 4-3-3 formation. The Chelsea boss brought in a diamond system last season. But he is set to revert to 4-3-3 for the new season with England man Cole on the right.<br><br>Cole said: Â“I think the 4-3-3 formation is our best formation.

The proposed contract would see the Dutch wing whizz pocket Â£74,000 a week tax free.</strong><br><br>Real are closing in on a Â£16m transfer deal with Chelsea. And SunSport can reveal they are also considering renewing their interest in Blues midfielder Frank Lampard, 29, after being snubbed by Arsenal playmaker Cesc Fabregas.<br><br>Robben, 23, is the priority and Bernabeu chiefs will line his pockets while picking up the tab for his taxes. La Liga sides can take advantage of a loophole by registering their star imports as foreign executives.<br><br>That means they pay only 24 per cent income tax. Robben would effectively earn Â£100,000 a week. In England he would be hit with a 40 per cent tax bill but Spanish rules mean he would take home more than ChelseaÂ’s Â£121,000-a-week top earners Michael Ballack and Andriy Shevchenko, who bank Â£72,600.<br></div>

I think it's better for you to forget the Arjen Robben story because today he (Robben) made a mistake, unless he has a private flight and is flying now!"<br><br>Meanwhile, Cannavaro's agent Gaetano Fedele claims Chelsea have made an offer for the Italian defender.<br><br>Fedele told Radio MilanInter: "Fabio is in Madrid where he is very well and where he won La Liga, and for that reason I do not believe that the possibility exists for him to leave Real Madrid.<br><br>"Yes, the offer (from Chelsea) arrived, but we have given everything to the will of Real Madrid because we do not forget that it is the most prestigious club in the world."</div>
