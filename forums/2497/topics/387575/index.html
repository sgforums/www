              <p><strong>Togo captain Emmanuel Adebayor has told French radio his team will head home from the African Nations Cup on Sunday afternoon on the advice of the Togolese government.</strong></p>
              <p>A number of players had been quoted in the French media saying they were keen to play on as a mark of respect to those killed and injured in Friday's gun attack in the Angolan enclave of Cabinda, b ut Togolese Prime Minister Gilbert Fossoun Houngbo ordered the team must return on Sunday.</p>
              <p>The players have now agreed and Togolese president Faure Gnassingbe has dispatched his presidential plane to collect them.</p>
              <p>Adebayor told French radio station <em>RMC</em>: "The head of state (Gnassingbe) has decided we will return. "There was a meeting between players yesterday (Saturday) and we said we were still footballers.</p>
              <p>"We all decided to do something good for the country and play to honour those who died. Unfortunately, the head of state and the country's authorities have decided otherwise. We will pack up and go home."</p>

              <p><strong>After a day of fraught negotiation </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Togo</strong></span><strong> tonight flew home from the </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Africa Cup of Nations</strong></span><strong> following Friday's deadly gun attack but left the door open for a return later in the tournament.</strong></p>
              <p>As Angola and Mali kicked off in the opening game, which was drawn 4-4, Togo headed for the airport in the northern province of Cabinda after being ordered to return by their prime minister, who sent the presidential plane to pick the players up. "Anybody that is involved in security matters will tell you that it would be irresponsible to just pretend that nothing has happened and just let the show go on," Togo's prime minister, Gilbert Houngbo, told the BBC World Service. "Security is non-negotiable."</p>
              <p>The Togo striker and captain, <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Emmanuel Adebayor" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/emmanuel-adebayor"><span style="color: #005689;">Emmanuel Adebayor</span></a>, told reporters at Cabinda airport: "We have to mourn our dead, we're going back to do so. We're very sad."</p>
              <p>But even as the Togolese plane prepared to leave, a spokesman for the squad said a final decision on whether the team would quit the competition altogether had not been made. "We're still talking with the players, no decision has been made yet. Everything is possible," he said.</p>
              <p>The Togolese sports minister, Christophe Tchao, added to the uncertainty by saying Togo had asked the Confederation of African Football (CAF) to find a way for the team to rejoin the competition later. "We have ordered a three-day mourning," Tchao said. "The players are leaving with the bodies of their fallen brothers and we've asked the CAF to find an arrangement so we can catch up with the competition later."</p>
              <p>Adebayor had earlier claimed his team were willing to stay but the decision appears to have been taken at the prompting of Houngbo, who maintained the side could not play while the goalkeeper Dodji Obilale remains in intensive care after the team bus was ambushed in Cabinda, killing three people. "If some people present themselves under the Togolese flag, it will be a false representation," he said.</p>
              <p>"The head of state [Faure Gnassingbé] has decided we will return," Adebayor told a French radio station. "There was a meeting between players yesterday and we said we were still footballers. We all decided to do something good for the country and play to honour those who died. Unfortunately the head of state and the country's authorities have decided otherwise.</p>
