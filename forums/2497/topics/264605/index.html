            <div class='col-md body'><strong>SAM ALLARDYCE is poised to kick-start his revolution in Newcastle's pre-season training next week with psychological profiling, punishing individual training regimes and tactical planning from a "war room".</strong><br><br>The Newcastle boss will get into the minds of his stars next season using scientifically prepared questionnaires to evaluate their state of mind and commitment to the club. They would indicate what sort of managerial approach will get the best out of them.<br><br>It is a technique his staff used at Bolton and which some of his players admitted was "frighteningly accurate."<br><br>Allardyce is also planning to ditch the routine of cross-country runs and lengthy slogs around pitches for the entire squad traditionally used to build fitness.<br><br>Instead he will hand players tailored pre-season programmes which will be worked on in small groups or individually - with stars coming in at different times of the day to do their work.<br><br>There will also be team bonding sessions, and focused sessions in the video room where Allardyce will outline different tactical formations for home games and away games. Allardyce is also hoping to take his squad away for a 10-day fitness building break in Austria, possibly starting next week.<br><br>One star who has trained under Allardyce's methods said: "If the Newcastle players buy into it, they will see it is eye-opening stuff. But they must know that Sam takes no s**t and if they don't go for it they will be out."<br><br>All planning is done from a base that was known at Bolton as the "war room."<br><br>Allardyce is close to appointing Mark Taylor as his head of sports science. The club is also advertising for a 10-strong backroom staff to help him.<br><br>The mission is to cut Newcastle's terrible injury record which saw 340 player-days lost to injury last season, five times more than Bolton's under Allardyce.<br><br>Allardyce said: "We will monitor each individual from day one, building up their all-round fitness and ability. It is true we won't even be training as a group. It will be individual programmes or small groups.<br><br>Then we will focus on how we want the team to play.<br><br>"I want to make the training ground a better place. It is like a squash club converted. It isn't a place for professional footballers to work on a day-to-day basis.<br><br>"My vision is to create an all-encompassing building that will excite everybody who walks through the door, every day."<br></div>
