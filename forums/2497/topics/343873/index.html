              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Zenit St Petersburg have turned
              down a £10million bid from Arsenal for Russian ace Andrei Arshavin as
              they feel it is "insufficient".</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The Gunners are hoping to
              sign the Russian schemer as they look to bolster their attacking
              options in this month's transfer window.</p>
              <p>Arsene Wenger has been coy on his side's interest in Arshavin,
              but Arsenal are believed to be leading the chase for the 27-year-old.</p>
              <p>Arshavin is determined to leave Zenit this month after being frustrated in his attempts to move last summer.</p>
              <p>Reports suggest Zenit are demanding a £20million fee for Arshavin, but the Gunners value the 27-year-old at considerably less.</p>
              <p>Zenit spokesman Alexei Petrov has confirmed Arsenal are the only
              club to have made an official approach for Arshavin, but that their
              initial offer was turned down.</p>
              <p>"I can confirm that Zenit did get an official offer from
              Arsenal about Andrei Arshavin," Petrov told the Mail on Sunday. It was
              rejected as insufficient.</p>
              <p>"They offered about £10m. No new offers have arrived from them
              since. At the moment, Arsenal are the only club to have approached us
              about the player."</p>
              <p>It remains to be seen if Arsenal will increase their offer for
              Arshavin with fresh reports suggesting Manchester City could hijack
              their move for the talented playmaker.</p>

              <p class="up"> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester City are closing in on Andrei Arshavin after agreeing an £18million deal with Zenit St Petersburg.</strong></p>
              <p>The 27-year-old striker flew into London last week amid speculation he was poised to join Arsenal. But City have stormed into pole position and Arshavin isoncourse to boost manager Mark Hughes's strike options at the struggling club.</p>
              <p>Dennis Lachter, Arshavin's agent, has claimed a move to the Emirates was unlikely because of Zenit's massive financial demands.</p>
              <p>Arsenal's valuation of the player was closer to £15m - and there was also an issue about the wages that Arshavin wants to seal a move to England.</p>
              <p>He sees himself in the £85,000-a-week bracket and at Arsenal only Cesc Fabregas earns anything like that.</p>

              <p>in my opinion, hughes is a great manager. the problem with city lies with the fact that their players cant play with each other. hughes needs to find the right blend of players to fit into the first eleven and everything will go well for him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>look at scolari, he's screwing up team selections, playing players in awkward positions and look at chelsea now. for man city, its not the playesrs in wrong position, but rather the chemistry within them is lacking. give hughes one season, if city finish around 10th to 15th this season, i wont be surprised. but i think the next season, they will be top 6 for sure.</p>

              <p>well, both managers are inheriting players, not what they want.</p>
              <p>Hughes was doing fine in Blackburn cause he got his core of hardworking players.</p>
              <p>Now, he has to "fight" with Sven's players. Same as Chelsea.</p>
