              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> chairman Bruce Buck says the club would still be a force without the backing of Roman Abramovich.</p>
              <p>The 42-year-old's vast spending potential inspired the Blues to back-to-back <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> titles in 2005 and 2006 and end a 50-year wait for the top-flight title.</p>
              <p>While he has brought success to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> there has been an underlying fear that the club's finances rely too heavily on Abramovich remaining.</p>
              <p>The club's losses have been reduced in recent times and Buck said that while Abramovich was going nowhere, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> could withstand his departure.</p>
              <p>"I think we'd be in a reasonably good state (if Abramovich left)," he told <em>BBC Radio Five Live</em>.</p>
              <p>"To be perfectly honest as directors we have a responsibility under the
              Companies Act and we have a responsibility when we deal with the orders
              at the end of the year.</p>
              <p>"We are comfortable - the directors of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> Football Club are comfortable - that Mr Abramovich is here for the long haul.</p>
              <p>"Every year we're required to look at that; we're comfortable and we don't see that as an issue at all."</p>

              <p>to be honest, without roman buying the club in 2003.. chelsea might be in deep shit and probarly in joing leeds in championship league 1.</p>
              <p>i really thanks God for roman to step in and pump lots of $$ into chelsea.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but then again, due to chelsea reputation now, even if roman want to leave, i am very sure its buyer can be at least 2X ricer then roman.</p>

              <p>thing is, in the long run, is it good for the team?</p>
              <p>would Abramovich leave and the club ends up with a whole lot of debt?</p>
              <p>or would someone else come in, pay 2x what he paid and finance the takeover with debt like what happened to a couple of other clubs?</p>
              <p>i think the only club now with a really healthy balance sheet is Arsenal... and i think it's due to Wenger's economics background which is pushing that</p>

              <p>compare to big 4.</p>
              <p><br>Arsenal, Chelsea, Man Utd, Liverpool in order from richest to poorer</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as roman already "gift" chelsea a 50% discount for the money he loan to them which mean is around 300m</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>while arsenal still have the burden of the new stadium</p>
              <p>man utd well, won't get affected much due to owners backing</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Liverpool... well they are just in a pool of shit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think the one that can be richer than big 4 is probarbly tottenham/man city</p>

              <p>they just need to look into a pool of young player chelsea have now, like borini, sam, di santo, scott sinclair and my fav stoch. they are future stats, and of cos the black "zidane". no worries.</p>
