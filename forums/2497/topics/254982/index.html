Reports suggest the England captain and inspirational centre-half is reputed to be furious he is not being paid the same wages as Andriy Shevchenko and Michael Ballack. </strong><br><br>Terry feels he has given his all for the Chelsea cause while last summer's two expensive signings have been criticised for failing to hit top gear during their first season with the Blues. Frank Lampard is also reported to share similar views as his friend and international team-mate although both players have insisted their ideal is to stay with the deposed Premiership champions for the long haul.<br><br>A source revealed: "I was told his agent is saying Terry could put in a written transfer request days after the FA Cup Final." Terry has also spoken about being a future manager at Chelsea but is angered at what he perceives to be a lack of respect from the King's Road hierarchy.<br><br></div>

Terry only know how to talk and shout and scream but it is and was Carvalho and Gallas that made him look so good at the back... And i don't think the money is the real problem here, $10,000 difference probably can still accept but asking for a 9 yrs contract? And want to be given a chance to manage the club in 9 yrs time? That is just asking too much i think... Sol Cambell probably a better defender than Terry at his age lost his first team place at Arsenal at the age of 32... Do you serious think Terry can last till 32 at the top level? I doubt very much so.<br><br>He should just take his 5yrs and forget about everything else and be happy with it.</div>
