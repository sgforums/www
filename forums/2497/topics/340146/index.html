              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">PHIL SCOLARI has been rocked by a transfer request from Alex. The Brazil defender hopes to move on from Chelsea next month. </h2>
              <p class="article">Alex said: “I told Chelsea a few days ago that I wanted to leave. “There are many options. But I have to think them through and see if Chelsea will let me leave in January.” </p>
              <p class="article">It is a major blow for boss Scolari, who has failed to get on with his countryman since arriving in London in July. </p>
              <p class="article">AC Milan and Seville have already expressed an interest in the £10million-rated centre-back. Alex is frustrated by his lack of first-team involvement, having made just 12 appearances so far this season. </p>
              <p class="article">He knows he is third-choice behind John Terry and and Ricardo Carvalho. But what really worries the Brazil star is he will fail to make his country’s 2010 World Cup team. </p>
              <p class="article">Brazil boss Dunga currently prefers Lucio and Juan as his central defenders and has told Alex he needs to play more games to be considered. Alex has not even been on the bench for the South Americans’ most recent qualifiers. The player, who began his career with Santos, came to Chelsea via PSV Eindhoven. </p>
              <p class="article">The Blues paid one dollar for him when he moved in the summer of 2007, after being on loan with the Dutch outfit for three years. The silver lining for Scolari is that any money generated by a sale could help finance buying a top new striker.</p>

              <p><strong>Now Scolari turns to Silva</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00678/silva_280x390_678368a.jpg" alt="FLUMIN HOT ... Silva is ready for a move to Europe " width="280" height="390"></p>
              <p><em>Silva: Hope to get more experience and raise his profile.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">CHELSEA will look to replace Alex with his fellow Brazilian Thiago Silva.</h2>
              <p class="article">SunSport revealed yesterday that centre-half Alex has asked the Blues for a transfer. It is understood Alex, 26, confronted boss Phil Scolari two days after he was left out of the 2-1 home defeat by Arsenal when Branislav Ivanovic played at the back.</p>
              <p class="article">Scolari is now willing to let him go and will make a nominal £1.2million bid for Fluminense star Silva, who will soon be out of contract. The 22-year-old is a full international and rated as the best young centre-half in South America.</p>
              <p class="article">He is also a target for Manchester City and Inter Milan but Scolari is hopeful he can persuade him to move to Stamford Bridge. Silva is desperate to sign for a big European club to stake his claim for a place in Brazil’s World Cup team.</p>
              <p class="article">And he has the support of City superstar Robinho who has already recommended him to his boss Mark Hughes.</p>
              <p class="article">Silva said: “It is inevitable that I will leave Fluminense. “My plan is to play in the World Cup for Brazil and it is important to be in Europe, to get more experience and raise my profile.</p>
              <p class="article">“European football is different and I think it is easier to be a defender there than here. “In Brazil, defences are left without any protection, while in Europe the rivals are well blocked before.</p>
              <p class="article">“My speed would be my best skill, I am very fast and that is great for European football. I always watch European football — English, Spanish and Italian leagues. They have also started to show Manchester City games in Brazil because of Robinho.</p>
              <p class="article">“He told me he was going to suggest me to City. It is the best help you can get, coming from the star of the team. It is a privilege.”</p>
              <p class="article">Meanwhile, Scolari has been told by Middlesbrough boss Gareth Southgate to forget about landing striker Tuncay on the cheap.</p>
              <p class="article">The Chelsea boss is keeping tabs on the Turkish ace, who has been linked with an £8million January move to Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p class="article">But after Blues paid £16m for defender Jose Bosingwa this summer, Boro boss Gareth Southgate insisted: “I’m sure there will be interest in lots our players here because we’ve got some good ones.</p>
              <p class="article">“It’s a good sign that we’re doing things right. “But I was quite amused at the figure they put on his head ... the club that was linked pay double that for full-backs!”</p>
