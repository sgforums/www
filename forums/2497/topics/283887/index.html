The love rat, now Manchester City manager, regularly invites Saima Ansari, 38, to his Â£1,500-a-night hotel suite in the city.<br><br>Back in London his long-suffering girlfriend Nancy wears a ring on her engagement finger, and insists: "We are still a couple." Sven, 59, has been seeing mum-of-two Saima since becoming City boss at the end of June.<br><br>Last week she visited him twice at his penthouseÂ—aptly named the VALENTINO suite. </strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/sven_30_03.jpg"><br><br>On Monday and Wednesday afternoons she stayed for several hours while her silver Peugeot 207 was parked outside. She later returned to her flat close to the notorious Strangeways Prison. pal said: "Saima is a beautiful and confident woman. You can see why Sven is attracted to her. "She has been seeing him for some time but they are always very discreet because he is frightened of their relationship getting out. If they go to a restaurant it is usually somewhere Saima knows, and they sit in a quiet corner.<br><br>"Sven appreciates the fact she is discreet. She says if anyone asks about the relationship she will deny itÂ—she respects his need for privacy." Meanwhile Nancy, 46, admits she has not yet visited Sven in ManchesterÂ— where he earns Â£2.5 MILLION a yearÂ—but he has seen her in London several times.<br><br>She said yesterday: "We are taking time to work on it but we are still a couple. "Our priorities change. My life and Sven's life are a lot busier and it is more difficult to spend time together. "But we already have had a long time with each other and that gives us strength." She has said previously: "We have this great, incredible passion, an incredibly strong bond."<br><br>Nancy stood by Sven following his earlier affairs with FA secretary Faria Alam and News of the World columnist Ulrika Jonsson. And this summer we revealed he'd also had a secret fling with Italian model Monica Casti. Saima was previously wed to Inmran Ansari in 1988, in what is believed to be an arranged marriage.<br><br>The relationship fell apart after eight years. The source said: "Saima was brought up a strict Muslim, which means no alcohol and no pork. "She would never be seen in a bar with Sven. However, she is full of energy and great company." On her website, Saima boasts she has been a model for the Body Shop. She says she is available for other modelling and acting workÂ—but will not pose in swimwear or lingerie.<br><br>For the last five years she has "worked in media", and claims to have started her own business organising corporate events for large banks and professional organisations. But we can reveal she is forced to claim income support, housing and child benefitÂ—while her famous lover gets Â£50,000 a WEEK.<br><br>Sven, who made Â£25million as England manager, moved to the Radisson Edwardian a few weeks ago. He was given the 14th-floor penthouse used by ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair at last year's Labour conference. The Swede, who has taken Manchester City to third in the Premiership, is said to love the dramatic views from the balcony. Every room has state-of-the-art Bang &amp; Olufsen entertainment systems, and the bathrooms are in marble.<br><br>When Saima visits she is welcomed by the concierge, who walks her to the lifts. He uses his swipe card to give her access to the residential floors, which are closed to the public. Saima refused to comment. But Sven's close friend Athole Still insisted Eriksson was NOT seeing Nancy. He added: "He is a single man. Why shouldn't he go out with anyone he wants?"<br><br>Sven has also been spotted at top Manchester restaurants and enjoying nights in the centre with his Swedish assistant Tord Grip. The source said: "Sven has been having a great time. But Nancy might think he has been enjoying life a little too much."<br><br><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/sven_30_05.jpg"><br><span class="small">Nancy Dell'Olio</span></div>
