              <p><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span><strong> are among the clubs planning a raid on </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>West Ham</strong></span><strong> to sign Carlton Cole in January.</strong></p>
              <p>With Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard struggling through injuries, manager Rafa Benitez has been forced to rely on back-up strikers David Ngog and Andriy Voronin.</p>
              <p>Barcelona’s interest in Javier Mascherano could finance a move because Liverpool want £32 million. That fee would also fund a replacement for the Argentina midfielder.</p>
              <p>Cole’s outstanding form has generated interest from home and abroad, particularly in view of the financial problems at Upton Park.</p>
              <p>West Ham fought off bids for their top players in the summer but are braced for more pressure when the transfer window re-opens.</p>
              <p>Cole, who is 26 tomorrow, has scored six in 11 Premier League games this season, including one against Liverpool in September.</p>

              <p>Firstly, mascherano isnt going anywhere because barcelona already say no longer interested.</p>
              <p>Secondly, buying carlton cole does not change their season. The damage has already been done. Robbie Keane is a good player though, but at liverpool he sucks. Maybe carlton cole will be another sucky player as well.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, I am just afraid that at liverpool, Carlton Cole would keep on doing that hand sign which he is showing in the picture.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez is spending the international break considering his options for reinforcements in the January transfer window.</strong></p>
              <p>And while it is unlikely he will have funds available to make a permanent signing, the Anfield boss will look for a loan striker to act as cover.</p>
              <p>The Spanish coach has sounded out advisors for Spurs forward Roman Pavlyuchenko, who indicated yesterday that he will press to leave the London club in January after failing to gain a regular first team place.</p>
              <p>Benitez sees him as the ideal stand in for Torres, and given his international pedigree he could do a job for Liverpool to put him into the spotlight before the World Cup gets underway next summer.</p>
              </div>
              <p>The Liverpool manager will also think about approaching his former club Real Madrid to talk about taking Dutch forward Rafael van der Vaart who has confirmed he will be leaving the Bernabeu in the January transfer window.</p>
              <p>Benitez will hope to get either player on loan, with the idea of a permanent deal in the summer when he will have more transfer funds.</p>
              <p>He will look to finance the wages of any loan signing by offloading Italian defender Andrea Dossena, who is close to concluding a deal with Napoli to take him back home when the window opens.</p>
              <p>Pavlyuchenko has admitted he is desperate to leave Tottenham because six months on the bench has cost him his place in the Russian team.</p>
              <p>Asked if he was planning to leave in January, the striker said: "Yes, because it's impossible for me to stay in the present situation.</p>
              <p>"I've been sitting on the bench for half a year now and because of that I've lost my place on the national team."</p>

              <p>I guess there is also another way to look at it... And that is, Spurs wants to get rid of him cos he is not fitting in and we can safely say he isn't their 2nd, or maybe even 3rd choice... Perhap he is their 4th... So if Pool wants him, why not sell or loan him to them? Cos better they give someone they find isn't really that good to your direct rival for that 4th spot rather than see them go out and buy or loan perhaps someone better? That would make their chances so much harder...</p>
              <p>Perhap we can even look at it in another fashion... Like Pool is helping Spurs to reduce their expenses by helping them pay off one of their unwanted player's salary... This way, they can use the newly released funds to help pay for another player's salary for their push toward the 4th spot? lol...</p>
              <p>It cut both ways... But i think Spurs gets the better deal if its true...</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez is spending the international break considering his options for reinforcements in the January transfer window.</strong></p>
              <p>And while it is unlikely he will have funds available to make a permanent signing, the Anfield boss will look for a loan striker to act as cover.</p>
              <p>The Spanish coach has sounded out advisors for Spurs forward Roman Pavlyuchenko, who indicated yesterday that he will press to leave the London club in January after failing to gain a regular first team place.</p>
              <p>Benitez sees him as the ideal stand in for Torres, and given his international pedigree he could do a job for Liverpool to put him into the spotlight before the World Cup gets underway next summer.</p>
              </div>
              <p>The Liverpool manager will also think about approaching his former club Real Madrid to talk about taking Dutch forward Rafael van der Vaart who has confirmed he will be leaving the Bernabeu in the January transfer window.</p>
              <p>Benitez will hope to get either player on loan, with the idea of a permanent deal in the summer when he will have more transfer funds.</p>
              <p>He will look to finance the wages of any loan signing by offloading Italian defender Andrea Dossena, who is close to concluding a deal with Napoli to take him back home when the window opens.</p>
              <p>Pavlyuchenko has admitted he is desperate to leave Tottenham because six months on the bench has cost him his place in the Russian team.</p>
              <p>Asked if he was planning to leave in January, the striker said: "Yes, because it's impossible for me to stay in the present situation.</p>
              <p>"I've been sitting on the bench for half a year now and because of that I've lost my place on the national team."</p>
