We offer Â£12m, they want Â£24m.<br><br>JUNE 21: New offer is rejected. At 11pm there is a proposition which Arsenal find acceptable. At 1am our lawyer sends a concrete offer.<br><br>JUNE 22: Deal agreed by 1pm but contract is not complete. We are allowed to meet Henry.<br><br>I realise how much he wants to sign for us. He was excited like a little boy, not like a big star.<br><br>JUNE 23-25: Lawyers sort out all contracts. On June 25 Henry is a Barca player.<br><br>Many times I thought the deal was done and many times I thought we would never sign him. In the end, we did it.</strong><br><br></div>
