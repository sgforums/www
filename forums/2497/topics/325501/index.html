              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Martin O'Neill has urged Gareth Barry to remain with Aston Villa and claimed the Midlands club want him more than Liverpool.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Barry received a rapturous reception from the
              Villa faithful following his introduction as a 15th-minute substitute
              in the Intertoto Cup win over Odense.</p>
              <p>The England midfielder responded with applause of his own as he
              turned in his usual measured performance after replacing stricken
              Dutchman Wilfred Bouma at left-back.</p>
              <p>And with Liverpool still to come up with an offer approaching
              the Â£18million Villa are demanding, O'Neill, who banned Barry from the
              training ground after his newspaper sideswipe at the Northern Irishman,
              is hoping his star man will stay.</p>
              <p>"Having not heard anything from Liverpool for some time it is clear we value him more than they do," said O'Neill.</p>
              <p>"The fact they have not answered us for a week sends out a real message.</p>
              <p>"We obviously don't want him to go, so the price we are asking
              is a fair and realistic one for a player who is so good. In fact I
              think it is really cheap.</p>
              <p>"My own view is that he should hang around for another year and see if we can make further progress as he would want.</p>
              <p>"Gareth is still only 28 next year - if we don't get where he wants to go, everybody would wish him well."</p>
              <p>O'Neill could not have asked any more of the Villa fans, who jeered Barry during a midweek outing at nearby Walsall.</p>
              <p>There was not the merest hint of dissent this time as the cheers began as the player waited to make his entrance.</p>
              <p>The reception, as well as a win which takes Villa into the UEFA
              Cup second qualifying round, provides the perfect platform for Barry to
              revise his opinion, which is what O'Neill desperately hopes for.</p>
              <p>"He has been with us for 10 years and the crowd reaction was really strong in his favour," said O'Neill.</p>
              <p>"I don't think there's any doubt about what we all want at Villa Park. We want him to stay at the club.</p>
              <p>"I am not in the habit of encouraging players to talk to me after games but I told Gareth he had been terrific.</p>
              <p>"You could see, with hardly any training, how brilliant he was.</p>
              <p>"We need him at this club. He would be a terrific loss for us."</p>
