              *Javier Mascherano Would Leave Liverpool For Barcelona â€“ Agent*
              .
              The midfield hardmanâ€™s agent has confessed that his client would have no problems swapping Anfield for Camp Nouâ€¦
              .
              .
              Liverpool midfielder Javier Mascherano has become one of Barcelonaâ€™s prime transfer targets this summer and it appears that the Blaugrana could get their man should they step up their pursuit.
              
              The Argentine captainâ€™s agent, Walter Tamer, has revealed that his client would not hesitate in accepting an offer to join the Catalans should one be officially made.
              
              â€œIf a club like Barcelona want to bring you into their ranks after having completed such a brilliant season and having won everything, obviously as a player, you are going to say, â€˜Yes, I want to play there,â€™â€� he told RAC-1 programme â€˜Tu Dirasâ€™.
              
              â€œIt is an honour for Javier that a club like Barca pay such close attention to him, especially after the incredible season they had. I believe that a transfer would be feasible. If Barca really want him, he will sign for them.â€� 
              
              Tamer also believes that â€˜Mascheâ€™ would have no problems fitting into Pep Guardiolaâ€™s setup at the Camp Nou. â€œHe would have a very easy job at Barca,â€� claimed the agent. â€œSometimes we talk and joke that the only thing he has to do is run, rob the ball, and pass it on to all the superstars in front of him.â€�
              
              Tamer, however, is aware that a Mascherano switch to Catalunya is not as easy as it seems, especially since Liverpool have to be willing to sell first. â€œI have spoken with [Barca technical director] Txiki Begiristain before, but we have not been in contact for a while now,â€� the representative asserted.
              
              â€œTo have something concrete, we have to talk to Liverpool first to know what their options are for Javier to leave, and then talk to Barcelona to find out their level of interest.
              
              â€œWhat if Xabi Alonso also leaves? Surely, [Liverpool manager] Rafael Benitez would not want to have both his central midfielders go. It will be difficult, although Xabiâ€™s future does not depend on Mascherano and vice-versa.
              
              â€œThe transaction would certainly happen, but the first to leave will have more options.â€�

              *Mascherano wants Barca move*
              .
              .
              
              
              *JAVIER MASCHERANO has stunned Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez by admitting he wants to join Barcelona.*
              
              SunSport revealed on Saturday that the European and La Liga champions had already made contact with the Argentine star's advisors and were preparing a Â£20million bid. 
              
              His agent, Walter Tamer, confirmed he held talks with Barca technical director Txiki Beguiristain - and admitted Mascherano would love to join the Catalan giants. 
              
              He said: "If a club like Barcelona want you after winning everything, obviously a player will say he wants to play there. 
              
              "It would make Javier proud to play for them after they've had such an incredible year. 
              
              "I believe a transfer can be done. I've spoken to Txiki Beguiristain about this although we've not been in contact for some time." 
              
              The news is a another blow for beleaguered Anfield boss Benitez, who is in danger of losing another of his midfield stars - Xabi Alonso - to Real Madrid and had his own transfer plans rocked by the recent announcement that Liverpool lost a whopping Â£42.6m last year. 
              
              The lure of lining up alongside the world's best midfield duo, Spain stars Andres Iniesta and Xavi Hernandez, could prove impossible for Mascherano to turn down. 
              
              And Tamer admitted he has discussed the possibility at length with Mascherano. The agent continued: "At Barcelona he would have a very easy job. "At times we joke because the only thing he would have to do there is to run, steal the ball and give it to one of their stars."

              I guess normally, the player would be keen and his agent, is only doing his job on behave of his client... The player would remain a "nice guy" in the eyes of the public while the agent takes all the rap... Otherwise how do they justify their huge commission if they are not seen doing their job by their client... They could lose a big client if he switches to another... 
              
              Kaka's father / agent was said to have been paid between $3.8 to $8m just for helping to make the move of his client / son...
