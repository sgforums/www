            <div class='col-md body'>Hackett let down by Poll's exit<br><br>Graham Poll will leave a sense of betrayal among referees when he blows the final whistle on his career at Wembley today in the Championship play-off final between Derby County and West Bromwich Albion. It is not his premature departure at 43 but rather the manner of it that rankles with Professional Game Match Officials.<br>Keith Hackett, the general manager of PGMO, wanted Poll to continue even though the official is ranked only sixth on his performance markings in his final season. However, now that Poll has decided to retire early, Hackett, it appears, has been left out of the loop.<br><br>The PGMO, comprising the FA, the Premier League and the Football League, shares that feeling of indignation over the way Poll failed to confirm plans that became public several weeks ago. A refereeing source said last night: "What would be nice is if Graham could respect the organisations he represents and let them know his intentions before commercial agents and journalists."<br>Hackett, who stood by the Tring official during the most difficult moments of his career, is thought to feel let down by the way Poll managed the announcement. Poll wanted to retire after being pilloried for showing three yellow cards to Croatia's Josip Simunic at last year's World Cup, but Hackett persuaded him to continue. However, senior figures believe he is far from irreplaceable. Alan Wiley has taken over as England's top official based on the referees' marking system. Also above Poll in this season's rankings were Mike Dean, Mark Halsey, Steve Bennett and Howard Webb.<br><br>The referees' table suggests Poll has timed his exit about right having always desired to leave when his career had passed its peak. He leaves with respect from managers and players for his fearless, forthright handling of the Premiership's most combustible matches - and in particular for facing the music as he braved another season to restore his reputation after his World Cup ridicule.<br><br>West Bromwich's captain, Paul Robinson, expects Poll to preside over a tough game at Wembley today. Robinson, who has been sent off twice and booked 11 times so far this season, said: "I did not realise it was Graham Poll's last game until someone told me the other day, but I think it will be a great way for him to retire.<br><br>"Hopefully he will make sure it is a good game of football and everybody can enjoy it. But there will not be anyone pulling out of tackles - we have a game of football to win against Derby. The most important aspect of the game is that we win it and if that means an ugly game then we are prepared for that."<br></div>
