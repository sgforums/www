              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=30">Sir Alex 
              Ferguson</a> has begun the war of words ahead of Sunday's Premier League
               showdown with Liverpool by accusing the Football Association's 
              disciplinary panel of being "dysfunctional'' after <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7935">Steven 
              Gerrard</a> escaped censure for the second time in a matter of weeks.</p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2010/0316/stevengerrardandmichaelbrown_275x155.jpg" border="0" alt="Steven Gerrard and Michael Brown clashed at Anfield" width="275" height="155">
              <div style="width: 275px;">
              <p class="photoDesc">Steven Gerrard 
              and Michael Brown clashed at Anfield</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>It comes after <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7825">Rio 
              Ferdinand</a> was forced to accept a three-match FA ban for throwing an 
              arm at Hull City striker <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=25546">Craig Fagan</a> off the ball. Ferdinand was then handed an extra one-match ban for what
               was deemed to be a "frivolous'' appeal.</p>
              <p>But Gerrard has not been 
              so unfortunate. First, he appeared to flick a V-sign in the direction of
               referee Andre Marriner as Liverpool lost at Wigan, and then the England
               international seemingly launched an elbow towards Portsmouth's <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=4767">Michael 
              Brown</a> on Monday.</p>
              <p>Gerrard will face no further action over 
              either incident. Ferguson believes it smacks of double standards, with 
              two players being treated completely differently for similar incidents.</p>
              <p>"I
               didn't expect anything to happen to 
              Steven Gerrard. It (the disciplinary panel) is a dysfunctional unit," he
               said. "I don't know what they are doing.''</p>
              <p>Ferguson had already 
              highlighted what he felt was a similar incident involving <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=40380">Javier 
              Mascherano</a> at Leeds during a Carling Cup tie earlier in the 
              campaign.</p>
              <p>"There is no consistency for a start and I didn't expect
               to get any,'' Ferguson added. "I am not too bothered about it. They can
               do what they want down there. It is crazy at times.''</p>
              <p>Although he
               gave Rafael Benitez plenty of credit for masterminding Liverpool's
              challenge last term, the Scot always had a feeling it was the best that 
              Reds
              team could manage.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes you peak with a particular team and 
              it is difficult to do it
              again,'' said Ferguson. "Everyone expected Liverpool to do better. But 
              they are not. Their challenge, along with quite a few others, is to get 
              that fourth spot,
              which seems to be a league of its own.''</p>
              <p>"It happens every 
              season. It is not something new.''</p>
              <p>Ferguson certainly believes 
              there will be no repeat of the 4-1 defeat United
              suffered at the hands of their old rivals in the corresponding game last
               term.</p>
              <p>"Last season was a one-off,'' said Ferguson. "It won't 
              happen again. I can
              assure you of that. Absolutely no chance.</p>
              <p>"Being on top of the 
              league at this stage of this season would make us
              difficult to get back at. I don't place that much importance on the 19th
               title. The more important one
              would be the 20th. This club is capable of doing that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Na bei, that old cheat complain so much. Why not tell it to their David Gill? surely he can "do something". </span></strong></p>
