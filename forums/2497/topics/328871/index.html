              <h2>Derby County defender Tyrone Mears is facing disciplinary action
              from his club after going AWOL and joining Olympique Marseille for a
              trial.</h2>
              <p>In an incredible story, it has emerged that the 25-year-old right-back
              absented himself from Rams training duty today and travelled to France
              in order to partake in a trial with Marseille. <br><br>It is believed
              that OM initially approached Derby with an offer to take the player on
              loan, on completion of a cursory trial period. <br><br>The player, for
              whom Derby are prepared to listen to offers, is valued at £2million by
              the Championship club and as such, they refused to release the player
              and dismissed the offer as ‘laughable’. <br><br>Club manager Paul
              Jewell (pictured) met with Mears to discuss the offer and both player
              and manager decided against the opportunity. <br><br>However, it has
              now emerged that the defender took it upon himself to go to France
              without the expressed permission of his club and will face disciplinary
              action as a result of his jaunt. <br><br>Paul Jewell fumed: “To jump
              on a plane and go and train with another club without permission is an
              absolute disgrace and an afront to Derby County and the supporters. I
              have dealt with a lot of things in football but this is incredible.”<br><br>Jewell
              described the offer from the Champions League participants, and
              revealed that club chairman Adam Pearson had received a fax regarding
              the player on Thursday.<br><br>“Tyrone came to see me about 4pm yesterday and I said to him ‘are you willing to go on trial and he said no’.<br><br>"He
              is an established player, why should he go on trial? He wouldn’t go on
              trial to a club in this country, something he agreed with.<br><br>"I said I’d see him at training today and now this has happened.”</p>

              <p class="first"><strong>Derby County defender Tyrone Mears has been fined six weeks' wages after having an unauthorised trial with Marseille in August.</strong></p>
              <p>The 25-year-old has since gone on loan to the French club until January.</p>
              <p>Manager Paul Jewell told BBC Radio Derby: "He was fined for
              going without our permission, leaving the country and not reporting for
              training."</p>
              <p>Jewell said the fine was not as high as the £75,000 figure reported and Mears has got six weeks to appeal.
              </p>
              <p>Mears joined Derby from West Ham last season and appeared 25 times as the Rams suffered Premier League relegation.
