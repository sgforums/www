            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Photo/competitions/UCL/442813_MEDIUMSQUARE.jpg"><br><br>'Decisive moment' nears for Arsenal<br>Tuesday, 31 October 2006<br><br>by Michael Harroldfrom London<br><br>Arsenal FC manager ArsÃ¨ne Wenger says UEFA Champions League Group G is entering a decisive phase as his side prepare to face PFC CSKA Moskva. It is the first of two home games for Arsenal and how they respond to defeat in Russia on Matchday 3 will go a long way to deciding their fate in the section.<br><br>'Decisive'<br>"It's the decisive moment because if we win the game we will nearly be qualified, but not mathematically no matter what happens," Wenger said. "We want to keep winning our home games in the Champions League like we did in a great way against [FC] Porto." Arsenal beat Porto 2-0 to take command of the group, then lost top spot to CSKA following a 1-0 reverse a fortnight ago. "They gave us a problem in Moscow that they'll give us again tomorrow," Wenger said. "They defended very well, were very aggressive, very well organised and played on the break."<br><br>Defensive<br>Wenger is accustomed to opponents getting men behind the ball against his free-flowing side who have struggled to break teams down after falling behind, as they did against Everton FC on Saturday. Arsenal hit back to draw 1-1, but Wenger knows CSKA will hurt them if they do not improve. "We weren't mobile enough," Wenger said. "Of course Everton defended very deep but I still think there's always enough space for a team to be dangerous no matter how many players defend. We didn't support our attacks enough from the flanks and that's why we weren't dangerous enough."<br><br>Injuries<br>Wenger's options have been narrowed by injuries and just as Philippe Senderos and GaÃ«l Clichy return, Justin Hoyte is giving cause for concern after coming off at the weekend with a back problem. The 21-year-old is "a doubt" so Clichy may play at left-back with William Gallas switching to the centre in a lineup otherwise unchanged from Saturday.<br><br>Dilemma<br>CSKA coach Valeri Gazzaev's main dilemma is whether to deploy VÃ¡gner Love or Ivica Olić in front of the dangerous Daniel Carvalho, scorer of the only goal in Moscow. Love missed Saturday's trip to FC Rostov because of a muscle strain and, in his absence, Olić stated his case with both goals as CSKA extended their lead at the top of the Russian Premier-Liga with a 2-1 victory. "We don't know Love's position yet," Gazzaev said. "He was OK in training and we'll take a decision on him tomorrow."<br><br>Support<br>CSKA will be well supported at the new Arsenal Stadium, with an ever-increasing expatriate community in London swelled for the night by hundreds of fans who have taken the four-hour flight from the Russian capital. Hopes are high among them that the 2005 UEFA Cup winners will reach the knockout stage and Gazzaev is doing nothing to dampen those expectations. "We can improve," he said. "The goal is to win tomorrow, but the ultimate aim is to still be top of the group after the match."</div>

However, their only home match so far ended in a creditable goalless draw with SL Benfica, and StÃ¥le Solbakken hopes his players will be inspired on Wednesday night. "It's the greatest game in KÃ¸benhavn's history," said the coach. "That will give extra strength to the players and it will be a much closer contest than at Old Trafford. Although we played quite well, we were up against maybe the best attacking team in Europe, so we're in for another tough contest."<br><br>Rooney danger<br>Solbakken, whose men beat Vejle BK 3-0 on Sunday, made light of the fact United will be without Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs and Louis Saha through injury, pointing instead to the danger posed by Wayne Rooney. The English international ended a ten-game goalless streak with a hat-trick in Saturday's 4-0 win at Bolton Wanderers FC, and Solbakken hinted he might deploy a five-man midfield to keep the 21-year-old in check. "We all know what he is capable of," said the Norwegian. "The goals have started to come for him again, and with Saha and Giggs out he will be even more vital to United, so we will keep an extra eye on him of course."<br><br>'Fantastic player'<br>Rooney's renaissance is likely to mean a busy evening for Jesper Christiansen, and he admits it will take an exceptional defensive display to stop United. "It's important we don't concede early, but we still have to be aggressive going forward and believe we can create chances," the goalkeeper told uefa.com. "Rooney is a fantastic player whether he is scoring or not. He was the main link in their play at Old Trafford and we'll have to find a way of keeping him quiet."<br><br>Happy memories<br>The last time United visited Denmark in the UEFA Champions League they recorded a 6-2 victory at BrÃ¸ndby IF en route to lifting the trophy in 1998/99. Sir Alex Ferguson insists another away success could prove to be a lucky omen again. "We have an opportunity with a new team to win the European Cup again and we could do it," he said. "There are half a dozen clubs who could win the competition this season, it's that open, but we're one of them."<br><br>'Exceptional individual'<br>Ole Gunnar SolskjÃ¦r was among the goalscorers against BrÃ¸ndby, and Sir Alex is full of praise for the way the Norwegian forward has returned after a two-year injury lay-off to score eight goals this season. "He's an exceptional and amazing individual," added the manager. "I'm now thinking he can get me 20 goals this season."</div>

'I have a stronger feeling about it now. I think he can.<br><br>'He has a fantastic football brain and has the best movement inside the penalty box of any striker I have had during my time at United.<br><br>'Maybe he has lost half a yard of pace but I don't think the injury is responsible for that, it is just something that happens with age.<br><br>'He is an amazing individual and to have scored six goals already is incredible.'<br><br>With captain Gary Neville and fellow veteran Ryan Giggs also remaining in England, changes from the side which swamped Bolton on Saturday are inevitable as United look to come to terms with an atrocious pitch churned up by a Bruce Springsteen concert this weekend.<br><br>Wes Brown will replace Neville, while Darren Fletcher and John O'Shea will be rewarded for their consistency this season by receiving midfield starting berths.<br><br>Gabriel Heinze is also expected to line up at left-back as United look to extend a run of seven successive wins that has seen them established as serious trophy contenders on all fronts this term.<br><br>After a succession of failures on the European front, Ferguson is particularly keen to make an impact on the Champions League this year.<br><br>As he approaches his 20th anniversary as United manager, the Scot is acutely aware the trophy should have been collected more than once during his illustrious reign.<br><br>But, after being written off as contenders at the start of the season, Ferguson accepts his side's form over the opening two months of the campaign has pushed them back into the bracket of potential winners once more.<br><br>'We can do it,' he declared.<br><br>'During my time at the club, we should have won this competition at least another twice but this is a new team, full of promise.<br><br>'What we have to do is maintain our form and find a level of consistency.

            <div class='col-md body'>Determined Djourou keen on starting role<br><br>Johan Djourou is determined to keep his place in the Arsenal side despite his compatriot Philippe Senderos stepping up a return from injury.<br><br>Senderos is returning from a dislocated shoulder and is expected to be on the bench for tonight's Champions League game against CSKA Moscow, although he will be looking to partner Kolo Toure in the heart of Arsenal's defence when fully recovered.<br><br>Djourou, who is Swiss like Senderos, has proved an able deputy and is looking to extend his run in the first team beyond tonight's clash at the Emirates Stadium.<br><br>The 19-year-old centre-back, who signed a six-year deal with the club in the summer, said: 'If the boss wants to change the team that's his decision.<br><br>'It's up to me to show in training I deserve to play.<br><br>'William Gallas and Kolo are there as well and as a young player I have to show I'm ready to play, so Philippe coming back is putting extra pressure on me and it's a good thing.<br><br>'It's very good to play at the top level because it's a good competition, but with Gallas and Toure around you can learn from them. They're fantastic team-mates.'<br><br>Arsenal felt a sense of injustice when they lost to CSKA in Russia two weeks ago, with Thierry Henry having a late strike in the Group G game harshly ruled out for handball.<br><br>'I can understand his frustration over what happened in Moscow,' said Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger.<br><br>'Frankly, it is difficult enough to score goals and on top of that it is cancelled and on top of that you get a yellow card. It is not easy to take.'<br><br>Djourou also felt the free-kick he gave away for Daniel Carvalho's winner was an incorrect decision.<br><br>'I was upset because I thought the referee let the play go on and then came back,' he added. 'I wasn't sure it was a foul.'<br><br>Arsenal are looking to bounce back from the weekend draw against Everton, where Henry was again frustrated as the visitors to the Emirates Stadium looked to stifle the hosts.<br><br>Wenger added: 'Thierry wants always to do well. You do not make the career he has made if you do not have that burning desire to win and to score goals.<br><br>'Of course he was frustrated on Saturday because he we did not win and he could not make the difference because he is used to doing it.<br><br>'But that happens as well. You have to take that on board and it is not the first time and it will not be the last time.'<br><br></div>
