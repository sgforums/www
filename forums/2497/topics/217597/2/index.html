The goal came from a corner that was not dealt with by the United defence, allowing Marcus AllbÃ¤ck to prod in from barely a metre after Atiba Hutchinson's header into his path.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>AllbÃ¤ck winner upsets United<br>Wednesday, 1 November 2006<br><br>A Marcus AllbÃ¤ck goal seventeen minutes from time gave FC KÃ¸benhavn their first UEFA Champions League victory at the expense of Group F rivals Manchester United FC.<br><br>Famous win<br>The match looked destined for a goalless draw when the Sweden striker pounced on Atiba Hutchinson's header to prod the ball over the line following a corner. With SL Benfica beating Celtic FC 3-0 in Lisbon, the group has been thrown open with KÃ¸benhavn moving to the four-point mark, two adrift of second-placed Celtic and five behind United.<br><br>Heinze means business<br>It was apparent from the early stages that the surface, rutted by the exertions of a Bruce Springsteen concert at the weekend, would mitigate against free-flowing football and the first ten minutes were punctuated by a series of high balls designed to test the resolve of both defences. The home rearguard were the first to flinch, on 13 minutes, when Gabriel Heinze got the better of Lars Jacobsen down the United left before feeding Wayne Rooney. The in-form striker cut inside and curled in a shot which was comfortably held by Jesper Christiansen.<br><br>Breaking away<br>Twenty-four minutes had elapsed before KÃ¸benhavn managed to get their first effort on target. Hutchinson robbed Heinze and slipped the ball to Michael Silberbauer but the midfielder's low attempt was easily held by United captain Edwin van der Sar at his near post. Almost immediately United broke to the other end, and from Wes Brown's cross, Rooney headed just over. The pace of the 21-year-old was causing all sorts of problems for the hosts and just before the half-hour, Brede Hangeland was booked for a late challenge on Rooney. However, the forward should have done better on 32 minutes when he fashioned another opening for himself, turning Hangeland inside the box before miscuing a weak shot.<br><br>Corner threat<br>Sir Alex Ferguson made one change at half-time, introducing Rio Ferdinand for Nemanja Vidić and the England centre-back was instantly involved as the Danish champions forced a series of corners. From one of Jacobsen's deliveries, Michael Gravgaard managed to get a header on target but it lacked power and was well taken by Van der Sar. His opposite number Christiansen had to be alert moments later, smothering the ball at Ole Gunnar SolksjÃ¦r's feet after Cristiano Ronaldo had played the Norwegian in on goal.<br><br>United pressure<br>Hutchinson had another opportunity on 55 minutes when Martin Bergvold picked him out with a left-wing cross, but although the midfielder rose above Ferdinand, he could not keep his header down. United responded, SolksjÃ¦r and Rooney combining inside the area before the latter glided the ball across to John O'Shea who cushioned a shot wide of the post with the goal at his mercy. The game was being played in KÃ¸benhavn's half and Rooney nodded wide from another Heinze centre on 64 minutes, before a shot from SolksjÃ¦r was deflected wide.<br><br>First goal<br>Home coach StÃ¥le Solbakken threw on Fredrik Berglund and William Kvist as KÃ¸benhanvn pushed for their first goal of the campaign and, within minutes, they had broken the deadlock. Jacobsen's corner was not cleared by United and when Hutchinson nodded the resulting cross towards goal, Allback reacted quickest to bundle the ball over the line and reignite FCK's qualifying hopes.<br><br><img src="http://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Photo/competitions/UCL/474359_MEDIUMSQUARE.jpg"></div>

Ultimately, though, they had Jens Lehmann to thank for a point after he saved superbly from VÃ¡gner Love shortly after the break. The stalemate leaves CSKA a point clear of Arsenal with everything to play for on Matchdays 5 and 6.<br><br>Henry determination<br>Henry showed his determination to make up for defeat in Moscow a fortnight ago with a fierce tackle on Yuri Zhirkov that earned an early booking. The Arsenal captain was in the thick of the action and moments later crossed for Robin van Persie who nodded wide. Arsenal were playing with pace and verve, intent on stamping their mark on the game, and twice more in the opening 15 minutes Van Persie missed the target when well placed. After a flowing move on 17 minutes, RosickÃ½ sent Gilberto scampering clear down the right. The Brazilian crossed low for Henry but the Frenchman stabbed wide at the near post.<br><br>Chances spurned<br>It was all Arsenal, although as in Saturday's draw against Everton FC, they were struggling to break down a packed defence. CSKA worked their first opportunity midway through the half when Daniel Carvalho rifled a free-kick straight at Lehmann. Arsenal were soon back on the attack and Fabregas should have put them ahead on 27 minutes, firing into the side-netting after rounding Igor Akinfeev. CSKA had not conceded in five previous UEFA Champions League outings this term, and rode their luck here. It summed up the first period when Henry shot wide with only the keeper to beat, before RosickÃ½ missed with the goal at his mercy just one metre out. Arsenal fans were laughing in disbelief.<br><br>Love lost<br>The pattern was resumed at the start of the second half with William Gallas pressing forward regularly to add power to Arsenal's attacking finesse. It was the Gunners, though, who were fortunate not to fall behind on 57 minutes. VÃ¡gner Love, preferred in attack to Ivica Olić, got the better of Gallas on the edge of the Arsenal area and Lehmann had to come to the rescue, grasping the ball with an outstretched hand as the Brazilian striker looked to round him.<br><br>Nervy finale<br>Arsenal had survived a scare, and their nervousness grew with every CSKA counterattack. That said, the hosts were still making chances and Van Persie was centimetres away from connecting with Henry's low delivery on 65 minutes. The introduction of Theo Walcott with 20 minutes remaining restored hope but when Van Persie headed wide with the goal gaping, and Akinfeev repelled an effort from Gilberto, it confirmed the evening belonged to CSKA.<br><br><img src="http://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Photo/competitions/UCL/474361_MEDIUMSQUARE.jpg"></div>
