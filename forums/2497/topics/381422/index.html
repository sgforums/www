              <p><em><span style="color: #888888;">GET OUT!</span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Newcastle fans have formally launched a campaign to buy the club as
              they look to raise funds from banks, businesses and fellow supporters.</p>
              <p>Sportswear tycoon Mike Ashley recently took the club off the market
              - for the second time - after revealing he was prepared to part with
              the club for around £80 million. Ashley has faced repeated supporter
              demonstrations against his tenure, and last week incensed fans by
              changing the name of the club's famous old ground to the
              sportsdirect.com@St James' Park Stadium.</p>
              <p>Newcastle United
              Supporters Trust (NUST), a not-for-profit organisation formed in the
              wake of former manager Kevin Keegan's constructive dismissal in
              September 2008, has spearheaded the campaign for him to leave.</p>
              <p>On
              Tuesday, it asked fans to pledge funds, backed by a deposit, into a
              special bank account to be used as a war chest for a buyout. It said
              further backers, including big names in the financial and business
              world, would be revealed in the coming days.</p>
              <p>Launching the 'Yes
              We Can' Campaign on Newcastle and Gateshead's quaysides, NUST spokesman
              Mark Jensen said the campaign had been months in the planning.</p>
              <p>"We
              have emailed over 40,000 supporters to ask them if and how they want to
              buy into the campaign to lead a city-wide bid to buy back the club," he
              said. "There are a number of ways supporters can buy into the model -
              which has been dubbed by the financial community as the 'Barcelona on
              the Tyne' - which would see a democratisation of the club to ensure
              that the current state of the club would not be repeated.</p>
              <p>"The
              idea is based on fans investing in the club through a number of
              financial opportunities which will be held by a local solicitor in an
              escrow account to demonstrate to Ashley that the fans have proof of
              funds.</p>
              <p>"Supporters will be asked to pledge 10% of their
              investment into this account and guaranteed that the money will be
              returned if the bid fails. It is clear that we have no knight in
              shining armour to end the charade at St James' Park so we must look at
              how we can do this ourselves.</p>
              <p>"The club is a fantastic investment
              if run properly and we aim to attract the type of investors who will
              seek to bring back the values of integrity and honesty to the club.
              We've been in discussions with serious people in the city and beyond
              and they have thrown down the gauntlet to supporters to lead the charge.</p>
              <p>"We've
              been obsessed by protest but this is the ultimate protest. If people
              want more info, they can visit www.nust.org.uk and find out more. There
              are a range of ways to invest, but fans can be sure that it will be on
              a 'one investor one vote' basis with fans electing six fans'
              representatives through the Trust and a President who will bring in a
              professional team accountable to the fans ultimately.</p>
              <p>"There are
              serious investors who want to back this idea because they can see the
              potential in the club. This is an investment which is not only ruled by
              the heart but by the head also."</p>
              <p>A spokesman from independent
              fans' website nufc.com said: "A succession of real and imagined bids
              have failed to bring about a change of ownership at SJP and in the
              meantime, the dignity and standing of the club has steadily been eroded.</p>
              <p>"Saturday's
              home game proved that unprecedented numbers of Newcastle supporters are
              sticking with the team, while demonstrating opposition to the current
              administration and their plans.</p>
              <p>"There's never been a better time
              to try and channel the energy of those protests into something
              tangible. That's why we're pleased to support the efforts of these lads
              and lasses and we're interested in the detail of their proposals."</p>
