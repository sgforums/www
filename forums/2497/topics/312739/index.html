              <h2>Brazil legend Romario has announced his retirement from football after 27 years in the game.</h2>
              <p>The 42-year-old, who has not played for Vasco da Gama since November due to
              a drugs ban, had revealed last month that he would be finally hanging up his
              boots at the end of March.
              <br><br>"I am not going to play any more. I have already stopped. I am out of
              shape,‚Äù Romario told O Dia newspaper.
              <br><br>"My last game was a long time ago and it is over for me."
              <br><br>Romario has retired from both playing and coaching and his only
              footballing involvement will be to help the Brazilian Football Confederation in
              their preparations for the 2014 World Cup.
              <br><br>"I am not going to return to Vasco. I am not going to work now and they
              are not paying me but our friendship continues," he added.
              <br><br>"I have talked to the board about my decision. On Sunday I am going to
              travel to the Caribbean.
              <br><br>"I have made this decision myself. If I had wanted to continue playing
              I would have returned to Vasco but that is not in my thoughts.
              <br><br>"I want to be with my children and we are travelling a lot. This makes
              me happy."
              <br><br>Romario has had a glittering career, in which he has also starred for the
              likes of PSV Eindhoven, Barcelona,
               Valencia and
              Vasco da Gama.
              <br><br>Last year he reportedly became only the second player ever, the other being
              Pele, to hit 1000 goals in professional football, when he scored a penalty for
              Vasco against Sport Recife.
              <br><br>He was also a star of the Brazil
              national team, and was at the peak of his powers in 1994 when he largely
              carried an ordinary team all the way to the World Cup final in America, where they defeated Italy on penalties.</p>
