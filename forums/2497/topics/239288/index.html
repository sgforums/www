            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Alan Curbishley endured a torrid return to The Valley as West Ham United were thumped 4-0 by his former club Charlton Athletic.<br><br>In a crucial clash between the relegation rivals, Alan Pardew put one over his old employers to lift Charlton to within three points of safety.<br><br>Darren Ambrose opened the scoring for The Addicks in a one-sided romp, with Jerome Thomas adding a second goal as West Ham's defence caved in.<br><br>Darren Bent marked his first appearance in two months with the third goal before half-time and Thomas got his second of the game with 10 minutes left to secure Charlton's biggest Premiership win since November 2004.<br><br>Calum Davenport made a good early block to prevent Darren Bent reaching Ambrose's cross before Charlton old boy Paul Konchesky was booked for going through the back of the midfielder.<br><br>Ambrose's probing runs in field were a constant threat in the first half and one dart into the penalty area required a good block from a covering defender.<br><br>Nigel Quashie was then booked for another robust challenge on Ambrose before Konchesky thrashed a volley across the face of goal after Carlton Cole's cross had been flicked on.<br><br>The breakthrough came on 24 minutes when Thomas' pass released Marcus Bent, who appeared a fraction offside, and his pull-back was cushioned inside the post by Ambrose.<br><br>Just 10 minutes later it was 2-0 as Thomas took advantage of gaps in the West Ham defence to sprint into the box and drive a low shot across Green after Davenport failed to get in a challenge.<br><br>Marcus Bent was then forced off with an injury and his replacement - Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink - was the creator of the third goal on 41 minutes after Scott Carson had earlier been pressed into his first save by beating away Quashie's 30-yard thumper.<br><br>Hasselbaink's pass sent Darren Bent scampering clear, with Davenport having failed to time his decision to play offside, and the returning striker struck a composed finish past Green.<br><br>Charlton came close to scoring a fourth goal early in the second half, but Hasselbaink's caressed curler from 25 yards came back off the post.<br><br>Carlos Tevez, having whipped a free-kick just over late in the first period, forced Carson to tip a set-piece over the bar as West Ham showed a little more purpose going forward.<br><br>Davenport headed straight at Carson, Yossi Benayoun shot at the on-loan keeper, who then turned substitute Marlon Harewood's deflected shot wide.<br><br>But with The Hammers having slung on all their attacking guns, they were caught with a sucker-punch 10 minutes from time, having been applying the pressure in Charlton's box.<br><br>Carson saved another Davenport header from a corner and immediately launched a counter-attack, which ended with Ambrose playing a low ball into the box for Thomas to sweep home in decisive fashion.<br><br>The scoreline could have been more embarrassing for The Hammers, but for the frame of the goal as Souleymane Diawara headed Thomas' free-kick against the bar in injury-time.<br><br>Curbishley will be mindful that a 4-0 away defeat marked the end of Pardew's tenure back in December and the current incumbent will be desperately hoping lightning does not strike twice.<br></span></div>

After all, he knew what he was getting into when he pick WH ahead of Pool... He was earning 25,000 per week at BBR and Pool offered him that same amount But WH is said to be paying him double at $50 - $60 ,000 per week...<br><br>A player at his age (29), getting his last big money contract is everything. Cos by the time his contract ends, he would probable be ready to retire. Anyway, which ever league he is playing... Australia will still pick him cos they don't have many quality defenders...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
