              <p class="ms-text-caption"><em>Anelka - sent home by France 
              after dressing-room bust-up.</em></p>
              </div>
              <p class="ms-text-bold">The France squad released a statement condemning
                   the decision to send Nicolas Anelka home and refused to train on 
                  Sunday.</p>
              <p>A day after the French Football Federation decided to punish the 
                  Chelsea striker for an outburst against coach Raymond Domenech at 
                  half-time of Thursday's 2-0 defeat to Mexico, the mood among the 
                  remaining players was one of anger and resentment.</p>
              <p>Just a few 
                  minutes after taking the field ahead of training, fitness coach Robert 
                  Duverne reportedly stormed away from an argument with captain Patrice 
                  Evra, throwing his accreditation badge to the ground.</p>
              <p>The players 
                  then left the training ground and boarded the team bus, in which they 
                  had a meeting with Domenech behind closed curtains.</p>
              <p>France team 
                  director Jean-Louis Valentin announced his resignation after revealing 
                  the squad did not want to train.</p>
              <p>"Ask the players, they do not 
                  want to involve themselves any more. It's unacceptable," Valentin told 
                  assembled media when quizzed as to why he was quitting.</p>
              <p>"They 
                  don't want to train. It's a scandal for the French, it's a scandal for 
                  the federation and the French team.</p>
              <p>"It is a shame. As for me, 
                  it's over. I'm leaving the federation. I'm sickened and disgusted.</p>
              <p>"Under
                   these conditions, I've decided to return to Paris and to resign."</p>
              <p>The
                   players then released a statement which was read out by Domenech.</p>
              <p>It
                   read: "All players without exception want to declare their opposition 
                  to FFF decision to exclude Nicolas Anelka."</p>
              <p>The players added they
                   felt the FFF "had at no time tried to protect the squad."</p>
              <p>They 
                  did vow, however, "to do everything individually and collectively so 
                  that France regains its honour [against South Africa] on Tuesday".</p>

              <h1>France World Cup squad refuse to train after bust-up between Patrice
               Evra and fitness coach Robert Duverne</h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>France's chaotic World Cup campaign is in disarray after the 
              players boycotted
              training in support of Nicolas Anelka, who was sent home yesterday for a
               row
              with coach Raymond Domenech.</p>
              <p>Less than 24 hours after the 
              Chelsea forward was excluded by the French
              Football Federation (FFF) for refusing to apologise for his verbal 
              attack on
              Domenech, the rest of the squad took matters into their own hands.</p>
              <p>Just
               a few minutes after taking the field for a training session at their
              Knysna base in South Africa captain Patrice Evra and fitness coach 
              Robert
              Duverne became involved in an argument. </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/20/article-0-0A1CE000000005DC-244_468x286.jpg" alt="Patrice Evra" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Flashpoint: Skipper Evra had a row with the 
              fitness coach</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Domenech stepped in and Duverne stormed away 
              as the players walked off and
              boarded the team bus.</p>
              <p>The coach returned moments later to 
              read a statement from the squad to the
              assembled media.</p>
              <p>'All players without exception want to declare their opposition to FFF
              decision to exclude Nicolas Anelka,' it said.</p>
              <p>The statement 
              added the players were angered the Anelka-Domenech row had become
              public and criticised the FFF, 'which at no time tried to protect the 
              squad'.</p>
              <p>However, the players vowed 'to do everything 
              individually and collectively so
              that France regains its honour [against South Africa] on Tuesday'. </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/20/article-0-0A15AD7A000005DC-282_468x276.jpg" alt="France" width="468" height="276">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Down and out: France are on the verge of 
              dropping out of the World Cup</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The walkout was prompted by 
              events yesterday when Anelka was dismissed from the
              squad after he refused to say sorry for his outburst at Domenech.</p>
              <p>Anelka
               exploded in a foul-mouthed tirade after the coach criticised him for
              straying out of position during the goalless first half of their 2-0 
              Group A
              defeat by Mexico on Thursday.</p>
              <p>The 31-year-old was 
              subsequently substituted before the start of the second
              half.
              Last night Manchester United defender Evra accused a 'traitor' within 
              the
              camp of trying to destabilise the squad after the details of Anelka's 
              row were
              leaked to the press.</p>
              <p>But the players, already under pressure 
              as a draw between Uruguay and Mexico on
              Tuesday will confirm France's elimination from the tournament 
              irrespective of
              their result against hosts South Africa, felt the need to make a more 
              public
              stand.</p>
              <p>'With this statement, all the players in the France 
              squad without exception
              want to declare their opposition to the decision taken by the French 
              Football
              Federation to exclude Nicolas Anelka from the squad. </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/20/article-1288096-0A1F4E6C000005DC-758_468x286.jpg" alt="France " width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Shambles: France players return to their bus 
              after refusing to take part in a training</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>'If we regret the 
              incident which occurred at half-time of the match between
              France and Mexico, we regret even more the leak of an event which should
               have
              remained within the group and which is quite common in a high-level 
              team.</p>
              <p>'At the request of the squad, the player in question 
              attempted to have
              dialogue but his approach was ignored.</p>
              <p>'For its part, the 
              French Football Federation has at no time tried to protect
              the squad. It has made a decision (to send Anelka home) without 
              consulting all the
              players, on the basis of the facts reported by the press.</p>
              <p>'Accordingly,
               and to mark the opposition to those at the highest level of
              French football, all the players decided not to train today.</p>
              <p>Out
               of respect for the public who came to attend training, we decided to go
              to meet the fans who, by their presence, showed their full support. </p>

              <p>'For our part, we are aware of our responsibilities as those wearing 
              the
              colours of our country. Also for those we have towards our fans and 
              countless
              children who keep Les Bleus as role models.</p>
              <p>'We forget none 
              of our duties. We will do everything individually and also in a 
              collective spirit to ensure
              that France regains its honour with a positive performance on Tuesday.'</p>
              <p>Domenech
               had stressed earlier in the day that had Anelka apologised he would
              have allowed him to stay with the squad.</p>
              <p>He also played down 
              the seriousness and context of his disagreement with the
              Chelsea striker.</p>
              <p>'It was not a confrontation,' said the 
              57-year-old, whose six-year reign as
              France boss will end with the country's participation in the South 
              Africa as he
              is being replaced by 1998 World Cup-winner Laurent Blanc. </p>

              <p>'People cannot imagine the pressure. We are in a dressing room, the 
              coach says
              something to a player who is already under pressure, he can react 
              angrily, and
              with strong words.</p>
              <p>'He did not react in the most suitable 
              fashion, but it was just a guy sitting
              in his corner and muttering - that would not have mattered had it stayed
               there.</p>
              <p>'What was important was that it made the front page 
              of a newspaper, and that
              exposes the internal life of the squad.</p>
              <p>'I sorted out the 
              problem internally, and as far as I was concerned it was
              done and dusted.</p>
              <p>'I had another chat with him (Anelka) the 
              next day and I left open the
              possibility for him to apologise, something which he did not want to do.</p>
              <p>'The decision to exclude him was the right one. He does not 
              have the right to
              say such things.'</p>
              <p>In the wake of events today France team 
              director Jean-Louis Valentin said he
              would be resigning.</p>
              <p>'It's a scandal for the French, it's a 
              scandal for the federation and the
              French team, he said.</p>
              <p>'It is a shame. As for me, it's over. 
              I'm leaving the federation. I'm sickened
              and disgusted.</p>
              <p>'Under these conditions, I've decided to 
              return to Paris and to resign.'</p>
