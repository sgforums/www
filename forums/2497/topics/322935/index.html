              <p>Kewell ended his miserable five-year stay on Merseyside at
              the end of last season when Liverpool opted
              against offering him a new contract.<br><br>Now a free agent, the 29-year-old has been strongly linked with a move to Roma over
              the past few weeks or so, and according to Ansa, the Giallorossi last week
              offered Kewell €1m per season in order to join them.<br><br>Latest reports in Italy
              claim that the Australian has given his consent to a move to the Eternal City, and could officially be a Roma
              player as early as next week.<br><br>If Kewell were to join the Giallorossi he would hook-up with
              former Liverpool
              team-mate John Arne Riise, who completed his move to the Stadio Olimpico last
              week.</p>

              <h1>Galatasaray Announce Kewell Capture</h1>
              <h2>Former Leeds United midfielder Harry Kewell has reportedly completed a controversial move to Galatasaray.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 29-year old, who was released by Liverpool in May after an injury-troubled spell at Anfield, was widely expected to move to Portsmouth within the next few days. <br><br>However, the Australia international has risked the backlash of English football fans with the decision to join the Turkish club. <br><br>The player angered fans at Elland Road after he refused to sign a new deal with the club, instead holding them to ransom until they accepted a cut-price £5 million offer from Liverpool. <br><br>The move will also heighten the tension between fans of Leeds United and their Turkish counterpart which stems from the dreadful scenes witnessed in 2000 before the sides’ UEFA Cup semi-final, with two innocent fans of the English club stabbed to death during violent clashes. <br><br>It was not the first incident of violence involving Galatasaray, with Manchester United fans also targeted by hooligan sects in 1993 and more recently during Champiosn League fixtures. <br><br>Kewell’s career has failed to hit the heights of his spell with The Whites, where he established himself as one of the best left-wingers in Europe, and he now looks set to sign a three-year deal with the club. <br><br>Galatasaray’s official website has announced his arrival at the Ali Sami Yen Stadium, news that will disappoint fans and potential suitors alike.</p>

              <h1>Kewell Agent Rubbishes Galatasaray "Transfer"</h1>
              <h2>Bernie Mandic, agent to Harry Kewell, has vehemently denied his
              client has sealed a move to Turkish heavyweights, Galatasaray, despite
              claims on the club’s website stating the contrary.</h2>
              <p>Harry Kewell, 29, entered the July transfer window on a free after
              rejecting a reduction in his wage package, from Liverpool where he
              spent 5 injury-plagued years. Since then, he has been linked with a
              plethora of clubs. Most notably: Galatasaray. <br><br>The Australian
              dribbler’s agent said that no decision regarding the national captain’s
              future would be made until Saturday the 5th of July. Mandic told
              Liverpool’s team website: “We have not finalised a deal for Harry and
              it’s down to two possibilities. We will not make any further comments
              until Harry decides on the options around noon on Saturday European
              time.” <br><br>Kewell was sent off against the Turkish side in a UEFA
              cup semi-final, when he was playing for Leeds in 2000. If he did sign
              for them then this could anger many Leeds United fans whom still hold
              dear the memories of two fans stabbed to death by the Istanbul side. <br><br>He has also been linked with A.S Roma.</p>
