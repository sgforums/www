              <p class="article"><strong></strong></p>
              <p class="article"><strong>The Gunners have gone five league games without a win and fallen six points behind leaders Manchester United. After heading the pack by five points, Arsenal are now in third behind Chelsea and Fabregas thinks he can see the glee in people’s eyes.</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The Gunners midfielder said: “I feel every time we lose or we don’t play well it’s like everybody’s happy. “I still don’t understand why everybody is against people who try to play nice football. “We’ve been playing fantastic football. But it’s true people like to see us lose. That’s the way I feel.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Arsenal have not thrown in the title towel though. They still have to visit Old Trafford on April 13 while United must go to Chelsea 13 days later. But Fabregas admits the Gunners cannot afford any more slip-ups in their last six games as they prepare for their match against Liverpool.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The Spaniard said: “If we want to win the league we cannot lose any more points. We have to think positive. “We have to believe we can do it. Whatever happens we fight to the end — that is what we are recognised for. “We can change things. Man United have to go to Chelsea and we’re going to Old Trafford to win. Of course we can win there. We did it last season and we’ve done if a few times in recent years so why not this time?</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“We have to go game by game. And every game is a final right to the end of the season.” Arsenal have not won a domestic game since February 11 before last night. The Gunners slumped to a 4-0 defeat at United in the FA Cup in their following match.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">But Fabregas says things started to go wrong when they drew 2-2 with Birmingham. Eduardo suffered his horrific leg break at St Andrew’s and Gael Clichy conceded a last-minute penalty which allowed Brum to grab a point.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Three more draws followed, then Arsenal lost 2-1 to Chelsea last Sunday after taking the lead. Fabregas said: “A little bit of everything has gone wrong in the last few weeks. “It all started at Birmingham where we could have killed the game before they equalised. “We could have made it 3-1 and then, after that little mistake by Gael, they had a penalty. “But even then you can say it was not a penalty.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“Against Chelsea, two players were offside for the first goal. Then we made a few mistakes at the back and paid for that. With talent like 24-year-olds Robin Van Persie, Emmanuel Adebayor and Emmanuel Eboue plus Fabregas in the ranks, Arsenal have the potential to win trophies for years.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">But the possibility of going three seasons without any silverware is something Fab does not want to think about. And he has his eyes on Premier League and Champions League glory come May.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Fabregas, 20, said: “We don’t want to be talking every year about the future. “We want to win this season and we have shown we have the team to do it.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">But if matters do not go according to plan, Arsenal will have to look to at least finish second in the league to avoid having to play a Champions League qualifier in the summer.</p>

              <p>pires and hleb is 2 very different wingers sia.</p>
              <p>ljungberg normally plays on the right for arsenal, fabregas is midfield central.</p>
              <p>and van persie is totally different from bergkamp who could play make and have great skill on the ball but lacks the sharp shooting that van persie has.</p>

              <p>The way i see it is the Arsenal team is ok... There is nothing seriously wrong with them or the players... The only difference is they are a bunch of inexperience youngsters... Only Gallas and Toure are consider senior players... But even they have not much experience in the title chase run-in... Gallas time at chelsea he didn't had this experience... even Toure don't have much either but still more than the rest...</p>
              <p>Experience at this point is very crucial... and the manager also plays a very big part to instill confidence on the players... Apparently the players felt the pressure and became nervous from the chase...</p>
              <p>I remembered the last time United ended Arsenal's long unbeaten run, they crack up and went on to drop many points as well... This time, its almost the same again... Since they lose to United 4 - 0 back in mid feb, they have only manage to get 4 points from 5 matches... dropping 11 in the space of about 4 weeks... its like a sign of a lack of confidence problem.</p>

              <p>funny comment..</p>
              <p>why would anyone hate a team who tried their best to win the title plus any cup competiiton??</p>
              <p>Personally, I hate team which worm thru the EPL season with the aim of just being in the top4, and then do their best at major cup competition cause their players are not even exerted.</p>

              <p><br>well, it was cause in the past, players were simply too arrogant like Cantona, Keano and GaryN, where they played their hardest, and to some gangster-like.</p>
              <p>but after watching how many players now go after the referee, spit at players, I think MUFC antic is nothing compared to these...</p>
              <p>maybe, some of them just love underdogs. Personally, I would hate it if the top4 keep dominating, I would love a Portsmoth or Spurs or even Everton  winning the league or getting into CL.</p>
              <p>and the wealth flowing in EPL to be shared among all leagues.. cause it is a pain to see clubs like Forest, Leeds struggling.</p>
