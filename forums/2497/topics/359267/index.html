              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger is ready to placate those fans who are demanding an
              injection of experience at Arsenal this summer but while he is
              targeting two older players, a new striker is not on the agenda.</strong></p>
              <p>The Gunners have once again finished the season without silverware
              and critics have pointed to a surfeit of young players as a reason for
              Wenger’s failure to land a trophy or challenge for the title.</p>
              <p>The Frenchman’s policy of purchasing and developing young players is
              well established but with a deep reserve of promising players now at
              his disposal, Wenger is ready to go down the Andrei Arshavin route
              again in the summer.</p>
              <p>But while speculation continues to surround the future of Emmanuel
              Adebayor, the Gunners boss is not developing a contingency plan by
              targeting a new attacker.</p>
              <p>“I’m not chasing any player at the moment,” said Wenger. “I believe my priority is to stay with the squad we have.</p>
              <p>“We will try of course to bring in one or two players to strengthen the squad but we have plenty of strikers.</p>
              <p>“And if we buy, it certainly won't be players who lack experience. We have enough of those.”</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Wenger has claimed that photos depicting Nicklas Bendtner
              emerging from a nightclub with his trousers down were a ‘setup’.</p>
              <p>The Denmark international has been fined by the club after he
              indulged in a late night out following the club’s Champions League exit
              at the hands of Manchester United on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>“I was angry,” Wenger added. “But he has been set up.</p>
              <p>“People make the story that he was drunk. He was not drunk. He did
              not put his trousers down, somebody did it for him and somebody was
              posted there with a camera.</p>
              <p>“I fined him not for that. I fined him because he should not have gone out.</p>
              <p>“But he's 20 years old and, in fairness, what I like with Bendtner
              is that he is honest enough and fair enough and intelligent enough to
              realise he made a mistake.”</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>The Frenchman is renowned for drafting in young talent rather than splashing the cash on proven star names but, with the club again set to finish the season trophyless, there have been calls from fans for a change this year.</p>
              <p>Wenger, though, has no plans to follow the likes of Chelsea's lead and will instead make only minimal alterations to his playing squad.</p>
              <p>Reflecting on his side's league showing, as well as their Champions League semi-final defeat to Manchester United, he said: "We are all very down and frustrated but it is not down to spending money. It is down to sticking with our policy.</p>
              <p>"Chelsea have spent magic money and still not won the European Cup. I believe our team has developed well but at the moment we are still a bit short.</p>
              <p>"Of course I'll try to bring in one or two in the summer and whoever we get will not be short of experience.</p>
              <p>"But the priority is to stay with the squad we have.</p>
              <p>"What am I supposed to do, kick out a quality young player like Walcott, Fabregas, Diaby or Bendtner who is already in his national team?"</p>
              <p>Wenger also dismissed Emmanuel Adebayor's comments that the team had gone backwards this term.</p>
              <p>"I don't take much notice of the comments of the players. They're not coaches. They are responsible for their own performance and not an assessment of the team.</p>
              <p>"Players at any club say they want to sign big names but never say they need someone in their position," he added.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>________________________________________________</p>

              <p>Wenger love player who can play multi role, what Arsenal needed now is a good keeper and 2 super central defender which is the most expensive department second to striker role.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look at the first 2 goal in UCL semi, was a backline mistake or incapable of players playing in this level? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And the third goal is a classic counter which Wenger likes to deploy. Wat you can do others do better than you. This is the worse ever UCL semi with only 10 min gone and the players are giving up!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Last 4 year is a disaster with totally no improvement in the backline. If Wenger continue like this, the strengh in depth in the current squad is too weak to win UCL which they have long wanted for. And players will leave for a better € and better team.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We noe Arsenal is trying to keep a clean balance sheet, but how to be the next Porto if the club has been already exist in UCL for so many years. Everyone noe the style of play Wenger in putting up, the player strength is predictable. Wenger dun have the € and luck that SAF has. </p>

              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger admits he is in the dark as to how much money he will be given to spend by the Arsenal board in the summer. </strong></p>
              <p>Wenger has been left licking his wounds after a week which saw
              The Gunners tumble out of the Champions League and thrashed at home by
              Chelsea in The Premier League.</p>
              <p>The home defeats to Manchester United and Chelsea demonstrated
              that Arsenal need to improve if they are to mount a serious challenge
              for honours.</p>
              <p>Wenger admits The Gunners need to spend to move forward, but will only open the chequebook if he feels he can add to his squad.</p>
              <p>”At the moment I don’t know what funds will be available,” said
              Wenger. “I will be told by the club. I believe we need to improve.</p>
              <p>”Things are not as doom and gloom as everybody wants to make it after a defeat.</p>
              <p>”We play in a strong league with opponents who are top quality.
              We have to continue to improve, but in the areas where it is right.</p>
              <p>”It’s not about quantity of money, necessarily. You wouldn’t want to come out and say we’ll buy four defenders.</p>
              <p>”I feel we have quality defenders. It’s more a question of balance.”</p>

              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger has promised
              there will be no revolution at Emirates Stadium as he continues to fend
              off a barrage of criticism from fans and former players. </strong></p>

              <p><strong>The Gunners boss is being urged from all quarters to embark on a
              summer spending spree after Arsenal’s limp exit from the Champions
              League left them facing a fourth consecutive trophyless season. </strong></p>
              <p>Ex-players have been quick to jump on the Wenger-bashing bandwagon,
              with former midfielder Emmanuel Petit claiming the Frenchman had failed
              to find the right balance between experience and youth.</p>
              <p>But Wenger insists he will not look to change his ways and will
              continue to develop his young squad rather than plunge into the
              transfer market.</p>
              <p>"We have a team which is 22 years old (on average), why should we look for revolution?" said Wenger.</p>
              <p>"That would be stupid and not responsible.</p>
              <p>"I still believe that when you have responsibilities, you have to
              make decisions and stand up for that. Until now we have not done too
              badly.</p>
              <p>"I do not think that the team need major investments."</p>

              <p>Wenger has the $$$, Arsenal has the $$$... But he and the directors both agree on one thing and that is spend less, running a football club is to make lots of money not winning trophies...</p>
              <p>Some years back when Arsenal still wasn't a very rich club, they were able to spend much more... During David Dein's time, Arsenal was almost on par with United...</p>
              <p>But somewhere in the mddle, the board decided that making money was priority number 1. Winning was push to the back...   How and why Dein was removed we have to wonder... Cos he was moving Arsenal in the right direction over the years.</p>
              <p>The thing I feel is, Wenger has been there for a long time and he is under no pressure to win anything cos the current board are very supportive of his current style. .. They don't really care as long as every year, they show a handsome profit on their balance sheet...</p>
              <p>My take is... with Pool, United and Chelsea all pushing every year and City up and coming... Arsenal won't even stand a chance to win the Premiership title until the current directors sell out. Either to the Russian or the American as what Dein predicted... And if they don't be careful...  They can even drop out of the top 4 very soon...</p>

              Emirates are understood to be a factor in the club's transfer budget
              and it is a factor Usmanov seems willing to help ease, if approached.</p>
              <p>A spokesman for Usmanov's investment company, Red and White
              Holdings, told the Daily Telegraph: "The key issue is to ensure that
              the club remain both self-financing and competitive at the very highest
              levels of European and world football.</p>
              <p>"The debt at the club appears to be an impediment to that and
              we are ready to help address that if the board asks. Raising ticket
              prices is not the answer."</p>
              <p>Prices were raised by 4.5% last year but the Gunners have already committed to a price-freeze for next term.</p>
