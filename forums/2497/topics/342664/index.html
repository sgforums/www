              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">MANCHESTER CITY want to make Wayne Bridge the highest-paid full-back in the world — by handing him a £21million contract.</h2>
              <p class="article">City last night agreed a £12m fee with Chelsea for the left-back, who will be given a four-year deal worth £5.2m a season.</p>
              <p class="article">That is a rise of £30,000 a week on his deal with the Blues as well as a guarantee of first-team football at Eastlands.</p>
              <p class="article">Bridge, 28, has made just 70 appearances for Chelsea in the last 2½ years since the arrival of Ashley Cole from Arsenal.</p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea have accepted City’s impressive bid and given boss Mark Hughes permission to speak to the England star.</p>
              <p class="article">However, Stamford Bridge chief Luiz Felipe Scolari has made it clear that he is not eager to see the defender leave.</p>
              <p class="article">Bridge is highly rated by England boss Fabio Capello — who sees him as a genuine challenger to Cole for a place in the national side. But with no money to spend in the January window unless he sells, Scolari is likely to accept Bridge’s departure and look to buy a striker.</p>
              <p class="article">Bridge is expected to travel to Manchester today to finalise terms and arrange a medical.</p>

              <p>ya should sell bridge for 15mil. anyway i would be sad to see him go, he's one of the best crossers from a fullback position and his attacking runs are more dangerous then ashley cole in my opinion, now i wonder who will cover ashley cole when he's injured, and yeah i rather they sold malouda.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">PHIL SCOLARI admits he is in the dark about Manchester City's swoop for Wayne Bridge. The Blues have accepted a £12million bid for Bridge and the left-back is expected to agree a four-year deal at Eastlands. But Scolari insists chief executive Peter Kenyon is the man to talk to when it comes to details about any potential departures.</h2>
              <p class="article">Big Phil revealed: "It's better you ask Peter, because he knows everything that has happened. "I don't know what happened yesterday, today.</p>
              <p class="article">"If any club wants to buy one of my players, OK, but offer big money because they are good players.</p>
              <p class="article">"If we get a good offer for anyone it will be discussed internally. "But if we sell one player, we sell for very good money.</p>

              <h1>Wayne Bridge to join Manchester City 'very soon'</h1>
              <h2>Mark Hughes, the Manchester City manager, says that he expects Wayne Bridge to complete his £11 million move from Chelsea to Eastlands within 48 hours.</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01215/bridge_1215296g.jpg" border="0" alt="Wayne Bridge to join Manchester City 'very soon'" width="140" height="87"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The England full-back travelled to Manchester on Friday night to undergo a medical and discuss the personal terms of a three-year contract believed to be worth around £80,000 a week.</strong></p>
              <p>Bridge, 28, who emerged in the professional game at Southampton when Hughes was coming to the end of his playing career, has been reluctant to leave Stamford Bridge despite failing to hold down a regular place in the team. Since joining Chelsea in 2003 for £7 million, the defender has been restricted to just 74 League appearances.</p>
              <p>It has not helped his cause having to compete against international colleague Ashley Cole for the same position at club level, a problem he will not have to face at Eastlands. The capture of Bridge will be seen as the first significant move by Hughes towards him strengthening his squad, although he has denied reports that he has also tabled bids for Shay Given, the Newcastle United goalkeeper, and Blackburn Rovers forward Roque Santa Cruz.</p>
              <p>Other players believed to be on his shopping list include Craig Bellamy, of West Ham, and Everton's Joleon Lescott.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, Hughes admits securing Bridge will be a major boost and he is convinced that the player can quickly rediscover his best form on a more consistent basis, not to mention regain his place in the England squad under Fabio Capello.</p>
              <p>Hughes said: "We need to speak to Wayne and come to a deal over his personal terms, but hopefully he will be a Manchester City player very soon.</p>
              <p>"He's still a successful player. He's an England international at one of the top four clubs in the country. I played alongside him at Southampton and know first hand what an outstanding player he is.</p>
              <p>"He's had a relative success, but you come to a point in your career where you want to be playing week in and week out. "You need to demand that from yourself and at the highest level. If that's not the case then maybe your focus can tend to drift a bit. It's a credit to him that he's not allowed this to happen at Chelsea.</p>
              <p>"He wants to get back into the England squad and Fabio Capello has said that he needs people playing week in and week out for them to be under consideration."</p>
              <p>Hughes' side face Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup on Saturday and he has made it clear to his under-achieving players that he will accept nothing less than a victory.</p>
              <p>Hughes, who will be without Stephen Ireland, who has a hamstring injury, added: "It's the most prestigious domestic competition in the world and should be given the respect it deserves. We don't want to be making the headlines for all the wrong reasons."</p>

              <p><strong>Bridge deal done and dusted</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Manchester City have completed the signing of Chelsea defender Wayne
              Bridge for a fee reported to be in the region of £12 million.</strong></p>
              <p>Bridge, 28, will wear the number 25 shirt at City and will resolve the
              club's search for a left back that has seen them use Michael Ball,
              Javier Garrido, Tal Ben Haim and even Micah Richards in that position
              this season.</p>
