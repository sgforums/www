              <p>This is due to the fact that there are too many man utd fans around.</p>
              <p>You cant expect an arsenal, liverpool fans to be reporting on manutd's news everyday. So its very fair to say the editor will let a man utd fan reporter cover news on manutd.</p>
              <p>For other clubs, they dont have as much fans so you tend to get more neutral views.</p>

              <p><br>There's no two ways about it... Tohari have openly declared himself to be a Arsenal fan... Whatever he writes its his job... to write things that could make people like you who reads the TNP agitated but yet continue to follow wondering whats he going to write next... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"> But deep down he supports Arsenal. Or perhaps he is unhappy with Arsenal's performance therefore upset with it... You can go and see quite a number of Arsenal fans here are also quite critical of them when they are not performing well... buddy.</p>
