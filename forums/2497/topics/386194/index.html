              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> Liverpool striker Fernando Torres may seek to ply his trade in greener pastures if the club fail to finish in the top four in the Premier League, according to the <em>News of the World</em>.<br><br>The
              Spain international joined the Reds in 2007, leaving his home-town club
              Atletico de Madrid to chase his dreams of winning silverware. And the
              only significant honor at club level that 'El Nino' has to show for his
              efforts is a second division league winners medal with the
              Spanish-capital club.<br><br>The Merseyside club have crashed out of
              the Champions League and have slipped considerably in the domestic
              circuit as well, losing seven games in the first half of their campaign.<br><br>Despite
              pledging allegiance to the club on several occasions over the past few
              weeks, and months, it is claimed that the former Atleti striker may
              look to move on with his career if Champions League football is not
              secured at the end of the season.<br><br>Manchester City have reportedly had a £70 million bid turned down, while Chelsea are believed to be monitoring the situation closely as well.</span></p>

              <p>how i wish torres would come to arsenal... with him as our main strikers then arsenal would be the best in the world.... but we already have van persie, and arsene would never buy torres for he is too too too too too expensive...</p>
              <p>Anyway, i think whether liverpool finishes 4th this season would very much depends on the next match in which they faces aston villa. If pool wins, then they are right back in it as they will have 33 points, and villa with 35. Even if spurs and city win their next match, they would have 37 and 35 points... therefore liverpool does indeed still have a chance.. but if they loses that match then villa would have 38 and pool with 30 points... an 8 points gap.</p>
              <p>Anyway, from yesterday game against arsenal, i feel that villa is actually quite strong with ashley young, agbonlahor and heskey up front. And with Downing and Milner in midfield, they have no lack of attacking powers... only that they do not have a tailsmanic player that can change the game on his own (Someone like Fabregas, Gerrard, Rooney etc)...</p>
              <p>It would be interesting to see who will finish fourth... man city and spurs are strong too...</p>

              <p>One thing Pool have and these other sides don't is the experience of the run-in... It may not be like a title run-in but its still a run to be the 4th place club... And Pool have it amongst them.</p>
              <p>From the start, every match was just playing a game, you play your best to win but come Feb onwards, every match is a pressure game that they must win and a draw may not be good enough... And to some or most players who are not used to it, they can let it effect their game cos when opponents know you need all the points, they will sit back and make it very difficult for you and hit you on the counter. And even when you have taken the lead, you become more nervous trying to protect it... These are valuable experienced that Pool have from last season.</p>
              <p>I think Spurs and Villa could be effected by this and start to drop off a little. The only serious one I find is City. Cos they are rich in abundance and will make another splash in Jan... And with a new manager in there who will be fresh, he won't have the 'build up' effect compare to someone who was in charge from the start... I feel the 'built-up' pressure is different when you start from the beginning... Like Lotti is feel it now and Scolari last season. Mancini could find it like Hiddink did. Come in and do a better job without too much pressure on his shoulders as he is only seen as a stand in.</p>
              <p>Next season will be another matter though... And even if Pool don't win tonight, i think its still not over for them cos with the premier league this season, top sides losing 3 to 5 matches in the second half is still not impossible... What about the Villas and Spurs kind?</p>

              <p>Consider that the only good player in your team is stevie, the rest cannot make it.</p>
              <p>How would you feel ?</p>
              <p>I think Torres is sick of the lone striker role where he kana whecked all the time.</p>
              <p>Even if Liverpool clinch the 4th position, there is no guarantee that they will STAY in the champion league during the knockout stage.</p>
              <p>So, if I am torres, I need to play with world class player so that I can be featured in the world cup squad.</p>
              <p>Better jump ship and get a good pay before the ship sink.</p>
