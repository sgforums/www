              <h2 class="sub-heading padding-top-5 padding-bottom-15">Leading English sides could be excluded from the Champions League if a Uefa proposal to limit overspending is successful.</h2>
              <p class="sub-heading padding-top-5 padding-bottom-15"> </p>
              <p>LIVERPOOL and Manchester United would be banned from the Champions League if Michel Platini’s “Financial Fair Play” criteria for European club competitions were introduced, according to senior sources within Uefa. Manchester City and Chelsea would also be at risk, despite their owners having paid off their debts recently.</p>
              <p>Rules governing the amount of debt clubs can accrue are being discussed within Uefa committees and though they are far from fixed, and at least three years away from being implemented, it is clear that many of Europe’s biggest clubs would fall foul of the criteria being proposed by Platini, the Uefa president. His guiding principle is that over a period of time clubs cannot spend more than they earn.</p>
              <p>“Manchester United and Liverpool would be barred from the Champions League and the Europa Cup because they have debts piled directly on the club as a result of their owners’ takeovers,” a Uefa executive told <em>The Sunday Times</em>.</p>
              <p>“Chelsea and Manchester City would fail to meet the requirements because we want to prevent a situation where you can overspend a great deal, then inject cash to balance the budget at the end of the season. Arsenal would qualify. They make more than they spend, including debt repayments. So do Tottenham.”</p>
              <p>However, it is not just English clubs that would be affected. Some of Europe’s most celebrated clubs have built up huge debts and they too face exclusion from the Champions League. “As things stand, Real Madrid would fail and Inter Milan. But for now it’s all theory, based around a principle that needs to be made into something workable,” the source said.</p>
              <p>Debt in English football has been highlighted again because United’s new financial figures, released last week, showed they made an annual profit of £48.2m only thanks to the £80m summer sale of Cristiano Ronaldo, inset. United paid £41.9m in interest in the year on debts that are now above £700m. Chelsea’s most recent figures showed a £44.4m loss, while City’s showed they lost £92m. Both those clubs’ owners have wiped out debts in excess of £300m to clean up their balance sheets. Liverpool’s debts are £240m-plus. Arsenal have £297m of debt, but this was acquired mainly for building Emirates stadium, now a cash cow that helps fuel profits. Arsenal’s repayments are easily serviced.</p>
              <p>England’s Big Four plus City can take solace in that Uefa’s plans are far from complete. Even Uefa officials are uncertain whether rules will be applied retrospectively. “That might not be possible,” the source said. All clubs will have to meet requirements to balance income and spending, but grey areas and loopholes will remain.</p>
              <p>Uefa’s only public statement on the subject so far is nebulous, saying there is an “obligation for clubs whose turnover is over a certain threshold, over a period of time, to balance their books or break even”.</p>
              <p>The rules will be framed by an independent 11-man Club Financial Control Panel, chaired by the former prime minister of Belgium, Jean-Luc Dehaene. The aim is to introduce the rules in the 2013-14 season. Most of the CFCP, and Platini, accept that debt is not to be outlawed per se, but want it to be manageable if it is on a club’s books.</p>
              <p>Uefa insiders are aware that if it banned most of the biggest clubs from its competition there would be a danger of a breakaway league. They also accept that its rules are susceptible to legal challenges. For now, there are three more years of work before proposals turn to rules.</p>
