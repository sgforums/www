              <p><strong>The doting mum of Man Utd superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has rubbished claims he is a ladies’ man.</strong></p>
              <p>Proud Dolores Aveiro, 54, said: “My son has only introduced two girlfriends to me – Merche Romero and Nereida Gallardo.</p>
              <p>“If I believed what other people say, he has been with more than 100 and he is a womaniser. “But I know that it is not true. When he likes a girl and the relationship is serious, he presents her to his family.”</p>

              <p><em>Brazilian actress Karina Bacchi, 32</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Yesterday Ronaldo, 24, was said to be back in the arms of Brazilian actress Karina Bacchi, 32, who he was with in summer 2007.</strong></p>
              <p>He dated Spanish model Nereida after meeting her in Majorca as he celebrated his 23rd birthday in a club.</p>
              <p>He earlier went out with Portuguese TV girl Merche. Meanwhile the Portugal footballer was last week linked to a Brazilian gym instructor called Gabi.</p>
              <p>Apparently, the Brazilian beauty, named only as Gabriela, 27, waved a poster of him at an international. According to reports, Ronaldo, 24, invited her to watch him play after meeting at a nightclub in Portugal.</p>
              <p>Friends say the stunner then jetted to England to spend 7 days with the Manchester United star at his 4million-pound home, reports The Sun.</p>
              <p>A friend of Gabriela known as Gabi said: Theyve ended up dating. Hes fascinated by her athletic body. She says hes attentive and romantic.</p>
              <p>Another pal said: Theyre a match made in heaven. Like Cristiano she never touches alcohol, and shes as fit as she is beautiful.</p>
              <p>Gabi works at a gym in Sintra, near Lisbon. (ANI)</p>

              <p><em>Ronaldo drives her home in his £150,000 Bentley Continental after nights out.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Last month, the Manchester United ace, 24, was reported to be dating blonde beauty Olivia Saunders, 18. </strong></p>
              <p>The unlikely couple met at a Manchester nightclub, where Olivia was working as a promotions girl. Since meeting, Ronaldo has been wining and dining the poor student all over Manchester.</p>
              <p>While she lives in a humble £100-a-week campus apartment near her university with three room-mates and shares a kitchen and living room with a group of fellow first years, he majesty relaxes in a 4-million pound villa and drives her home in his £150,000 Bentley Continental after nights out.</p>
              <p>For one date, Ronaldo brought her to the swish Cloud 23 bar at the Manchester Hilton Hotel, which would have made a nice change from the cheap drinks at the student union.</p>
              <p>Surely Olivia will have her plate full keeping the attractive footballer, because even Croatian women chose Ronaldo as the hottest football player before the start of EURO 2008.</p>

              <h1><span style="color: #0b3c89;">Why is Ronaldo not married? Too young to marry?</span></h1>
              <p><img src="http://i184.photobucket.com/albums/x79/pixvirtual/us010/czpla7Bd8FTM.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>At 24 years of age, Cristiano Ronaldo still lives as a single man. Unlike Robin Van Persie or Sergio Aguerro , Ronaldo has no fiancée, no wife, no kids… at least, officially. </strong></p>
              <p>The FIFA &amp; European player of the year is believed to have dated over 100 girls if rumours are true – which explains one of his quotes: “We should make the most of life, enjoy it because that’s the way it is”</p>
              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo looked very close though to marry Spanish model Mercedes Romero whom he both dated, without forgetting Jordana Jardel from Brazil. But after going out with all these ladies for months, Cristiano Ronaldo did not propose anything so serious as marriage.</p>
              <p>Perhaps Ronaldo feels he is too young to settle with one woman now, perhaps is it a way to concentrate more on his professional career.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><em>Nereida and Ronaldo in happier times</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>In any case, the dumped-and-broken Nereida Gallardo has other ideas why Ronaldo is not, cannot, and does not want to marry: it’s all because of his mother, Dolores Aveiro.</strong></p>
              <p>“He phones her every day. I wouldn’t be surprised if his next girlfriend is chosen by his mum,” Nereida once revealed as she blamed Dolores Aveiro for her split with Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>Rumours that the Star winger was going to marry the model from Mallorca were so strong that the press were just waiting to see the wedding ceremony take place to capture some exclusive pictures. The couple were seen together so often and cameras even spotted Nereida with a diamond ring on her engagement finger.</p>
              <p>The Manchester United number 7 would have certainly eclipsed the Beckhams if he had effectively married the model. But after eight months of serious dating, Ronaldo’s relationship with Gallardo collapsed into pieces.</p>
              <p>“He’s a coward who couldn’t end it face-to-face,” Nereida insisted – pointing out the way Ronaldo dumped her by text messages. Letizia Filippi aka The Gaze was next on Ronaldo’s list, with Niki Ghazian in between his dreams.</p>
              <p>Still, the so-called coward playboy could not choose a wife to marry among these girls… So, is it really Ronaldo’s choice to remain unmarried at present?</p>
              <p>Well, there should be a reason why this successful, powerful, handsome and happy man is still single.</p>
