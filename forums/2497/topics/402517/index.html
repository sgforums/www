              <h1><span>Inter Milan boss Rafa Benitez: Give 
              Liverpool job to Kenny Dalglish</span></h1>

              <p>Rafa Benitez threw his weight behind Kenny Dalglish's bid to become Liverpool manager and hailed him as the perfect fit 
              to revive their fortunes.</p>
              <p>Inter Milan's new coach made his first 
              appearance before the Italian media, but still found time to address his
               departure from Anfield and the subject of who should replace him.</p>
              <p>Despite
               Roy Hodgson remaining Liverpool's preferred choice, Benitez insisted 
              Dalglish was best qualified to appease disgruntled fans and ease some of
               the pressure on owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett.</p>

              perfect man to take charge of Liverpool" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>King Kenny: Former Kop boss Rafa Benitez insists
               Dalglish is the perfect man to take charge of Liverpool</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Reflecting on the way Dalglish has been revered by Liverpool 
              followers ever since his arrival from Celtic in 1977, the former 
              Liverpool manager said: 'I think they should look at Kenny Dalglish. He 
              is the best man for the job. The owners should listen to the fans 
              because they are unhappy.</p>
              <p>'No one knows the club better than 
              Dalglish, and he would be perfect there. He wants the job and in my 
              opinion he should get it.'</p>
              <p>Benitez was axed earlier this 
              month amid claims that several senior players had lost faith in him 
              during a calamitous season in which Liverpool would have missed out on 
              Europe altogether, but for Portsmouth's financial predicament.</p>

              </div>
              <p>He strongly denied losing the dressing room, though, and revealed 
              that he made a point of sending birthday wishes to Steven Gerrard when 
              the Liverpool skipper was 30 at the end of last month.</p>
              <p>'Before
               I left, I spoke with 95 per cent of the Liverpool players, and I 
              contacted Steven Gerrard on his birthday,' he added.</p>
              <p>'The 
              majority said, "Thank you for everything". I spoke with Gerrard, and he 
              was fine. In fact, he wished me well. I left on a positive note and the 
              relationship with the players was good.</p>
              <p>'It was hard for me 
              to leave Liverpool. It was really difficult and I was sad to go. It was 
              not easy, because the fans on the Kop were always fantastic to me. All 
              the fans were like that. It was a sad day when I left, but I had to do 
              it.</p>
              <p>'My youngest daughter grew up in Liverpool. I was there 
              for six years and she is only seven, so we will be looking at English 
              schools. Both the girls were very attached to Liverpool - neither of 
              them supports Everton.'</p>
              <p>Benitez, who signed a two-year 
              contract worth more than £4million a year, was frequently at odds with 
              his predecessor Jose Mourinho, when they were rivals in the Barclays 
              Premier League.</p>
              <p>He hinted he may seek his advice, though, 
              once he has assessed his squad and the former Chelsea boss has settled 
              in at Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>'I haven't spoken with Mourinho, because I
               have been very busy and so has he,' he said.</p>
              <p>'Maybe I will 
              talk with him in a few weeks when we are not so busy.</p>
              <p>'I am 
              not an anti-Mourinho, and I believe he did a good job here. We are 
              different, but I like to win and I like to play good football, so I 
              don't think we are all that different. I am not going to change 
              anything, because that would not be very clever.'</p>

              </div>
              <p>Benitez confirmed he will look to strengthen Inter's squad, despite 
              last season's eye-catching success at home and in Europe, and has been 
              linked with moves for Liverpool midfielders Javier Mascherano and Dirk 
              Kuyt.</p>
              <p>'I cannot talk about players at other clubs,' he said. 
              'I will discuss possible transfer targets with the people here, but I 
              think we will be looking to bring in top-level players.</p>
              <p>'A few years ago, there was interest in me from Inter, but we didn't 
              have any direct contact. Now this opportunity has come at the right 
              time, and I mean to make the most of it.</p>
              <p>'In Italy, you live 
              and breathe football. In Sardinia, where I was on holiday, I saw 
              reporters and paparazzi at my hotel in all positions, 4-5-1, 4-3-3.'</p>
              <p>Liverpool,
               meanwhile, denied claims that Chelsea had offered £50m for striker Fernando Torres
               and reiterated their stance that any such approach would be rejected.</p>
