              <p><strong>John Terry has all but been stripped of the England captaincy after Fabio Capello announced his intention to delay naming his skipper until the World Cup qualifiers start in September.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Capello is likely to ask Steven Gerrard to lead out the team against Switzerland on Wednesday in the absence of the injured Terry, but the England manager is expected to give two or three players the opportunity to skipper the side between now and the autumn. Capello respects the importance the armband is given in this country and for that reason he will select his captains carefully. But he wants to use the five friendlies he has before September to identify the right man, leaving Terry to wonder if he will ever get the chance to lead the national team again.</p>
              <p>Capello said: 'I plan to name a captain for the Switzerland game on Tuesday, but I don't expect to appoint a permanent captain until we start the qualifying games. I want to work closely with the players before deciding on this.</p>
              <p>"We will be monitoring the form of everyone very closely as we work towards the competitive matches which start in September. I'm looking forward to working with the players on the training ground. There is a lot of work to do, but I am ready for the challenge."</p>
              <p>Capello met his players for the first time — with the exception of former Real Madrid defender Jonathan Woodgate — at the team hotel in Watford last night and addressed them in English, informing them that he would be taking them for two training sessions today, the second of which will be at Wembley this evening.</p>

              <p><em>ME AND MY BOSS.. Michael Owen with new England manager Fabio Capello</em></p>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong> FABIO CAPELLO has laid down the law — and left England’s stars quaking.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">The ruthless Italian issued strict new rules as he prepares for tomorrow’s 
              Wembley showdown with Switzerland.</p>
              <p class="article">As players assembled at the team hotel in Watford, they were confronted by a 
              noticeboard telling them:</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <div class="clear-left">
              <li>- Lateness will not be tolerated, room service is banned and mobiles 
              can only be used in bedrooms.
              <p class="article"> </p>
              </li>
              <li>- Players must eat together in smart dress and must wear team blazers 
              when in public and at matches.
              <p class="article"> </p>
              </li>
              <li>- Players will be called by their surnames.
              <p class="article"> </p>
              </li>
              <li>- No WAGS, relatives or agents are allowed to visit.
              <p class="article">One insider said: “Capello has turned the hotel into a military camp.”</p>
              <p class="article">The England players are still feeling the shock of Capello’s decision to axe 
              David Beckham for tomorrow’s friendly, denying him a 100th cap.</p>
              <p class="article">And even established internationals Rio Ferdinand and Steven Gerrard have been 
              left with no doubts as to who is the boss.</p>
              <p class="article">Ferdinand said: “He calls me and a lot of the other players by our surnames. 
              His coaching staff call us by surname as well. That’s the way it is.</p>
              <p class="article">“The Becks decision proved there is no sentiment about the boss.</p>
              <p class="article">“Nine out of 10 others would probably have picked him but this manager has 
              made his decision and it’s not our place to question that or react to it.</p>
              <p class="article">“We’re not here to worry about anyone else’s feelings. We’re here to be part 
              of a successful team.</p>
              <p class="article">“It’s his job to pick the squad and if we’re going to be successful we will 
              live or die by his decisions.”</p>
              <p class="article">Gerrard, expected to captain Capello’s first team tomorrow, said: “Fabio is 
              keeping us all on our toes.</p>
              <p class="article">“As long as there is a big respect between the manager and his players, I 
              don’t think it’s important he’s not close to us.</p>
              <p class="article">“It’s not about enjoying yourself with the manager, it’s about seriousness and 
              getting results in an England shirt.”</p>
