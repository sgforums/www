The Swedish philanderer, 59, has been secretly seeing sultry Marisa Cauchi, 35, for weeks. She has told pals their relationship is Â“seriousÂ” Â– but they are not so sure about the Manchester City managerÂ’s intentions. </strong><br><br><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00370/snn1105gx1280_370326a.jpg"><br><span class="small">Marisa Cauchi</span><br><br>One friend said: Â“Marisa is a lovely girl. Everyone who knows her is hoping sheÂ’s not just another of SvenÂ’s conquests and that she wonÂ’t get hurt. Â“The relationship seems to have picked up pace and she thinks it could be serious. But thereÂ’s no telling whether Sven feels the same as he has a certain reputation with the ladies.Â”<br><br>Former England coach Sven has been sharing intimate dinners with mum-of-two Marisa at ManchesterÂ’s swish Lowry Hotel. She is co-director of Salford Skip Hire with her estranged husband Anthony, 42 Â– and also runs Manchester Recycling Centre.<br><br>The couple, who wed in August 2002, split last year but still share the same luxury home in Bury. SvenÂ’s latest dalliance will heap yet more humiliation on his long-term girlfriend Nancy DellÂ’Olio.<br><br>Last month it was revealed he lured beauty Saima Ansari, 38, to his Â£1,500anight Manchester hotel suite. He has romanced TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson, FA secretary Faria Alam and Romanian singer Rux-andra Galeriu behind the back of fiery Italian lawyer Nancy. And last week Italian journalist Monica Casti, 41, claimed she had been seeing him for eight years.<br><br>A friend of olive-skinned Marisa, whose children are Alisha, 17, and Joshua, 12, told last night how she and Sven talk at length on the phone several times a day. And she has been Â“bowled over by his famous charmÂ”. The pal added: Â“She has been given the impression theyÂ’ll soon be a couple.<br><br>She told a few friends about him but swore them to secrecy. When Marisa started seeing Sven a few weeks back she was coy and only said she was seeing Â‘a celebrityÂ’. Â“She then let slip her man had something to do with football and it didnÂ’t take her long to admit it was Sven.Â”<br><br>Nancy, who is still based in London, has not visited Sven in Manchester since he landed his Â£2.5million-a-year City job in July. But Sven Â– given a Â£3.7million payoff by the FA after EnglandÂ’s World Cup flop last year Â– has seen her in the capital. And Nancy insisted recently: Â“We are still a couple.Â”<br><br>Last night she seemed unfazed by SvenÂ’s latest away fixture. She said: Â“I am too busy on other matters and I donÂ’t really care or have anything to say. Why donÂ’t you focus on me and what I am doing, which is much more important?Â”<br><br>A Man City spokesman last night said Marisa is Â“knownÂ” to Sven, but added: Â“I donÂ’t think she should be planning any weddings.Â” Another source at the club said: Â“ItÂ’s a case of join the queue for this girl because thereÂ’s nothing but casual dating in the bossÂ’s world.Â”<br></div>
