              <p><strong>The summer of shame engulfing French football reached a new low today as two players were formally accused of soliciting an underage prostitute.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Franck Ribéry</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span> 27, a midfielder for Bayern Munich and a member of the international side which left the World Cup in ignominy, and Real Madrid's Karim Benzema, 22, face up to three years in jail and a fine of €45,000 (£37,600) if convicted.</p>
              <p>Both deny wrongdoing. Benzema has said he is "unaffected'' by the allegation by a former sex worker, Zahia Dehar, that she was solicited separately by the two when she was 16.</p>
              <p>Ribéry is married and has two children. He has admitted having sex with Dehar, but insists he was unaware of her age.</p>
              <p>In <span style="color: #000000;">France</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span> although the age for consenting sex is 15, soliciting a prostitute under 18 is a crime. The investigation into the trade allegedly going on in the Zaman Cafe, a late night bar on the Champs Elysées in Paris, was revealed in April when it was raided and more than a dozen women were arrested, including Dehar.</p>
              <p>Shetold police she had been paid to have sex with several soccer stars, including Sidney Govou, another player for Les Bleus, as well as Ribéry and Benzema; however, Govou's alleged encounter was in March, by which time she was 18.</p>
              <p>According to the testimony of Dehar and Ribéry, Dehar never told her clients she was underage – an important factor in such cases.</p>
              <p>Investigators from Paris's equivalent of the vice squad have been trying to establish whether or not, when he asked her to fly to Bavaria for his birthday celebrations in April, Ribéry bought Dehar's plane ticket. If he did, they argue, he would have known her date of birth.</p>
              <p>Sophie Bottai, Ribéry's lawyer, told French radio that for her client to be found guilty "he would have had to know her age, which was not the case. She would have had to look like a minor, which was not the case. She would have to be claiming that she had told him she was a minor, which is not the case."</p>
              <p>The saga was put on hold during the World Cup, but has now thrown a spotlight on France's younger generation of soccer stars, who are struggling to inspire the respect which fans had for their predecessors. Even before they jetted to South Africa, many of the players had shaken France's usually firm pride in Les Bleus with a combination of dispiriting performances on the pitch and unseemly and extravagant lifestyles off it.</p>
              <p>When their 2010 bid for World Cup glory ended in defeat, mutiny and foul language, the sense of malaise was reinforced – and the president, Nicolas Sarkozy, summoned veteran player Thierry Henry to explain himself. Henry, a member of the legendary squad which won the World Cup for France in 1998, rubbed salt into the wound by announcing last week he would never again play for Les Bleus.</p>
              <p>Last night, former sports minister Bernard Laporte criticised the attention given the allegations. "We make things very important which are perhaps not all that important. He [Ribéry] hasn't killed anyone … I don't believe in a severe punishment. I don't believe in that at all, as logically speaking, when you see this girl you don't think she's underage." He added, nonetheless: "No one is above the law.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 1.05em; FONT-SIZE: 1.05em">FRENCH soccer star Franck Ribery jetted underage hooker Zahia Dehar to Germany on his 26th birthday as a "lovely little present", she revealed.</h2>
              <p>The married Bayern Munich maestro paid £1,500 for a night of passion with the Moroccan-born temptress from Paris at a five-star hotel in Bavaria.</p>
              <p>But in her first interview, stunning blonde Zahia, told Paris Match magazine she lied that she was over 18 — the legal age for prostitution in France.</p>
              <p>Zahia — in hiding since the scandal broke a fortnight ago — said: "I was Ribery's birthday present. Franck approached me in a Paris club. He booked me and flew me to Munich to celebrate his 26th birthday.</p>
              <p>Zahia, from a strict Muslim family, went on: "I consider myself to be a call girl, but not a prostitute.  </p>
              <p>"My mother and my stepfather did not know what I was doing until this happened. Now it seems they have had some 'news' from their daughter."</p>
              <p>Franck, 27, converted to Islam when he married childhood sweetheart Wahiba, mother of his two children. She is now reportedly considering divorce.</p>
              <p>Fellow French internationals Sidney Govou, 30, Karim Benzema, 22, and Hatem Ben Arfa, 23, have also been linked with Zahia.</p>
              <p>Ribery is considered the country's best player, but the population has turned against him.</p>
              <p>Zahia was one of 18 girls arrested from the Cafe Zaman night club on the Champs Elysee over a child prostitution racket.</p>
              <p>If Ribery is charged, he faces up to three years in jail and a fine of up to £40,000. He has admitted a long-term relationship with her, but has denied in interviews with cops he knew she was just 17.</p>
