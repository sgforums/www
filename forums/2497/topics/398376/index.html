              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea </strong></span></a><strong>are ready to tempt AC Milan with a £70million double bid for Alexandre Pato and Thiago Silva.</strong></p>
              <p>The Serie A giants have insisted their star players are not for sale but Milan's financial situation will make it difficult to resist serious bids.</p>
              <p>The San Siro side recorded a loss of £8.5m last year despite selling Kaka to Real Madrid for £56m and they are reportedly heading for another summer of low spending and belt-tightening when it comes to offering players new contracts.</p>
              <p>Chelsea boss Carlo Ancelotti is a huge admirer of Pato and was in charge of Milan when the Brazil striker was signed from Internacional just over two years ago.</p>
              <p>The Barclays Premier League champions-elect had a bid turned down for the 20-year-old last summer and are expected to make another attempt to sign him at the end of the season.</p>
              <p>Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport report that Ancelotti is also keen to add Brazil defender Thiago Silva to the deal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/04/article-1271799-096BD0FB000005DC-910_468x319.jpg" alt="Target: Chelsea boss Ancelotti wants Thiago Silva (centre) at Stamford Bridge" width="468" height="319">

              <p><strong>Chelsea scouted the 25-year-old before he moved to Milan from Fluminense two years ago. The move could be part of a Brazilian exodus from the Italian side.</strong></p>
              <p>Coach Leonardo is leaving in the summer and star forward Ronaldinho is increasingly expected to shun a new contract which would see his £135,000 a week wages slashed by 25 per cent.</p>
              <p>The 30-year-old former Barcelona forward's agent is set for more talks this week amid claims that <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester City</span></a> could still be interested in the two-time World Player of the Year. </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1272483" rel="1272483|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1272483/70m-Fernando-Torres-Chelsea-launch-huge-bid-striker-Roman-Abramovich-looks-blow-Manchester-City-water.html"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Chelsea have made a dramatic move for Fernando Torres that they hope will catch Manchester City cold and take the Liverpool striker to Stamford Bridge for a British record transfer fee that could reach £70million.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span> understands preliminary discussions have already taken place, with the outcome of those meetings positive enough to convince Roman Abramovich that he will beat his big-spending rivals at Eastlands to the 26-year-old Spaniard.</p>
              <p>Chelsea owner Abramovich has been relatively quiet in the transfer market by his own extravagant standards since Jose Mourinho left. But the success and stability Carlo Ancelotti has brought, achieved with an attacking style Abramovich appreciates, have convinced the club’s Russian billionaire to make another stellar signing.</p>
              <p>Chelsea can secure their third Barclays Premier League title during Abramovich’s tenure with the right result at home to Wigan on Sunday — before then chasing a possible domestic Double with the FA Cup final the following weekend — and Abramovich now wants to add the extra quality to the side that will enhance their chances of finally winning the Champions League.</p>
              <p>Chelsea are not afraid to sign Liverpool’s best players. In 2005 and 2006 they went close to luring captain Steven Gerrard from Anfield and now they are sure they will succeed with the player named in the FIFPro World XI for the last two years and ranked third behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka at the FIFA World Player of the Year gala for 2008.</p>
              <p>Amid the chaos at Anfield, fears have already been expressed that Torres, who joined from Atletico Madrid for around £20m in 2007, will leave Liverpool this summer.</p>
              <p>It was only last year that he made a commitment to the Merseysiders by signing a new four-year contract worth £110,000-a-week. But the Liverpool landscape has since changed significantly, with under-fire manager Rafa Benitez now on the verge of leaving for Juventus, yet more uncertainty over the future ownership of the club, and the team’s failure to qualify for next season’s Champions League hanging over Anfield.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Only this week Torres’s team-mate, Yossi Benayoun, said: ‘A club like Liverpool must do everything they can to keep players like Stevie (Gerrard) and Fernando but a lot of things can change and in a few weeks we will know better.’</p>
              </div>
              <p>Benitez has valued Torres at £70m and Anfield officials have said that they will not sell their prized asset.</p>
              <p>But until now, Torres has only enjoyed major success at international level, having scored the winning goal for Spain in the final of the last European Championships, and Liverpool’s shocking season has convinced him to look elsewhere.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/04/article-0-01CAF49D00000578-854_468x310.jpg" alt="Spanish flyer: Torres fires the opener in the Euro 2008 final - the striker's only major honour to date" width="468" height="310">

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>With the continued uncertainty over the future of Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini, and no guarantee as yet that his club will secure Champions League football next season, it is understood that Torres would favour a move to a more settled club who look like winning the championship.</strong></p>
              <p>After watching his colleagues lose pitifully to Chelsea on Sunday, Torres cut a forlorn figure as the players did a circuit of the pitch to thank the fans for their loyal support. Indeed, he already looked like a man ready to move on.</p>
              <p>Liverpool were only concerned with his fitness yesterday, and whether he would be fit to participate in the World Cup after suffering a knee injury during a Europa League clash with Benfica last month.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>‘Whether he will be fit for Spain’s first game or not is uncertain,’ said Peter Brukner, who is overseeing his recovery at Anfield.</strong></p>
              <p>‘But, if he continues to progress the way he is, he should be fit to play at some stage during the World Cup.’</p>
              <p>By the time he does he will almost certainly be heading out of Liverpool.</p>

              <p>Sky Bet are also offering odds on Torres leaving Liverpool this summer and make <strong>Chelsea 5/1 favourites</strong> to secure his signature should he quit Anfield. Manchester City are 6/1 shots to sign him, while Inter Milan, who are also rumoured to be planning a summer swoop, are a 20/1 chance.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, speculation also continues over Rafa Benitez’s future at Anfield and <a class="links2Bold" href="http://www.caledonianmedia.com/sitestat.aspx?siteurl=9378"><strong><span style="color: #106bde;">Sky Bet</span></strong></a> make the Spaniard 1/2 to be managing Juventus by the start of next season.</p>
              <p>Benitez’s agent claims that the Reds’ boss has not received any offers and wants to remain at Anfield but Sky Bet make him 3/1 still to be at the Liverpool helm for their opening match of the 2010/11 Premier League.</p>
              <p>Benitez is also reportedly a target for Real Madrid and is 6/1 to succeed Manuel Pellegrini at the Bernabeu.</p>
              <p>Both of them should leave, better then rotting at Liverpool. With two blood sucking owners only concern is making a profit, I don't see any future improvement coming.</p>

              <p>if Wenger had been coaching Chelsea, they've been crowned champs weeks ago !</p>

              <p>don't forget, Man U is considerably weaker this season without Ronaldo............</p>
              <p>Arsenal was never strong enough to challenge for the title...............</p>
