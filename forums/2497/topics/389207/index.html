              <h1>Chelsea beware! I've built MY Inter Milan team now, roars Jose Mourinho<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Such was the thunder of Sunday night’s enthralling Milan derby, it
              seemed for a moment that even the one-man theatrical production that is
              Jose Mourinho might be drowned out, lost for words, even. The Special
              One soon scotched those notions.</p>
              <p>Once Mourinho had digested the
              unforgettable drama of Inter Milan’s nine-man 2-0 triumph, a victory
              that took Inter nine points clear at the top of Serie A and on the way
              to a fifth consecutive title, he quickly looked into next month and the
              Champions League knockout stage against Chelsea, his much-treasured
              former club.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/01/25/article-0-0800271A000005DC-143_468x327.jpg" alt="Jose Mourinho" width="468" height="327">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Inter-change: Jose Mourinho has warned his old club that his side are better than last year</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>‘We know we have a super opponent,’ he said. ‘But Chelsea know they don’t have an easy job with us.’</p>
              <p>Sunday
              will have shown Carlo Ancelotti that. Chelsea are not AC Milan, who
              were wooden and creaking at the San Siro, but Mourinho’s theory is
              that, compared with last March when Inter meekly exited the Champions
              League at Old Trafford, his team have improved by a dimension.</p>
              <p>‘This
              team is better than last year,’ said Mourinho. ‘It’s much better. If
              everybody is in good shape we have more solutions. Of the team that
              played today, (Samuel) Eto’o was not here, (Dejan) Stankovic was not
              here, (Cristian) Chivu was not here. So even with some problems we’re a
              team with more solutions. We are a better team.’</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/01/25/article-1246079-080029ED000005DC-330_306x423.jpg" alt="David Beckham" width="306" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Kings of the city: Inter were too much of a match for David Beckham and co in the Milan derby on Sunday</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Mourinho, 47 today, then added: ‘This is now my team, a team in my image.’</p>
              <p>Given
              his record of rebuilding sides at Porto and Chelsea, Inter deserve
              increasing respect. They qualified from the toughest Champions League
              group, which included Barcelona, FC Rubin Kazan and Dynamo Kiev. Since
              losing to Barcelona in November, never mind at Manchester United last
              March - when Mourinho had been at Inter only nine months - there has
              been progress.</p>
              <p>Goran
              Pandev, creator of the first on Sunday and scorer of the second, has
              arrived from Lazio after a long contractual dispute. Pandev cost
              nothing - so far. With Eto’o away with Cameroon, Pandev partnered Diego
              Milito and the give-and-go chemistry between them overwhelmed AC
              Milan’s defence.</p>
              <p>Behind them, Wesley Sneijder formed the base of
              an attacking triangle. There was a touch of Deco about him. Sneijder
              cost £24million when he joined Real Madrid. The fee was half that when
              he moved to Inter, and despite his foolish dismissal, Sneijder, Pandev
              and Milito gelled dangerously when together. None were in Manchester
              last March and there was a degree of movement not seen when Zlatan
              Ibrahimovic led Inter’s line.</p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/01/25/article-0-08042DCC000005DC-251_235x366.jpg" alt="United vs Inter" width="235" height="366"></div>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><br></div>
              <p>‘Year after year you change things according to your needs and your
              own philosophy,’ added Mourinho. ‘I have in attack the kind of players
              I like, players who can hold the ball and play football, not just score
              goals. A player like Sneijder is a player we didn’t have last season.
              Lucio is better in the air than previous defenders. The team has more
              of a chance of success.’</p>
              <p>Mourinho described his record against
              Ancelotti as ‘OK’ and said that his knowledge of Chelsea’s squad - and
              theirs of him - means ‘nobody has an advantage’.</p>
              <p>Beaten
              AC Milan boss Leonardo, described Inter’s counter-attacking as
              ‘brilliant’, but there could be no such praise for his own team.</p>
              <p>Sir
              Alex Ferguson leads Wayne Rooney and Co to the San Siro three weeks
              today and Ferguson left there on Sunday surely satisfied United can
              overcome Milan.</p>
              <p>There may yet be one last hurrah from a set of
              Milan players whose best days are behind them but, from Andrea Pirlo to
              Gennaro Gattuso, to David Beckham and Ronaldinho, the lack of pace was
              obvious. At least Alessandro Nesta is due to return to the back four.</p>
              <p>On the bench were Clarence Seedorf, Filippo Inzaghi and Kakha Kaladze, part of a different era, it feels.</p>
              <p>This is Mourinho’s Inter city for now.</p>

              <p>well, it is a big deal for Inter as accordingly, Milan and Inter are on par with 17 Serie A titles, so if Inter wins this season, they are above Milan.</p>
              <p>btw, Juventus got 20+ if I am not wrong.</p>
