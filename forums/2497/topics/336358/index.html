              <p><strong>Zenit St Petersburg star Andrei Arshavin has again told the club that he is desperate to leave as soon as possible. </strong></p>
              <p>The Russia forward, 27, was heavily linked with moves to Barcelona
              and Arsenal in the summer before eventually coming close to a move to
              Tottenham, but the move fell through as the clubs were unable to agree
              a fee.</p>
              <p>And while Zenit are the current Uefa Cup and Super Cup champions and
              are competing in this season’s Champions League, he insists he remains
              desperate to secure a move away from the club.</p>
              <p>"A professional cannot be reluctant to play if he enters the field," he told Sport Express.</p>
              <p>“I am doing my best for Zenit, but four months ago I told the
              chairman of the club that I don’t want to stay in the team. And then I
              repeated it continually.</p>
              <p>“Unfortunately, my words were either ignored or underestimated.</p>
              <p>"The problem boils down to whether Zenit set a realistic price.</p>
              <p>“If that happens, I will leave; if not, I will be listed in the
              Zenit squad but only on paper. Next year, I don’t want to – and won’t –
              play here.</p>
              <p>"That is not an ultimatum but a typical reaction to the situation.</p>
              <p>“I was always thinking that it is possible to come to an agreement and leave smoothly, but now I have much less hope.</p>
              <p>“A conflict seems necessary but, bless me, I wanted it least of all.</p>
              <p>"The management of the club does not know about my decision yet, but they will learn about it after this interview."</p>
              <p>He added: "I am not satisfied playing in Zenit and I think my teammates do not enjoy the game either as they see my situation.</p>
              <p>"Generally speaking, I have been suffering for four months and the team is in torment with me.</p>
              <p>"The Champions League is of course a kind of an impetus, but that is only six games.</p>
              <p>"At the moment, I am a part of the team and it is important for me
              that the team finishes as high in the Russian championship as possible.</p>
              <p>“I repeat that, if I enter the field, I do everything I can at that moment. If I did not want to play, I would say it."</p>
              <p>Arshavin says he has not seen Tottenham this season but was pleased
              to hear that Russia team-mate Roman Pavlychenko score at the weekend.</p>
              <p>"I have not seen a single game of Tottenham, to tell you the truth,” he said.</p>
              <p>“But after every match day of the English Premier League, everybody
              in the team who watched the games is teasing me – even (coach Dick)
              Advocaat.</p>
              <p>“That is why I don’t really need to watch Tottenham – I get full reports from their games anyway.</p>
              <p>“After my unsuccessful transfer to that English club, absolutely everyone at Zenit is interested in Tottenham.</p>
              <p>"I can say nothing about Tottenham’s and especially Pavlyuchenko’s
              performance as I am not in the team, but Roman has started to score.
              That is good."</p>

              <p><strong>Zenit St Petersburg boss Dick Advocaat has revealed he no longer wants Andrei Arshavin to stay at the club. </strong></p>
              <p>Following the player's explosive interview on Friday
                  in which he demanded the chance to play abroad, Advocaat has admitted
                  there is little point in keeping the player in Russia and the
                  27-year-old now looks set to leave in January.</p>
              <p>“As a coach, I suppose that we should give Andrei a chance to try himself in the other team,” he told Sport Express.</p>
              <p>“It will be better both for our club and for the player.</p>
              <p>“We had good time together and it’s time to part with him.”</p>
              <p>Arshavin hinted in the interview that he is still interested in moving to Tottenham.</p>
