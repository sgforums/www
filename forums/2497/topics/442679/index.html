              <p class="imageCaption">Injury blow: Lucas is stretchered off at Stamford Bridge</p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Jamie Carragher has admitted Liverpool have lost a player 'as important as Luis Suarez' after the club's worst fears over Lucas were confirmed.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Brazilian international will miss the rest of the season after scans revealed he suffered significant damage to the anterior cruciate ligament in his left-knee during Tuesday night's 2-0 win at Chelsea in the Carling Cup.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He will need surgery to correct the damage and will then face six months on the sidelines, meaning Liverpool may be forced to reassess their plans for the January transfer window.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Jay Spearing is likely to take over his defensive midfield role alongside Charlie Adam for the time being, as Steven Gerrard is still recovering from an ankle infection. </span></p>
              <div id="ext-gen3138" class="moduleHalf"><span style="font-size: x-small;">What is certain, though, is that the injury has dealt a huge blow to Liverpool's ambitions and Carragher underlined Lucas' worth when he claimed his influence on the team in 2011 has been matched only by Suarez.</span></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'For the last 18 months, in my opinion, he has been our best player,' said Carragher.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Luis Suarez has come in and done great things for the club but Lucas has been his equal in many ways. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'He has been as good as anyone in the team this season and there is no question he will be a big miss.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Signed from Gremio in May 2007, Lucas has fought back from being a target for the terrace boo-boys and Carragher believes the 24-year-old's strength of character will help his rehabilitation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I have been there in terms of receiving criticism,' said Carragher. 'High standards are expected when you play for one of the big clubs and there are plenty examples of players who have gone missing after realising the demands on them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'But you can tell Lucas is a top player as he never lets that bother him. He has just got on with it and plays in nearly every game. If he has a little knock, he will always try and carry on, doing his best for us. There are lots of different characters but you can't fault Lucas.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Lucas is distraught about the news but he said on Twitter: 'I am really disappointed but I am sure I will come back stronger and achieve everything I dream of in a Liverpool shirt.'</span></p>

              <p>It was two season ago that Lucas was labelled as a clown for losing possession in midfield.</p>
              <p>I am surprised that he have evolved to be the main force in Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Kudo to him for taking all the negative critics and prove his worth on the field.</p>
              <p>Ah Ken should have some idea on who to replace him.</p>
              <p>Henderson seem to be more comfortable in playing in the middle.</p>
              <p>As for Aquaman, it really puzzled me as we have nursed him back to health and he is playing in Italy for the past two seasons.</p>
              <p>He was never given a chance under Kenny.</p>
              <p>Lastly, Maxi should thank FA for putting the fixture so close that Kenny have finally decided to use him instead of his pets.</p>
              <p>Maxi did not disappoint Kenny and deliver the thankgiving present at the Bridge two times for all the faithful fans.</p>
              <p>As for Carroll, he missed the penalty and nearly screwed up while helping up in defence.</p>
              <p>Enough said about him around the world in the forum.</p>

              <p>To be honest, I wouldn'd be disappointed at all if United sign Torres from Chelsea for a cut price $30m. But I wouldn't even want Carroll for $20m. Cos there is just something about Torres that makes you belief he can still deliver.</p>
              <p>I still think it's the Chelsea style or midfielders that isn't supplying him fully... He could be a RVN kind of players... But too bad lah, Chelsea won't sell him on the cheap for sure...</p>

              <p>To be honest, I wouldn'd be disappointed at all if United sign
              Torres from Chelsea for a cut price $30m. But I wouldn't even want
              Carroll for $20m. Cos there is just something about Torres that
              makes you belief he can still deliver.</p>
              <p>I still think it's the Chelsea style or midfielders that isn't
              supplying him fully... He could be a RVN kind of players... But too
              bad lah, Chelsea won't sell him on the cheap for sure...</p>

              <p>At least, Torres moves and shoots like a striker even if he is struggling to score.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Carroll's movement and shooting looks damn clumsy for a striker - no finesse, no power, no accuracy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
