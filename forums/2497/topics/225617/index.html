            <div class='col-md body'>The Premiership's big four would have harboured two secret wishes as they waited for the Champions League draw - keep away from Barcelona and hope to meet Lille.<br><br>So it will have been with decidedly mixed feelings that the hierarchy of Liverpool and Manchester United left Nyon after the pairings for the last 16. Liverpool landed holders Barcelona, who were lurking dangerously in the other half of the draw after finishing second to Chelsea in the group stage. Manchester United, in contrast, got the draw they would have picked themselves when they landed rank outsiders Lille.<br><br>Any Old Trafford complacency, however, will be wiped away by the memories of miserable performances against Lille last season that shaped their embarrassing exit at the group stage. Arsenal and Chelsea will be firm favourites to get past PSV Eindhoven and Porto respectively - but it is the meeting of the last two winners of the Champions League that captures the imagination.<br><br>Liverpool fans' hearts may have sank as their ball was pulled out to face Barca, but there are sound reasons to suggest they may be the team to stop Frank Rijkaard's hugely-gifted side retaining the trophy. And the tactical acumen of manager Rafael Benitez, as he prepares to return to Spain, will give Liverpool their main cause for optimism.<br><br>Benitez has proved himself a master of the two-legged European tie, most crucially in the Champions League triumph of 2005. He will go back to his homeland armed with the knowledge that it was his superbly-drilled Valencia side that broke the cartel of Barca and Real Madrid that carved up La Liga before Benitez's departure for Liverpool.<br><br>Benitez knows what it takes to win at the Nou Camp, and will prepare Liverpool accordingly. The Spanish coach's previous success will aid him in the psychological warfare that almost inevitably takes place before any big game at the Nou Camp. Benitez will hope to keep Barcelona in range for the second leg, before relying on Anfield's unique atmosphere to potentially push his players over the line.<br><br>Barcelona have the brilliance of Ronaldinho, Deco, Lionel Messi and the likely return of Samuel Eto'o. They will be firm favourites and rightly so, but to write Liverpool off would be foolish. The occasion will be made for Steven Gerrard, and the enigmatic Luis Garcia - a former Barcelona player - has a happy knack of scoring crucial Champions League goals.<br><br>Goalkeeper Pepe Reina is another Barca old boy, while Xabi Alonso is another member of Liverpool's Spanish contingent with a huge incentive to impress. The smart money is on Barca, but the smart money was also on Juventus, Chelsea and AC Milan when Liverpool last lifted the trophy against all odds.<br><br>Barcelona will be wary of the wily Benitez and the local knowledge he is sure to utilise to the full.<br><br>Another manager returning home is Chelsea's Jose Mourinho, who goes to back to Porto having achieved legendary status when he won the Champions League with the club in 2004. He will be confident of progress, and there is the possibility that Premiership could make up half of the quarter-final draw.</div>

HeÂ’s resilient and heÂ’ll get his team to fight.Â”<br></div>
