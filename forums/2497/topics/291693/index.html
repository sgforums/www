            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2007/11/14/gerrard2.jpg"><br><br><strong>Steven Gerrard expects to be in anguish when he watches the Croatia and Russia games that could eliminate his country from Euro 2008 but there is an even greater apprehension when he peers into the future. The Liverpool captain does not shy away from a vision of a deeper decline for the England side and adds his name to the list of those alarmed by the number of overseas signings in the Premier League.</strong><br><br>I believe," he said, "that if foreigners do take over completely it will make things even worse for the national team." Gerrard backs a quota scheme, despite the difficulties of developing a system that complies with European and national laws. "I'm all for that," he said. "I support the Liverpool academy now and I am desperate for another young player to come through into the Liverpool team. I support that in the national team as well. There's a big danger that we stop producing quality young kids because of the amount of foreigners in the game."<br><br>Gerrard must realise the dangerous territory he is entering. He and Michael Owen were the last English teenagers of the highest quality to emerge at Anfield and the club has felt compelled to look further afield. The Liverpool line-up for last weekend's game against Fulham contained three native players and the composition of the reserve side is similar.<br><br>While he is no rebel, Gerrard cannot help but sound at variance with his club manager, Rafael BenÃ­tez, who has authorised the cosmopolitan recruitment policy. The player, of course, appreciates the realities: "You've got to understand the manager's situation going into big games." On the whole, top-flight managers do not trust in youngsters. But Gerrard said: "Kids will only turn into good players if they are given the chance. I would not be sitting here without the chance that GÃ©rard Houllier gave me."<br><br>Idealism is gripping the midfielder, possibly because jeopardy in the Euro 2008 qualifiers underlines how much is at stake. Gerrard does not hesitate to declare international football a greater priority. "When I join up with England these games are bigger than Champions League games or league games," said. "You're representing your country. If you go to a major tournament and play well or achieve something as a team it's going to be a lot bigger than achieving something at your club."<br><br>This sort of talk will exasperate BenÃ­tez when Liverpool are struggling in their Champions League group. The club's owners might find such views toxic and Anfield fans could have different aims from Gerrard. He will not budge. "Maybe that is supporters being selfish," he said, "but as a player you want to play in the biggest games. Those are European [Championship] games and World Cup games."<br><br>Gerrard reiterated his backing for the manager, Steve McClaren, and argued that blame for bad results has lain with the players. He realises that he and the rest of the squad will come in for hostile treatment at Wembley should the meeting with Croatia be meaningless.<br><br>"If we don't get [to Euro 2008]," he said, "we are going to be in for a difficult night, which is understandable. You've got to take it on the chin. It's not going to help the team if we are going to be jeered at. I would plead with the fans to stay with us. I'm an England fan as well and I do understand them being frustrated if we don't qualify. They are the best supporters out there and they do want to go to [Euro 2008]."<br></div>
