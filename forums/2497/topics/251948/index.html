Liverpool beat the Blues on penalties to knock them out of the Champions League semi-finals for the second time in three years as Mourinho again failed to deliver a place in a European final. </strong><br><br>Ranieri, Mourinho's predecessor at the club, was dismissed for a similar record - although the Portuguese's back-to-back Premiership titles do appear to put him in a position of strength. But Chelsea look set to lose out to Manchester United and relinquish their crown this season, leaving an FA Cup final against Sir Alex Ferguson's side as the last chance to add to the league cup win.<br><br>Ranieri told BBC Radio Five Live: "(Owner Roman) Abramovich wants to win the Champions League. He wants Chelsea at the top of the world. "Jose Mourinho is working very well but I don't know what could happen. "(Winning) the Carling Cup wasn't enough for me after four years - is it enough for Mourinho? I don't know. "I'm not sure what happened (against Liverpool). But he (Abramovich) wants it. I think the match was fantastic and the second leg was fantastic.<br><br>"Chelsea lost the match at home at Stamford Bridge when Jose Reina made two great saves." Ranieri, who took over at Valencia after leaving Chelsea and is currently at Italian side Parma, also admitted he could be tempted by a return to the Premiership.<br><br>He said: "England has fantastic atmosphere, great football, great fans. "At the moment I am at Parma and in a very good moment." Ranieri has been linked with a summer move to Fulham but asked if he had been approached by any English clubs, he said: "I don't know. I have heard nothing myself, I don't know about my agent<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've said it before and I'll say it again, Chelsea would do better if Mourinho continued to be manager.<br><br>However, I feel Mourinho has made enemies unnecessarily of everyone else out there. I used to think he's moaning were just tactics and ploys. But judging from how he responded after last night's match, it really seems the things he says are just moanings..... I've lost respect for him as a manager, but I still think he's good.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mourinho may be quite good but if you look at the bigger picture... He is actually very bad to have as your club manager. The problem with him is, he put the club into serious problems... You can imagine... Roman put so much money and today the club is less popular mainly because of him i would say...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i hope roman let mourinho control the 1st team matter...let him tok as he like..let him sign players he like...instead of the sporting director doing all these things ( duno how spell his name )... it will be better if mourinho is the 1 doing..he know wat the club need..he can sign players which improve the team..instead of letting big signing rotting on bench...</div>

The Anfield chief executive was angry that Mourinho had described Liverpool as a small club and a cup team before the game. The build up to last night's semi-final, second leg had also been clouded by mudslinging between Rafa Benitez and the Chelsea boss and Parry took his opportunity to hit back after Liverpool knocked out the Premiership champions 4-1 on penalties. </strong><br><br>"I don't care what he says, I don't listen," said Parry. "I guess when you've invested Â£500m it's a fantastic season to win the League Cup. He's welcome to his opinions, we care about Liverpool."<br><br>Mourinho insisted today that the crushing defeat would have no bearing on his future but former manager Claudio Ranieri is not so sure that the Portuguese will be in charge at Chelsea next season.
