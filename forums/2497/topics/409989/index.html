              <h1>Fabio Capello: You've turned me into a monster! England boss turns on his critics ahead of Bulgaria clash<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden"></div>
              <p>Fabio Capello admits his national status has slumped from a 'god' to a
               'monster' since England's World Cup flop but he has promised to fight 
              to save his job.</p>
              <p>Capello turned on his critics ahead of the 
              Euro 2012 qualifier against Bulgaria at Wembley, defending his tactics, 
              his players and his record as England boss.</p>
              <p>'You create the 
              god and you create the monster,' said the Italian with a laugh. 'I 
              remember what was written about me before this period. I live the same 
              when you write well of me as I do when you write badly of me. This is my
               job and I have to live with the pressure.</p>

              </div>
              <p>'We lost only one game in the World Cup, against Germany, after one 
              big mistake from the referee. You don't remember this? I think so. But, 
              after this, your opinion about me changed completely. But I live with 
              this situation. It's no problem for me. I live. Sorry. It is easy to be 
              the best when you win but, when you lose, you lose everything. You have 
              to fight and I am a fighter.'</p>
              <p>In his hour of need, Capello will 
              show faith in many of the same players who let him down in South Africa.
               The England manager confirmed that Jermain Defoe and Wayne Rooney, the 
              strikeforce which started in the 4-1 defeat to Germany, will again 
              spearhead the team.</p>

              <p>Rooney has not scored in 10 internationals, stretching back almost a 
              year, but Capello said: 'He is good, he is back. Rooney will play with 
              Defoe. I changed some things but not a lot.'</p>

              <h3 class="wocc"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The changing face of Europe</span><br></h3>
              <div class="ins cleared xolcc bdrcc">
              <p>England ditched 12 players from their World Cup squad for the 
              forthcoming European Championship qualifiers, calling up 11 new faces. 
              And they are not alone.</p>
              <p>The rest of Europe has been at it 
              too. Unlike at the World Cup, where countries had to select 23-strong 
              squads, they are able to select a different sized group for the Euro 
              qualifiers.</p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">France.................... IN 15   OUT 14</p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">Germany................ IN 4     OUT 6</p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">Holland .................. IN 8     OUT 9</p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">Spain ..................... IN 2      OUT 4</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Portugal ............... IN 6      OUT 9</span></p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>But Bulgaria coach Stanimir Stoilov believes the pressure could get 
              to Rooney and urged Hungarian referee Viktor Kassai and his fellow 
              officials to stamp out any aggression he might show towards his players.</p>
              <p>Stoilov said: 'If Rooney is nervous because of his lack of 
              goals he should be punished if he is too aggressive, but that is the 
              referee's job. Rooney has great skills so I have to teach my players how
               to stop him on the pitch and not to provoke him. It is not the style of
               the Bulgaria national team to provoke. We came here to play fairly.'</p>
              <p>But
               for injuries to Chelsea pair John Terry and Frank Lampard, the England 
              team starting tonight would be close to the one thrashed by the Germans 
              in Bloemfontein.</p>
              <p>Everton defender Phil Jagielka trained yesterday and is expected to replace Terry in the back four.</p>
              <p>West
               Bromwich Albion goalkeeper Scott Carson pulled out of the squad after a
               family bereavement and has been replaced by Watford's Scott Loach, 
              recalled from Under 21 duty.</p>
              <p>Capello hopes Carson will be able to rejoin his squad in time for Tuesday's game in Switzerland.</p>
