              <p>Thanks iceFatboy,</p>
              <p>It's easy to talk with the open-minded, at least as what u have
              shown. I do think that the clash at the Kallar Roar Stadium has the
              contributions of both sides, not the Sings alone because I know
              some Viets who is more aggressive that what they look like.</p>
              <p>Sorry for above angry and unclean words. Hoping for friendly
              talks!</p>

              <p>for that, I thank you..</p>
              <p>Well, sometimes football do that to people. just make the adrenline shoot up and people just forget they are people.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I don't think SEA countries are ready to challenge the big guns of Asia like Korea, Japan, the Middle East Countries or even Australia that are added..</p>

              <p>Now that we champion, who dare to meet us Viet players. We are reaching out AFC 2011 to compete with timid China, turbulous Lebanon and Syria and beat 'em all. The lions? better to stay at home unless u want to be pulverized by Thais, Iranians and Jordan. Paper lions of striped bloods. Singapore's hybrid football team. <br><br>^^ U the one who type this leh n u the one who start it first saying we Singapore team go home leh wor, but i go to tell u last time Singapore has a legend that go Europe play leh, U all got ma? N come to think of it , So wad if we Singapore Team lost to all the pro , at least we has the honor to fight against the pro team ,u all leh, dun even dare to fight Man Utd or Some pro clubs. See China la, even China dare to fight Barcelona n gt even go World Cups play leh (2002)...... <br></p>

              <p>Ok, Limmper. Your angers are understandable as they often spark
              from the one with mental inferiority. No one will blame u for such
              wording! That's your words, so keep them and live with them if u
              want. I don't care how are you feeling. I won't touch u and i hope
              you will stay away from me. OK.</p>

              <p>Facts are facts. But it seems some people just have an inferiority complex. Every nation in SEA wants to beat Singapore in football 'cos we have established ourselves as a powerhouse in recent years.</p>
              <p>However, I'm not too proud of the way we fast tracked foreigners into our team. Zidane may be of Algerian roots but he grew up in France. Likewise for Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard of Surinam. Singapore is just doing things the convenient way and how ludicrous of Stupid Lau Goh to use France as our benchmark when they won the WC1998.</p>
              <p>Anyway, with regards to Vietnam, yes I love their people for their hospitality but I certainly don't love their dogs. Any in this forum? A senior accountant friend of mine who works in UOB Vietnam earns only US$500 a month. Mind you, he has schooled in Germany before. Now that can't even compare with our Bangala constuction worker.</p>
              <p>Vietnam will be a powerful nation but definitely not in the pace of China. And until then, which may very well be a 100 years later, some fucktard dogs shd just shut the fuck up and eat some humble pie. Admittedly though, Vietnam has shown lots of fighting spirit in their matches and they thoroughly deserved their Cup. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Limmper, u shoud go out there talking with your family members and friends this way. U r not the one who can talk with me. It's no use bearing such a grudge. Get out of my talks, sir!</p>
              <p>A newly rich person often has arrogant behaviors. That's understandable. Each country has its own history and circumstances. Look at Japan, a highly developed and respectable country. People from Japan are always polite, modest and courteous. They never boast their riches. They never base one money to look down anyone. And that's the manner of the real champion. They have post-modernized people and they value righteousness, morals, dignity over money and material needs.</p>
              <p>People coming from newly-well-off countries like South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and some places in China, by contrast, are often haughty, rude, small-minded, arrogant and ridiculous. Money is their reason and justification of living. In their view, a friend that is poor is not a good friend. They are modernized people and they value money and material needs. They can harm their own families members or friends for material reason. They base on money to jugde whether one is superior or inferior.</p>
              <p>We, the Vietnamese, are still poor, and that is true. But we must not let ourself follow the mentality of newly-well-off countries. We admire the Japanese and would learn from them in our own way. We would not blame the history, the wars that torn our country. We are pround of being the Vietnamese. As far as the ideology, the government, the regime are concerned, there comes another story.</p>
              <p>And if you disregard us, we would despise u in return. Only ones who have dignity deserve our respect. One who take advantage of some sport events do burn our flag, attack our fellows and throw vulgar words on us must not receive anything good from us.</p>
