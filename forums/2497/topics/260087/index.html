            <div class='col-md body'>the fact that Newcastle paid a huge sum of money to get him out of Real when he didn't quite enjoyed himself with them and the way Newcastle stood by him when he got injuried playing for England does make senses that he repay them by at least staying with them a couple of years to allow them to recoup some of those millions.. but with the way things goes in transfer market i seriously doubt anyone gives a damn, just hope that Owen is not one of those</div>
