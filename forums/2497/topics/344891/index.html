              <h2>It seems that City have lost two Brazilians in one night after their superstar striker went AWOL.</h2>
              <p>Everyone expected Manchester City to announce the world-record
              capture of Kaka last night, but instead they were left with only Craig
              Bellamy to unveil as AC Milan decided to keep their brilliant playmaker.</p>
              <p>And now the Citizens face a potential crisis after Robinho went
              missing from their training camp in the Canary Islands last night.</p>
              <p>Sources in the English press claim that the ex-Real Madrid
              star stormed out of the Sky Blues' base in Tenerife and could not be
              contacted all evening.</p>
              <p>It is believed the 24-year-old has grown sullen at Eastlands, as he
              has become frustrated with City's underperformance on the pitch and,
              perhaps, at the negotiating table.</p>
              <p>There is a suggestion that Robinho is upset at the club's failure to
              sign Kaka. He has long stressed his desire to see more Brazilians in
              the blue half of Manchester, and the former FIFA World Player of the
              Year would have been a dream addition.</p>
              <p>The details of this whole affair are still sketchy, but it might be
              enough to convince Chelsea to have another crack at one of Luiz Felipe
              Scolari's favourite players.</p>

              <p><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/08/12/330/Robinho_1586860.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Robinho insists he is happy at
              Manchester City and left the club's training camp in Tenerife to return
              to Brazil for family reasons.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The former Real Madrid
              forward left the Canaries on Monday amid speculation he stormed out
              following the club's failure to complete a deal for AC Milan star Kaka.</p>
              <p>However Robinho told BBC Sport: "I had made Manchester City aware that I needed to return to Brazil because of a family matter.</p>
              <p>"I will return to the club and hope to sort this out as soon as possible."</p>
              <p>Robinho added: "I feel it is important to underline that I did not return to Brazil because of the Kaka deal.</p>
              <p>"He is one of my good friends and it would have been great to
              see him at Manchester City - but it had nothing to do with his decision
              to stay in Milan.</p>
              <p>"I am committed to helping Manchester City become the force the owners assured me they will become."</p>
              <p>The Blues smashed the British transfer record when they splashed out £32.5million on the 24-year-old in August last year.</p>
              <p>Widely assumed to be joining Chelsea, Robinho plumped for City
              when Real Madrid refused to do business with the Stamford Bridge
              outfit.</p>
              <p>On a personal level, Robinho has been a success, netting 12
              goals for his new club - all but one of which have come in the Premier
              League - and becoming an instant hit with the City faithful.</p>
              <p>However, City's failure to establish themselves in the top half
              of the table under manager Mark Hughes is bound to be the source of
              disappointment.</p>
              <p>The striker has been giving Hughes some advice over his team
              building, claiming last week that even though he would like to see Kaka
              at Eastlands, defensive reinforcements were the priority.</p>
