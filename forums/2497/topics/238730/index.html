The midfielder, 31, has not played for England since McClaren took over as coach after the World Cup last summer. </strong><br><br>Beckham also found himself omitted from the Real team after agreeing to join LA Galaxy in the summer, but has impressed on his return in their last two games.<br><br>"It gives me a problem, one of the problems you welcome," McClaren said. "He's being professional and performing well for his club - obviously that's a problem I would rather have than not have. It's interesting," he added.<br><br>Beckham was named man-of-the-match in Real's Champions League win over Bayern Munich on Tuesday, and McClaren is full of admiration for the way he has battled back into the side.<br><br>He said: "The reaction from every adversity he's ever gone through in his career, he's always bounced back and been professional and got on with his job. "It's pleasing to see that a month ago he would never play for Real Madrid again and there he is starring in a game against Bayern Munich and being man-of-the-match."<br><br>Reports of Beckham's possible recall follow a poor recent run under McClaren from England, during which they have lost two and drawn two in four matches.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> <span style="color: red;"><span class="large">Owen: Get Becks back, Mac </span></span><br><br>OWEN HARGREAVES reckons anyone who doubts David Beckham can win an England recall is mad. The clamour for Golden Balls to return to his throne is growing thanks to his outstanding form since returning to the Real Madrid side. Beckham has twice saved the neck of under-fire Real coach Fabio Capello. Now he is being touted to spare the blushes of national boss Steve McClaren Â— six months after Sven Goran ErikssonÂ’s successor seemed to end his international career.</strong><br><br>Beckham scored two weeks ago in a 2-1 win over Real Sociedad with Capello knowing defeat would have seen him out of a job. Then, on Tuesday night, Beckham turned in a man-of-the-match display to earn Real a 3-2 Champions League victory over Bayern Munich in the home leg of their last-16 knockout clash.<br><br>England midfielder Hargreaves was in the Bayern side and witnessed at close quarters exactly what Becks still has to offer. Whether McClaren loves Beckham or hates him, with crucial Euro 2008 qualifiers coming up in Israel and Andorra next month, can he afford to ignore him?<br><br>Hargreaves, for one, does not think he can. He has long admired Beckham and credits the former England skipper with making him feel he truly belonged in the national squad when others were doubting him.<br><br>Now it is his turn to repay the compliment. Hargreaves said: Â“If David plays like he did against us then he can play his way back into any team. Â“It was great to see him back again and IÂ’ve always said anyone who writes off Becks is mad. Â“He has such exceptional ability and is an exceptional passer and he showed that again. Â“He was RealÂ’s most influential player against us by a country mile. Every chance seemed to come from his set-pieces or passes.<br><br>Â“Becks completely controlled the flow of the game, especially in the first half. He was the key player basically in all their moves.Â” McClaren had given no indications until this week he was ready to consider recalling Becks. Axeing the national skipper and one-time talisman was his first big mission statement. But can anyone still argue England are better off without Becks?<br><br>Aaron Lennon has failed to grab his chance and it is felt he lacks heart, despite having the pace McClaren requires. McClaren said of BeckhamÂ’s form: Â“It gives me a problem, one of the problems you welcome. HeÂ’s being professional and performing well for his club.<br><br>Â“After every adversity heÂ’s had in his career, heÂ’s always bounced back and been professional and got on with his job. Â“A month ago he was never playing for Real Madrid again yet here he is starring in a game against Bayern Munich and being man of the match.Â”<br><br>Beckham has a crucial few weeks coming up. He is suspended for the weekendÂ’s game against Atletico Madrid but returns to face Getafe the following weekend, Bayern in the return leg Â— and a league trip to Barcelona.<br><br>The icing on the cake will be his return to Old Trafford with a European Select XI for a friendly on March 13. McClaren might just have to swallow his pride and bring the boy back. Beckham said: Â“My ambition has never changed since the age of 13, even younger.<br><br>Â“I always wanted to play for my country and I will always be available whether IÂ’m in Spain for the next four months, or whether IÂ’m in Los Angeles. Â“I will always want to do well for my country.Â”<br><br></div>
