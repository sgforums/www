The England skipper, who has been in negotiations with the club for more than six months, will be paid Â£135,000 a week for the next five years.</strong><br><br>Terry's incredible deal, which was finally approved by Roman Abramovich yesterday afternoon, eclipses the Â£130,000 a week paid to striker Andriy Shevchenko and midfielder Michael Ballack. Defender Terry broke through the Â£100,000-a-week barrier in November 2005, but this latest increase is in line with his status as captain of the national team.<br><br>Chelsea are also in negotiations with Frank Lampard, but the England midfielder has yet to agree similar terms to extend his stay at Stamford Bridge. Terry, 26, said: "I hope the fans can see that we are trying to build something special here and I want to be part of that. I have been at Chelsea all my career and have the privilege of being captain."<br><br>Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon expressed his delight that an agreement had been reached after months of wrangling. "This is an important day for Chelsea," he said. "It was the right deal for us and for John.<br><br>"As a club we are committed to trying to keep our players together on long-term deals, and this was a natural progression from last season when other players also committed for the long term. As captain, John is clearly a key player for Chelsea and also a great symbol of the club, so naturally we are very pleased this has been agreed."<br><br>Terry will lead his team in today's friendly against Rangers at Ibrox, but there are expected to be changes in personnel before the start of the season.<br><br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/07_03/terryDM2807_468x407.jpg"><br>ItÂ’s a deal: Terry signs his new Â£35.1m contract<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Former Blues midfielder and manager John Hollins:<br><br>"What worries me is the others in the team, playing the same number of games - would they settle for Â£80-90,000 now?" asked Hollins on BBC Radio Five Live.<br><br>"John is a Chelsea man through and through and this brings him up to the same pay level to where Shevchenko is.<br><br>"But Petr Czech - would he go on Â£130,000 a week? Would Ricardo Carvalho, who has been a stalwart at the back when John Terry was out?<br><br>"How do you gauge a footballer? Is it because he is an England player?"<br><br>They were allegedly delaying signing new deals because they were unhappy that last season's big summer signings, Andriy Shevchenko and Michael Ballack, were being paid more than them.<br><br>Hollins, 61, who made 455 appearances in two spells with Chelsea as a player, then managed the club between 1985 nd 1988, added: "Now Terry has signed, it is evident they must also get Frank signed or find out what he is going to do.<br><br>"I still think there is doubt there. He wants parity with everybody but the crunch is if he gets Â£130,000 will he sign or will he want more?<br><br>"It's been a long time trying to get this thing nailed down. Once it is done fine, but the longer it goes on there will be interest from other massive clubs who may say, 'OK, we'll pay that.'"</div>
