              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rafa Benitez</span></abbr> remains keen on <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Real Madrid</span></abbr> striker Ruud van Nistelrooy.</p>
              <p>The <em>Sunday Mirror</em> says Van Nistelrooy’s hopes of
              landing a New Year move to Anfield hinge on the Dutchman accepting a
              pay-as-you-play deal instead of the £100,000-a-week after-tax wages he
              earns at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Real Madrid</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>But while <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> believe they can get Real to slash their initial £3million asking price
              for the 33-year-old, they are not willing to match his salary at the
              Bernabeu given his recent injury record.</p>
              <p>Van Nistelrooy’s advisers have touted him around Europe in a bid to safeguard his place in Holland’s World Cup squad.</p>
              <p>An Anfield source said: “There is an interest in Van Nistelrooy,
              but doing a deal will be very difficult unless something changes
              financially.</p>
              <p>“His fitness record is a big worry. There are some reservations
              about bringing in a player who has suffered so much with injuries given
              how the squad has been hit by injuries this season.</p>
              <p>“It would be a gamble, so any deal must offer some value for money otherwise it will not happen.”</p>

              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> Liverpool are set to resurrect their bid for Real Madrid striker Ruud van Nistelrooy by offering the player a pay-as-you-play deal to move to Anfield.<br><br>The
              prolific front-man has suffered a series of injuries in the past year
              that has meant his long-term fitness is a concern for any potential
              buyers.<br><br>However, Reds boss Rafael Benitez remains confident that
              he can secure the 33-year old – but only if the deal suits both club
              and player.<br><br>Van Nistelrooy currently collects over £100,000 a
              week with the La Liga side, and although Liverpool will not match that
              salary, they would be willing to offer the striker a contract based on
              the number of appearance he makes.<br><br><em>The News of the World</em> reports that a source close to the Merseyside club said, “There is a
              definite interest in [Ruud] van Nistelrooy, but doing a deal will be
              very difficult unless the situation changes financially.<br><br>“His
              fitness record is a big worry, and there are reservations regarding
              signing a player who has suffered injuries given the amount of problems
              the squad has suffered this season.”<br><br>Van Nistelrooy spent five
              years in England previously with Manchester United, before completing a
              €24m move to the Bernabeu in the summer of 2006.</span></p>

              <p>The <em>Daily Mail</em> says the former <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> striker, who underwent a successful operation to have his tonsils removed yesterday, is desperate to leave <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Real Madrid</span></abbr> to play regular football and be part of Holland's World Cup squad.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> are reluctant to sign Van Nistelrooy permanently but manager <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rafa Benitez</span></abbr> knows he needs someone to play alongside <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fernando Torres</span></abbr> to rekindle the Reds' season.</p>
              <p>However, the Bernabeu hierarchy are determined to off load the
              33-year-old on a permanent basis and any switch will rely on Benitez
              persuading the Spanish giants to let him have the striker on loan.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Blackburn Rovers</span></abbr> have also shown an interest in Van Nistelrooy but the striker is believed to favour a move to Anfield.</p>

              <p>It depends on whether Ah Ben can guarantee 1st team for him.</p>
              <p>For RVN, he plays a lone striker.</p>

              <p>that's no price for him to pay.</p>
              <p>fans are suffering for the club's doings, players are losing confidence.</p>
              <p>but this freak still have the cheek to say, when i signed a 5yrs contract, i intend to see it out.</p>

              <p>The price he has to pay... Get paid with a $20 million pay day... lol</p>
              <p>And the worst part of it... He will be in another job with some mid table Spanish club earning $2 million a year... and Pool will still be repairing the damaged he has brought upon them... boo... </p>
              <p>Life is certainly rewarding towards Rafa... </p>

              <p>this is tit for tat.</p>
              <p>Because manutd bought owen, so liverpool has to buy RVN to anger the manutd fans.</p>

              <p>The way I see it, I think Rafa is... cutting off his nose to spite his face. </p>
              <p>Why?  Cos he had the chance to sign a 29 yrs old Owen for free on $20k a week as Owen has already said he would have taken a bigger cut to his salary if Pool had came for him. Lots of the former pool and some current players and management wanted him back too but Rafa refused (I strongly believed for personal reasons rather than for the good of the club) and he went to United on a pay as you play deal not amounting to $50k per week despite earning $100k at Newcastle...</p>
              <p>Now he is trying to get a 33 yrs old Ruud at $75k per week? And there is still no telling if Ruud is willing to accept that sum given he has 6 more months to earn $100k a week at Real... And if Real are looking for a permanent deal, (cos his contract with them only left 6 months) then I guess they are looking for a $1 or $2 million token... or at least half a million...</p>
              <p>Why I say Rafa is cutting off his nose to spite his face, its because United have signed Owen so now he wants a former United striker to show the Pool fans... But it looks a silly deal to me. Cos his reason Pool didn't need Owen was because he was injury prone... I am just wondering, is Ruud any less injury prone than Owen? And given his age... 33 coming to 34... probably more easier to get injured and would take longer to recover too... </p>
              <p>Looks a silly deal to me unless he come without a fee and earns no more than $40k per week... </p>
