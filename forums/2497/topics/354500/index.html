              <p><strong>Southampton Leisure Holdings plc, the parent company of Southampton Football Club, has gone into administration.</strong></p>
              <p>At a press conference on Thursday, the Administrators revealed that
              the Championship club could struggle to complete its fixtures this
              season. Specialists Begbies Traynor have been appointed as
              administrators.</p>
              <p>Southampton still owe £24m on their St Mary's Stadium, which opened in 2001, and another £4m to Barclays Bank.</p>
              <p>They
              have three home games remaining, their only realistic source of income,
              which means that after the match against Burnley on April 25 there will
              be no more revenue coming in to service the debt.</p>
              <p>The move into
              administration has caused controversy with the parent company
              officially described as a separate entity to the football club itself,
              which means Saints should avoid the statutory 10-point penalty under
              insolvency rules.</p>
              <p>But despite the insistence that the football club is not affected, the administrators' comments clearly suggest otherwise.</p>
              <p>Derby
              County followed a similar route in 2003 and avoided any points penalty.
              There is no confirmation that Southampton will also avoid a deduction
              but if the Football League are unable to take action it seems likely
              they will again be forced to tighten up their regulations.</p>
              <p>In
              2007 they were forced to act after Leeds United and Boston United
              entered administration in the last week of the season to avoid a
              penalty for the following campaign. As with the Derby example, the
              Football League failed to learn from previous mistakes as Cambridge
              United had pulled the same move years beforehand.</p>
              <p>Should the
              Football League order a ten-point penalty it will not be taken off
              until the end of the season when the club's Championship league
              position would be taken into account. Should it have no bearing on
              their divisional status it would be applied for 2009/10. But should
              they finish outside the bottom three it would result in the club being
              dumped into the relegation zone, though they would start next season in
              League One on a level playing field.</p>
              <p>Dr John Beech, from the
              Centre for the International Business of Sport at Coventry University,
              an expert on insolvency in football, said: "Will they have 10 points
              deducted? That remains to be seen. Football League Regulation 12.3.1b
              states that the ten points will be deducted in cases where a club (my
              emphasis) "have an administration order made in respect of that Club".</p>
              <p>"In
              this case, the club itself hasn't - it's the parent company that has
              gone into Administration. If they decide they cannot impose a 10 points
              deduction because of this, we can expect to see the loophole closed
              shortly, albeit too late to apply it to Southampton.</p>
              <p>"Extending
              the catchment of the Regulations to parent companies may prove
              problematic. For example, in 1992 Birmingham City was brought down by
              the collapse of the BCCI bank, also owned by the Kumar brothers. Few
              would argue that the club should, in similar circumstances, be
              penalised with a points deduction. Deliberate structuring of companies
              to avoid points deductions is another matter however."</p>
              <p>Chief
              executive Rupert Lowe Lowe, chairman Michael Wilde and director Andrew
              Cowen have all resigned from the company with immediate effect,
              although a statement from SLH said the club is "unaffected by these
              insolvency proceedings''.</p>
              <p>In a statement, joint-administrator Mark Fry said: "Southampton Football Club
              has a long history in English football and could be an extremely attractive
              investment for the right buyer.</p>
              <p>"We are working hard to preserve the value of the football club and produce a
              positive outcome for all stakeholders, and I ask that fans continue to show
              their support for the team for the remainder of the season as we seek to show
              the best face possible to potential investors.''</p>
              <p>Saints are currently three points from safety and face rock-bottom Charlton at
              St Mary's on Saturday - and the news that they may not be deducted 10 points is
              unlikely to sit well with the teams around them in the relegation scrap.</p>

              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Southampton have been consigned to relegation to League One after the Football League deducted the Championship club 10 points.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The governing body launched
              an investigation into Saints' finances after their holding company,
              Southampton Leisure Holdings plc, went into administration.</p>
              <p>Southampton argued that because the club itself was not in administration, they should avoid the mandatory points penalty.</p>
              <p>But on Thursday, the League decided that the club and the
              holding company are "inextricably linked as one economic entity", and
              that the 10-point deduction stands.</p>
              <p>As the holding company, chaired by ex-club chairman Rupert
              Lowe, entered administration after the League's March deadline, the
              points deduction will take effect this season should Southampton avoid
              relegation.</p>
              <p>However, if Saints go down anyway - they are currently four
              points adrift with two games remaining - then they will begin next
              season in League One on minus 10 points.</p>
