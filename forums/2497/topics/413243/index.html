              <p>He is clearly not the man to lead liverpool to glory. how many trophies has he won as a manager? he won UEFA cup with Inter when Ronaldo played for them in the late 90s. other than that, what other trophies has he won?</p>
              <p>Liverpool board just dun learn its lessons, disastrous appointments after appointments, first with souness, then with roy evans. what next after hodgson? maybe Keegan.</p>
              <p>You need winners, proven winners like Mourinho or Ancelotti. Rafa was a winner in spain, given he led Valencia to 2 La Liga title and 1 Uefa cup, but his EPL record yielded 2 cups, 1 CL and 1 fa cup.</p>

              <p>HAHAHA, omg what big knee-jerk reactions from you guys. He's a good manager, if not, when he manage fulham, there already would be ''some signs that some of the players have lost faith in him and themselves''. but no, fulham reached the europa league final under him. </p>
              <p>You guys know that when he took charge of sweden, he led the country to a 3rd place ranking in the world?  Plus he took charge of inter milan n led them to 3rd place too, up from their previous positions of 7th n 6th and also reached the final of uefa cup.</p>
              <p>Surely all this would be good eough credentials to manage liverpool which is not a top 4 club anymore, and are languishing at the bottom of the BPL ?</p>
              <p>Last time u all want benitez to go, n some welcome roy, n now aft a few weeks, all wna kp him say he not good, n that benitez was betteR? Why not judge him after a suitable time period? Why place all the blame on him, n not on the players too? I dont see u guys saying torres not good enough for lpool? i dont see u guys saying gerrard shld go?</p>
              <p>im not a lpool fan but seeing u guys whining bout this n that, i feel sad for the club n manager.</p>

              <p>I get the vibes that managers these days are being seen as disposable commodities.</p>
              <p>A run of bad results, and the manager gets the axe. It wasn't like this in the past. Certainly Sir Alex Ferguson would not have survived his early years at Man U if the current trend of sacking managers had occurred then.</p>
              <p>Sure, Hodgson hasn't really been that good with tactics and all, but not all the blame should go to him. Part of the problem comes from the financial and ownership troubles plaguing the club, and part of it comes from the primadonna attitudes of some of the players.</p>
              <p>At the very least, if you kick Hodgson out now, he needs to be given the golden handshake. What are the odds that the money for that will come from the transfer kitty?</p>
              <p>At least give him the rest of the season to prove himself, I say.</p>

              <p>I had my reservations on hodgson when I read he is going to take over liverpool. sure he took fulham to places, but so did mark hughes with blackburn rovers and steve bruce with birmingham and now sunderland.</p>
              <p>I have nothing against Hodgson, but what I am saying is, you need a proven winner to manage top clubs. As for Mancini, he is doing fine at the moment, but whether he will win trophy with Man City is another issue. if he doesnt win anything in 2 years time, time to change a new manager who can.</p>

              <p>Wah if Roy gets the golden handshake this week, he could actually walk away with quite a tidy sum for about 3 and a half months of work...</p>
              <p>I believe the new owner have a time limit to sack him cos it has been revealed that he has a clause in his contract that allow the new owners to send him packing upon their takeover with only a $3m payoff. So, it depends on the time limit of that clause, 3 days, 7, 14 or a month? Cos if they are not confident with him, it could happen very soon</p>
              <p>But for Roy... Well, he may be disappointed but hey, together with his monthly salary and the pay-off, he could earn almost as much with Liverpool in under 4 months than what he would need to at Fulham for 4 years... So still not too bad lah, Can retire early...</p>

              <p>"So far, Hodgson has resembled a formula one driver who, after impressing with his calm handling of a Renault, is asked to race for Ferrari - and not a good Ferrari, but one where the technical crew are demoralised and the car is in no state to live up to its prestigious name."</p>

              <p> That makes Rafa a really damn good driver then...Rafa didn't do that bad after all come to think of it now...</p>

              <p>I guess RH has to tinker his formation..</p>
              <p>most importantly, playing Toress as a lone striker is realli a tough job for him..he realli nids sum1 to play alongside wif him..</p>
              <p>matches after matches, we can clearly see how Pools opponents' tackle on Pools main sources of goals..<br>its simple, man-mark both Torres &amp; Gerrard..<br>and the rest of the 8 players(excluding GK) will be like headless chickens running all over the pitch..</p>
              <p>compared to afew seasons back, when they still have both Alonso &amp; Benayoun(most recently left)..<br>they have more options in terms of creativity..</p>
              <p>lastly, by sacking RH rite away, i guess it will just add more fuel to the fire..<br>as he's consider unlucky to be made the Gaffer when Pool are ardy in a bad shape..<br>i tink he nids more time to prove sumtink he's capable of, hopefully he does..</p>

              <p>I thought the fanboys love takeovers?</p>
              <p>Benefits:</p>
              <p>- More money to buy World Class players</p>
              <p>- Because of the money being pumped, more World Class players ply their trade in the EPL and thus giving the fanboys all the reasons and excuses to boast that the EPL is the best and greatest in the World and bashing other leagues like the Serie A, La Liga, etc..</p>
              <p>- Able to so call dominate ONLY the semi-finals of the European Champions League competition</p>
              <p>Cons:</p>
              <p>- Takeovers sometimes introduce heavy debts.. resulting in something like Liverpool FC fighting relegation due to boardroom struggles, low player morale, lack of funds to remedy poor squad qualition etc... and whatever other reasons the fanboys can come out with. You have enjoyed the benefits of having class players like Torres, now it is time to pay the piper (maybe relegation) ; )</p>
              <p>- In time, more clubs might face similar situation lol</p>
