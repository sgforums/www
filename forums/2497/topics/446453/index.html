              <p><strong>Roberto Mancini insisted he was to blame for Manchester City’s defeat at Everton, claiming that he had both failed to prepare his players properly and also under-estimated David Moyes’s side. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>The Italian’s comments were probably designed to shield his players, who are showing signs that they are feeling the pressure of their title pursuit, but they were still a remarkable admission for a Premier League manager to make.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>“We had a problem because I made mistakes,” said Mancini. “It was a bad night for me. We didn’t deserve to lose, but I made a mistake as we did not prepare properly for this game.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>“It is important I learn from this because I cannot make the same mistakes in the next game. I thought maybe it was going to be easier than it was, and it is never easy this game.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>“It is impossible to always do well, but we did not prepare well in training in the last three or four days.</p>
              <p>“We played well against Tottenham and we’ve won the last three games in the Premier League, Everton were without some important players, we made a mistake. I did not prepare us for the pressure that we would be put under tonight.</p>
              <p>“We are still top of the table and we have 15 games [left]. It is important now that we win the game at home next weekend.”</p>
              <p>With the transfer window now shut, Everton’s win has thrown the title race wide open and it was ironically, and almost inevitably, secured by former Manchester United midfielder Darron Gibson’s first goal for the Merseyside club.</p>
              <p>Gibson was an early January mover after finding his first team opportunities limited at United, but the midfielder’s popularity at Old Trafford has never been higher after his second-half strike condemned City to only their third league defeat of the season.</p>
              <p>Given a standing ovation when he left the Goodison Park pitch, the midfielder’s name also rang out at his former home. A rare feat for anyone, let alone a player who had his fair share of critics towards the end of his time at United.</p>

              <p><span><strong>Rio Ferdinand has promised former team-mate Darron Gibson a free meal at his Manchester restaurant following the Everton midfielder's match-winning performance against Premier League leaders City on Tuesday night. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Republic of Ireland international Gibson smashed home the only goal of the game - and his first for the club - as Everton downed Roberto Mancini's side at Goodison Park.</span></p>
              <p><span>Wayne Rooney was first to congratulate Gibson, who moved to Everton for a cut-price fee after 60 appearances under Sir Alex Ferguson, when he wrote on Twitter: 'Yeeeeeeesssssssss gibbo. Love u kid.'</span></p>
              <p><span>And that was followed up by Ferdinand, who this morning added: 'Just organising a FREE meal at my restaurant @RossoRestaurant for Darron Gibson!!'</span></p>
              <p><span>City's defeat, coupled with United's win at home over Stoke, meant the defending champions moved level on points with their rivals. </span></p>
