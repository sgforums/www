              <p><strong>Real Madrid and Barcelona </strong></p>
              <p><strong>3 May 2011</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Time : 2:45 am <span style="color: #ff0000;">(Live)</span> Mio 102 / 110</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>The war of words between Real Madrid and Barcelona has intensified after Sergio Busquets was accused of calling Marcelo a 'monkey'.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">In a video posted by the club's in-house TV station the footage shows the Barca midfielder confronting the Brazilian during the Champions League semi-final first leg clash at the Bernabeu, allegedly taunting the full-back saying 'mono, mono', which translates in Spanish as 'monkey'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">It is the latest in a long-line of controversies to come after the storm that followed Barcelona's 2-0 win last Wednesday ahead of tomorrow's crunch second leg clash at the Nou Camp.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Both clubs face a series of charges from UEFA following their hate-fuelled European encounter that will be answered on Friday.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Real boss Jose Mourinho faces an extended touchline ban for his sending-off during the second half of last Wednesday’s game at the Bernabeu and post-match comments which he bitterly implied there was a conspiracy to help Barca get through.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Mourinho's anger stemmed from the decision of German referee Wolfgang Stark to send off Pepe for a foul on Dani Alves on the hour mark, with the former Chelsea boss being sent to the stands too for his protests.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He said: 'Why do the opponents of Barcelona always have a man sent off? Where does this power come from? Maybe it is to give more publicity to UNICEF, maybe because of the power of (Spanish federation president Jose Angel) Villar in UEFA.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The outburst prompted a furious reaction from Barcelona who threatened legal action against the former Chelsea boss.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Assistant coach and former Madrid defender Aitor Karanka will speak to the media, the club announced on their website, and is set to face questions of this latest serious accusation.</span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">In the video, which analyses Mourinho's disputed appointment of Belgian referee Frank De Bleeckere, Busquets is also accused of diving, as well as his alleged racist remarks aimed at Marcelo.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="artSplitter"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/05/02/article-1382702-0BDF593100000578-916_634x429.jpg" alt="Ready for another battle: Jose Mourinho with Iker Casillas in training" width="634" height="429"></span>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>The translation of the Real Madrid TV narrator's preview reads: 'His last chapter was marked by controversy. This collegiate experience came to Barcelona as a seal of approval and fell, one in the list, with the theater that has become a specialist, Sergio Busquets.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'We have to rely on for this match at the Camp Nou, in the eyes of world football, not again fall into the trap of unsportsmanlike actions of some Barcelona players as those seen at the Bernabeu.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'And that does not allow contempt for the opposition and by flag bearing the UEFA basic principles: respect and fair play.'<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Barcelona are yet to respond but will no doubt react with further anger towards their bitter <span style="font-style: italic;">clasico </span>rivals.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Meanwhile, UEFA has rejected both complaints lodged by Real Madrid and the one complaint made by Barcelona after Wednesday's match.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="clear"></div>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Madrid announced that they were reporting Barca for 'unsportsmanlike behaviour' and soon after Barca confirmed they were reporting Mourinho for his post-match comments.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">A UEFA statement read: 'UEFA has announced today that the vice-chairman of the UEFA control and disciplinary body, as a judge sitting alone, has rejected both the protests lodged by Real Madrid CF and the complaint made by FC Barcelona following the UEFA Champions League semi-final first leg between the two clubs last Wednesday.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'The protests lodged by Madrid, against the behaviour of the Barcelona players during the match and against the red card shown to Pepe, are rejected.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'In the case of the behaviour of the Barcelona players, it was deemed that there was no common strategy to provoke, while in the case of Pepe, the referee's factual decision is upheld. As a result, Pepe is suspended for the second leg on Tuesday.'<br></span></p>

              <p class="headline"><strong>Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola has leapt to the defence of his players ahead of the Champions League semi-final clash with Real Madrid, claiming they are examples of professionalism.</strong></p>
              <p class="headline">Dani Alves, Pedro and Sergio Busquets were all accused of unsporting conduct by Madrid in a fiesty first leg at the Bernabeu, while the latter is reported to have racially abused Real full-back Marcelo.</p>
              <p class="headline">However, UEFA decided against taking additional action against both clubs - deciding to <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/912886/barcelona-and-real-madrid-face-uefa-action?cc=5739"><span style="color: #225fb2;">stick with the original list of charges</span></a> - and also threw out the extra accusations made by the Catalan club against Madrid coach Jose Mourinho.</p>
              <p class="headline">Guardiola, though, took the chance to hail his players' attributes and said: ''I know my players very well and they are an example of professionalism and honesty. They can all make mistakes during the game, but they are exemplary human beings and in any case, the actions from the past are just that - in the past.''</p>
              <p class="headline">Barcelona midfielder Xavi also hit out at Madrid's protests to UEFA.</p>
              <p class="headline">''The complaint from Real Madrid was a disgrace and it's logical UEFA have rejected it,'' he said. ''We have hardly talked about football at all and that makes me sad.''</p>
              <p class="headline">Tensions have grown on and off the pitch over the last 17 days, but Tuesday's game will conclude the four-match <em>El Clasico </em>series, which began on April 16 with a 1-1 draw in the Primera Division. ''I'm happy it's all over,'' Guardiola added.</p>
              <p class="headline">Back on the pitch, Barca will be big favourites to reach the final after winning the first leg 2-0, but Madrid striker Karim Benzema believes Real can produce an upset.</p>
              <p class="headline">"We will attack to score goals," he told Madrid's official website. "I will do so too. We need goals, so we will look for them."</p>
              <p class="headline">"I hope we win here and reach the final. Many things can happen in 90 minutes of football and I hope we win the game. Nothing is set in stone in football and we can end up winning the tie. We will have to defend well in order to score goals. It's important to keep a clean sheet."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo believes Barcelona were given 'outside help' in their Champions League semi-final clash with Real Madrid, suggesting the Catalan club be handed the trophy next season to save hassle.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Portuguese forward was incensed by the performance of the referee during the clash at Camp Nou - which was drawn 1-1 to send Barca through - and backed up his manager Jose Mourinho's claims of a conspiracy in favour of their rivals. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Ronaldo said: 'Barcelona are a difficult team to beat because they get outside help. Next year they should give the cup directly to them.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Real's main gripe concerned Gonzalo Higuain's disallowed goal just minutes after half-time. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Ronaldo accidentally tripped up Javier Mascherano in the lead-up play, although the world's most expensive player appeared to have himself been tripped by a home defender to initiate the contact.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="artSplitter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/05/03/article-0-0BE4E73F00000578-655_634x385.jpg" alt="Denied: Gonzalo Higuain (left) finds the net for Real Madrid but his strike was ruled out" width="634" height="385"></div>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>He added: 'We knew we could beat Barca, but the referee didn't let us. Once again it was the referee that didn't allow us to dictate the outcome.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'The referee in the first match (Wolfgang Stark) took away our chances of playing the final. Whoever knows anything about football knows that Barcelona get preferential treatment.   </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Higuain's goal was good. (Gerard) Pique pushed me and I landed on Mascherano. He didn't used to fall to the ground in England, but he's picked up the bad habit of doing it here like everyone else.'  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Ronaldo pointed to the domestic Cup win, the second of four 'Clasicos' between the clubs in three competitions in 18 days, as evidence that Real were capable of beating Barca when the officials were neutral.    </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Barcelona have a lot of power off the pitch,' he said. 'There are no differences between the teams as was seen throughout the four matches.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Spanish World Cup winner Xabi Alonso was equally dumbfounded at the decision: 'When we scored the first goal it would have been totally different and we feel so many bad decisions have been made against us and we are not happy about that,' he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'We think we did a good job but decisions went against us, we really feel that way.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'It would have changed everything, our position would have been much stronger and after that it was much more difficult,' he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Madrid later released a video on their television station highlighting what they believed to be the injustice of the disallowed goal. <br></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Minutes later Pedro converted a fantastic ball from Andres Iniesta before Marcelo levelled on the night for Madrid.</strong></span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Assistant coach Aitor Karanka, who was in the dugout due to Jose Mourinho's suspension, claimed the performance of the officials proved his side had no chance of making it through to the Champions League final.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'(Jose) Mourinho was right,' Karanka said. 'He said that it would be impossible for us to go through. Tonight proved that it was impossible and 100 million people saw it - there is nothing more to add.'</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who kept his side in the game with a string of fine saves in the first half, was also frustrated at the decision to disallow Higuain's strike.</span></p>
              <div class="artSplitter"><span style="font-size: x-small;">'It has happened again - just like always,' he said after the game. 'Playing 11 against 11 we have shown we can compete without complexes and it takes me back to the first game; if we had finished 0-0 (the score before Pepe was sent off), tonight's 1-1 would have taken us through to the final.'</span></div>
              <div class="artSplitter"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola did not agree with the opinions on the refereeing of both legs, insisting it was not the main talking point.</span></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I don't have time for that, it has been a tough 20 days and we have played the richest team in the world many times, the referee may have had an influence but we were very good in the second match,' he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Guardiola also said he was happy to be returning to the venue where the club won their first European Cup 19 years ago.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Football is coming home so it an honour to play at Wembley,' he said.</span> <span style="font-size: x-small;">'We won our first Champions League in 1992 at the old Wembley and we are ever so proud for our club and players.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The 40-year-old Barca manager thinks Manchester United will progress against Schalke to set up a repeat of the 2009 final which his side won 2-0, but he believes that would have no bearing on any potential rematch.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I suppose it will be Manchester [in the final], it was two years ago and I think Sir Alex Ferguson will always be there so for us it is an honour and for me as a young coach it is an honour to arrive at the final and play them,' he said.</span></p>

              <p>I always think Barca are a great team, but after watching their latest win over Real, my opinion of them totally changed.</p>
              <p>Yes, teams dived to get the fouls, but this Barca team is way over the top. The whole team seems trained to be a pro actor on the field.</p>
              <p>To many, barca play beautiful football, i was one of the believer that they are the greatest team at the moment. Now.... i simply think they are a diving team, worst than any other teams that has players that dives.</p>

              <p>no offense to any.</p>
              <p>I think RM's frustration boils over from the La Liga pursuits where they see barca sailing away.</p>
              <p>Yes, barca has their fair share of 'simulations', but RM may have their fair share too.</p>
              <p>to be fair, when both sides play real football, we got a treat in the 5-0 drubbing right? but when RM tries to play the hack and counter, they got a cup, but loses in the UCL.</p>
              <p>yes, it may be puzzling that RM seems to be playing 10man vs 11, but if one team sets out to tackle harder, and be more physical, maybe, the writing on the walls, wouldn't you say?</p>
              <p>anyway, the UCL finals is between MU and Barca at wembley. MU got a spanking and footballing lesson last time, maybe, this time, we get to see some good football.</p>

              <p>Watch the 2003 UEFA cup final between Mourinho's Porto and O'Neill's Celtic and you will see some diving masterclass. Watch the 2004 UCL semi-final between Mourinho's Porto and Man Utd and you will see diving masterclass upped to the next echelon. Watch Chelsea's Drogba when Mourinho first took over and you see a big and strong striker suddenly going weak in the opposing box. Well, not forgetting Ronaldo's play acting when he was in the EPL lol.</p>
              <p>So....I guess there's such a thing called Karma hahaha.</p>
