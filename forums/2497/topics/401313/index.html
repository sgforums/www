              <h1>Rafa Benitez is out: Spaniard to quit Liverpool with a £4m pay-off</h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Rafael Benitez will leave Liverpool today after the club's board made
               it clear he was no longer wanted as manager.</p>
              <p>The Anfield 
              hierarchy has blinked first in the Mexican stand-off by offering their 
              50-year-old manager a compromise compensation deal to quit the club.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/02/article-1283538-07E195DC000005DC-823_468x396.jpg" alt="He's off: Rafa Benitez" width="468" height="396">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>He's off: Benitez's relationship with the 
              Anfield hierarchy has grown increasingly uncomfortable </em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The offer was made in a conference 
              call to Benitez, who is in Sardinia. It is 
              believed Sammy Lee has been put in 
              temporary charge of team matters.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Spaniard believed for some time 
              he had the whip hand in his dealings 
              with the board, but the negotiations 
              about his future became a vicious 
              circle - although he did not realise 
              just how vicious it was to become.</p>
              <p>In a vote of no confidence, the 
              Liverpool board approved a proposal 
              which would see Benitez depart with 
              a lucrative pay-off worth in the region 
              of £4million.</p>
              <p>Liverpool, ultimately, have decided 
              it is time to move on and progress. 
              The Dallas-style soap opera that has 
              blighted the famous club's name over 
              recent months had to stop and 
              Benitez will be the cast member to 
              depart.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Centre of attention: Roy Hodgson has impressed 
              at Fulham</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>That was inevitable after a disastrous 
              season in which Liverpool finished 
              seventh in the Barclays Premier 
              League and Benitez blamed a dwindling 
              transfer budget for his squad's 
              inane performance.</p>
              <p>That did not sit well with owners 
              Tom Hicks and George Gillett, who, despite declaring their intention to 
              sell the club, knew action had to be taken swiftly for the Anfield 
              outfit to move forward or risk implosion. With every penny counting, 
              doing nothing was too big a risk to take.</p>

              <p style="font-weight: bold;">5.December 2009 - Humiliated as his side are
               knocked out of the Champions League in the group stages.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Benitez has spent more than £220m on more than 70 players in his 
              colourful six years at Anfield.</p>
              <p>Yet, as Sportsmail revealed last 
              week, his budget was severely restricted and he wanted written 
              assurances from the club's board that money from every player sold could
               be re-directed into the coffers enabling him the funds to bring in new 
              ones.</p>
              <p>Confidence in his ability to wheel and deal, particularly 
              on the back of last season's £17million acquisition of Alberto Aquilani,
               was evidently not there.</p>
              <p>Instead Benitez was allowed to grow 
              increasingly frustrated. Despiteoffers for his players he did not want 
              to sell for fear of his squad being further weakened.</p>
              <p>Had Benitez
               received the guarantees he had been looking for during talks with 
              chairman Martin Broughton then the current situation would not have 
              arisen but with both parties unable to envisage a way of working 
              together a parting of the ways was and is inevitable.</p>
              <p>When 
              Juventus came knocking, Liverpool believed an easy exit was apparent for
               the Spaniard but he did not have enough faith in the Juventus project 
              and harboured hopes that Liverpool's fortunes would change with new 
              ownership.</p>
              <p>However, with annual losses of £55m, debts totalling 
              £351m and the club out of the Champions League, Liverpool is not an easy
               or, more importantly quick, sell.</p>
              <p>Benitez was always going to 
              find it 
              difficult after winning the Champions 
              League famously in his first season as 
              that dramatic Istanbul victory over 
              AC Milan raised the roof on expectation. 
              He and his wife Montse have 
              fallen in love with the area and 
              embraced the history of the club.</p>

              <p>When the Kop sang You'll Never Walk 
              Alone to him they meant it and he 
              reciprocated. He danced with them 
              and drank with them establishing 
              himself as a man of the people but, 
              ultimately, the team's demise has 
              even weakened that bond. 
              While he enjoys the majority of support, 
              some fans have brought his credentials 
              into question this season.</p>
              <p>Transfers, team selection and substitutions 
              have all raised eyebrows - even 
              among the stars of his team. 
              The Americans will always take the 
              brunt of the blame but now Benitez 
              will be forced to walk away and into 
              the arms of Inter Milan.</p>
              <p>Following in the footsteps of his 
              great adversary Jose Mourinho will 
              not be easy but already the Inter fans 
              are calling for the man 'who stole the 
              Champions League away from Milan'. 
              That one night in Istanbul could yet 
              serve Benitez well.</p>

              <h2><span style="color: #e01c44;">MARK HUGHES (22-1)</span><br></h2>
              <p>Took
               over at Blackburn in 2004 after a stint in charge of Wales and changed 
              the fortunes of the Lancashire club, qualifying for the UEFA Cup for two
               seasons. Left Ewood Park in June 2008 and replaced Sven Goran Eriksson 
              at Manchester City.</p>
              <p>When Abu Dhabi investors took over the 
              club he broke the British transfer record to sign Robinho for £32.5m 
              from Real Madrid, but was sacked last December after a series of draws 
              in the Barclays Premier League.</p>
              <h2><span style="color: #e01c44;">ROY HODGSON (4-1)</span><br></h2>
              <p>Another with an impressive 
              managerial c.v. at club and international levels. His latest achievement
               has been to work wonders at Fulham, taking them to the final of the 
              Europa League - their first European final - for which he was voted the 
              LMA Manager of the Year for 2010.</p>

              <h2 style="color: #e01c44;">GUUS HIDDINK (3-1)</h2>
              <p>The 
              former temporary manager of Chelsea is scheduled to take over as coach 
              of Turkey from August 1.</p>
              <p>Has huge managerial experience at 
              club level (including PSV Eindhoven and Real Madrid) and in the 
              international game (Netherlands, South Korea, Australia and Russia).</p>
              <p>Won
               the 2009 FA Cup for Chelsea after replacing Luiz Felipe Scolari and 
              fans wanted him to stay.</p>
              <h2 style="color: #e01c44;">MARTIN
               O’NEILL (6-4)</h2>
              <p>The bookies’ firm favourite has resolved his 
              differences with Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner after months of 
              disagreements. Made his managerial name at Leicester and took Celtic to 
              the 2003 UEFA Cup final, where they lost to Jose Mourinho’s Porto. Took 
              Villa — a team full of English players — to the League Cup final in 
              February but lost to Manchester United.</p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Other odds from Skybet: 13-8 Martin O'Neill.

              <h1>Inter Milan want Steven Gerrard, Fernando Torres and Javier 
              Mascherano to follow Rafa Benitez to the San Siro</h1>

              <p>Inter Milan will look into moves for Liverpool's star trio Fernando 
              Torres, Steven Gerrard and Javier Mascherano as they close in on 
              appointing Rafa Benitez as their next manager.</p>
              <p>After Fabio 
              Capello's decision to decisively commit to the England job for another 
              two years, Inter have made it their primary objective to install Benitez
               as Jose Mourinho's successor.</p>
              <p>The Spaniard is set to leave 
              Anfield after being offered a £4million pay-off and a quick return to 
              the game with the European champions could suit everyone concerned.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Inter  director Lele Oriali told Il Corriere dello Sport.: 'To
              Interisti he gave a great joy: the Champions League win in 2005 against
              Milan. He has a certain affinity with the Nerazzurri.</p>
              <p>'But the 
              choice will be made by our president [Massimo Moratti]. He will listen 
              to his staff and then the last word is his.</p>

              <p>'As for the team, they are convinced of their qualities and
              strength. They are a winning team. Whoever comes to Inter will not
              upset everything.'</p>
              <p>Inter will also test Liverpool's vulnerability 
              to offers for their players.</p>
              <p>Respected Italian newspaper La 
              Gazzetta dello Sport reports that Benitez particularly wants to take 
              Mascherano with him.</p>
              <p>The Argentina captain had been ready to 
              commit his future to Liverpool
               but recently shelved talks about a new contract and is also being 
              targeted by Chelsea and
               Barcelona.</p>
              <p>A deal for Gerrard could be a non-starter, given 
              the Liverpool captain's fractious relationship with Benitez, and Real 
              Madrid are also pushing hard for him.</p>
              <p>Torres has a closer 
              bond with Benitez, though Liverpool would resist a deal for their 
              talismanic striker.</p>
              <p>The Spain hot shot has repeatedly 
              insisted he is happy on Merseyside, while regularly adding the caveat 
              that the team must be improved.</p>

              <p>Chelsea are also interested in the former Atletico Madrid and could 
              offer as much as £70million.</p>
              <p>Inter may be able to compete at 
              that level if they sell Diego Milito or Samuel Eto'o to Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile,
               axed Real Madrid boss Manuel Pellegrini could be a contender to replace
               Benitez at Anfield.</p>
              <p>The Chilean is understood to be keen on 
              working in the Barclays Premier League and is already said to have 
              offers from England, Turkey and Italy.</p>
              <p>Liverpool would, 
              however, struggle to land Guus Hiddink. The Dutchman was interested in 
              the post in the winter when his days as Russia boss were coming to an 
              end, but he has since signed a contract with Turkey through to Euro 
              2012, which has a further two-year option.</p>
              <p>Sources indicate 
              he will not ask to break his contract and any deal would rest on 
              Liverpool agreeing a pricey deal with the Turkish FA.</p>
              <p>Hiddink
               had also been considered by Inter, but a move was not encouraged and it
               is hard to see the 63-year-old turning down the European champions 
              while welcoming a move to the difficult environment of Liverpool.</p>

              <p>Benitez is finalising severance pay with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> today after the board chose to end his

              <p>The Spaniard is currently in Italy, in Sardinia, and could immediately 
              travel to Milan to finalise terms with Inter - which are willing to 
              double his previous £4 million-a-year Reds contract.</p>
              <p>Oriali said this morning: "We really like Benitez and think he is the

              <p>• <strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=792569&amp;sec=england&amp;cc=4716">Reina rues Rafa news</a></strong><br> • <strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=792442&amp;sec=england&amp;root=england&amp;cc=4716">Jolly: An inevitable departure</a></strong><br> • <strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=28">Manager profile: Rafael Benitez</a></strong></p>
              <p>Benitez, who took over from Gerard Houllier in 2004, found his position
              untenable after a disappointing season which saw Liverpool finish
              seventh in the Premier League, just 12 months after being runners-up to
              Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Rafael Benitez told the club's official website: "It is very sad for me
              to announce that I will no longer be manager of Liverpool FC. I would
              like to thank all of the staff and players for their efforts.</p>
              <p>"I'll always keep in my heart the good times I've had here, the strong
              and loyal support of the fans in the tough times and the love from
              Liverpool. I have no words to thank you enough for all these years and
              I am very proud to say that I was your manager.</p>
              <p>"Thank you so much once more and always remember: You'll never walk alone."</p>
              <p>After a poor start to the campaign, which included an exit from the
              Champions League in the group stage, Benitez guaranteed he would
              qualify for the competition in 2010-11. But Benitez failed to deliver
              on that guarantee and only booked a place in the Europa League due to
              Portsmouth's perilous financial state, with Liverpool losing 19 matches
              in all competitions.</p>
              <p>Failure to qualify for Europe's elite competition has ramifications for
              Liverpool's own finances, leading to speculation that star names such
              as <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/7935">Steven Gerrard</a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/24257">Fernando Torres</a> could be sold off to balance the books.</p>

              <p>News of the 50-year-old's impending exit broke on Wednesday evening
              with talks underway to agree a compensation package. It is thought
              Benitez will receive a £6 million pay-off.</p>
              <p>The Liverpool board feels that the club needs a new direction to stand any chance of finishing in the top four next season.</p>
              <p>Liverpool released the following statement: "Liverpool FC today
              confirmed that Rafael Benitez is to leave the club by mutual consent.
              Mr Benitez relinquishes his position as team manager after six years
              and the board of directors would like to place on record their grateful

              <p>Liverpool chairman Martin Broughton said: "Rafa will forever be part of

              the epic final in Istanbul but after a disappointing season both
              parties felt a fresh start would be best for all concerned.''</p>
              <p>Benitez, who won the Champions League with Liverpool in 2005 and also
              reached the final 2007, is now the favourite to take over at Inter
              Milan following Jose Mourinho's exit for Real Madrid and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=53">Fabio Capello</a>'s decision to stay with England.</p>
              <p>"We really like Rafa Benitez and he is in our favour since the
              Champions League final in Istanbul [when Liverpool beat rivals AC Milan
              in 2005]," Inter director Gabriele Oriali told <em>Corriere dello Sport</em>.</p>

              <h1>King Kenny: Dalglish brought in to lure Roy Hodgson or Martin

              </div>
              <p>Anfield legend Kenny Dalglish will spearhead the search for 
              Liverpool’s new manager after Rafa Benitez’s six-year reign finally 
              ended on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Fulham boss Roy Hodgson and Aston Villa’s 
              Martin O’Neill top the list of targets but Dalglish is understood to be 
              interested in taking over himself at the club where he enjoys iconic 
              status.</p>
              <p>Dalglish readily accepted the role of kingmaker, in 
              conjunction with managing director Christian Purslow, after Benitez was 
              sent packing with a pay-off in excess of £4million.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Kingmaker: Kenny Dalglish will have a huge say 
              on the identity of Liverpool's next boss - the Scot himself could could 
              make a sensational return to Anfield</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Last night he was urged to take control of the crisis club by former 
              Liverpool stars and fans. Phil Thompson, who was hired by Dalglish in 
              1986 as Liverpool’s reserve team coach, said. ‘I can see the logic in a 
              Dalglish appointment – until there are new owners.</p>
              <p>‘Of course I
               would support Kenny. He was a good team-mate, a good manager. He won 
              the title with Blackburn Rovers. He’s still very passionate about 
              football. So I can see where that would fit in.’</p>
              <p>After a 
              troubled end to the Benitez era, marked by rows with his Anfield bosses 
              and a worsening relationship with key senior players, Liverpool are 
              eager to restore order and stability behind the scenes.</p>
              <p>They 
              want an established, experienced coach, with an understanding of Europe 
              and ability to cope with pressure, and believe Hodgson fits the bill on 
              all fronts. </p>

              </div>
              <p>While an approach has yet to be made, Liverpool have been heartened 
              by an early indication that Hodgson, 62, would welcome a move to Anfield
               and, unlike Benitez, would not need substantial transfer funds to 
              revive their fortunes next season.</p>
              <p>Benitez dismissed as 
              inadequate a summer budget of no more than £15m, but Fulham boss Hodgson
               would back himself to get the best out of players already at his<br>disposal.</p>
              <p>The former Inter Milan coach has transformed Fulham from 
              relegation strugglers to European trailblazers and has a track record

              <p>Hodgson
               is on a 12-month rolling contract with the London club, and

              jump at the chance of restoring Liverpool’s tarnished reputation after 
              becoming increasingly concerned by dwindling transfer funds at Aston 
              Villa.</p>
              <p>The Villa manager has tried to find some common ground
               with American owner Randy Lerner over the level of investment needed 
              but he might be easily prised away<br>from the club.</p>
              <p>Former 
              Manchester City manager Mark Hughes is another who will feature on the 
              shortlist, while Galatasaray’s Frank Rijkaard, Turkey coach Guus Hiddink
               and Bayern Munich’s Louis van Gaal head the likely list of foreign 
              candidates.</p>

              <p>But former Liverpool stars Thompson and Mark Lawrenson believe 
              Dalglish could also fill the role himself.</p>
              <p>Thompson, who was 
              speaking at the Standard Chartered ‘Beat the Goalie’ competition in 
              London, raising money to treat the blind or partially sighted, added<br>that
               the appointment of Dalglish could persuade star players Steven Gerrard,
               Fernando Torres and Javier Mascherano to stay at the club.</p>
              <p>‘I
               want Steven Gerrard and Torres to stay at Liverpool FC. And Mascherano,
               too. Because that is going to make my football team stronger,’ he said</p>
              <p>‘You’re
               looking at Kenny Dalglish, who is steeped in Liverpool tradition. I can
               see where the Kenny thing would fit in with people. It is probably a 
              step in the right direction at this present moment.’</p>
              <p>Football
               pundit Lawrenson, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, added: ‘I would have<br>thought
               Kenny would be heavily involved and quite rightly so — maybe not just 
              in choosing the manager but holding the fort in the meantime.’ </p>

              <p>Benitez’s lawyers finally agreed a severance package worth an initial
               £4m after two days of negotiations with their Liverpool counterparts.</p>
              <p>It
               will rise to over £6m should he remain out of work beyond this summer, 
              but that appears unlikely after Inter Milan again went public on their 
              intention to recruit him as Jose Mourinho’s successor at the San Siro.</p>
              <p>Liverpool
               chairman Martin Broughton confirmed that Benitez’s departure was 
              initiated by the Anfield board.</p>
              <p>He said: ‘Rafa will forever 
              be part of Liverpool folklore after bringing home the Champions League 
              following the epic final in Istanbul, but after a disappointing season, 
              both parties felt a fresh start would be best for all concerned.’</p>
              <p>Support
               for Benitez, 50, was beginning to waver in the stands, as well as the 
              boardroom, but he sent an emotional farewell message to supporters.</p>
              <p>He
               said: ‘It is very sad for me to announce that I will no longer be 
              manager of Liverpool FC. I would like to thank all of the staff and 
              players for their efforts. </p>

               Milan yesterday released a statement, saying: ‘We are not behind the 
              story involving Benitez and Liverpool, but we are following it with 
              interest.</p>
              <p>‘If he becomes free of his obligations to Liverpool
