              <p>Carlo Ancelotti has claimed that if <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chelsea"><span style="color: #005689;">Chelsea</span></a> fail to claim a trophy this year he can still consider the season a success despite two of his predecessors, Avram Grant and Luiz Felipe Scolari, receiving the sack for being unable to provide a winning team.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's new head coach takes his side to Wembley this afternoon to face Manchester United in the Community Shield, a match Ancelotti wants to win to establish immediately the correct tone for his tenure at the club.</p>
              <p>Yet while the Italian, who has never played or coached at the national stadium, has been hired by Roman Abramovich to bring the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span></a> or Champions League trophy to Stamford Bridge, he is adamant that he will not be measured by silverware.</p>
              <p>Asked what would be his own gauge of the team's accomplishments at the close of his first year in charge, Ancelotti said: "To win a trophy, to do the best I possibly can." But pressed if no trophy by next May would equate to a failed season he said: "No, this is not my [measure] – for the season is not all important to win, it is important that Chelsea do the maximum of the team's possibilities."</p>
              <p>And the 50-year-old was unconcerned when it was suggested to him that if head coaches fail to not win anything at Chelsea then it generally means they are told "Goodbye". With a smile Ancelotti replied: "Goodbye? No problem. I am here to stay, I want to win, and to start on Sunday."</p>
              <p>Ancelotti, who won a single <em>Serie A</em> title during eight seasons in charge of Milan, believes the Premier League will be more difficult to win. "For sure. It's a very competitive championship, there are a lot of great teams that can win it," he said.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti also believes that despite the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez from Old Trafford, Manchester United will still be the same force. "The [quality] of the team is not any one player but their teamwork. United remain a great team without Ronaldo." When it was suggested that any team would miss the World and European player of the year, he replied: "I don't know because I think there remains very good players there – Giggs, Scholes, Rooney, Berbatov. They are all great players."</p>
