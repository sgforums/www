              <p><strong>Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini has set his sights on the Barclays Premier League title next season after insisting the club will win trophies under his leadership.</strong></p>
              <p>The Italian has already been publicly backed by owner Sheikh Mansoor bin Zayed Al Nahyan despite missing out on qualifying for the Champions League this season.</p>
              <p>City finished fifth, 19 points behind champions Chelsea, but Mancini is not deterred by that statistic as he targets a title challenge next season.</p>
              <p>And he stressed it was a matter of "when" and not "if" the club won trophies.</p>
              <p>"I want to win a lot of trophies with this club. We did okay this season but next season I want us to aim to win the Premier League," said Mancini.</p>
              <p>"It makes me more determined than ever to bring them success - when we win our first trophy it will be a very good moment for everyone."</p>
              <p>The former Inter Milan boss, who won three Serie A titles and two Italian cups, said a change of mindset was needed within the squad.</p>
              <p>"I think the most important thing I try to instil in my players is that they must always believe that they can win - we need a winning mentality at this club because eventually, it pays off," he told mcfc.co.uk</p>
              <p>"It doesn't happen overnight and can take maybe six or eight months to really be absorbed, but if you are prepared to work hard every game, you will always have a chance of being successful.</p>
              <p>"It's a simple observation, but very true - you can't win anything without working hard."</p>

              <p>Get more quality players - but w/o UCL next season, ( not many of these World Class players will come and play ) - the only motivation is $$$$.  And everybody knows that $$$ will not buy instant success...  ( Look at Real, breaks the bank.. achieved 0 cup/title )</p>
              <p>Man City will be a Premier League contender for sure for 2010/2011 season, could  also breaks into Top 4, but with the current crops of players, it is a Tall Order to achieve Premiership Title.</p>
              <p>Every managers aimed for the Title.. so did Rafa in 2009/2010... </p>
              <p>Top 4 is the most ideal.</p>
