            <div class='col-md body'>Ferguson hints a double swoop<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson could bring in two new players during the transfer window.<br><br>But the Manchester United manager insists he has no intention of raising funds by selling Cristiano Ronaldo.<br><br>Bayern Munich's England midfielder Owen Hargreaves is known to be target but Ferguson refuses to go into specifics about possible transfer dealings.<br><br>Ferguson explained: 'We may sign someone in January, there may be a couple of signings, who knows? We are looking at some things.<br><br>'But we have the squad to handle it (all competitions).'<br><br>Portugal winger Ronaldo has again been linked with a move to Real Madrid but Ferguson said: 'There has not been an offer.<br><br>'It is not worth talking about anyway. It is not an issue for us.'<br><br>Former Barcelona and Celtic striker Henrik Larsson is one new recruit and set to make his debut against Aston Villa in the FA Cup on Sunday after arriving on loan from Helsingborg.<br><br>Ferguson is debating whether to partner the Swede with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer up front as Louis Saha is sidelined with a groin strain.<br><br>The Old Trafford boss said: 'Both players will be involved - I have to decide whether to start with both or just one of them.<br><br>'Like Ole, Henrik is a good finisher. They are both experienced and they can use that knowledge.<br><br>'Certainly their positional play in the penalty box is the great strength of both of them.'<br><br>Ferguson has been delighted with the way the veteran forward has applied himself since arriving.<br><br>'Larsson's performances in training have been very good, ' he said.<br><br>'I have been very pleased. He is very sharp.<br><br>'He is a man who looks after himself and I have been an admirer of him for many years.<br><br>'On two or three occasions I thought I had him. But he was always happy at Celtic and that was a problem for us.<br><br>'It was understandable he did not want to move as he was settled there.'<br><br>Former West Brom goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak will make his fourth appearance of the season in the third round, replacing Edwin Van der Sar, who is rested.<br><br>Ferguson said 'Tomasz has been excellent. In terms of a match situation he has played only three games but his performances in training have been absolutely superb.<br><br>'He is dedicated trainer, very quick and brave. He has a future the boy, no question of that.<br><br>'It is a good game for him to take part in.<br><br>'With European football beckoning next month it is important Tomasz gets a bit of football.<br><br>'Edwin has been fantastic but I think he understands we need to give the boy some experience.'<br><br>Even though they have crucial Champions League and Premiership fixtures ahead, Ferguson insists they are not taking the FA Cup lightly.<br><br>He said: 'It is a competition which creates a special atmosphere, no doubt it, when you look at all the shocks over the years.<br><br>'FA Cup history is full of United and Villa teams. We both have great records.<br><br>'We are all looking forward to the game and I hope we can get a good run.<br><br>'But we know it will not be easy against Villa as they are a very committed team under Martin O'Neill.' end<br></div>
