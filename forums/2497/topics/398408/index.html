              <p>Liverpool's asking price for a takeover may be as much as an inflated 
              £800 million, according to analysis from a leading City expert in 
              football finance.</p>
              <p>And David Bick, Chairman of Square 1 Consulting, argues that Liverpool 
              are in urgent need of a "rescue" package rather than a takeover, as the 
              club need to move from their crumbling Anfield to a new stadium, and are
               in danger of losing star players such as Fernando Torres and Steven 
              Gerrard.</p>
              <p>Bick is an advisor to Keith Harris, who has been behind two 
              abortive takeover bids for the stricken club in the recent past, and 
              says City sources have informed him that even the reduced price the two 
              American owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett might accept, £500 million,
               is far too high, saying: "Rumours abound of a price being asked from 
              £500 million up to an incredible £800 million."</p>
              <p>While Harris is a 
              leading light in the 'Red Knights' group heavily linked with trying to 
              buy out the Glazers at Manchester United, Bick has focused on their 
              North-West rivals and warns of an impending £10 million fee to be 
              imposed by the Royal Bank of Scotland to extend bank-loan facilities for
               a further six months.</p>
              <p>And Bick suggests that, while the club is 
              due to publish and publicise a £35 million profit, there are huge 
              similarities with the recent Manchester United bond issue launched after
               a similar posting of a putative financial gain.</p>
              <p>As part of their 
              bond prospectus, United were able to claim a £48.2 million profit, 
              having sold Cristiano Ronaldo for £80 million while Liverpool sold Xabi 
              Alonso for £35 million to Real Madrid last summer - almost the exact 
              amount Bick believes will be trumpeted as this year's profit.</p>
              <p>In a
               damning indictment of financial affairs and long-standing neglect at 
              Liverpool, Bick writes in an open letter: "Liverpool has potentially 
              reached its most important historic point. The club has now gone 20 
              years without winning the English League title. It has never won the 
              Premier League. It was drummed out earlier than expected from this 
              year's Champions League and now, as one of the world's biggest clubs, 
              faces the ignominy and reality of failing to qualify for next season's 
              premier European competition.</p>
              <p>"To my mind, the people running the
               club over the last two decades must bear the bulk of the responsibility
               and the brunt of the criticism. On a recent visit to Anfield to watch 
              my team, West Ham, play like a pub team with a Force 10 hangover, one 
              had only to look at the stadium to see the years of dreadful neglect at 
              first hand. Unbelievably, there are still pillars holding up one roof!</p>
              <p>"Whether
               it comes down to incompetence or thoughtless arrogance at Liverpool, we
               have seen the club left behind by the other great clubs like Arsenal, 
              Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea and Spurs. They have rebuilt
               their stadia to high standards and, largely speaking, to capacities 
              that accommodate their substantial fan bases. Yet all Liverpool fans 
              have heard is talk and a string of broken promises.</p>
              <p>"The other 
              clubs have built their revenue streams or attracted owners that have 
              given them the wherewithal to compete effectively at the top of the 
              modern game. It seems to me that the Liverpool fans are being treated to
               a 'product' that is rooted in the 1970s. Sadly, in very recent times, 
              Liverpool has also been owned by people who have said much and delivered
               little of the stated vision. Replacing them is a very urgent 
              imperative.</p>
              <p>"Liverpool claimed in a recent statement that it has 
              'overseen a significant improvement in the financial performance of the 
              club since 2007'. Well, that's difficult to assess. The management has 
              not published accounts for Kop Football (Holdings) Limited - the main 
              trading company - since the filing for the year to 31 July 2008 and, in 
              that year, the business showed net losses of over £42 million and net 
              interest payments on debt of £35 million not covered at all (let alone 
              adequately) by operating profit - pre-player amortisation and trading - 
              of £25 million.</p>
              <p>"Debt remains stubbornly near a reported £240 
              million, so what profits are produced do not leave much, if anything, 
              for the manager to work with, even if we believe rumours of a £35 
              million profit for the year that will end this 31 July. In short, 
              Liverpool's financial structure can't work in my opinion and, since the 
              sale of the club in 2007, it was never going to.</p>
              <p>"If the manager 
              cannot operate competitively in the transfer market, he has no chance of
               competing regularly in the top four. We have now seen the first 
              concrete sign of this with the failure to even stay in the top four. 
              Manchester United, a club manfully trying to cope with a similarly 
              onerous financial structure will also, I believe, start to experience 
              similar problems, although their state of decline is nowhere near as 
              advanced as Liverpool's.</p>
              <p>"It seems axiomatic to me that Liverpool 
              needs new, responsible owners and new top-flight, football-experienced 
              executive management. It will not be beyond the wit of man, the new well
               regarded chairman included, to find such a new owner. But first of all,
               Liverpool needs to stop spinning silly numbers. Rumours abound of a 
              price being asked from £500 million up to an incredible £800 million, 
              the lower of which is, in my view, way over the top for a club in its 
              current condition and by any sensible comparison with Arsenal or 
              Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Bick pinpoints the burning issue of a new 
              stadium, a project that has stalled during over three years of American 
              ownership, and says that this can only make any takeover more 
              complicated.</p>
              <p>"Financially at least, Liverpool must have a new 
              stadium if it is to have any hope of restoring past glories," he writes.
               "But the finance for that, and any subsequent financial benefit to 
              owners, must accrue to those who put up the money. In any case, this 
              will not be a conventional acquisition of a football asset - it is more 
              likely now to be a rescue.</p>
              <p>"The new owners will need to be people 
              of high calibre. They will need to have access to very large sums of 
              money to build the new stadium, revitalise the management and allow for a
               well thought-through strengthening of the playing squad."</p>
              <p>On the 
              current and much-debated issue of Rafael Benitez's future as Liverpool 
              manager, Bick expresses the pressing need for stability to be restored 
              or else the club could face a doomsday scenario. "Right now, Liverpool 
              is at risk of losing its manager and some of its best players, 
              demoralised by a recent Europa Cup semi-final defeat and a poor season. 
              While no-one is irreplaceable, such an exodus will leave a new owner 
              with an even more difficult task. Therefore, the new chairman of 
              Liverpool needs to act with some swiftness.</p>
              <p>"Once decline becomes
               precipitous, even money may not prevent the decline spiralling into 
              permanency."</p>
              <p>Bick's open letter, headed 'Rescuing Liverpool', seen
               by <em>Soccernet</em>, may well cause shock waves among the Premier 
              League community and not just at Anfield.</p>
