              <p class="imageCaption">Captain's job: Terry celebrates his opener with Ashley Cole and debutant Raul Meireles</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Steve Bruce could gain consolation from the injury-time goal that heralded Ji-Dong Won's arrival in the Premier League. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>It made no difference to the destiny of the three points but at least it erased one of a collection of uncomfortable statistics involving his Sunderland team. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>A little known US college professor Aaron Levenstein once intoned: 'Statistics are like bikinis. What they reveal is suggestive but what they conceal is vital.' </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Well, Sunderland's vital statistics hardly make encouraging reading.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>This was their eighth defeat in the last nine league matches at the Stadium Of Light, including four in succession. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>This was Chelsea's seventh successive win on Wearside. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>At least South Korean Ji maintaining a scoring run which included two for his country during the week prevented four on the trot without a Sunderland goal.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>It also sparked a hectic final three minutes which, it must be said, disturbed Chelsea's composure for the first time in the match. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But to draw optimism from such a token flurry would be to paper over undoubted cracks. And yet for all of Chelsea's territorial command, they still should have been a goal down in the 12th minute when Nicklas Bendtner wasted a great opportunity to endear himself to his new band of followers. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Bendtner has undoubted assets which will aid Sunderland in his season's loan from Arsenal, but his big weakness is his consistent failure to profit from his ability not only to take up good positions but also to out-jump even the most formidable central defensive opponent. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Cue the inswinging free-kick from Seb Larsson which Bendtner got on the end of with such effect that he only had Petr Cech to beat. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The goalkeeper, back in action after a knee ligament injury, was mightily relieved when the striker guided the ball wide of his right-hand post.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'Nick had a great chance and you have to take chances like that against Chelsea,' said Bruce.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>That was the sum total of Cech's anxiety for all but the last minute of the first half, when he reacted quickly to deal with a shot on the turn from Stephane Sessegnon. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The time in between was a reflection of the enormous chasm which stretches between the Steve Bruce could gain consolation from the injury-time goal that yesterday heralded Ji-Dong Won's arrival in the Premier League.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/09/10/article-2035858-0DCF7A7000000578-200_634x297.jpg" alt="Consolation: Ji Dong-Won celebrates his first goals for Sunderland" width="634" height="297"> </span>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The time in between was a reflection of the enormous chasm which stretches between the aspirations of the two sides - Chelsea's passing and movement creating pressure and Sunderland trying vainly to cope but looking bereft of ideas and inspiration. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>A Chelsea goal seemed inevitable. It came in the 17th minute when Lee Cattermole, never the shrinking violet, dived in on Nicolas Anelka and brought him down.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Anelka made the most of it but there was no doubt about the contact. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Juan Mata cracked the 25-yard free-kick against a post but Chelsea's reactions to the rebound were far more positive and, after John Terry's first cross was blocked, when the ball came back to him he squeezed it in from an acute angle, with Phil Bardsley succeeding only in making sure it went over the line. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Six minutes after half-time Daniel Sturridge made it two with a goal of superb individual talent.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>First, he worried Wes Brown out of a long ball from Ramires and then, with Simon Mignolet also trying to crowd him, the striker's kind of side-footed backheel rolled into an empty net. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Bruce tried all manner of permutations and players without ever threatening until the late burst sparked by Ji's low right-footer after Bendtner had helped on a Larsson pass.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Chelsea boss Andre Villas-Boas said: 'It went very well for us in terms of what you want to achieve.' </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>He is clearly aware of the demands of owner Roman Abramovich as far as a big prize is concerned and added: 'I just have to focus on what the owner has told me. One of his obsessions is to play well and that's what we try to do. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'We have only two days to rest before the Leverkusen game in the Champions League, with Bayer having one day extra to rest. And we have to focus on getting the three points before going on to Valencia.' </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Bruce said: 'It was very difficult against a very good Chelsea team. They had terrific possession of the ball and we used up a lot of energy trying to get it back. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'The pity was we didn't make the most of what we had.' </span></p>

              <p>Their striker is still not sharp enough.. Actually , they shall have let Ancelotti continue stay. He is best with old man at his diposal.</p>
              <p>I think Drogba can still play a few more good years under him. So as Malouda and Lampard...</p>

              <p>the second goal was by sturridge (new guy)</p>
              <p>all the old guards like lampard, malouda, drogba, anelka all have declined alot.</p>
              <p>and the new ones ramires and torres are also so poor.</p>
