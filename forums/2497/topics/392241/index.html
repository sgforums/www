              <p><span id="intelliTXT">The administrator in charge of Portsmouth expects the financially-stricken Premier League club's debt to total £78million.</span></p>
              <p><span><span id="intelliTXT">But Andrew Andronikou has been led to believe there is still a chance of Pompey avoiding a nine-point penalty. </span></span></p>
              <p>"The debt is going to be slightly more than £70million," Andronikou told Sportsweek on BBC Radio Five Live.</p>
              <p>"We will know more towards the end of the week. There are lots of contingent creditors I need to look at.</p>
              <p>"I will probably need another week to get to the bottom of it all and see the exact figures.</p>
              <p>"I would imagine (the debts) will bottom around £78million."</p>
              <p>Andronikou has been advised that Portsmouth may be able to challenge "the assumption" that the Premier League will impose a points penalty for going into administration.</p>
              <p>The punishment would push Pompey, who are currently four points adrift at the foot of the table, to the brink of relegation.</p>
              <p>"The assumption that there is an automatic deduction of points has never been tested before, but we will do our very best to avoid a deduction," Andronikou said.</p>
              <p>"Our solicitors believe there may be a slight opportunity but I don't want to say anything more because that prejudices my position in achieving it.</p>
              <p>"I would say everyone has taken for granted that there will be a deduction of nine points."</p>
              <p>Andronikou is investigating every one of Portsmouth's transfers in the hope of discovering how the club found themselves in such a financial mess, despite raising around £100million in player sales over the last 20 months.</p>
              <p>One line of inquiry is whether the money Pompey received for players was the same as the reported amounts.</p>
              <p>"Everyone asks how Portsmouth can generate so many funds from player sales but be left with residual liabilities," Andronikou explained.</p>
              <p>"I am going to go through every transfer on a one-by-one basis. The transfers that have been reported in the press, I am told, aren't actually the figures of the funds received by the club.</p>
              <p>"The most difficult area to discuss at the moment are the cost, expenses, of selling each player.</p>
              <p>"I will go through every single transaction and find out where each penny has been accounted for."</p>
