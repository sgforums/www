              <p><strong>Ronaldo is out of the game - which Portugal need to win to ensure their place in the play-offs - with an ankle injury and Real are reported as insisting he does not travel to Guimaraes.</strong></p>
              <p>"The important thing is recuperating perfectly to get over the problem," the player himself said on Real's website - though he did earlier ask for permission to make the trip.</p>
              <p>Real are already upset that Ronaldo is set to be out for a month after he aggravated an existing ankle problem in Saturday's win over Hungary, during which he hobbled off. He suffered the original problem in the Champions League win over Marseille.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Cristiano Ronaldo</span><span style="color: #000000;"> is confident that he will be back on the pitch sooner than expected, despite being told he faces around a month on the sidelines.</span></p>
              <p>The injury is to the ankle which was operated on last year, but the world's most expensive player has reassured fans that his new problem is in no way related to the old injury and that he expects to be back sooner rather than later.</p>
              <p>"I will work very hard to try to shorten the length of time I'm out, even though now what's important is to recuperate perfectly so as not to return to having problems," Ronaldo said. "It's a different injury to that which I was operated on. It's got nothing to do with that.</p>
              <p>"I'm calm because I know that with the desire I have to get better and the good work of the physiotherapists at Madrid everything will go very well."</p>
              <p>Ronaldo's absence will be a big blow to Real, as the 24-year-old has scored nine goals in seven competitive games since moving from Manchester United in the summer. Real's dependence on him was evident as they lost their first match without him.</p>
              <p>Real will feel somewhat aggrieved with Portugal, who played Ronaldo after he had missed the Sevilla match the previous week with injury. However, Ronaldo said there was never any question of him missing out. "I felt very good, but I wasn't at 100%, I had a bit of discomfort," he said. "But I wanted to push myself to help my country go to the World Cup. I'm upset because I was in a good period of form and so being injured again is something that affects me even more. I'm not the country's savour, but after the defeat against Sevilla, I wanted to help my Real Madrid team-mates win the next few games."</p>
              <p>Ronaldo is almost certain to miss Real's games against Valladolid, Sporting Gijon and Getafe, as well as a Champions League home match against Milan and a Copa del Rey match at Alcorcón. He is also likely to be absent from Madrid's visit to the San Siro and the derby against Atlético Madrid.</p>
