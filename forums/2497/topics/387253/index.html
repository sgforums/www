              <p><strong>On any other day AC Milan's midweek home match against Genoa would pass with precious little recognition in the majority of the world's media.</strong></p>
              <p>Wednesday's fixture, though, was different. For this was David Beckham's second debut with the giants of Italian football.</p>
              <p>And what an impact the England international had. Within a few minutes of kick-off Beckham fizzed a sumptuous low cross into the area that Marco Borriello turned goalwards. Only a superb plunging save prevented Milan going ahead. </p>
              <p>Watched by England coach Fabio Capello, and playing on the right of a three-pronged attack, Beckham excelled and was warmly applauded as he left the pitch on 75 minutes. By then, Milan led 5-1.</p>
              <p>Genoa's Giuseppe Sculli put Genoa ahead but Ronaldinho, Thiago Silva, Borriello (2) and substitute Klaas-Jan Huntelaar all notched to keep the Rossoneri eight points adrift of Serie A leaders Inter. David Suazo added a late consolation.</p>
              <p>Beckham was surprised but happy to make the 75-minute appearance on his return to Serie A. 'I didn't expect to start, but obviously with the injuries we got during the week, I had to. I was happy. I was happy with the game and happy with the win and it's just great to be back. It felt great, he said.</p>
              <p>And Beckham - who is in Milan to earn himself a World Cup place - was surprised to hear of Capello's presence. 'I didn't know he was there, I only found out afterwards,' admitted the former Manchester United player. 'But he loves football and he'll go to every game possible. I know he visits all of the Premier League games and, obviously being in Italy over the Christmas period, he was able to come to this game.</p>
              <p>'I think it's always important that I work hard and perform well and I felt that I did that tonight but it's just one game.'</p>
              <p>League leaders Inter Milan are the opponents in the Derby della Madonnina later<br>this month and Beckham believes his side is well-placed to mount a challenge for<br>silverware this season.</p>
              <p>'I think after the first half of the season, we've done well. We are in a great position and we need to continue because Inter are a great team, they are going to keep winning games and they are the team to catch.</p>
              <p>'But you know Juventus is a huge game, not just for us but for them as well. It's going to be a tough one but you always enjoy playing in those games.'</p>
              <p>Milan coach Leonardo was delighted with Beckham's performance. 'He had a week where we tried him in every role (in training). I think that is the synthesis of what he is all about. He has an absolute willingness to help, extraordinary quality and tactical intelligence.'</p>
              <p>Milan chief executive Adriano Galliani, added: 'Beckham, just like last season, has been a great acquisition. He is a superb player and a superb person.  'He earns very little from us. He came to Milan for all different reasons than money.'</p>

              <p>Well, Giggs relied on his speed in his younger days but he was so hardworking that he managed to hone his techniques and skills to a higher level as he knew he could not always rely on his pace as he gets older.</p>
              <p>Which also explains why Owen will never get back to England squad because his play is always about speed.</p>
