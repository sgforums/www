              <p>This guy was said to be better than Ronaldo by some at least when they were younger... But he seem to have some problems with big clubs... His time at Barce was consider a flop, and even at Inter when after Mourinho bought him, there was high hopes that he would finally do well this time since he did ok at smaller side Porto... But unfortunately, his time at Inter was also very bad... Mourinho has come out and said he is mentally weak and was prepare to let his $18.6 million purchase go on loan...</p>
              <p>Maybe Scolari could do better with him...</p>

              <p><em>Chelsea new boy: Ricardo Quaresma</em></p>
              <p><em></em>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1135405" rel="1135405|3| nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1135405/The-Quaresma-question-Is-Chelseas-new-man-actually-good.html"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Ricardo Quaresma may only be 25 years old but his loan move to </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span><strong> looks like his last shot at the big time.</strong></p>
              <p>While Andrei Arshavin was capturing the headlines with his drawn-out move from Zenit St Petersburg to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal</span></a>, Chelsea’s loan signing from Inter Milan almost slipped under the deadline-day radar.</p>
              <p>Yet, if Quaresma is to make it on the game’s biggest stages, he cannot go unnoticed for long. After being dumped by Jose Mourinho at Inter and by Barcelona before that , the Portugal winger has less than half a season to prove he can handle the pressure and expectation heaped on the world’s best players.</p>
              <p>Quaresma has arrived at Stamford Bridge with the Special One doubting he has the right mentality to thrive in the big time and former Italy manager Arrigo Sacchi insisting a change of environment will not improve his performances.</p>
              <p>Chelsea manager Luiz Felipe Scolari has signed him as cover for the injured Joe Cole, who is out for the rest of the season after knee surgery, but Quaresma knows a return to the form he showed when he made his reputation at Porto could earn him a permanent move.</p>
              <p>Quaresma said: ‘I am proud to represent such a great club. I didn’t have many opportunities to show my qualities at Inter but I want to show what I am made of.’</p>
              <p>Quaresma was one of Mourinho’s first buys for Inter last summer, when the former Chelsea boss paid £15million to sign him from Porto. A product of Sporting Lisbon’s youth academy along with Cristiano Ronaldo, the man they call ‘Mustang’ for his speed and ‘The Little Gypsy’ for his Romany heritage was a flop during his one season with Barcelona five years ago.</p>
              <p>He resurrected his career during his four-year stint with Porto but lasted just eight games into Inter’s Serie A campaign before Mourinho dished out some very public criticism.</p>
              <p>His arrival in England had Sacchi claiming: ‘Honestly, I doubt Quaresma will do better in new surroundings at Chelsea.’ Quaresma did well for Scolari with Portugal but according to sources in Lisbon he has a track record for rebelling against authority.</p>
              <p>‘Like most gypsy families, his travelling around, rather than putting down roots anywhere, has got him a reputation for being difficult to handle,’ said one.</p>
              <p>‘Scolari is the one coach who has consistently been able to get the best out of him. 'Everyone acknowledges that here, so maybe this move to Chelsea will work out.<br>‘He had a couple of great seasons at Porto but has been a complete flop in Milan.</p>
              <p>‘Jose Mourinho is embarrassed about how much he paid for him and so is Ricardo. He cost more than Ronaldinho, which seems ridiculous.’</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">JOSE MOURINHO is ready to use Ricardo Quaresma as bait to finally nab Chelsea superstar Didier Drogba.</h2>
              <p class="article">Inter Milan coach Mourinho will offer his old club the possibility of a straight swap in the summer. Winger Quaresma, 25, arrived at the Blues on loan for the season on Monday and teamed up with his former Portugal coach Phil Scolari.</p>
              <p class="article">Mourinho would love to be reunited with striker Drogba, who was one of his most trusted stars during his three years at the Bridge. Drogba has been unsettled at Chelsea since Mourinho was axed in September 2007.</p>
              <p class="article">Last season he launched a blistering attack on owner Roman Abramovich for his treatment of Mourinho. Drogba, 30, was linked with Inter last year but new boss Big Phil promised him a new contract. The pair have since fallen out.</p>
