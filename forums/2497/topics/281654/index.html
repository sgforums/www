            <div class='col-md body'>the match was quite boring and dull too. if jose was around, the red card incident and all those poor referee decisions would certainly bring big reactions from him as expected of his antic, but unfortunately we all cant get to see mourinho get angry with referees anymore.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Just my own comments on the match.<br><br>Chelsea was as the commentator said, lifeless. The same drive that Chelsea has displayed for the past 3 seasons was absent. Even John Terry looked sian.... which is really bad news.<br><br>The referee was horrible, making quite a few bad calls and did really weird things. Like the incident where Man U played the ball out, Chelsea themselves expected to be giving the ball back from a throw in. No one knew what the ref wanted when he brought the ball back onto the pitch. Free kick? Drop ball? Didn't seem like either. I still don't know what it was.<br><br>Mikel's tackle was a very bad one, hard and with studs showing. But personally I don't think it was worth a straight red card. Yellow definitely but red was a little harsh.<br><br>Rooney could have been sent off. To me he deserved a yellow card when he knocked over Ashley Cole in the second half. But the replay seems to show that it was more of a push than a direct elbow or something like that. The initial footage seemed as if Rooney charged in with an elbow. Still, I wouldn't have been suprised to see Rooney get a second yellow.5<br><br>Referee's judgement calls were inconsistent as well. I can't say for sure the incident involving Joe Cole and Evra was a definite penalty, Joe Cole did get the ball but it was from behind and hard to tell if he got the man first or player first. He definitely brought Evra off his footing. I felt though that John Terry's tackle on Rooney in the second half was a similar tackle, the one where Terry got a yellow card. Based on what I saw from the television, if the first one wasn't a foul, then neither should the second one. At least, that's what I think.<br><br>I'm not too surprised Ben Haim gave away a penalty, but I didn't really expect it to be in that manner. There was definite contact by Ben Haim, and Saha did seem to make a meal out of it, but there was a foul because Ben Haim kicked Saha on the shin. Not hard but he did, mistimed maybe? Cech almost saved the penalty though. In fact, I think Cech did very well during the match.<br><br>Tevez scored as a result of Chelsea not being able to clear properly. Wasn't the first time in the match either so they had it coming. The compusure wasn't there.<br><br>And the protest against the penalty was reasonably mild, if Mourinho was still manager it'd be a different case altogether. Although the penalty call was valid, I've seen teams protest for more clear cut penalties than that.<br><br>Overall it wasn't a great match, no real flair from either side. The match also lacked the atmosphere and intensity you would expect from a match between title contenders.<br><br>I would have liked to see a draw, but with Chelsea played the way they did, they might still have lost even with 11 men. Even if Mikel wasn't sent off, I think he'd be conceding a lot of fouls and maybe another penalty. His sending off did prevent Chelsea from venturing forward more.<br><br>Shevchenko was pretty hard working and you could see he played with less burden than he has for the past year. But he's still a little lacking in sharpness and his anticipation is not quite there. Might be due to different team tactics as well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea only managed 4 shots at goal but only 1 shot is on target. Bad news.

            <div class='col-md body'>playing style is not something that can be nurtured in a short span of time. If RA thinks by bringing Ronaldhino and bringing in new coaches will sow quick results then he is wrong. I do think if he wants that kind of flamboyant and attacking style of football he should have gotten a new coach right after last season where the team will have some preseason training that might help.<br><br>ashley cole and malouda combined quite well on the left before mikel was sent off. but they lacked that x factor. Shevchenko seems to be playing ' better '. shrugged off a few challenges and got a shot in, but his 1st touch still lets him down, the speed of epl just doesnt suit him. kalou, nothing to say about him. i tink every1 can feel chelsea not playing with their hearts and soul.<br><br></div>
