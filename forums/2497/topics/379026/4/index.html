              <p>If the beach ball (it's confirmed to be a beach ball, not a balloon) could deflect the soccer ball, it just goes to show that Bent's shot had pretty low momentum and might actually have been saveable.</p>
              <p>But I can say that the kid can't really be blamed for his enthusiasm, and besides, Reina or his defenders should have kicked it away as soon as possible.</p>
              <p>In the end, Bent was given too much space to maneuver, and that was what that really caused the goal. The defenders should have harassed him and shut him down, but they failed to do so.</p>

              <p>It was a weird goal i must say... Johnson was grabbing his own 2 balls and kicking the other 2 balls at the same time... lol</p>
              <p>Johnson seem to have cleared the beach ball while missing the actual match ball... and it got deflected at that split second and instead of going to Reina's right, it then went to Reina's left...</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool's title challenge looks in serious trouble after they lost their fourth game of the season, going down 1-0 to Sunderland in bizarre circumstances.</strong></p>
              <p>Darren Bent was credited with the only goal at the Stadium of Light, but the ball took a wicked deflection off a beach ball - which appeared to have been thrown onto the pitch by a Liverpool fan - and deceived Pepe Reina.</p>
              <p>As the football struck the beach ball and veered to Reina's left, the Spanish keeper appeared to react to and follow the beach ball, who dived the wrong way as the ball flew into the net.</p>

              <p>The price is not going to go down for the Prince... The 2 yanks are quite smart businessmen... They know they can milk the club for much more so why give up now? The Prince would have to pay big time to get the club... Pool already got an $80m shirt sponsor starting next season...</p>
              <p>George Gillett and Tom Hicks paid only $219 million for the whole club in 2007 and now GG wants to sell his half share for $350 million... That is like he wants to multiple his investment by more than 3 x in less than 3 years... And the worse thing is, they didn't even came out the full sum... Most of it was loan from the banks...</p>
              <p>These 2 yankees sure know how to milk Pool dry... But maybe Tom Hicks isn't that bad as he isn't looking to sell according to news report...</p>

              <p class="article">Benitez refused to blame the freak goal for Liverpool's loss. He said: "It's a very technical question. It could be a goal, it's difficult to say. In this case, it has to be a goal.</p>
              <p class="article">"These things can happen in a lot of games. It was a bad situation for us - it was in the middle [of the goal] and it was very influential. "But we didn't play well, that is the main thing for me."</p>
              <p class="article">Bruce blew his top at Benitez after the Spaniard complained at injured Kenwyne Jones' lengthy on-pitch treatment. But the Sunderland chief brushed aside the clash after the game. He added: "It was handbags. It's all over, it's done.</p>

              <p><strong>Pictures on Sky TV showed a young fan in the Liverpool section throwing the beach ball on the pitch and then looking particularly glum at halftime as he perhaps considered the consequences of his actions.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The rules state the referee has the option to allow play to continue if a "second ball" goes on to the field but should call a halt if it interferes with the action.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It also states he should stop the game in the case of "any kind of outside interference" but in reality matches are routinely allowed to continue with items like balloons on the pitch.</p>

              <p>I guess Pool's problems come down to just Rafa and nothing else as important... The rest isn't too major.</p>
              <p>Rafa is dragging them through the mud this last 5 over years and unless they change manager, they probably will remain an averagely good club only...</p>
              <p>Rafa don't seem to have good PR skills and don't seem to be able to connect with the players as well as he should... Torres, Kuyt and Lucas are probably the only ones that will be loyal to him... Mascherano seems to have lost interest, probably due to Barcelona or he feel he is not paid enough and Rafa isn't helping him to get a better deal... Its hard to blame him when he see people like Johnson gets $140k per week and he gets peanuts...</p>

              <p>If I understand Ah Ben's above response, he meant that the formation put up is ok and his players are not good enough to play to the formation that he have devised.</p>
              <p>If his players are good enough, any of his formation may worked.</p>
              <p>But, if he know his players well, they are not as versatile as he have expected and they have even problems playing in their own positions.</p>
              <p>I will be very angry if I am the player after reading this report.</p>
              <p>As for winning against Lyon, the chances of that happening is zero unless Ah Ben is stupid enough to risk SG and FT for that game and get injured for two weeks.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben cannot risk his neck for two time in a week - imagine losing to Lyon and Man Utd within a week in ANFIELD.</p>
              <p>You will see fans burning the flag "In Rafa, We Trust".</p>
              <p>It is the truth that Ah Ben have brought a number of good players but it is always his formation that is losing the plot.</p>

              <p>Glen Johnson should just go and play beach football lah... What $140k defender he is...</p>
              <p>His right-back position is Pool's weakest area in defence... You can try to argue that he goes missing from his position most of the time cos he likes to wander about but even when he is there, its like not much difference... His positioning and blocking isn't that good too.</p>
              <p>He need Kuyt to help him cover most of the time... and Kuyt wasn't available in this game.</p>
              <p>And I watched the rerun of the start and I saw the beach ball was resting innocently in Reina's goal when the match started... Then we have to ask how did the beach ball thrown from the stands ended up so nicely in Reina's net? Was Reina keeping the beach ball in there so that he could take it home with him after the match?</p>
              <p>I think its pointless to blame the referee, cos not too long ago, balloons were responsible for a goal between Sheff Utd &amp; City and the respond was its the keeper's duty to clear it away... Here I guess should have been the same, But why was Reina keeping the beach ball in his net and not deflated it at the start, I guess they have to ask him...</p>
