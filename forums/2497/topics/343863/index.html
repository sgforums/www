              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Tottenham gaffer Harry Redknapp
              has insisted he will not try to sign any more Portsmouth players out of
              respect for his former club.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Redknapp, who left his
              Fratton Park post to become Spurs boss earlier this season, has already
              captured striker Jermain Defoe this month.</p>
              <p>He has been linked with a number of other Pompey stars and admits he would have been interested in Glen Johnson.</p>
              <p>The full-back penned a new long-term contract with Portsmouth
              this week and Redknapp is happy the South Coast club have secured his
              future.</p>
              <p>The Spurs boss has no intention of making life difficult for
              Pompey after being criticised for his conduct in the Defoe transfer.</p>
              <p>"I would have gone back and taken Glen Johnson but I didn't
              want to get involved and cause problems," he said in the Sunday
              Telegraph.</p>
              <p>"Defoe was different, they wanted to sell Defoe. Man City were in for him, there were a few clubs in for him.</p>
              <p>"He was up in the open market but they didn't want to sell Johnson.</p>
              <p>"I've not gone near him. They wanted to keep him and he's signed a new contract, which is great for the club."</p>
              <p>Redknapp, who has also been linked with midfielder Niko
              Kranjcar, maintains that he will only pursue a Portsmouth player if he
              is up for sale.</p>
              <p>He added: "I wouldn't bother going for Kranjcar. Unless they want to sell them, I won't go, I wouldn't do that.</p>
              <p>"Somebody said I was disrespectful to Tony over Defoe but I wasn't.</p>
              <p>"I wouldn't cause any problems for Tony Adams or (chief executive) Peter Storrie or the club."</p>
