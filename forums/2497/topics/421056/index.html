              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Carlo Ancelotti</span></abbr> is happy to be judged at the end of the season if his decision to offload several veterans last summer was right.</p>
              <p>Players such as <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Joe Cole</span></abbr>, Ricardo Carvalho, Michael Ballack, Deco and Juliano Belletti moved on but although the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> manager often extols the virtues of experienced players, even when results have dipped he doesn't look back.</p>
              <p>He told <em>chelseafc.com</em>: "Our philosophy at the end of the season 
              was, because a lot of players were at the end of their contracts, to 
              change our way and to give opportunity to the young players to grow from
               the Academy.</p>
              <p>"This was the reason and now we can't come back to say, ah, we had 
              players with experience. Our philosophy was to put more young players in
               and now we have to wait to see if we had a good idea or a bad idea - 
              but we were agreed to change this direction."</p>

              <p>It all boils down to great transfer strategies by the director of football. Look at how much they "saved" from purchases like Van der Vaart and more recently, Pienaar. And also how much the earn from Robbie Keane's "loan" spell at Liverpool?</p>

              <p>well, not a lot of EPL clubs chairman/board are patient, cause once performance slides, they will fear dropping into championship and lose a slice of EPL money. Look @ Bent's purchase, and U can see the logic.</p>
              <p>only a few clubs like gunners/manU, with established management/managers, are able to tolerate a greater degree of testing/trying of youths. for chelsea/mcity, they have to produce results quicker as the investments are so huge, so expectations are high.</p>
              <p>For most teams, i do believe they get lots of gems, in the hope, that one of them can turn into aka Ronaldo and really influence the results. And in some cases, sell for massive profits.</p>

              <p>well, if chelsea is seriously consider breeding its own youngster, it has to start sooner than later. also roman has to lower his expectation and has patience with the whoever manager he wanted to put incharge. it will meant 2-3 season without a trophy.</p>
