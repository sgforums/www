              <h1>CSKA Moscow 0 Inter Milan 1: Special delivery for Jose Mourinho as 
              Wesley Sneijder books spot in last four<span class="author"></span></h1>
              <p>Inter Milan reached the last four of the Champions League for the 
              first time since 2003 as they eased to a 2-0 aggregate victory in 
              Moscow.</p>
              <p>Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder grabbed the only goal
               of the game in the sixth minute as his low free-kick found its way 
              through the CSKA wall and beyond goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev.</p>
              <p>Things
               got worse for the hosts when they had substitute Chidi Odiah sent off 
              early in the second half and Inter were comfortably able to repel any 
              pressure from their hosts and coast in the last four.</p>
              <p>Overhauling
               their first-leg deficit always looked like being a tough task for the 
              home side, given the way they were completely outplayed at the San Siro 
              last week and the absence of key midfielder Yevgeny Aldonin and Milos 
              Krasic through suspension.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/06/article-0-0906BA3B000005DC-470_468x293.jpg" alt="Inter Milan's Wesley Sneijder" width="468" height="293">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Wall breaker: Sneijder fires Inter ahead in 
              Moscow after six minutes</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>But they made a bright start on the plastic pitch at Luzhniki Stadium
               and had an early effort on goal from Japan midfielder Keisuke Honda, 
              who dragged a long-range effort wide.</p>
              <p>But Inter landed an 
              early body blow as they opened the scoring. Midfielder Sneijder drilled 
              in a low free-kick that flew under the leaping wall and fooled keeper 
              Akinfeev to end up in the back of the net.</p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/06/article-0-0906E6EC000005DC-657_233x317.jpg" alt="Wesley Sneijder " width="233" height="317">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Jump leads: Sneijder is congratulated by Goran 
              Pandev</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>That goal meant the hosts needed to score three goals to have any 
              chance of going through and Inter went close to getting their second 
              goal of the night as Goran Pandev had a sight of goal, but Akinfeev 
              comfortably held his shot.</p>
              <p>Conceding the goal prompted an 
              early response from CSKA manager Leonid Slutsky as he hauled off 
              defender Vasili Berezutsky after just 13 minutes to replace him with 
              Odiah.</p>
              <p>Honda then fired wide with two optimistic free-kick 
              efforts from distance, but the hosts did go close to grabbing a goal 
              back when Tomas Necid fired agonisingly wide after controlling Odiah's 
              pass in the 24th minute.</p>
              <p>The hosts then carved out another 
              chance in the 34th minute as they broke quickly through Mark Gonzalez, 
              but Alan Dzagoev made a mess of the finish, scuffing the ball infield as
               he drove into the box.</p>
              <p>And that miss was almost instantly 
              punished as Sneijder's excellent lofted ball played Diego Milito in, but
               the Argentinian forward could only hit his shot at Akinfeev.</p>
              <p>Odiah
               then saw Julio Cesar tip his shot round the post at the other end, but 
              the Italian champions looked comfortable soaking up any CSKA pressure.</p>
              <p>And
               things got even worse for the Russian side when Odiah was dismissed 
              just three minutes into the second half as his rash lunge for a loose 
              ball saw him bring down Samuel Eto'o to earn himself a second yellow 
              card.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/06/article-0-0906F46C000005DC-336_468x371.jpg" alt="Inter Milan's Samuel Eto'o" width="468" height="371">

              </div>
              <p>But they continued to push forward in search of a goal and midfielder
               Gonzalez had two chances in the space of a minute.</p>
              <p>The Chile 
              international firstly smashed a half-volley that Julio Cesar did well to
               hang on to, before dragging another effort wide from the edge of the 
              box.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/06/article-0-0906E8D4000005DC-344_468x329.jpg" alt="Inter Milan's coach Jose Mourinho " width="468" height="329">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Special delivery: Jose Mourinho steered Inter 
              into the last four</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>With 20 minutes to go Jose Mourinho's side were 
              dominating possession, sweeping the ball around at will, and Sneijder 
              and Dejan Stankovic both forced Akinfeev into action with powerful 
              efforts, and the keeper did superbly to keep out Milito's effort with 
              the Argentina international through on goal.</p>
              <p>The game rather 
              petered out from that point, although Eto'o just failed to add a second 
              as he shot over the bar in the final minutes.</p>
