              <h3>SAMUEL ETO'O has warned that Chelsea will need to produce their best 
              performance of the season to knock Inter out of the Champions League.</h3>
              <p>The Cameroon international says he has already dreamed of scoring the 
              winner 
              at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>And he believes he will go on to lift the trophy for the third time in 
              his 
              career if the Serie A champions overcome Carlo Ancelotti's side.</p>
              <p>Eto'o, who hoped the two clubs would meet in the final on May 22, scored
               the 
              winner at Chelsea in February 2006 for his former club Barcelona. The 
              Spanish giants went on to win the tournament against Arsenal in Paris.</p>
              <p>He won it again last season, becoming only the second player to score in
               two 
              separate Champions League finals when he netted against Manchester 
              United in 
              Rome.</p>
              <p>His pedigree as a player for the big occasion stands up to the greatest 
              scrutiny. And he insists the pressure of having to score could force 
              some 
              tension into Chelsea's performance.</p>
              <p>"I always improve my own level when I play in a match of this size and I
               have 
              already dreamed of scoring the winning goal at Stamford Bridge," he 
              said.</p>
              <p>"Chelsea are the favourites and the pressure is on them.</p>
              <p>"Every minute that passes without a goal on Tuesday will add to that 
              pressure. 
              They will feel the tension.</p>
              <p>"That doesn't mean we will be defensive. That would be a grave error.</p>
              <p>"We will attack them from the start and if we win this game then I 
              believe we 
              will go on to win the Champions League.</p>
              <p>"I have told Didier Drogba that we will create big problems for Chelsea 
              and 
              that they will have to produce their best performance of the season to 
              beat 
              us.</p>
              <p>"I was annoyed when I saw the draw because I hoped this match would have
               been 
              the final at the Bernabeu in May, but we don't fear Chelsea.</p>
              <p>"We need to repeat the level we showed in the San Siro over the 90 
              minutes.</p>
              <p>"For either of these clubs to be knocked out at this stage of the 
              competition 
              would be a major failure.</p>
              <p>"The match is in our hands and if we stick to our usual style we will 
              not be 
              eliminated."</p>
              <p>Eto'o, 29, may have used his comments to divert attention from Jose 
              Mourinho's 
              return to Stamford Bridge for the first time since his controversial 
              departure in September 2009.</p>
              <p>But he has his own history at the stadium after he complained at being 
              subjected to racial abuse at the end of Barca's defeat there in 2005.</p>
              <p>The three-times African Player of the Year accused members of Chelsea's 
              ground 
              staff of calling him a "monkey" after the 4-2 loss against Mourinho's 
              side.</p>
              <p>Eto'o almost moved to Manchester City last summer but the club's board 
              pulled 
              out of the deal when he demanded more money at the latter stage of 
              negotiations.</p>
              <p>Manchester United also considered signing him but were put off by his 
              wage 
              demands and what they saw as his dubious motives for wanting to play in 
              the 
              Premier League.</p>
              <p>Despite his uneasy relations with English clubs, he does not feel in any
               awe 
              of Chelsea's much-vaunted defenders, having got the better of them more 
              than 
              once in the past.</p>
              <h4><strong>Pedigree</strong></h4>
              <p>"Chelsea may have a great international back line but I have shown my 
              own 
              pedigree at the top level and I don't feel in any way inferior to them,"
               he 
              said.</p>
              <p>"One thing I will say is that their defenders know me well from the 
              times we 
              played against each other when I was at Barcelona.</p>
              <p>"This not is not a duel between Jose Mourinho and Carlo Ancelotti or 
              between 
              Samuel Eto'o and Didier Drogba. It is between Chelsea and Inter.</p>
              <p>"Mourinho going back to Chelsea is a big thing for him but he is very 
              professional and will be prepared for the situation.</p>
              <p>"I had the same thing when I went back to the Nou Camp during the group 
              stages 
              earlier this season.</p>
              <p>"I think this is a game where there will be goals - and we are 
              determined to 
              prevail."</p>
