              <p><em>Rafa
              Benitez arrived at Anfield five years ago this week, and in that time
              plenty has occured. So what's gone well, and what badly? Nick Miller
              looks at the good and bad of Rafa's half decade...</em></p>
              <p></p>
              <p><strong>THE GOOD</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Signing Fernando Torres, Xabi Alonso and Pepe Reina</strong><br>Quite
              good players, these three. Would any of them be in the Premier League
              if it wasn't for Benitez? Real Madrid were Alonso's other main suitor
              in 2004 (still are), Torres might still be at Atletico had Liverpool
              not come up with the cash, while Reina would most likely have moved
              back to Barcelona. In these three - along with Steven Gerrard and Jamie
              Carragher - Benitez has created a spine around which Liverpool's
              success is based, and if he does something daft (like selling Alonso)
              this summer, their continued title challenge will almost certainly
              falter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>Keeping - then getting the best from - Steven Gerrard</strong><br>When
              Benitez arrived, two of Liverpool's best players were about to jump
              ship. While Michael Owen left, Gerrard was persuaded to stay (just a
              couple of weeks after Benitez's appointment too) despite offers of
              riches and instant success from Chelsea. It happened again the
              following summer, and while Gerrard claimed it was an emotional
              decision, Benitez would no doubt have been a major factor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Keeping him was only a half-success though. After a couple of
              years shoving him out to the right and occasionally the left of
              midfield, Benitez realised that his true potential could only be
              brought out in his current 'free' role. While it might be a stretch to
              say Benitez alone has converted him from midfielder to support striker,
              he must be praised for allowing Gerrard to roam free.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>Istanbul</strong><br>The story goes that, as the entire
              Liverpool side and staff were cavorting around the Ataturk Stadium
              pitch, Benitez took Jamie Carragher aside and offered some constructive
              criticism about his positioning during the game.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's this sort of cold attention to detail that was the centre
              of Liverpool's comeback. Amid the chaos of half-time, and after setting
              out a formation that included 12 players, Benitez had the nous and
              awareness to realise that he had to introduce Dietmar Hamman in order
              to protect his ravaged defence and midfield. Without this Liverpool
              probably wouldn't have scored those three goals in six minutes, and
              certainly wouldn't have prevented Milan from adding more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>Reigniting a rivalry</strong><br>In this generation of
              football, there can be few things more flattering than Alex Ferguson
              recognising you are a threat. The difference between Ferguson's
              treatment of Benitez and Arsene Wenger at the tail end of last season
              was telling. While Wenger received the equivalent of a ruffle of the
              hair and a 'Bless 'em, they play nice football', Benitez was the
              subject of a cynical and co-ordinated attack from Ferguson and Sam
              Allardyce, designed to destabilise their season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Much has been made (on these pages and others) of the 'facts
              rant', and while it's clear that Ferguson got under Benitez's skin,
              it's difficult to prove either way that it had a significant impact on
              Liverpool's season. Sure, they went on a poor run shortly after, but if
              Benitez had truly been psychologically battered and it had sabotaged
              Liverpool's season, how do you explain the 4-1 win at Old Trafford?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The improvement in Liverpool's league position since 2004 has
              been gradual, but last season they were genuine, serious and sustained
              title contenders for the first time since they last won the thing in
              1990. With the right signings, it could be even closer next time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>Surviving the power struggle</strong><br>18 months ago it
              looked like Benitez's time at Anfield was done. Disagreements with the
              American owners and Rick Parry over control (it always is) meant that
              he was being pushed out, with Tom Hicks and George Gillett even lining
              up Jurgen Klinsmann to replace him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How much should be made of the apparent power struggle between
              Parry and Benitez is unclear, and who actually bought Robbie Keane, but
              if there really was a row, there's only one winner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The extent of his victory is perfectly illustrated by the long
              negotiations over his new contract last season. He rejected every
              version of the deal that didn't please him, safe in the knowledge that
              he could ask for a monkey butler and strippers and the club would have
              to acquiesce, such was and is his power. He now has control over
              Liverpool's transfer policy, and is shaping the club into his own
              image.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>THE BAD</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Blind spots</strong><br>Strange how some managers have blind spots
              in certain positions. With Ferguson for a long time it was goalkeepers,
              for Arsene Wenger centre-backs, but for Benitez it seems to be
              full-backs. Josemi, Jan Kronkamp, Antonio Barragan, Philip Degen,
              Andrea Dossena, Alvaro Arbeloa and Fabio Aurelio have been purchased,
              with arguably only the latter two being successes. And now it looks
              like he is about to pay a huge fee for the good, but not great, Glen
              Johnson.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>The '7/10' obsession</strong><br>The fundamental element of
              Benitez's managerial philosophy is control. He's obsessed with it. One
              imagines the sort of games that we punters enjoy (the break-neck
              seven-goalers, the games we remember) are the ones that Benitez hates,
              because there's no control. They're unpredictable. Anything could
              happen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This might explain his early fascination with steady,
              predictable players that would play quite well and run around a lot
              every week, but rarely created anything spectacular. It's why he
              persisted with Dirk Kuyt and eventually found a place for him, as well
              as Momo Sissoko, Andrei Voronin, Alvaro Arbeloa, Bolo Zenden, Albert
              Riera, even Craig Bellamy and to an extent Yossi Benayoun.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the signing of Torres one suspected he finally realised
              that a mixture of flair and graft is the way to go, which is why their
              reluctance to chase a player like David Silva is so frustrating.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>Rotation</strong><br>In his early days, you suspected that
              Benitez made changes to his side almost out of spite, being
              deliberately obtuse. He famously didn't keep the same side for 99
              consecutive games (even that he made no changes for that 100th match
              suggests stubbornness), and such changes were as much about him not
              knowing his best side as keeping things fresh. Now, most people could
              probably name his first-choice eleven, but back then you might as well
              have picked names from a hat. It's difficult to work out whether the
              recent success is simply down to keeping a settled side, or the settled
              side is simply because he has better players now, and can thus more
              readily trust them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>Questionable transfer record</strong><br>For every Torres
              there's a Voronin, for every a Skrtel a Kronkamp, for every Alonso a
              Nunez. In five years Benitez has signed 45 players, a massive number
              that smacks of at best trial and error, at worst guessing. Obviously he
              was unsure in his early days about which players would work in England,
              but even last summer there were some stinkers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Philip Degen has yet to make a league appearance (although much
              of that was down to injury), Andrea Dossena cost £7million, and then
              there was Robbie Keane. For a manager who is operating on a budget (as
              he never fails to remind us) much lower than his immediate rivals, he
              must minimise these sort of judgement errors.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>Over-analysis</strong><br>After Liverpool beat Real Madrid
              last summer, one of the Spanish papers wrote that you should never play
              chess with a grandmaster. It's true, and it might be one of the reasons
              that Liverpool had such a good record in 'big' games last season, while
              they dropped points against the lesser lights of the Premier League.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Clever thinking and effective tactics are required against
              Manchester United and Chelsea, but perhaps less so against Stoke and
              Hull. One suspects against those from the nether regions of the Premier
              League, Alex Ferguson offers little by way of tactical thinking - he
              simply says 'You're better than them, go and win it'. Benitez rarely
              lets his players loose, or goes for all-out attack in the same way that
              Jose Mourinho used to at Chelsea. If they were losing 1-0 after an
              hour, Mourinho would chuck on two more strikers and play four up front.
              Benitez tends to stick with the plan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He has a tendency to over-think, to try and work out how to beat
              every team, when he could merely trust that his troops are better than
              the opposition, which they frequently are. Sometimes football really is
              that simple, and it might be a lesson that Benitez would do well to
              learn.</p>

              <p>Yeah, at least he changed it towards the end of last season. I
              don't think he will go back to defensive play coming season. If he
              does, then that's it.</p>

              that depends on his football philosophy. Wenger, fergie and the barcelona coach, all based their tactics on attacking football. Rafa is a sort of mixed, bit of defensive, bit counter attacking, bit attacking philosophy.
              
              Let see if he has changed his mentality for next season. Mourinho also cant change his mentality overnight. he is still defensive even in serie A with Inter dominating.

              <p>their goal difference was far superior to Man U's and Chelsea's, this meant they have put together a huge goal tally. </p>

              <p>I'll prefer my team to score alot of goals and have a right balance of attacking and defensive attitude than have one that spurns one for the other . I feel that Liverpool has got the balance correct, the goals were pouring in for them and they were winning most of their matches.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>liverpool has the tendency to sit back, absorb, then let torres run for the ball in most games. it works sometimes, doesnt work sometimes. agreeably, the goal difference is highest. yet the failure to score key goals which can change games is there. where other teams have players who can just change a game in ONE moment, liverpool cannot do so. arguably gerrard can, but he just hasn't pulled it off enough. for example, macheda at united scored twice for 4 points. thats whats missing at liverpool. plus the reserves suck. lol! they dont have reserves like united/chelsea.</p></div>
