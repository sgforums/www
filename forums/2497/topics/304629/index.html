            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard has suffered a setback in his bid to recover from a thigh problem.</strong><br><br>Lampard has been out of action since picking up the thigh injury in the Boxing Day draw with Aston Villa.<br><br>The England international had targeted a return against Everton in the second leg of their Carling Cup semi-final, but he will now miss the trip to Goodison Park after aggravating the injury in training.<br><br>Blues boss Avram Grant confirmed Lampard could be sidelined for a further two weeks.<br><br>"All I can say about his injury is that he is not available for the moment but we hope he will be soon as possible," said Grant.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Complicated</span></strong><br><br>"It is a little bit more complicated than we thought. But I think he will be back soon.<br><br>"He has torn his thigh muscle for a second time and I think it could be between days or two weeks from now."<br><br>Better news on the injury front for Grant is that Shaun Wright-Phillips could be available despite limping off against Birmingham at the weekend.<br><br>Wright-Phillips was expected to miss out after suffering an ankle injury at St Andrews, but he is back in light training and could make the clash with Everton.<br><br>"The good thing with these players is they like to play and even when they are not fit and 100 per cent, they are doing everything to play.<br><br>"Not all the players have been 100 per cent fit for the last few games but the squad is very short. Everybody, including Shaun, is doing everything they can to play, but it is good news he is out there."<br><br>Grant has dismissed suggestions that his side will go to Goodison Park and sit back and defend their 2-1 lead from the first leg.<br><br>"I don't believe in that. If you go to only defend then you can make a mistake and lose the game because of it," insisted Grant.<br><br>"It is not our style of game over the last three months. I don't think you can play totally different for just one game. It is not the nature of the team.<br><br>"We will not change our system and our style of play will be the same we play at home. I believe Everton feel more comfortable to play at home but for us it is the same. The atmosphere at Liverpool and Goodison Park is very good. I like it. The supporters get behind their team. It is a great atmosphere.<br><br>"The Carling Cup is not my main target but it is a good competition. If you get into the semi-final of any competition then you want to qualify and any game we have played in the Carling Cup we have taken seriously."</div>
