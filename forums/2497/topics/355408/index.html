              <p>Two goals from defender Branislav Ivanovic and a third from Didier Drogba gave Chelsea an emphatic victory, after Liverpool's Fernando Torres had put the Reds in front in the sixth minute.</p>
              <p>Chelsea are favourites to reach the semi-finals of the competition, and Lampard was buoyed by the performance and result. Midfielder Lampard was at his influential best against Liverpool, who will go to Stamford Bridge next Tuesday requiring at least three goals to have any chance of turning the tie in their favour.</p>
              <p>Lampard is not ready, though, to focus solely on winning the Champions League this season."This result sets the tone really," he said. "Who knows what can happen in the league and the FA Cup? "Everything is still up for grabs, even though we are behind in the league. It is important that we keep to the standard we played against Liverpool. When we look at the strength of our team throughout the pitch, we are as good as anybody.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's advantage should make the return leg at home a mere formality, but the ever-cautious Lampard is taking nothing for granted. "We were disappointed we didn't score more, especially towards the end of the game when they opened up and we had two or three chances to make it four or five," he added.</p>
              <p>"That would have put the game out of sight. At the moment, it is not out of sight. Liverpool are a strong team - they beat Manchester United 4-1 - and we have to be on our game next week and make sure we don't slip up. "But it is a fantastic first result. We were very organised, played good football and were very dangerous on the break. We changed ourselves tactically a little bit, and they found it hard to deal with."</p>
              <p>One low point for Chelsea was captain John Terry's booking for a challenge on goalkeeper Jose Reina. Terry is now suspended for the return leg, but Lampard believes they have enough in reserve to deal with his absence - and he also criticised Liverpool's players for urging the referee to show the defender a yellow card.</p>
              <p>"We hope we'll have enough in the squad," he said. "Ricardo Carvalho looks as though he will be fit - and if we can go through then John will be on a clean bill going into the semi-final. It was unfortunate that the Liverpool players ran round to make sure he did get booked."</p>

The Blues stunned Liverpool with a 3-1 rout at Anfield in Wednesday’s Champions League quarter-final first leg tie.

              <p class="article">He said: “If we can carry on playing like that, we will put fear into a lot of teams. “It was a superb display. From five minutes on, we were fantastic and we came in at half-time knowing we could do even better. There was just a feeling about the game.</p>

              <p class="article">“We were very organised, played good football and were very dangerous on the break. “We’d have taken 3-1 all day long before the game but, after it, there was a slight sense of disappointment that we didn’t score more.</p>
