            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by johntoil:</div><div class="quote_body"><span class="large"></span><br><br>He is a celebrity footballer here. You recognised him means he is somebody. Being a star, he can't stoop that low to be a despatch rider or MacDonald delivery boy. But, he should be able to play in Indonesia.<br><br>Don't forget, he is not banned from playing for his country. He still can afford to smile and be arrogant. His country needs him so badly that they didn't ban him from international competitions. Our football panel thinks that he the only Alan Shearer and we should close one eye for his frequent mis-guided violent acts. Our panel feels Singaporeans should accept their decisions quietly.<br><br></div></blockquote>To be very honest, the only member i would recognize in the Sg team in Lional Lewis... The rest of them i wouldn't know even if i were to meet them on the street... What celebrity footballer you talking? This is Sg, not the epl or europe... Honestly, Footballers isn't exactly held in high esteem on this island...<br><br>Technically, he isn't ban for country but i think the Sg coach would not be allow to select him either... So it won't make much difference... Not sure if he still can afford to smile and be arrogant. Cos if i am not wrong... Indonesia is also a member of FIFAs associations...<br><br>The only way he can play now is unless FAS makes a U-turn and unbanned him which is quite unlikely or he find a country football league that is not associate to FIFA... even more unlikely....<br><br><blockquote>At first it was thought that the ban would not prevent Alam Shah from playing at club-level outside Singapore, and he made arrangements to join the Malaysian team PDRM FA. However in January 2008, the Football Association of Malaysia confirmed that under FIFA rules, member associations are required to respect domestic bans imposed by other associations, and therefore Alam Shah is not eligible to play in the Malaysian Super League until his ban is completed.</blockquote>This is the current Sg squad playing in the Middle east...<br><br><strong>Singapore:</strong> Lionel Lewis, Noh Rahman, Precious Emuejeraye, Baihakki Khaizan, Daniel Bennett, Shi Jiayi, Shahril Ishak, John Wilkinson, Hariss Harun, Mustafic Fahrudin, Isa Halim, Fazrul Nawaz, Khairul Amri, Indra Sahdan, Ridhuan Muhamad, Aleksandar Duric, Agu Casmir, Hassan Sunny, Faizal Hamid, Ismail Yunos, JumaÂ’at Jantan, Sevki ShaÂ’ban.<br><br></div>
