              <h2>£130m in stars off-loaded to meet Prem's new rules</h2>
              <p> </p>
              
              <p> </p>
              <h3>ROBERTO MANCINI needs a frantic five-week fire sale to offload up to £130million worth of stars and comply with Premier League rules. </h3>
              <p>The Manchester City manager has 37 first-team players but has just over a month to meet the new requirement for a maximum 25-man squad. </p>
              <p>It means the likes of Craig Bellamy, who has been linked with Spurs, Nigel De Jong, bought for £16m, and the unsettled Stephen Ireland could all leave for knockdown prices before the squad list is submitted to the Premier League on September 1. </p>
              <p>And with Mancini, who has assessed his playing staff during City's pre-season tour of the United States, set to conclude a deal for Aston Villa's James Milner, he is desperate to get the bulk of those players out of the door at Eastlands within 20 days. </p>
              <p>He said: "I know that we must sell some players because in 20 days we must have a list with 25 players. I am disappointed because some players must change teams now. It is difficult for them to play for us. </p>
              <p>"When you play in four competitions you must have a large squad because if not you have difficulties. For this it's important we have 25 players." </p>
              <p>The new rule is that each club must register a squad of 25 players with the Premier League - eight of which must be 'home grown'. </p>
              <p>To qualify as 'home grown', players must have played for at least three seasons before reaching 21 with a club affiliated to either the English or Welsh FA. </p>
              <p>Once registered, only these 25 players can feature in Premier League games until the next transfer window, although players who are still under 21 do not have to be registered and can still play. </p>
              <p>City have bought mainly experienced players as they attempt to gatecrash the Premier League elite. Now they have a list of around a dozen players for whom they would listen to offers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="inline-image-left-280"><img title="Stephen Ireland" src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00134/iro_280x870_134115a.jpg" alt="Stephen Ireland">
              <div class="caption">UNSETTLED: Stephen Ireland</div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Bellamy, a £14m buy from West Ham, is rated at only £4m, while Ireland made it clear at the end of last season that he wanted out.</strong> </p>
              <p>He is valued at between £12-15m and has attracted interest from Aston Villa as well as admiring glances from Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United. </p>
              <p>Wayne Bridge's position has also come under threat following this week's £17m signing of left-back Alexsander Kolarov from Lazio. The former Chelsea and England defender was signed for £10m in January 2009 but will not be happy at being second choice. </p>
              <p>Brazilian superstar Robinho, bought from Real Madrid for a record £32.5m on the day of the Abu Dhabi Group's takeover in August 2008, is still out on loan at Santos and has no intention of rejoining City before finding a new club. City could be looking at taking a hit of up to £15m if, as expected, they sell him for less than £20m. </p>
              <p>The squad is overstocked in the defensive midfield position, which has led to talk that Dutch World Cup hero De Jong may move on. The player was signed from Hamburg in January 2009 but must now compete with new signing Yaya Toure, England international Gareth Barry and even Patrick Vieira for a place in Mancini's starting side. </p>
              <p>Pablo Zabaleta and Vincent Kompany were also bought as defensive midfielders when they arrived at Eastlands just weeks before the takeover. </p>
              <p>England winger Shaun Wright-Phillips, not a regular starter under Mancini, is another tipped for a possible departure after the breakdown of his contract talks. Wright-Phillips is two years through a four-year deal and has turned down an extension worth £70,000 a week after initially demanding £100,000 a week. </p>
              <p>Academy graduate Nedum Onuoha and former England prodigy Micah Richards are also likely to leave before the season kicks off at Spurs on August 14. </p>
              <p>Onuoha said at the end of last season that he doesn't think Mancini appreciates him, while Richards has not shown the form in the past two years that propelled him into Steve McClaren's England side at just 17. </p>
              <p>Sunderland, Spurs, Everton and Aston Villa have shown interest in the pair and City would be happy to receive around £12m for both. </p>
              <p>Not all the players on the list will leave and Mancini will try to trim his squad by sending young fringe players such as Vladimir Weiss, Kelvin Etuhu, Greg Cunningham and the talented Michael Johnson out on loan to gain first-team experience. </p>
              <p>Brazilian striker Jo, a disastrous £18m signing in the weeks leading up to the Abu Dhabi buyout, is not wanted and City will be lucky to recoup a fraction of their outlay. Ecuadorian striker Felipe Caicedo has also been told to find another club. </p>
              <p>The expected losses, which could top £40m, emphasise the club's lack of awareness in the transfer market during the first 18 months of the takeover. </p>
              <p>As well as Robinho, it is widely accepted they paid over the odds for Joleon Lescott, at £24m, Roque Santa Cruz, who cost £17.5m, and Kolo Toure, who did not impress in his first season after leaving Arsenal for £16m. </p>
              <p>The jury is still out on Emmanuel Adebayor, who also arrived from the Emirates last summer - for £25m - after he scored just 14 goals last term.</p>

              wields axe over several stars<br></h1>

              <p>Moneybags Manchester
               City are planning a massive dressing-room clear-out as manager 
              Roberto Mancini looked like taking his summer spending towards the 
              £100million-mark yesterday.</p>
              <p>England internationals Shaun 
              Wright-Phillips, Joleon Lescott and Wayne Bridge are among the 
              high-profile names Mancini wants out of Eastlands as the Italian started
               to wield the axe on the most expensively-assembled squad in the Premier
               League.</p>
              <p>City’s summer spree topped £75m last night with the 
              capture of Serbia’s World Cup full-back Alexander Kolarov from Lazio.</p>

              </div>
              <p>And Mancini, who has already written huge cheques to snare Jerome 
              Boateng, David Silva and Yaya Toure in recent weeks, is not finished 
              there, with Inter Milan’s Italy Under-21 striker Mario Balotelli still 
              on his radar before the season starts in three weeks. The clubs are 
              still in talks over a possible £24m move for the 19-year-old.</p>
              <p>It
               all means that in addition to the England trio, City will also listen 
              to offers for a host of star names, including Craig Bellamy, Stephen 
              Ireland, Roque Santa Cruz, Jo and Felipe Caicedo.</p>
              <p>Since the 
              end of last season Martin Petrov  nd Valeri Bojinov have already been 
              shown the door by Mancini.</p>

              <p>‘The situation is the same as what happens at other clubs when there 
              are new signings,’ said a club source on Saturday night.</p>
              <p>‘There
               will be those who may not figure in the manager’s plans and will want 
              to move on. Obviously, the club will not want to keep players who don’t 
              want to stay.’</p>
              <p>Bridge’s position as City’s first-choice 
              left-back has clearly been undermined by the £19m signing of 24-year-old
               Kolarov, while there are several midfielders, including Vladimir Weiss,
               Kelvin Etuhu and Michael Johnson — none of whom made a single Premier 
              League start last season — who are now right out of Mancini’s plans and 
              likely to be moved on.</p>
              <p>The manager tried to distance himself 
              from the possibility of a fire sale on Saturday by insisting he wants 
              two players for each position, yet Kolarov’s arrival means City now have
               a staggering 39 players in their first-team squad. </p>

              Adebayor</h1>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Juventus</span></abbr> are preparing an offer for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester
               City</span></abbr> striker <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Emmanuel
               Adebayor</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Juve are turning to the former <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> star after <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Wolfsburg</span></abbr> withdrew Edin Dzeko from the market.</p>
              <p><em>Corriere dello Sport</em> says City boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Roberto
               Mancini</span></abbr> is willing to let the player go as he is set to 
              give
               more playing time to Roque Santa Cruz.</p>
              <p>Juve could sign Adebayor on loan but would have to pay for his £4.5m 
              wage entirely by themselves. The Bianconeri apparently need to wait for 
              City to sign a striker first.</p>
              <p>The Bianconeri may also agree with the Citizens for a potential deal 
              regarding Momo Sissoko. The former <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> midfielder has been hailed by Mancini, who wishes to sign him on a 
              permanent basis.</p>
