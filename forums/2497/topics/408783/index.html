              <p>I have to say last weekend, on Sat the matches were lag and freeze for short moments here and there... Then it got better on Sun, a lot lesser problems. But on Monday when I watched the United v Newcastle match, it went smoothly without any glitch at all. That in itself was amazing to me... lol... The first moment of any problem showing up was after the match and during the reviews... But at least it wasn't that bad, reviews only mah...</p>
              <p>On the whole, if they can improve and provide a problem free viewing and no lag or freeze image here and there, I will be please enough. And their picture quality is actually better than Starhub's too...</p>

              <p>Yea but the majority still have problems I think... But if they can resolve this problem for more people, I guess they will hear lesser unhappy subscribers...</p>
              <p>The thing here is I belief they are working on it... I have seen improvement over the last 9 months but it's still not good enough, they must do even better and here's my question... Why have they waited till now to improve the quality? Should have got it settled before the EPL started...</p>
              <p>And anyone notice, the slightly better quality coincide with them cutting off all the other channels for free viewing? Before they cut off those channels, the EPL channels were good although a bit lagging and freeze but those other channels were worse...</p>

              <p>and guess what? they will recoup these costs in their pricing revision. With ever increasing bids and money being spent to rectify these faults, whoever wins the next EPL bid will surely up the prices.</p>
