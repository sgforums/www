              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The Chelsea and England defender, who is married to X Factor judge and Girls Aloud singer Cheryl Cole, claims stories about his alleged affairs with three women contained confidential information and breached his right to privacy.</strong></p>
              <p>He is seeking damages of up to £200,000 from Mirror Group Newspapers over eight stories published in the Daily Mirror and Sunday Mirror in January and February this year.</p>
              <p>Cole, 27, alleges he was embarrassed and gravely distressed by the stories, which also upset his wife. Some of the information printed was false and invented, he claims, although his legal action will not distinguish between true or false information.</p>

              <p><em>Hairdresser Aimee Walton</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The young women in question were hairdresser Aimee Walton, and models Brooke Healy and Coralie Robinson.</p>
              <p>The star argues that his right to respect for private and family life, as laid out under the European Convention on Human Rights, outweighed the newspapers' rights of freedom of expression.</p>
              <p>The hearing is scheduled to take place today before senior High Court official Master Eyre.</p>
              <p>Cole married the then Cheryl Tweedy in July 2006, and sold the wedding pictures to a glossy magazine. The couple remain together despite the newspaper allegations.</p>
