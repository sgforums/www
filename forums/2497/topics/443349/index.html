              <h1>Tevez turmoil as PSG agree £21m fee with Manchester City</h1>
              <h1><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/12/10/article-0-0E712A8000000578-816_468x286.jpg" alt="Out in the cold: Carlos Tevez has been frozen out by Manchester City" width="468" height="286"></span></h1>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Out in the cold: Carlos Tevez has been frozen out by Manchester City</p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">Manchester City have agreed a £21million deal to se</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">ll Carlos Tevez to Paris Saint-Germain. And that will spark a new war with Tevez, who wants to join Italian giants AC Milan.</span></strong>
              </p><p><span style="font-size: x-small;">City owner Sheik Mansour is understood to have a close relationship  with the Qatari owners of the French club. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">And Roberto Mancini, City’s manager, is in no mood to accommodate the wishes of Tevez, who is  currently in Argentina, allegedly without the club’s permission. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Sheik Mansour has always backed Mancini in the battle of wills between player and coach, which exploded in the infamous incident at Bayern Munich when Tevez appeared to refuse orders from Mancini to warm up for action when losing a Champions League tie.</span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">AC Milan want to take the 27-year-old on loan in January, with a view to their own £21m deal in the summer. But City, who paid Manchester United £32m for the striker in July 2009, are adamant that they require a straight cash deal, with any provisional loan out of the question.</span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Juventus, run by the Agnelli family of Fiat fame, have in the past 48 hours expressed interest in buying Tevez outright. But that prompted the Parisians to press their own claims.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Now Tevez is likely to react angrily to the latest twist in his troubled career, arguing that he cannot be forced to join any club against his wishes. But if that leaves him out in the cold, playing no football, then City are said to be only too happy to oblige.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The club hope that, given the choice of a new chance of competitive football and a new start at a rich European club, as opposed to the humiliating prospect of further training alone in Manchester, Tevez will comply with City’s wishes and move to Paris.</span></p>

              <p><span>Clarence Seedorf has cast doubt over AC Milan's proposed move for Carlos Tevez, insisting the Manchester City rebel will only join the club who guarantees him the most money.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Qatari-backed Paris Saint-Germain - who are understood to have agreed a £21million deal - now lead the race to sign the controversial Argentina striker in January.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Milan have had an offer rejected for Tevez, whose switch to the San Siro has seemingly stalled over City's flat refusal to allow their former captain to leave the Etihad Stadium on loan.<br></span></p>
              <div class="moduleHalf"> </div>
              <div class="moduleHalf"><span style="font-size: small;">The Italian giants remain hopeful they can engineer a deal in time for when the transfer market reopens in the New Year but veteran Dutch star Seedorf believes Tevez will only go where he is told.</span></div>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'Looking back at his career, his agents and every move he has ever made, I think Tevez will go where they can promise him the most money,' Seedorf told <span style="font-style: italic;">Sky Sport Italia</span>.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'Milan would be the first time in his life that he has chosen a club for his career rather than the money. We'll see what happens.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The Rossoneri's offer also included a commitment to buy Tevez for £21million next summer, but City are adamant Tevez will only leave on a permanent deal.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Milan chief executive Adriano Galliani confirmed earlier this week to Italian media that a loan deal looked out of the question.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">He said: 'Manchester City want us to buy Tevez definitively. </span></p>

              <p>i dont believe fully what mancini said.  but when they offered tevez a chance to apologize why didnt he take it?  what good does it do to his image and career being so stubborn?</p>
              <p>make  peace and then move on if he doesnt like mancini or man city.</p>
              <p>look at where he stands now.</p>
              <p>on top of that dont you think he appears smug in most of the photos taken?</p>

              <p><strong>Carlos Tevez has taunted Manchester City over their ­Champions League exit.</strong></p>
              <p>The £200,000-a-week striker cracked up with laughter as a musician pal joked about the ­Premier League leader’s Euro ­failure after inviting him on stage to sing.</p>
              <p>The controversial striker laughed loudest as the pot-bellied crooner abused City by ranting, “Que se caguen!” In English, that translates as “F*** them”. Footage of Tevez and his friend, Juan Carlos Jimenez Rufino, was later loaded on to Youtube.</p>
              <p>The incident came as the player, who insists he has no intention of returning to ­England, holidayed with friends and family in Cordoba, 400 miles north west of Argentine capital ­Buenos Aires.</p>
              <p>Tevez, whose relationship with City fans nosedived ­after his touchline row with manager Roberto ­Mancini at Bayern Munich in September, slammed ­Manchester earlier in the year on Argentine TV.</p>
              <p>Tevez has no future with City. AC Milan believe they will land him in January, but their opening offer of a loan deal will not be accepted.</p>
              <p>Juventus and Paris St ­Germain will offer £22million permanent deals.</p>

              <p>i dont believe fully what mancini said.  but when they
              offered tevez a chance to apologize why didnt he take it? 
              what good does it do to his image and career being so stubborn?</p>
              <p>make  peace and then move on if he doesnt like mancini or
              man city.</p>
              <p>look at where he stands now.</p>
              <p>on top of that dont you think he appears smug in most of the
              photos taken?</p>

              <p>yes, he is in limbo, but seemingly, he is quite happy, partying @ his home town.. in the end, I think he should just go back to argie and play his football.</p>
