            <div class='col-md body'>Barcelona and Real Madrid yesterday moved level on points with Sevilla at the top of the Primera Liga. BarÃ§a returned to winning ways with a 3-0 victory over Gimnastic to reclaim top spot on goal difference following Sevilla's goalless draw at Villarreal on Saturday. While Real Madrid came away from a testing trip to Real Mallorca with a 1-0 win courtesy of a JosÃ© Antonio Reyes' free-kick. Osasuna had four players sent off in the last 11 minutes of their 1-0 defeat at AtlÃ©tico Madrid.<br><br>Internazionale strengthened their lead in Italy's Serie A, recording their 13th win in a row - 3-1 at home to Fiorentina - and going 11 points clear at the top. Fiorentina briefly threatened an upset when Luca Toni headed them into an early lead but goals by Dejan Stankovic, Adriano and Zlatan Ibrahimovic secured victory for Inter.<br><br>Second-placed Roma were held to a 1-1 draw at Livorno. The home side went ahead when Cristiano Lucarelli scored from the penalty spot after he had been fouled by Philippe MexÃ¨s. Francesco Totti equalised in the 74th-minute but he was later sent off for kicking out at the Livorno defender Fabio Galante.<br><br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/laligatab.jpg"></div>
