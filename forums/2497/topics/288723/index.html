Former chairman Peter Ridsdale claims OÂ’Leary must shoulder the lionÂ’s share of the blame for the meltdown at Leeds after TEN players refused to play for him. Ridsdale is adamant OÂ’Leary failed to realise just how deep the resentment was against him after he released his own Â‘tell-allÂ’ book while in charge.<br><br>It began when OÂ’Leary, who is being linked to replace Steve Staunton as Republic of Ireland manager, dropped keeper Paul Robinson. The current England No 1, now at Spurs, was in the team and playing out of his skin but was dumped in favour of Nigel Martyn.</strong><br><br>Ridsdale reveals: Â“The first crack was just before our FA Cup game against Liverpool in January 2001. Â“As the team left our hotel for the short trip to Elland Road, I saw Paul Robinson looking thunderous and close to tears. Â“I hurried up to him and tried grabbing his arm to ask what was wrong. Â“Â‘DonÂ’t talk to me nowÂ’, he said, Â‘but IÂ’ll tell you this Â— IÂ’ll never play for that b*****d againÂ’. Paul was young and still learning but one thing was true Â— he never did play for the manager again.<br><br>Â“Managers often have spats with players but, in such a closely-knit dressing room and involving such a popular young member of the squad, this seemed like the first red flag being raised from a spirited dressing room.Â” He added: Â“It galled me to see OÂ’Leary promoting his book Leeds United on Trial, which came out in January 2002. He broke the sacrosanct code of the dressing room by criticising players. Â“From my chairmanÂ’s office I could almost hear the teamÂ’s respect breaking up. Â“OÂ’Leary denied there was a dressing-room revolt. Â“But towards the end of the season a senior player asked to see me in my office and he said Â‘Mr Ridsdale, unless you change the manager I wonÂ’t sign a new contract. I also feel I represent the mood of most of the dressing room, the lads have lost it with the gafferÂ’.<br><br>Â“Lee Bowyer, Danny Mills, Rio Ferdinand all criticised the manager for washing dirty linen in public. Â“The managerÂ’s book was the cause and effect of the crisis that sent the club over the edge. Ten players, either directly or indirectly through their agents, said theyÂ’d be looking to move elsewhere if David OÂ’Leary remained as manager for the 2002-03 season.Â”<br><br>Ridsdale reckons the sale of Rio Ferdinand to Manchester United also exposed OÂ’Leary as being unable to cope with controversy. He writes: Â“At the board meeting EVERYONE, including the manager, agreed a valuation of Â£30million for Ferdinand. Â“In public, David distanced himself from such reality by describing the proposed sale as criminal. Whenever there was the slightest whiff of controversy or bad press, David ran a mile.Â”<br><br>OÂ’Leary stunned Ridsdale with his cheek when he attended a board meeting aimed at cutting costs. Ridsdale adds: Â“The future of the manager and the club was decided on May 31 2002 at Elland Road. David asked to attend so he could address the board in person. Â“I couldnÂ’t believe what I was hearing ... David was explaining how he needed another Â£23m for new players on top of the Â£97m heÂ’d already spent. "He tried to blame me for the poor season, he laid the blame at my door. I bit my lip and said nothing. I felt he was challenging the board with a subtle message Â‘ItÂ’s either the chairman or meÂ’. Â“I thought he wanted to attend to be contrite and say the right things to save his job. Instead he walked in, put the revolver to his head and pulled the trigger.<br><br>Â“David was summoned to Elland Road in the final week of June. I didnÂ’t mess around or soft soap him. Â‘I think for everyoneÂ’s sake you should move on and we should find a new managerÂ’. "The tension bristled between us but there were no signs of anger. He looked like someone who had been expecting it but he disagreed he had lost the dressing room. Â“He squandered a golden opportunity and his legacy will be: The man who gave Leeds one hell of a ride but won us nothing. Of course, the board must also carry the can. We spent too much, putting our money where his mouth was.Â”<br><br>United We Fall by Peter Ridsdale Â© Peter Ridsdale 2007. Published by Macmillan on November 2, priced Â£18.99.
