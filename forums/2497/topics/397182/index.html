              <p class="article">SunSport revealed yesterday the Manchester United boss is ready to step down after one more season.</p>
              <p class="article">Ferguson, 68, is convinced that Everton boss Moyes can provide the continuity United crave to keep them challenging for the top honours.</p>
              <p class="article">Jose Mourinho is the bookies' favourite and enjoys a close relationship with Ferguson from his time as a rival boss with Chelsea.</p>
              <p class="article">But the United hierarchy, including the influential Sir Bobby Charlton, are not convinced.</p>
              <p class="article">Ferguson knows fellow Glaswegian Moyes, 46, well and has constantly championed his achievements at Preston and now Everton.</p>
              <p class="article">He also believes it is right to give a good British manager the chance to take one of the big jobs in football.</p>

              <p>I think there is some good reason for it... Moyes is also a devotee to playing attractive attacking football, a believer of the youth system and the ability to keep his club among the big boys even though he has very little funds to manage over the years...</p>
              <p>But he is still very inexperience at the very top level, so... it is a risky choice but could be a good long term one though...</p>

              <p>I like the way Everton plays where every one on the pitch sings the same tune. Moyes focus alot on teamwork and that is where Everton thrives.</p>
              <p>But one thing to take note is Rooney didn't have a good relationship with Moyes after Moyes refusal to let him go to United initially. Moyes' appointment might be the catalyst to drive Rooney out of United. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>
              <p>As much as i hate to admit, I'd love to see Mourinho taking over Fergie. He has proven time and again that he's the tactical mastermind, the genius at winning games. He might be able to push United up another level. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>Mourinho may be good, but let's face it... He doesn't play good attractive football. And there is no guarantee he will be a success either, he is kind of strugglling right now to keep the Serie A for Inter despite having no serious challenger to begin with...</p>
              <p>Mourinho would probably be a short term manager, he doesn't stay with a club for very long cos of his behaviour. And he is also a magnet for unwanted problems and controversies.</p>

But for Man U, alot of the foundation has been set by Fergie and what the team needs is a person who shares the same ideal in managing a team with commerical sense to sustain the team both on the playing field and financially. Moyes can do that.</p></div>
