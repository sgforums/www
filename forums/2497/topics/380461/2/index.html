              <p>Jamie Carragher finally deserve what he got last night... He is
              like always pulling people down... Last week he got lucky by some
              strange luck the referee didn't show him a red. But this week, his
              luck ran out...</p>
              <p>And another thing it seems to prove me right, and that is Rafa
              can't motivate his players, the players motivate themselves
              when they come up against bigger sides... But against smaller ones,
              they can't do it and Rafa is clueless as well... If they gets a
              manager who knows how to motivate them like Mourinho, they
              could be Wow !</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Fulham boss Hodgson: I wished Rafa luck for Lyon</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fulham</span></abbr> boss Roy Hodgson was proud of his players after their 3-1 victory over <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Bobby Zamora put <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fulham</span></abbr> ahead and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fernando Torres</span></abbr> equalised in a first half in which <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> dominated possession.</p>
              <p>But when Erik Nevland put <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fulham</span></abbr> ahead for the second time and Torres had been substituted there was
              only one winner, Clint Dempsey scoring a late clincher for the home
              side.</p>
              <p>Hodgson said: "We had to work hard to keep them at bay. They
              had more possession than us and at one stage I couldn't see us holding
              out.</p>
              <p>"But we got closer to them in the second half. We started to
              create chances and took some of them. We're getting better as a team."</p>
              <p>He admitted he had not offered any sympathy to Benitez.</p>
              <p>"I would regard that as patronage," Hodgson said. "I just wished him luck for Wednesday."</p>
              <p>There is no chance Hodgson, however, will let his <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fulham</span></abbr> side get carried away with the result.</p>
              <p>He said: "We still have got a lot of work to do. I am preaching modesty and humility. To be in the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> and to be playing <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> is a wonderful achievement for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fulham</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>"It is important to keep our feet on the ground and we will have
              to because this year European competition is a huge stretch on our
              resources."</p>

              <p>2. When crouch is arnd, there was a plan B, which is long ball...however, crouch didn't really gt the liking from benitez for some unknown reason, n maybe crouch wasn't fast enuff for benitez, so he got the boot...yes, benitez may have spent as much as alex ferguson,but remember that the money was spent on getting a super gd player, paying off debts, and benitez has no choice but to use basement finds to boost the depth..</p>
              <p>3. maybe for benitez, he tinks that voronin got more creativity than babel, thus he gt the nod..</p>
              <p>Lastly, the current owners are more concerned with getting more $$ for themselves thna the team's result, n they probably do not have the $$ to break the contract they have with benitez.. in other words, if benitez dun resign, his job is as solid as a iron rice bowl..</p>

              <p>I have been thinking what is really wrong with Liverpool... And I kind of come to one significant point... I ask myself how can a team play so well not just once against top sides but on many occasions and then do so badly against the lower ones... and sometimes its just days apart only and not like months later...</p>
              <p>I feel it has to go down as a lack of motivational spirit among the players... Simply put, the manager isn't motivating them... Therefore, when the big teams come along, the players can automatically feel motivated just by the thougt of a big match. But when the average sides come up... They are clueless on how to contest and lack the fighting spirit that is required... Or like to put it in our own terms... Lets just say a match between 2 S league sides, and we can't bring yourself to get all excited about it right. Then even before the Pool and United derbies or the London derbies even start, we are all excited and ready to catch it whatever happens...</p>
              <p>I guess its like that lah... Just my thought. If they can beat the big sides, then no reason they can't do so against the smaller ones with the same squad they have currently... I guess they are just not motivated enough... But if they are, i think they can be quite a frightening side to play against...</p>

              dun moan to press....</p>
              <p>2. When crouch is arnd, there was a plan B, which is long
              ball...however, crouch didn't really gt the liking from benitez for
              some unknown reason, n maybe crouch wasn't fast enuff for benitez,
              so he got the boot...yes, benitez may have spent as much as alex
              ferguson,but remember that the money was spent on getting a
              super gd player, paying off debts, and benitez has no choice but to
              use basement finds to boost the depth..</p>
              <p>3. maybe for benitez, he tinks that voronin got more creativity
              than babel, thus he gt the nod..</p>
              <p>Lastly, the current owners are more concerned with getting more
              $$ for themselves thna the team's result, n they probably do not
              have the $$ to break the contract they have with benitez.. in other
              words, if benitez dun resign, his job is as solid as a iron rice
              bowl..</p>

Sure there comes a time when everyone's spirits is down and the manager or captain will need to come out and inspire or motivate the rest, but really its a disgrace to the fans and the people paying money to watch them put in displays worthy of friendlies. Be professional.</p></div>
