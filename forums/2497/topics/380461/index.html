              </span></p><p>Under-pressure Rafael Benitez endured another day to forget as nine-man <strong>Liverpool </strong>crashed to a 3-1 defeat against <strong>Fulham</strong>.</p>
              <p>Last week's win over Manchester United ended a run of five
              successive defeats but that became six from seven as goals from Bobby
              Zamora, Erik Nevland and Clint Dempsey earned Fulham the points.</p>
              <p>Fernando Torres had equalised just before the break but he was
              substituted in the second half. Nevland restored Fulham's lead and
              Philipp Degen and Jamie Carragher both saw red within three minutes
              before Dempsey rubbed salt in the wound.</p>

              <p>I watched the post match interview given by benitez and he blamed everything but his substitution of Torres (who was baffled by the decision) and Yossi Benayourn (who was also baffled and muttered some curse to himself).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How can he take out the best striker when the game is at 1-1?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How can he take out the last remaining creative player (yossi) when the team is 2-1 down?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What was benitez thinking????????????????????</p>
              <p>Nobody knw!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By doing that... he seems to given up on winning the match!!!</p>
              <p>At this rate, liverpool fans can forget about winning the EPL.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I absolutely LOL at his facial expression when he gave that interview.</p>

              <p>Jamie Carragher finally deserve what he got last night... He is like always pulling people down... Last week he got lucky by some strange luck the referee didn't show him a red. But this week, his luck ran out...</p>
              <p>And another thing it seems to prove me right, and that is Rafa can't motivate his players, the players motivate themselves when they come up against bigger sides... But against smaller ones, they can't do it and Rafa is clueless as well... If they gets a manager who knows how to motivate them like Mourinho, they could be Wow !</p>

              <p>Personally, I don't really belief Pool have that many injuries problems... Afterall, he is the manager that went 99 matches without playing the same team isn't he?</p>
              <p>I believe its more like Rafa was trying to chop and change his team which he usually does before a CL match... Johnson, Agger and Aurelio are being kept for the Lyon match on Wed... I think we will see all of them take to the field on Wed, and who knows... maybe even Gerrard might surprise us...</p>

              <p>The decision by Ah Ben to sub Benny and FT is correct.</p>
              <p>He was going for a draw and to preserve the strength of his squad for trip to Lyon.</p>
              <p>He need to qualify for CL next round for the money.</p>
              <p>Although he was the cause for the depth of the squad, he is just deploying what he have in his team.</p>
              <p>I dun think he is ever bothered by his critics cos he stand by his decision.</p>
              <p>As for the bickering from other fans, it only show their maturity about the game, the liverpool fans dun even bother about it.</p>

              <p>But I do believe not qualifying for next season's CL will cost even more than not getting to the 2nd stage this season... And according to the commentary, Benayoun was like upset at being taken off last night... There is no reason for him not to continue when their next match is like 4 days away still...</p>
              <p>City will prove to be their biggest rival for that 4th spot this season and I now I am starting to belief they can take it away...</p>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Rafael Benitez will appeal against both red cards after nine-man Liverpool slumped to a humiliating 3-1 defeat at Craven Cottage. Swiss defender Philipp Degen and captain Jamie Carragher were sent off for second-half fouls as Liverpool's Premier League hopes disintegrated, falling to their fifth league loss of the season. </strong></p>
              <p>But Benitez believed referee Lee Mason got both decisions wrong, saying Degen's foul on Clint Dempsey was no more than a yellow card while he maintained Carragher played the ball when he was adjudged to have brought down Bobby Zamora.</p>
              <p>Benitez said: "They were two incidents in a few minutes when we were losing and they were difficult to take. "The first one was a yellow card. The second one you can clearly see that Carragher was kicking the ball."</p>
              <p>Bobby Zamora put Fulham ahead and Fernando Torres equalised in a first-half in which Liverpool dominated possession. But when Erik Nevland put Fulham ahead for the second time and Torres had been substituted there was only one winner, Clint Dempsey scoring a late clincher for the home side.</p>
              <p>Benitez, however, was left wondering how Liverpool could have lost after enjoying so much possession. He said: "It's hard to take the defeat, especially when we were in control of the game. The first half was one-sided. We made one mistake and we conceded a goal.</p>
              <p>"The second half they were more offensive and we made a massive mistake when we conceded the second goal. We worked hard with nine players but it was very difficult."</p>
              <p>Benitez could now be without Torres and Steven Gerrard for the crucial Champions League clash against Lyon on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The Liverpool boss said he would "have to see how Gerrard progresses" with his troublesome groin injury, while Torres is still not fully fit.</p>
              <p>Benitez said: "We decided to play Fernando Torres against Manchester United (last Sunday) and it was a difficult decision because he was not 100% fit. He needed four days to be ready and is still not 100% fit. "We decided to put him on the pitch but we had to protect him and that's why we took him out after 60 minutes. I don't want to lose an important player like Fernando for one month."</p>
              <p>Benitez, however, dismissed talk of being under pressure, He said: "We have confidence we can do it but we have to take our chances and not make mistakes like today. You have to be calm and keep working hard and find solutions. "We have to be realistic. We have to get three points in the league in the next game against Birmingham."</p>
              <p>Fulham manager Roy Hodgson said: "We had to work hard to keep them at bay. They had more possession than us and at one stage I couldn't see us holding out. "But we got closer to them in the second half. We started to create chances and took some of them. We're getting better as a team.</p>
              <p>He admitted he had not offered any sympathy to Benitez. "I would regard that as patronage," Hodgson said. "I just wished him luck for Wednesday."</p>
              <p>There is no chance Hodgson, however, will let his Fulham side get carried away with the result. He said: "We still have got a lot of work to do. I am preaching modesty and humility. To be in the Premier League and to be playing Liverpool and Manchester United and Chelsea is a wonderful achievement for Fulham.</p>
              <p>"It is important to keep our feet on the ground and we will have to because this year European competition is a huge stretch on our resources."</p>
