              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/07/16/article-1035560-056071890000044D-206_306x423.jpg" alt="Wayne Bridge" width="306" height="423"></p>
              <p><em>Bridge: has agreed a new four-year deal worth £60,000-a-week even though he is expected to remain as understudy.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Wayne Bridge has warned Manchester United that he is determined to help Chelsea take the Premier and Champions League trophies away from Old Trafford next season after deciding to stay at Stamford Bridge.</strong></p>
              <p>Left-back Bridge, who was strongly linked with a move to Portsmouth, has agreed a new four-year deal worth £60,000-a-week even though he is expected to remain as understudy to Ashley Cole. The England international has been at Chelsea since moving from Southampton for £7million in 2003, but said the last campaign was his most painful yet in a blue shirt.</p>
              <p>Chelsea lost out to United in the Premier League on the last day of the campaign and then were beaten by Sir Alex Ferguson's men on a penalty shoot-out in the Champions League Final. It was the first season for four years that Chelsea have failed to win any silverware and Bridge has vowed to put things right.</p>
              <p>He said: 'My aim for Chelsea this season is to win as many trophies as possible. The one that hurt the most last season was the Champions League Final and we want to go on to win it this year. 'But everyone wants to win the Premier League because it proves you are consistent throughout the year and that is something we want to get back. We didn't win a trophy last season and want to get back to winning ways.'</p>
              <p>The 27-year-old has already made a big impact on new manager Luiz Felipe Scolari and is looking forward to doing battle with Cole for the left-back berth once again.</p>
              <p>'Chelsea play a lot of games in a season and every member of the squad is a world-class player so everyone is going to get their chance. When you get it you just want to do well. 'I love it here and hope to be here for another four years. I just want to play as many games as I can.'</p>
              <p>Scolari's double training sessions may already be putting the squad under strain, but Bridge believes the Brazilian has already proved his worth. He told Chelsea TV: 'The training under him is good. I wouldn't say I enjoy the running, but I like to get it under my belt and feel fit. Everyone is doing really well and it just shows how professional the players are.'</p>
