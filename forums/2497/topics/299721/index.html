Ballack makes his point to referee Phil Dowd</span><br><br>MICHAEL BALLACK has told Aston Villa boss Martin O'Neill: Don't call me a diver. O'Neill accused Ballack of taking a tumble to win a penalty during Villa's 4-4 draw at Chelsea yesterday. But the German midfielder insists Zat Knight deserved to be red-carded for the challenge which sent him crashing.</strong><br><br>Ballack fumed: "For me there is no discussion about this. "I had the ball and two guys, not just one, came and one pushed me. "It was a clear penalty."<br><br>Ballack was inspirational as Chelsea fought back from two goals down at Stamford Bridge. Andriy Shevchenko converted the spot-kick won by his team-mate on the stroke of half-time before smashing home the equaliser early in the second half.<br><br>Brazilian defender Alex put Avram Grant's men in front and Ballack restored the lead late on with a curling free-kick after Martin Laursen's equaliser. But his efforts were in vain as Ashley Cole followed Ricardo Carvalho for an early bath after handling the ball on the line. Gareth Barry converted from the spot to send Villa home with a share of the spoils.<br><br></div>
