              <h1>United hero David Beckham pins colours to the mast by backing fans' 
              green and gold protest<br></h1>

              </div>
              <p>Former Manchester
               United Manchester United hero David Beckham gave his own remarkable
               support to the Old Trafford green and gold campaign on Wednesday night.</p>
              <p>The
               England midfielder made an emotional return to the club where he made 
              his name, only to see a rampant United crush his AC Milan side.</p>
              <p>Beckham,
               however, still made sure that he grabbed the headlines as he plucked a 
              green and gold scarf from the pitch at full-time and draped it proudly 
              round his neck.<br>The campaign has grown every week since it was 
              launched in January as a symbol of defiance against the Glazer family 
              who own United.</p>
              <p>But Beckham’s gesture, watched from the 
              directors’ box by Avi Glazer, represents one of the most significant 
              moments yet.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/10/article-0-08AACD33000005DC-578_468x475.jpg" alt="david beckham" width="468" height="475">
              <p class="imageCaption">Evergreen and gold: Beckham walks off
              sporting the anti-Glazer colours </p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He said: ‘I am a Manchester United fan and I support
               the club. I
              always will. I saw the scarf there and just put it round my neck. It’s
              the old colours. That’s all I know. It’s nothing to do with me how it’s
              run. That’s to do with other people. I support the team.’</p>
              <p>Glazer had already endured a difficult night as Sir Alex Ferguson’s
              team put on a majestic performance against a backdrop of anti-Glazer
              protests.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>On the field, United’s performance was notable for two more goals
              from the remarkable Wayne Rooney. The striker has 30 this season and it
              is possible he could even beat the 42-goal haul of former United winger
              Cristiano Ronaldo from two seasons ago.</p>
              <p>United manager Ferguson said: ‘There’s a challenge for him now and
              he will be aiming for it. I was happy for him to get to 30 goals but he
              keeps improving. Tonight he was sensational. I thought our second-half
              performance was marvellous. When we play with that tempo we are
              difficult to play against.’</p>

              <p>On a dramatic night in Europe Ronaldo and Real Madrid went out 2-1
              to Lyon on aggregate. This removes one significant obstacle for United
              as they seek to reach the final for the third season running.</p>
              <p>Ferguson added: ‘With this team of ours it does not matter who we

              <p>The night was glorious for United but not so for Beckham. The former
              England captain was left on the bench at the start and did not appear
              on the field until the 62nd minute — seemingly with a tear in his eye.</p>
              <p>Beckham did threaten to score with one volley and almost set up a
              goal with a late cross. He received a rapturous ovation from the Old
              Trafford supporters and swapped shirts with Rio Ferdinand afterwards.</p>
              <p>Beckham said: ‘It was very nice to be back and yes it was emotional. I
               don’t know if I had a tear in my eye or not.</p>
              <p>‘It’s a disappointing night in terms of the result. They are a very
              good team. When you don’t start the game it’s always frustrating.</p>

              and lose together. I keep saying that Wayne Rooney is such an
              exceptional talent and that is obvious. Without doubt he’s one of the
              best players in the world at the moment.</p>
              <p>‘This is possibly the last time I will play at Old Trafford and I
              have been given some great memories from the fans. The way they gave me
              that reception was terrific and I’ll never forget it.’</p>

              <p>Ferguson added: ‘We expected that reception for David. I think he

              Normally they always applaud our players, the ones who have had great
              careers here.’</p>
              <p>Milan coach Leonardo conceded that United had ‘dominated’ and added
              his own tribute to Rooney, saying: ‘Rooney can grow up even more
              because he is still young. He’s a complete player, strong, fast and he
              works hard.</p>
              <p>'He does a lot of incredible movement and he’s playing in a system
              that is perfect for him. United play at such speed and often on the
              counter-attack. That system, with Rooney, is incredible.’</p>

              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>There were protests and there were prizes. A gold star for Wayne 
              Rooney; a green and gold scarf for David Beckham.</p>
              <p>And there was 
              yet another appearance in the Champions League quarter-finals to 
              celebrate for supporters who began this enchanted Old Trafford evening 
              applauding their remarkable young striker and ended it by turning, once 
              again, on their club’s American owners.</p>
              <p>For the aforementioned 
              Manchester United old boy, it amounted to quite a night. Far more 
              enjoyable, it has to be said, than it would have been for the other old 
              boys of AC Milan. This was as depressing an evening as this once great 
              side have had in Europe for many a year. Further evidence that they have
               become sporting geriatrics.</p>
              <p>Not that their suffering was of any 
              concern to Rooney and United. Inspired, once again, by their brilliant 
              England forward, United were sensational in the way they secured their 
              club’s first victory against the San Siro giants.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/10/article-1256992-08AAA838000005DC-258_468x374.jpg" alt="Wayne Rooney" width="468" height="374">

              </div>
              <p>Two more goals for Rooney. One each for the excellent Ji-Sung Park
              and the irrepressible Darren Fletcher. It was a battering almost as
              impressive as the one dished out by Arsenal the previous night.</p>
              <p>Rooney, presumably, is now off the naughty step and back in his 
              manager’s good books.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson appeared to be furious with him last week for 
              battling on against Egypt when it seemed he had aggravated a knee 
              injury. By
              Friday he was spitting mad, not least because it meant he would miss
              the Premier League trip to Wolves the following day and possibly even
              this European game.</p>
              <p>But Rooney returned to action here at Old Trafford and returned to
              what has now become a familiar routine. Another goal with his head. A
              second that enabled him to further demonstrate his ability as a 
              finisher. He was terrific, from the
              power and accuracy of the header to the burst of acceleration he
              produced to get to Nani’s ball and guide his finish beyond the reach of 
              Christian Abbiati before taking evasive action.</p>

              <p>That goal, scored shortly after the interval, took him to 30 this
              season and now even Ferguson will have to admit there is a good chance
              he will sail past Cristiano Ronaldo’s 2007-08 mark of 42 before the 
              campaign is over.</p>
              <p>United have waited a long time to beat Milan but
               they did so with
              ease in this last-16 tie, building on the 3-2 victory at the San Siro
              with a win that was surprisingly comfortable — so easy that Ferguson 
              took off Rooney after 66 minutes and still found himself celebrating an 
              extension to his team’s lead.</p>
              <p>It was over a good deal before that. After 13 minutes, to be 
              precise,because that was how long it took for Rooney to score the first 
              goal
              and leave Milan needing three to progress beyond this round.</p>
              <p>United performed much like Arsenal had done against Porto. With great
               urgency and desire, a real sense
              of purpose. Rooney was first to threaten and then Gary Neville, yes
              Gary Neville, followed that up with a left-foot effort that flew only
              just over the bar.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Milan did respond, threatening with a header from Ronaldinho. But
              when Neville sent in a cross Beckham would have been proud to deliver,
              Rooney took advantage of truly awful defending. In doing so, he
              extended a remarkable run to seven successive goals with his head. And
              nine headers in 11.</p>
              <p>Milan were nothing like as energetic as they 
              had been in the first half at the San Siro. There were
              flashes of skill, most notably from Andrea Pirlo and Ronaldinho. And a
              powerfully struck shot from Pirlo tested Edwin van der Sar.</p>
              <p>But in the absence of the injured Pato, their brilliant young 
              Brazilian striker, they lacked spark. Leonardo should have sent on

              <p>Leonardo made a different change at the break, replacing the hapless
              Daniele Bonera with Clarence Seedorf. But to no avail. No sooner had
              the contest resumed than Nani was sending Rooney into the box with a
              super ball from the left.</p>
              <p>And when Park then sprinted on to a delightful pass from Paul
              Scholes and beat Abbiati with an excellent right-foot shot shortly
              before the hour, it was simply left to Beckham to lap up the applause
              and say the final farewell that was denied him when he joined Real
              Madrid in the summer of 2003.</p>

              <p>Beckham received the biggest cheer of the night, and went close to
              scoring when he unleashed a super volley that forced Van der Sar into
              an excellent save.</p>
              <p>But the goals were only going to come from United, their fourth
              materialising in the form of a cross from Rafael da Silva and a neatly
              executed header from Fletcher two minutes before the end.</p>
              <p>By then, the fans had turned their attention to the Glazers, which
              must have made it particularly unpleasant for Avi and Joel, seated here
              last night among the directors.</p>
              <p>The darling of those same disgruntled fans, Beckham only added to the
               Glazers’ pain by picking up a green
              and golf scarf that had been thrown in his direction and wrapping it 
              around his neck.</p>
              <p>Is he one of these Red Knight characters? Probably not, but the 
              recruitment drive starts here.</p>

              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has hailed Ji-sung Park for destroying AC Milan and sending </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> into the quarter-finals of the Champions League.</strong></p>
              <p>Wayne Rooney scored four of United's goals in their 7-2 aggregate win, taking his tally for the season to 30 with a double in the 4-0 win at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>But Park and Darren Fletcher were also on target and manager Ferguson singled out the South Korea international for the way he man-marked Andrea Pirlo and stopped Milan's midfield from playing.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">'Park was the key to our game,' Ferguson told MUTV. 'We can talk about Rooney – and he was great – but Park’s discipline, intelligence and sacrifice won us the match tactically. Pirlo is such an important player for them.'<br><br>Club captain Gary Neville, who never gave Ronaldinho an inch, agreed with his manager, adding: 'I don’t know if it was easy out there [against Ronaldinho], but you have to look at the work Ji-sung Park did, stopping the forwards getting the service.</p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>

              <p><strong>'A player like Ronaldinho is difficult to mark if he gets good service but I was able to get close to him.</strong></p>
              <p>'That result gives us confidence. We’ve done well in the European Cup in the last two seasons and now we’re in the quarter-finals again. But we know in this competition that anything can happen.</p>
              <p>'There are a lot of good teams left in the competition. Hopefully the draw [made on Friday 19 March] will be kind to us.'</p>

              <p><br>As new_b has said it... That's the way it went... If you had watch the match you will know what I meant... Park stick to him like super glue until he hardly got time on the ball alone or had to rush whenever he gets the ball... lol.</p>
