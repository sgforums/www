              <div class="content">
              <p>Pep Guardiola's delays in signing a new deal with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Barcelona</span></abbr> is over his demands the club signs <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> captain Cesc Fabregas.</p>
              <p>The <em>Daily Star</em> says Guardiola is adamant the Gunners
              skipper should be signed in the summer. Guardiola has so far signed a
              year-on-year deal, but is holding out at the moment because he wants to
              make sure the club are committed to landing Fabregas.</p>
              <p>The matter is complicated by the fact their will be
              presidential elections this summer. But Guardiola is believed to want
              all prospective candidates to make Fabregas the central player in their
              transfer strategy.</p>
              <p>A source close to the 38-year-old manager, who Fabregas has
              admitted was his idol, said: “There is no way that Guardiola will not
              sign a new contract and he can almost write out his own terms for what
              he has already achieved.</p>
              <p>“But he wants to make sure that he gets his staff the contracts he wants and that there is a commitment to Fabregas.</p>
              <p>“It will be an important signing for them this summer and any new president will want to keep Guardiola happy.”</p>

              <h2 style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">REAL MADRID president Florentino Perez's bid to prise Cesc Fabregas away from Arsenal has been dubbed 'Operation Cesc' in Spain. </h2>
              <p>Perez and his director general Jorge Valdano have held summit talks over a £43million summer bid for the midfield ace - and how they can knock deadly rivals Barcelona out of the running. </p>
              <p>Arsenal are desperate to hang on to their captain but might be willing to talk if Real's £25m-rated striker Gonzalo Higuain is thrown into the bargain. </p>
              <p>Against that, Barca hope to weigh in with a straight £40m bid. If that fails, an alternative is to offer unsettled Ivory Coast midfielder Yaya Toure, brother of former Gunners defender Kolo, plus £30m. </p>
              <p>Barca president Joan Laporta has already promised "to fight for the kid" who played for the club as a teenager. </p>
              <p>A Real insider revealed: "The price demanded is £43m and that is what we are basing our calculations on. </p>
              <p>"This is 'Operation Cesc', which we hope will prove a blow to Barcelona."</p>

              <p>But departure of Ronaldo to R Madrid won't <strong>affect greatly </strong>as there still got many midfielders like Valencia (replacement of CR 7), Fletcher etc... to provide for goals to the frontline: topscorer Rooney, Berbatov and retained 2nd position (but Arsenal one match on hand) and even though Man U is not as good as last season since departure of prize asset CR7.</p>

              <p><br>To add on:</p>
              <p>2) Tottenham is another club whose manager Harry Redknapp signed the former players back: Chimbonda (from Sunderland), Robbie Keane (From Liverpool) and Defoe (from Portsmouth)</p>
              <p>Only two of the players stayed (who were hardcore Hotspur playersonce: Defoe was sold to Portsmouth by Ramos as he did not have any 1st team oppourtunity, Keane was sold to Liverpool as Kops had a better offer) but Chimbonda (whom left Spurs to Sunderland, then back to Spurs) left again for Blackburn.......</p>
              <p>So, under Redknapp, Keane and Defoe had found their momentum (during Martin Jol's era) back and Defoe fired Hotpurs into top 5. (But Man City one match on hand)  However, inconsistency counts for Spurs as even though they thrashed 9-1 against Wigan, they sufferred from 1-0 home loss to Wolverhampton. Against top elites, they only managed to win against Liverpool, the rest all lost.........</p>

              <p>looking at ramsey, merida, wilshere performances lately, how can AW or arsenal let go of fabregas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if i am fabrgas, why would you want to go barca or real?</p>
              <p>1. real already has alonso, if fab goes, either one of them will be bench.</p>
              <p>2. already has iniesta, xavi or many more creative players, why would fabregas risk it ? hasent he seen what happen to Helb?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but come to it, if barca or real make a 200k/week offer, i would say what the heck of warming a bech if it pay you 200k/week to do so.</p>
