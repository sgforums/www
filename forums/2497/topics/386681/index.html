              <h1>Toffees suspend AWOL striker Jo</h1>
              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Everton have suspended on-loan Manchester City
              striker Jo for a breach of club discipline after he returned to Brazil
              without permission.</span></strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/09/09/330/Jo-Hull-City-Everton-Carling-Cup-Third-Round_2364293.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Jo, who has been suffering from a knee injury,
              is understood to have returned to his native Brazil for Christmas
              without permission from Toffees boss David Moyes.</p>
              <p>Everton have now decided to act and they have suspended the
              striker from the club, meaning he will not be available for the FA Cup
              tie with Carlisle.</p>
              <p>"We like Jo and he has been a really good lad. We have enjoyed
              having him, but there has to be discipline at all football clubs," said
              Moyes.</p>
              <p>"He left over a busy period for us and left us short of players. I found it very difficult so he's suspended from the club."</p>
              <p>Asked if it was a short-term punishment for the player, Moyes
              said: "At the moment, yes. It might change in the coming weeks but at
              the moment, that is the situation."</p>
              <p>The news casts a doubt over Jo's long-term future at Goodison
              Park with the player due to stay on Merseyside until the end of the
              current campaign.</p>
              <p>Jo initially joined Everton on loan during last winter's transfer window and he returned in a similar deal in the summer.</p>
              <p>The 22-year-old has found it difficult to hold down a place in Moyes' side this season and has scored only two goals this term.</p>

              <p><strong>Jô, the Brazil striker, has effectively been "sent home" to Manchester City 
                  in disgrace by Everton after going absent without leave. </strong></p>
              <p>It is a development not expected by Roberto Mancini, the new City manager, 
                  and perhaps not desired, either. The Italian already has six strikers to keep 
                  happy. Jô, who was due to spend the season on loan at Goodison Park, would not 
                  rank in the top five and his career at City would seem bleak, too.</p>
              <p>David Moyes, the Everton manager, suspended Jô yesterday after he had 
                  travelled to Brazil for "personal reasons" for a two-week break without gaining 
                  permission. "He is now back but is suspended at the present time," Moyes said. 
                  "I am disappointed. We like Jô. He has been a really good lad and we have 
                  enjoyed having him.</p>
              <p>"But there has to be discipline at all football clubs. He left over a busy 
                  period when we were short of players. I found it very difficult, so he is 
                  suspended from the club. It might not be indefinite. I need to see how it is, 
                  but I feel right now that I have to take some action."</p>
              <p>Moyes might be appearing to keep his options open, with Everton facing a 
                  potentially awkward FA Cup third-round tie at home to Carlisle United today. He 
                  is short of forwards, with Yakubu Ayegbeni having joined the Nigeria squad for 
                  the African Cup of Nations and Louis Saha absent with a hamstring injury.</p>
              <div id="related-article-links">
              <p>Privately, however, he has washed his hands of Jô. "He doesn’t want him," a 
                  club source said. "His Everton career is now over." Everton officials will 
                  discuss the cancellation of the loan deal as soon as possible.</p>
              <p>Jô’s abrupt exit, rather conveniently, will assist Moyes in the January 
                  transfer window. The Scot has little — if any — funds with which to manoeuvre 
                  over the next four weeks and will have to rely on loan agreements. Only two 
                  loans are allowed from fellow Premier League clubs, with Jô having filled one of 
                  those berths at Goodison. His departure frees the slot, giving Moyes a full 
                  complement to work with. If it assists Moyes, it can only hinder Mancini. He is 
                  spoilt for choice in the strike department, with Roque Santa Cruz, Emmanuel 
                  Adebayor, Benjani Mwaruwari, Carlos Tévez, Craig Bellamy and Robinho to choose 
                  from.</p>
              <p>Although Adebayor will be with Togo for the African Cup of Nations this 
                  month, Jô is still likely to remain a peripheral figure at the City of 
                  Manchester Stadium. Mancini will also hope that his return does not prove 
                  disruptive to Robinho.</p>
              <p>Last season, Mark Hughes, Mancini’s predecessor, struggled to keep control of 
                  the Brazilian "clan" of Robinho, Jô and Elano.</p>
              <p>With Elano having left for Galatasaray in Turkey last summer and Jô at 
                  Everton, it was widely recognised that Robinho appeared more settled.</p>
              <p>Jô, 22, last played for Everton in the 3-3 draw with Chelsea three weeks ago, 
                  during which he injured a knee. He had scored two goals this season, in the 4-0 
                  wins over AEK Athens in the Europa League and Hull City in the Carling Cup third 
                  round. He had done well on a shorter loan period with Everton at the end last 
                  season, scoring five goals in 12 games.</p>
              <p>City signed Jô on a four-year contract from CSKA Moscow in July 2008 for what 
                  was then a club-record fee of £18 million, but the player failed to adapt to 
                  life there.</p>
