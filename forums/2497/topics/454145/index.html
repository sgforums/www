              <p class="body ">Arsenal have slapped a £30 million price tag on striker Robin van Persie.</p>
              <p class="body ">The Dutch striker has so far failed to agree an extension to his current deal which has just one season left.</p>
              <p class="body ">The club are willing to make Van Persie the highest earner in the club’s history with an offer close to £130,000-a-week.</p>
              <p class="body ">But Gunners chairman Peter Hill-Wood ­admitted that if ­another club offers Van Persie £250,000 a week, then ­Arsenal would not be able to compete.</p>
              <p class="body "> </p>

              <p class="body "> </p>
              <p class="body ">Arsenal have not given up hope of keeping their captain, but if he insists on leaving the price will be high.</p>
              <p class="body ">Van Persie is being tracked by Manchester City and ­Juventus.</p>
              <p class="body ">Paris St Germain, funder by Qatari owners, are also keeping tabs on developments.</p>
              <p class="body ">Russian League big spenders Anzhi, managed by Guus Hiddink, would also top any contract offer to Van Persie. But the 28 year-old striker does not want to be based in Moscow. This ­summer’s debate will revolve around Van Persie’s willingness to commit his future to Arsenal.</p>
              <p class="body ">If he can’t do that the London club will take any £30m offer – even one from a rival Premier League club like champions City.</p>

              <p class="body "> </p>
              <p class="body ">If no-one matches that valuation, then ­manager Arsene Wenger is happy to keep Van Persie at The Emirates and allow his contract to run down in June 2013.</p>
              <p class="body ">That would make the player a free agent in a year’s time but he would also be approaching his 30th birthday and his market value will have dipped and he would be ­unlikely to command a salary in excess of Arsenal’s current offer.</p>
              <p class="body ">Arsenal will also have bolstered their strike force by the start of the season.</p>
              <p class="body ">Lukas Podoloski has already joined from Cologne for £10m and a deal for a similar sum has been agreed with new French champions Montpellier for striker ­Olivier Giroud. If Van Persie stays at the club to see out his contract Giroud will have a full season to adapt to the Premier League.</p>
              <p class="body ">But there is also a question mark about the ­future of Theo Walcott. The England winger also has one-year left on his contract but talks about a new deal have reached deadlock.</p>
              <p class="body ">The two parties are still some distance from agreement and Walcott could be on the move in the summer.</p>

              isnt 28 a bit too to justify 30 million?

              <p>Chelsea bought Shevchenko for $30.8m when he was about 29 going on to 30 didn't they?</p>
              <p>I guess it would take a big money offer to persuade gunners to sell.</p>
              <p>Anyway, for that $30m, they can re-new their strike force with German striker Podoloski and ­Olivier Giroud and still may have $10m balanced... lol.</p>
              <p>Oh and not to forget still got Nicklas Bendtner... His stock have probably up since he went to Sunderland on loan and now after his Euro showing...</p>
              <p>In the end, Arsenal renew their squad an still make a profit... lol...</p>
