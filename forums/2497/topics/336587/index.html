              <p>It's one of the biggest games in the Premier League calendar and, prior to Chelsea's emergence as a superpower, it was <em>the </em>rivalry
              in English football, even temporarily surpassing the likes of
              Liverpool-Everton and Arsenal-Tottenham Hotspur for uncontrollable
              tempers, box-office build-up and fiery fall-out, even though it lacked
              the comparitive history.<br><br>Now, though the rivalry is not quite so
              heated, the gamesmanship remains and the egos are as fragile as ever.
              So, looking at past encounters as well as the current state of each
              club, we asked a global panel of editors to give their thoughts on what
              will happen tomorrow at the Emirates Stadium...<br><br><strong>1) Wenger won't see it</strong><br><br>It
              just wouldn't be a big game in the Premier League if Arsene 'eagle-eye'
              Wenger didn't become unsighted at the most conveniently controversial
              moment in the game that ended up favouring his side. Rest assured, if
              the Gunners get a favourable call, the Frenchman will decline to
              comment on the incident until he's seen it again - but if it goes
              against him, he'll know the name, shirt number, birth date, blood type,
              favourite food and head size of every player involved and be filing a
              report to the FA faster than you can say 'Martin Keown'. (Sulmaan
              Ahmad, Goal.com International)<br><br><strong>2) Rio gaffe to gift Gunners a golden opportunity</strong><br><br>At
              some point during the match, Rio Ferdinand will succumb to his
              bi-weekly moment of madness and gift Arsenal a wonderful scoring chance
              that will most likely end in a goal. The usually stable Englishman has
              been known to show cracks in the past, and in a huge match for United,
              it could all come undone - only once mind you - and it will still spell
              big trouble for the visitors. (Shane Evans, Goal.com USA)<br><br><strong>3) Excuses, excuses...</strong><br><br>It
              goes without saying that whichever manager ends on the losing side will
              open with the excuse of a European hangover. "What do you expect when
              we had a Champions league game in midweek and then play on Saturday
              lunchtime? It is as if the Premier League doesn't want us to be
              successful." Come on, you hear it too... (John Duerden, Goal.com Asia)<br><br><strong>4) Cristiano Ronal-dove</strong><br><br>Gael
              Clichy will eventually make the fatal mistake of touching Cristiano
              Ronaldo in or around the vicinity of the penalty area, which will
              result in the Portuguese bringing into action his deckchair-like
              collapsable legs. Sir Alex Ferguson, however, will lament the lack of a
              penalty award and claim his players are facing unfair treatment from
              Premier League referees, unlike those in Europe. He will also find a
              way to squeeze in a mention of Steven Gerrard's spectacular 94th-minute
              cannonball dive midweek at Anfield. (Torsten Pauly, Goal.com Germany)<br><strong><br>5) Bleus to outnumber Brits</strong><br><br>Ever
              since Arsene Wenger's arrival in London, Arsenal have become their own
              little French colony. Some even said, with tongue firmly in cheek, they
              had unfair home advantage in the 2006 Champions League final, which
              they lost to Barcelona in Paris. When considering new signings Samir
              Nasri and, coincidentally, former United man Mikael Silvestre, added to
              the likes of Clichy, William Gallas and Bakary Sagna - plus Patrice
              Evra lining up for United and injuries to the likes of Owen Hargreaves
              and Paul Scholes - there is a good chance France will be the best
              represented nation in England's capital tomorrow afternoon. (Alexandre
              Walraevens, Goal.com France)<br><br><strong>6) Ronaldo to flop, Real rumours won't stop</strong><br><br>Score
              in Champions League finals and multiple clashes against big four
              opposition last year as he may have done, some still believe C Ron to 
              be a big game flop. Should he for any reason prove to be outfoxed at
              the Emirates and leave the field sporting his trademark tantrum face
              then it is likely only to be a matter of time before someone, somewhere
              decides this means he will soon restart his push to for his dream move
              to Real Madrid. Also, Manuel Almunia may or may not take to the field
              draped in an English flag, singing 'God Save The Queen'. (Juan Lirman,
              Goal.com Spain)<br><br><strong>7) The Nutty Professor</strong><br><br>If the
              Gunners lose, Arsene Wenger will repeat, for the billionth time: "You
              must remember that this is a young side with great quality, attitude,
              and team spirit. It's a long season and we can still win the league."
              There will be pleas for more time, so he can continue to make his young
              side even younger year after year and somehow make that an excuse for
              continued failure to bring home silverware. Also, if Arsenal are
              leading with 10 minutes remaining, Wenger will bring on secret weapons
              Alex Song and Emannuel Eboue as strikers, to increase the team's goal
              threat. (Atishay Agarwal, Goal.com India)<br><br><strong>8) Edwin's redemption</strong><br><br>With
              his very place in the side under threat, experienced shot-stopper Edwin
              van der Sar will, if given the chance, prove his worth to the Red
              Devils tomorrow and put in an excellent performance. However, with
              shades of Euro 2008 and the Netherlands' elimination against Russia,
              van der Sar's heroics won't prevent the Gunners emerging victorious and
              leaving Edwin empty-handed. (Andre Trompers, Goal.com Netherlands)<br><br><strong>9) No shakes and the return of pizzagate</strong><br><br>However,
              if United should emerge winners after an emphatic 4-0 thrashing in
              which the champions give Arsenal a footballing lesson, Arsene Wenger
              will embark down the tunnel without offering so much as a handshake to
              Sir Alex Ferguson, who yesterday celebrated the 22nd anniversary in
              charge of the club. Might their feud finally resurface with their
              common enemy now plying his trade in the Inter hotseat? Also, after
              hitting the back of the net, the Red Devils may just perform a special
              celebration as a dedication to their legendary manager's continued
              longevity at Old Trafford. (Sergio Stanco and Daniele Perticari,
              Goal.com Italy)<br><br><strong>10) And for the grand finale...</strong><br><br>In
              a devious plot to unsettle the Red Devils, Arsene Wenger will invite
              Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon as a guest for the game tomorrow
              and after several taunts during the course of the game, Fergie will
              snap and aim a kung-fu kick at the Spanish supremo, causing injuries so
              severe that he is forced to sell €80 million star Ronaldo as
              compensation to los Blancos. Meanwhile, Arsenal will win the day and
              leapfrog United in the table. (Michael Paterakis, Goal.com Greece)</p>
