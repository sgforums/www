Following his move to West Ham this week, Ljungberg argued his former club lacked ambition and their glory days were over.</strong><br><br>Arsenal lost 1-0 against Salzburg here on Wednesday night but French defender Clichy said: "I don't think Arsenal lack ambition. "I don't know why Freddie said that. He has had nine great seasons with Arsenal and he's entitled to his opinion but I've got a different opinion. "We know we've got the quality, the strength. Everyone is confident, we have signed new players and we are going to have a great season.<br><br>"For two years we hear Arsenal are not competitive any more but last season we won both matches against Manchester United, drew both against Chelsea with what is supposed to be a young team, so I don't know what's wrong with that. "We have a few new players who have added more quality to the team and the boss is one of the best managers."<br><br>Arsenal's already youthful squad is even more inexperienced following the departures of Ljungberg and Thierry Henry but Clichy does not seen it as a problem. He said: "Of course it is difficult to lose a player like Thierry, who is one of the best strikers in the world. But I think we have plenty of qualities, everyone can see it, and I think this year will be a big one for Arsenal."<br><br>Sweden international Ljungberg was critical of the Gunners and their title chances following his switch to West Ham. However, former team-mate Gael Clichy sees no reason why next season cannot be a "big one" for Wenger's emerging squad. "I do not think Arsenal lack ambition," the full-back told the London Evening Standard. "I do not know why Freddie has said that. He has had nine great seasons with Arsenal and he is entitled to his opinion - but I have got a different opinion.<br><br>"We know we have got the quality, the strength. "Everyone is confident, we have signed new players and we are going to have a great season. "For two years we hear Arsenal are not competitive any more - but we won both matches against Manchester United last season, and drew twice with Chelsea with what is supposed to be a young team, so I do not know what is wrong with that.<br><br>"We have a few new players who have added more quality to the team and the boss is one of the best managers." Clichy added: "Of course it is difficult to lose a player like Thierry, who is one of the best strikers in the world - but we have plenty of qualities, everyone can see it, and I think this year will be a big one for Arsenal."<br><br></div>
