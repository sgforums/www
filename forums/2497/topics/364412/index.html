              *Real Madrid Offer Nine Players To Premier League Clubs â€“ Report*
              .
              
              Los Blancos are hoping to recuperate some of the â‚¬165.6 million spent on Kaka and Cristiano Ronaldo this summer...
              .
              .
              
              *According to a report in the British broadsheet The Guardian, Spanish giants Real Madrid have offered the services of nine players to clubs in the Premier League.*
              
              Los Blancos have already spent big signing Kaka from Milan and are poised to splash out even more cash on Cristiano Ronaldo, who appears set to complete a record breaking move from Manchester United. The combined total of these transactions will come to more than â‚¬165 million.
              
              It is thought that Los Merengues are keen to add a striker to their squad, with Valencia's David Villa their preferred choice and Atletico Madrid's Diego Forlan earmarked as a back-up. Meanwhile, the possibility of moving for Bayern Munich's Franck Ribery still remains. 
              
              However, it is believed that funds are tighter now at the Santiago Bernabeu and a whole host of players will be shipped out in order to raise more money.
              
              Argentine duo Gabriel Heinze and Javier Saviola, Mali international midfielder Mahamadou Diarra and the Dutch contingent of Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Arjen Robben, Rafael van der Vaart, Wesley Sneijder and Royston Drenthe have been made available to purchase.
              
              It has been reported that Juventus are keen to snap-up Diarra, although those claims have recently been quashed.
              
              Meanwhile, The Daily Mirror has linked Tottenham Hotspur with Van Nistelrooy and Sneijder, although The Sun writes that the former's wage demands could scupper any potential deal.
              
              Apparently, Los Merengues are hoping to bring in around â‚¬100m (Â£84.5m) from sales.

              <p>Omg, Real madrid rather sell Mahamadou Diarra and keep the stupid looking Lassana (with an even more stupid name on the shirt "LASS") bought from a lowly english club at an overpriced rate.</p>
              <p>If i remember correctly, this Mahamadou Diarra was an expensive purchase from Lyon, touted as 'even better than Michael Essien' after Essien's sale to Chelsea.</p>

              <h1 class="main-headline">Real deny tout claims</h1>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Real Madrid have denied reports suggesting they have faxed English clubs touting a number of their players. </strong></p>
              <p>It had been claimed that the Primera Liga giants had
              sent a list of those available for transfer this summer to a host of
              Premier League sides.</p>
              <p>With Florentino Perez currently embarking
              on a major rebuilding programme at Santiago Bernabeu, the club are keen
              to free up space within their squad.</p>
              <p>Kaka has already been
              acquired, with Cristiano Ronaldo also on his way in a record breaking
              deal, but more high-profile arrivals are expected.</p>
              <p>Perez has
              previously been quoted as saying that up to 10 members of the Real
              squad could be offloaded in order to bring the playing staff down to 25.</p>
              <p>However,
              Los Blancos have categorically denied that their efforts to trim their
              squad has seen them offer certain players to other teams.</p>
              <p>"Several Spanish media outlets today [Thursday] reproduced a report originally published by the English newspaper <em>The Guardian</em>, alleging that Real Madrid has offered players to certain Premier League clubs via fax," read a statement on the club's <em>official website</em>.</p>
              <p>"Real
              Madrid categorically denies such allegation, which if accurate would be
              absolutely disrespectful to the members of the team."</p>

              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Real Madrid</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> have warned Arjen Robben that they are prepared to leave him out of their squad next season if he refuses to leave the club this summer. The Dutchman is not keen to leave the Santiago Bernabéu and his father responded to reports of a move to Tottenham Hotspur by </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">insisting there was "no way" his son would sign for the White Hart Lane club</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">. But Robben has been left in little doubt as to his position at Madrid.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The club's director general, Jorge Valdano, has admitted: "It would be better if Robben listened to the offers coming in for him." And it has now emerged that he has threatened the Dutchman with the possibility of being banished to the stands in a World Cup year if he insists on staying. Robben risks being left without a squad number and not being registered for<span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #000000;">La Liga</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span>or the Champions League.</p>
              <p>Madrid consider Robben too injury prone to stay at the Bernabéu and have earmarked Bayern Munich's Franck Ribéry to occupy his position on the left of the attack. The club's adviser, Zinedine Zidane, has said that Madrid "will do all we can to sign Ribery". Although sources at the club play down its significance, Robben is not helped by his status as Ramon Calderon's marquee signing – the one promise the former president kept.</p>
              <p>However, the central reason for wanting to sell Robben is financial, as Madrid seek to recoup some of the money spent on Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka and to raise cash to make more signings this summer. Madrid already have 30 players in their squad and plan to sign as many as five more, with the president, Florentino Pérez, tonight claiming the transfer of David Villa was "just a matter of time". Spanish league rules allow for only 25 first-team squad members.</p>
              <p>That has left Madrid looking to offload as many as nine current players and Robben is top of the list. He is the one expendable player for whom Madrid believe they can command a major fee. He joined the club for £24m from Chelsea two years ago and Madrid remain hopeful that, after an impressive second half to the last campaign, he could bring in as much as £30m.</p>
              <p>Madrid will have been encouraged in their pursuit of the <span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span><span style="color: #000000;"> midfielder Xabi Alonso after he failed to dismiss suggestions that he was looking to leave Anfield. Asked by the Cadena Ser radio station if he would be disappointed having to stay at Liverpool next season, he responded: "I can't answer that question." To which the interviewer replied: "And with that you have said it all."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Meanwhile </span><span style="color: #005689;">Barcelona have met representatives of Alonso's current midfield partner, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Javier Mascherano.</span> A two-hour meeting was held between Mascherano's agent, Walter Tamer, and Barcelona in the Rey Juan Carlos I hotel in the Catalan capital. Barcelona, however, believe the ball is in Liverpool's court and Rafael Benítez says the Argentinian is not for sale.</p>

              robben is his hamstring like, like giggs afflicted by hamstring many years ago.
              
              just dun play him often can le and use him sparingly and build up his hamstring to prevent relapse. he is still pacy and can trouble defences.
