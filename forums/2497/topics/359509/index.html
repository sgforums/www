              <p>Chelsea boss Guus Hiddink had a dig at Arsene Wenger's Arsenal after last night's thumping.</p>
              <p>Hiddink said: "Securing third place gives me and everyone inside great satisfaction, considering the situation in February.</p>
              <p>"The players have reacted perfectly and I am very proud."</p>
              <p>Sunday's result was Arsenal's heaviest home defeat to Chelsea in the league since 1960.</p>
              <p>Hiddink observed: "It shows, first of all, that Chelsea are one of the
              two or three biggest clubs performing in Europe - but it will also give
              Arsenal a lot to think about.</p>
              <p>"It might be a considerable blow and show them what they have to do."</p>

              <p>I agree.  Hiddink is a world class manager. The amount of respect he receives back in Holland and South Korea is unbelivable.. The guy's a genius tactician and he's really good at being an underdog in BIG occasions..</p>
              <p>I hope he stays at Chelsea after this season.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Ashley Cole added insult to </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Arsenal</strong></span></a><strong>'s injured pride by claiming a trip to the Emirates was just what </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea </strong></span></a><strong>needed after crashing out of Europe. The Blues inflicted Arsenal's worst home league defeat for 32 years with the 4-1 thrashing, bouncing back from their fiery Champions League exit to Barcelona in midweek.</strong></p>
              <p>The club are set to be charged by UEFA this week for failing to control their players during and after last Wednesday's semi-final, and Didier Drogba, Michael Ballack and Jose Bosingwa face charges over their treatment of referee Tom Henning Ovrebo.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Chelsea's playing style was also heavily criticised in Spain after their negative approach in the goalless first leg at the Nou Camp.</p>
              </div>
              <p>But Cole, a none-too-popular former Gunner, believes the defeat of Arsenal shows they are not the enemies of football. </p>
              <div class="relatedItemsTopBorder">'We know there are a lot of strong emotions in football and sometimes when you haven’t kicked a ball you can’t talk about those emotions and you don’t understand,' the England left-back told London's <span style="font-style: italic;">Evening Standard</span>.</div>
              <p>'Against Arsenal we showed how good we are. We didn’t get in too many battles or too many fights this time. The lads have done well. </p>

              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/05/11/article-1180430-04E25402000005DC-38_306x560.jpg" alt=" Alex rises above Mikel Silvestre" width="306" height="560">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Head boy: Alex rises above Mikel Silvestre to score for Chelsea</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>'A lot of people would have thought we’d all be down and out, but we showed a lot of character. At times we defended really well and now we’ve clinched third spot.'</strong></p>
              <p>Cole said the 'mood was down' during training on Thursday and Friday and added: 'Everyone’s disappointed when you lose in the semi-final of the Champions League. It’s life and there is nothing we can do about it.</p>
              <p>'The players here have got great character. I have played with a lot of big players, but at Chelsea they seem to be able to motivate themselves very quickly. It showed against Arsenal and it had to show.'</p>
              <p>The 28-year-old is never likely to be warmly received at Arsenal after the nature of his departure to Chelsea three years ago. But Cole taunted the Emirates boo-boys for helping him to recover from the crushing disappointment of defeat against Barcelona.</p>
              <p>Asked if he found it hard to play so soon after the European exit, he said: 'It was easy for me but I have different reasons for that. Coming back to my old club, I hate losing to Arsenal so it means I’m more motivated.'</p>
              <p>Referring to the abuse from fans, he said: 'It is always there — I don’t blame them. I just want to play my game and win for Chelsea.'</p>

              <p>    asharvin has brought creativity on the left side of pitch.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. we need a tall strong central defender. without gallas, arsenal lack stability at the back. gallas absent is the reason why arsenal are struggling against the big club.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. strong defensive midfielder.</p>
              <p>     i always thought palacious will be good addition to arsenal.</p>

              <p>well, gunners never recover from losing flamini, and gallas..</p>
              <p>next season, gallas will be back.. maybe a committed striker.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Patience is running out at Arsenal.. both by the management and the fans. So much about playing beautiful football, but if you can't defend properly and as a team, you can forget about winning trophies. Will Arsene Wenger sticks to his youth policy for the next couple of seasons? The fact is that it will never work because once the players reached maturity, they will be sold to another big club. We've seen this happened. In business sense, Arsenal should be profitting with the money. But in football sense, it would probably mean you're not going to win anything really.</p></div>
