            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Peter Crouch insists he never even entertained the prospect of leaving Liverpool, despite a January transfer window which saw him linked to Newcastle.</strong><br><br>Since the turn of the year Crouch has won his way into Rafa Benitez's thinking at Anfield, but earlier in the season he cut more of a frustrated figure, in often playing second fiddle to Dirk Kuyt and Craig Bellamy.<br><br>A sublime hat-trick against Arsenal at the end of March had even his staunchest detractors eating their words, with 17 goals this season from just 27 starts bearing testimony to an ability to perform both in the Premiership and in Europe.<br><br>While the likes of Newcastle, and others, may hanker after the beanpole striker, Crouch is more than content on Merseyside and he has no intention of leaving a club he feels is heading in the right direction, both on and off the pitch.<br><br>"It never entered my head to leave the club," Crouch told the website.<br><br>"I am happy here, I'm happy with the manager and with the team. I'm sure there is more to come. I certainly don't want to leave.<br><br>"I've got to work hard and make sure I add value to the team, otherwise you will find yourself out.<br><br>"That's something I don't want to happen."<br><br>On the contrary to crushing his spirits, Crouch insists criticism aimed in his direction only heightens his desire to prove the sceptics wrong.<br><br>"A few said I was going to move on but it just made me more determined to play," he concluded.<br><br>"Until I'm told otherwise I'll keep working hard and try to win games.<br><br>"I definitely think it's (the future) bright, I think we've got the right man in charge.<br><br>"He's brought in new players and it looks like we've got a new stadium to look forward to. So why would I want to go anywhere else?" </span></div>
