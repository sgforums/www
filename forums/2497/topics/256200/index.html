            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/05_02/PoliceFansPA_468x379.jpg"><br><span class="small">Stand off: Liverpool fans are met by a wall of riot police outside the stadium</span><br><br><strong>UEFA's head of communications William Gaillard has blamed the behaviour of Liverpool fans for ticketing and disorder problems in the Champions League final against AC Milan. Rafael Benitez's side went down 2-1 to Milan on the night but supporters were the biggest losers as many with genuine tickets were kept out of the Athens Olympic Stadium, while others reportedly managed to force their way in with forged tickets or none at all. </strong><br><br>But while Reds fans, some of whom were sprayed with tear gas as unhappy groups protested outside the ground, expressed their displeasure with UEFA's organisation of the event, Gaillard turned the blame squarely on unruly supporters. "It was a suitable venue. It is the stadium where the 2004 Olympics were held and where all the games of the (Greek) national team are held. "Unfortunately in Britain it is the behaviour. Liverpool fans are responsible for the problems before, during and after the game.<br><br>"(They were) trying to go over the barriers to get into the stadium without tickets, which is not the behaviour we can condone. It is very easy to say 'this is not a football stadium'. "Milan supporters didn't face the same problems because they didn't behave the same way."<br><br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/05_02/fansfight2_468x311.jpg"><br><span class="small">Chaos: Liverpool supporters fight amongst themselves outside the Olympic Stadium</span><br><br>Gaillard defended a system that did not include the use of turnstiles and also praised the work of Greek police in containing flashpoints to a minimum. "In terms of fans pushing and attempting to get over the barriers, with turnstiles there could have been a tragedy. "At one point the police were overwhelmed and it is much to their credit that there were no dangerous incidents."<br><br>Gaillard went on to admit he felt sorry for fans who had acted in good faith and been disappointed but absolved UEFA of any blame. "I am very sorry for what has happened to fans who had regulation tickets but at the same time there is a collective responsibility for behaviour. Some are obviously honest fans who got tickets and obeyed the rules but because of those who did not they found themselves in an uncomfortable position.<br><br>"Some responsibility we (UEFA) could accept is we did not choose a stadium with 250,000 seats, but they don't exist." Former Conservative leader Michael Howard disagreed with Gaillard, claiming the Olympic Stadium was not ready to cope with the match. "I didn't think the match should have been held at the stadium. It's not a football stadium and is not equipped to cope with that number of people.<br><br>"Ticket checks were a joke. Many people with valid tickets were not allowed in. "That is not acceptable and UEFA really need to look at their procedures and make sure everything is all in order."<br><br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/05_02/FansFight_468x325.jpg"><br><span class="small">Aftermath: the tickets fiasco led to ugly scenes in the streets around the stadium</span><br></div>

There are a lot of anti-man utd threads out there, and i don't mean damaging reports, just plain Anti... But do you see me even bother by it? Well no, it doesn't bother me one single bit, i will probably just laugh at it after reading the posts within, just like i am laughing off at your accusation right now. But i can't imagine how you would have taken it...<br><br>Obviously you can't differentiate between a proper thread from a one out to flame the masses... Because i see you, yes... yourself playing a major part on a lot of those flaming threads over the months... I am sorry that you can't accept the facts and I got you all upset because i choose to post on a major Football incident which happened bearly 18 hrs ago. But i am not sorry to have brought it cos this is a Football discussion forum and apart from you, there may be others who would be interested and have a different opinion or may simply just like to be informed that's all.<br><br>Anyway, my take is you don't need a good memory to recall something like that, maybe just being resentful about it kept it on your mind after all this time... My honest opinion of it was, it was posted out to flame others here, I believed the people here more or less knows what you are all about after all this time. Here was a guy who had hardly posted in here before then suddenly one fine day decided to post on a topic out to taunt the masses. Say what you like but it clearly came across as that to me. You are free to post it in the Pool folder or the Sports folder, its perfectly fine by me cos it doesn't concern me if the flaming gets out of hand over there cos my primary objective is just here. Not too long ago Sports used to be a place for flaming and taunting but you don't see me getting involved with it, do you? But i see lots of you over there during the exchanged.<br><br>And i don't understand whats it to you that i delete it or lock it? Does it make a difference to you? But i can tell you my part. This is a informative football forum, a lot of new stories and interesting topics gets uploaded everyday, therefore i don't see why we should keep a useless thread lock and taking up space on the first page at the same time. Yours isn't the first threads i have deleted, i have also deleted my own as well as my fellow mods threads if they are of no interest to others anymore. So please grow up and don't take it so personal.<br><br>Lastly, it doesn't bother me one bit what you think of my character, and i don't care if you want to search the entire Singapore let alone just this sgforum... It will just confirm and prove to me the resentment you have over all these... Your threats of wanting to search all of the forum isn't new to me anymore, you have already said it a few times... You seem to think "its so cool"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  to threaten others here as and when you like... If you want, please go ahead and do it and get it out of the way once and for all so that i don't have to hear it from you again in future... At most i can tell you is... it will probably only give me a good laugh at the time you spent (waste) doing it regardless of how much "free" time you may claim you have... Anyway, this would be my answer just in case you bother...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>And do get one thing straight, I am not here to get your appraisal or anyone's for that matter... What you think of my character would be the least thing i would be worry about. I am just here as part of a community to share and discuss about the happenings in the Football world only. It is just unfortunate that you can't seem to accept the unpleasant with the good. But i would suggest that you stop whining, cos you will only come across like a disgruntled customer to me... and nothing more.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://news.bbc.co.uk/olmedia/820000/images/_824279_towsend300.jpg"><br><br><span class="large"><strong>Townsend: Fans must take some blame for the scenes in Athens, but UEFA must look at their policy, too</strong></span><br><br>A couple of Liverpool fans approached me inside the TV compound in the Olympic Stadium, wearing official blue photographerÂ’s vests. "Andy, get us a couple of cameras, so we can get to the side of the pitch." They were in an official secure area and didnÂ’t have a camera between them but had somehow overcome a strict accreditation pass checkpoint and travelled through an X-ray machine to get that far.<br><br>Part of me admired their cheek, but their audacity was nothing compared to the horror stories I was hearing on the way home from Athens on Thursday. Stories that you hope are not true: stories of Liverpool supporters stealing tickets from other Liverpool supporters who had paid for their seats at the European Cup Final.<br><br>These are fans famous for their loyalty and passion to the cause, forged partly by the football disasters of Heysel and Hillsborough. Then there was a big Scouser, a lad who could clearly look after himself, but who talked of the overcrowding in the Liverpool section, comparing it to Hillsborough and talking of the fear of being crushed in powerful surges. "If I fall over here, IÂ’m in serious trouble," he recalled. Others talked of frightening experiences inside and around a stadium built for athletics and inadequate for a football match. Fans should be allowed to join the party; IÂ’m all for them being part of the action. Supporters with a passion for their team will go to extraordinary lengths to watch them around the world, like those who follow the Republic of Ireland abroad.<br><br>With football in such great demand and cheap flights available on the internet, people will gamble in the hope they can beg for a ticket at the venue. But at what point does common sense kick in and the individual takes responsibility for what happens next? At what point does the supporter Â— in this case the Liverpool fan Â— think "I havenÂ’t got a ticket, so IÂ’ll find myself a bar or a big screen and enjoy it from there?" ThatÂ’s what the Irish followers would do, thatÂ’s what happened when Celtic took over Seville for the 2003 UEFA Cup Final against Porto. Yet many in Liverpool colours decided: "IÂ’ve got no ticket, but thatÂ’s not going to stop me getting in."<br><br>At best, they were willing to take the place of a fellow supporter. At worst, they were placing the lives of others in danger. As a consequence of this attitude, fans with genuine tickets couldnÂ’t get in and some were bulldozed, baton-charged and battered instead of taking their place for the final.<br></div>
