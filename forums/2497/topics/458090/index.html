              <p>if hodgson, an experienced manager and coach for 30 years, struggled to make liverpool tick, you think a rookie manager like rodgers, can improve and turn liverpool into a top 4 overnight?</p>
              <p>why I say liverpool willl struggle? do you think suarez is able to score 20 league goals for liverpool? Borini, it is good if he can score 10 goals at the end of the season. some more bellamy was released and kuyt was sold, and carroll was loaned out. how many goals did liverpool score last season in the league?</p>
              <p>from the way I see, they will struggle at away and even at home, why? cos they dun score a lot of goals in a match, how to win if you dun score more goals than your opponents. you think a rookie manager like rodgers will turn liverpool into a scoring machine when kenny failed last season?</p>

              <p>I think he will resign eventually even if Henry do not sack him.</p>
              <p>He is considering signing Mickey Mouse but Henry did not approve.</p>
              <p>So, imagine you are the manager and the owner is not even bothered to sign mouse to help your squad, what miracle can you create ?</p>
              <p>How many press conference can he do and keep mentioning that Liverpool team have a good game and still lose ?</p>
              <p>Now, he is in a worse off position than Roy as the reliable and saviour players are ALL gone.</p>
              <p>Who else can save him when even Stevie and Reina are both off form ?</p>
              <p>I do not blame him if Liverpool is relegated this season cos it is pretty obvious that Henry is not willing to spend more despite all the craps he is saying.</p>

              <p>Actually its very easy to save Liverpool from their situaition now.</p>
              <p>Just spend 45m get Falcao/Benzama and you will see them rising up the table into top4.</p>
              <p>But dun need to think, definietly no possible with the current owners, 6m also dun want to spend liao, still want to spend 40m, wait till Liverpool win the league also will not happen.</p>
              <p>They wont sack Rodger one, after they sack Rodger, no one will ever want to take up the manager job at Liverpool liao. Cuz they also know, reaching top4 with mid table team budget is not possible non matter what.</p>
              <p>Maybe Rafa will come back if he is still without a job. But with this kind of spending, Pep also cant help Liverpool.</p>

              <p>It is a pain to watch Liverpool matches now.</p>
              <p>No pressure from opponent, they can pass nice nice, tiki taka untill very shiok.</p>
              <p>Once still the pressure built up, all the long ball and hollywood passing come out liao.</p>
              <p>Playing tiki taka with a team except one who know it just doesnt work.</p>
              <p>last season its Bellamy who pulled Liverpool through the winter season when the team is off formed. Wonder who is it this season, or will there even be one.</p>
              <p>Also hard to believe that one of the best player on pitch for Liverpool can easily be Sterling. </p>

              <p>Realistically speaking, i don't see Brenda getting the sack this season. Obviously the owners may have change their minds from wanted to win or qualify for the CL to one of anywhere as long as don't get relegated. This way, they will still enjoy the Tv income of about 30 to 40 million, don't loss their sponsors and still able to charge premier league ticket prices to every league match.</p>
              <p>Also, sacking him would also be too costly as he is only into his 1st year of 3.</p>
              <p>The only reason the owners will sack him is if he loses the dressing room. Once players are no longer keen to play for him, that's it. Cos every match they play they will lose. So have to go. But my own view is... For better or for worse, he will be there for a while...</p>

              <p>even if liverpool doesnt finish in relegation, the thought of finishing in top 10, will the fans have patience to the team and above all, the owner?</p>
              <p>the possibility of liverpool not finishing top 10 is very real if rodgers is in charge till end of the season. liverpool do not have a striker that can be relied upon to score goals regularly. Suarez is not an out and out striker, he is more of a forward with lots of trickery up his sleeves. as for borini at 10m, he looks like a bad buy judging from his past few appearances, but its too early to judge as he played on the right flank.</p>
              <p>as for gerrard, he used to rescue liverpool with his surging forward and vital goals, but he is getting old and injury prone, can liverpool still rely on him regularly?</p>
              <p>I think he is starting to lose the dressing room, as he came in and want to rid of so  many players and even tried to trade them off. sounded like AVB at chelsea last season, when he tried to implement so many changes and the players doesnt want to play for him.</p>

              <p>actually finishing outside top4 and finishing above bottom3 doesnt have much difference (not very sure).</p>
              <p>Its time to let Gerrard go already, either giving way to younger players or even move oversea in a year or so to earn his last pot of gold.</p>
              <p>His abililty is just being wasted at Liverpool. He cant help them to win anything because he cant do it by himself and most importantly his tiki taka sucks. </p>
              <p>and this brings me to why play tiki taka when your best midfield player cant do it well. Gerrard's long pass and cross is definitly word class but now you are telling him to do what he done best.</p>

              <p>Liverpool problems is all around.</p>
              <p>Goalkeeper dropping balls, Defenders losing focus, Midfielders not stamping their authority and Strikers not sharp and on form.</p>
              <p>They have a host of problems at the moment.</p>
              <p>I believe Ah Rod should be able to fix the problem but he dun have the players to score the goal and some players are losing faith in him.</p>
              <p>Similar situation for Ah Roy.</p>
              <p>So, they will not be performing better than last season as they are pretty lean.</p>
              <p>It just take a few injury to kill them.</p>
              <p>They will be relegated if some of the players decide to leave in Jan 2012 and Ah Rod failed to buy any more players in Jan 2012.</p>
              <p>We will seeing Liverpool in Championship soccer next season.</p>

              <p>Liverpool is doomed regardles of whether they sack rodgers or not.</p>
              <p>They made too many major changes to the squad from players to football play style.</p>
              <p>Even the dressing room morale is surely at its lowest. They brought in so many managers who constantly tinkered with the player transfer even before players get a chance to settle down they're told to play a totally different game from each manager.</p>
              <p>Rodgers is a arrogant/ignorant fool who though he could change the way liverpool play. Now they're stuck with players who have almost 0 versatility in the out field and can only play short passing.</p>
              <p>I seriously doubt any manager will want to sign for liverpool even after Rodgers get sacked.</p>

              <p>1 point earned at sunderland, next up is at home against man united.</p>
              <p>if liverpool is to lose the match at home to their hatred rivals on Sunday,  the pressure is very acutely on Rodgers, as it is almost end of September. If results dun go their way, they may end up in relegation by November.</p>
              <p>I am not sure if the owner can tolerate liverpool at relegation in the league table in November or even December. by then if this is true, then the owner will replace Rodgers with perhaps, Harry Rednapp or even Rafa if the situation is dire.</p>
