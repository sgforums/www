              <p>I think Rodgers know that he have his youth team as a backup.</p>
              <p>The youth team played to two victory for the last two weeks.</p>
              <p>So, it depends on when he can introduced the youth players gradually.</p>
              <p>Liverpool is going towards the right direction.</p>
              <p>It just need the fans to have faith in Rodgers in grooming the team.</p>
              <p>It will take longer without addition of star players.</p>
              <p>Or it will take the replacement of some of the players from Team A.</p>

              <p>At least he is not getting the noise when Ah Roy took over Liverpool.</p>
              <p>The players know that changing manager is not good for Liverpool.</p>
              <p>I support his approach in exposing the youth team as they are the next generation.</p>
              <p>There are certain senior players who are actually off form or off fitness.</p>
              <p>Some of them dun cut it.</p>
              <p>Ah Rod is giving Henderson some chance to prove himself.</p>
              <p>As for Downing, I think he have given himself any chance to play well.</p>
              <p>So, he will ship out soon.</p>
              <p>Ah Rod surprised all when Liverpool win this morning including myself.</p>

              i support the system of using players from the youth academy plus some good signings.  thats the way for club to thrive long term.  
              
              man city and chelsea's method of spending millions cant last forever.

              <p>Liverpool already have a youth system in place.</p>
              <p>It is any wonder why they are not being utilised under Kenny and Benny management.</p>
              <p>I agreed with dragg that using youth players should be the way to go.</p>
              <p>Arsenal and Man Utd did it with success.</p>
              <p>My only worry is the Henry may sell them away to make money instead of pursuing club glory.</p>

              <p>Yeah, this is always a worry with youth players... Once they become somebody, they will expect something as well. Either it's a higher than usual salary, a demand to play more matches, or ultimately to win prizes, titles... We have seen it with Arsenal for a number of years already but the amazing thing about Arsenal is they manage to replace the stars that left them and continue to make new ones.</p>
              <p>All the talk about suso going to be something in future but if he does well, i can already see him destine to go back to spain before he turns 24. And Henry is a businessman first and foremost, so he can't turn away from a perceived good profit.</p>

              <p>Having watched every pool game this season, im still quite optimistic for the team, can see the change in liverpool's style, although they are still an unfinished and raw product for the way rodgers wants them to play. We may have our worst start to a season ever but i believe once they start winning,  the team should have more confidence in themselves.</p>
              <p>Some of the youth product seem to have more hunger to win, players such as wisdom and suso are looking pretty decent for their age and need to be exposed to games more like sterling has been given. Yes stevie just doesnt suit the tiki taka style but him and carragher have been the club's stalwart and i dont see them leaving. They still have an important role on and off the pitch for the club.</p>
              <p>I do plea to fellow fans to give rodgers time, though some may say results mean more than the style itself but i have enjoyed some of liverpool's games so far and im sure once the problems are worked out in the training ground we will start winning more games.</p>

              <p>The fans are happy to see Liverpool attack with 10 men on the field.</p>
              <p>But, they lack the sharpness and clinical finish.</p>
              <p>They know Ah Rod is bringing youth players with more exposure in Europa and Capital One Cup. (This is actually a big risk if they dun play hard.)</p>
              <p>So, it is a marked improvement over Ah Ken where there is no ray of hope.</p>
              <p>The key is for the players to have faith in Ah Rod and for the whole team to play well.</p>
              <p>Liverpool fans know that Henry have played Ah Rod out during transfer so he is in this crap situation when his key senior players are injured.</p>
              <p>It is a blessing in disguise as he can field them against Norwich.</p>

              <p>as long as any of the new player dun get snatch up by other clubs, future is always great.</p>
              <p>But there is how many players today is able to resist a 100k+ wage.</p>
              <p>Its petty interesting to see that the 2nd team is winning games, while the 1st team is losing left and right.</p>
              <p>Sahin looks great from the Capital One Cup game, but too bad he is on loan, hopefully liverpool can buy him after the loan.</p>
