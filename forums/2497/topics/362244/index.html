              <p><strong>Ancelotti announces Milan departure</strong></p>
              <div id="div_article_main_content">
              <p><strong>Carlo Ancelotti is set to be
                  announced as the new manager of Chelsea after the Italian confirmed
                  that his contract with Milan had been mutually terminated.</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/italy/Milan/ancelotti_red_480.jpg" alt="" width="477" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>Ancelotti confirmed his departure from the Rossoneri immediately
                  after his team’s 2-0 win at Fiorentina on the final day of the Serie
                  A season on Sunday.</strong></p>
              <p>The victory confirmed Milan's third-placed finish and
                  their participation in next season’s Champions League, leaving
                  Ancelotti clear to pursue what is believed to be a career in England
                  with Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti leaves a year before the expiry of his Milan contract
                  having been one of his team's most successful coaches. In eight years
                  at the San Siro, Ancelotti won the Champions League twice.</p>
              <p>“It’s a good choice for both parties,” Ancelotti said of his departure.</p>
              <p>“There is no issue with our separation, only mutual respect for each other.</p>
              <p>“I cannot say officially where I am going because nothing is
                  finalised. I hope to know soon, but it’s not definite that I’m going to
                  London.”</p>
              <p>The 49-year-old is widely expected to succeed Guus Hiddink who on
                  Saturday delivered the FA Cup to crown a highly successful
                  interim tenure at Chelsea after the Dutchman took temporary charge at
                  Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>Hiddink's unwavering commitment to his role with the Russian
                  national team meant Chelsea had to look elsewhere though for their
                  long-term replacement for Luiz Felipe Scolari.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">CARLO ANCELOTTI quit AC Milan yesterday to take over as boss of Chelsea. And the Italian coach will be given £50million to help bring the Premier League trophy back to Stamford Bridge.</h2>
              <p class="article">Ancelotti, 49, is expected to be unveiled officially as Guus Hiddink’s successor within 24 hours. After his last game with Milan — a 2-0 win at Fiorentina — he said: “In agreement with the club, we have decided to terminate the contract a year early. “It was decided by mutual consent after the game. Our roads will separate next season.”</p>
              <p class="article">At least <strong>THREE</strong> new stars are on the radar with owner Roman Abramovich giving Ancelotti the biggest Blues transfer budget since Jose Mourinho.</p>
              <p class="article">It is the first time in two seasons the Russian owner has dipped into his own pocket to buy players. SunSport revealed last week Chelsea have already agreed a deal for CSKA Moscow attacking midfielder Yuri Zhirkhov.</p>
              <p class="article">Both Bayern Munich’s French winger Franck Ribery and Valencia’s Spain striker David Villa have already been targeted. Ancelotti has also authorised the sale of Florent Malouda, Salomon Kalou and Deco.</p>
              <p class="article">As we said in March, a three-year deal worth £16.5million has been agreed with the Italian. While refusing to confirm his move to Chelsea yesterday, Ancelotti added: “I am certainly not staying in Italy.”</p>
              <p class="article">Meanwhile, Blues skipper John Terry revealed he and his team-mates are already looking forward to welcoming some big names to Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “There needs to be a couple of changes, a few players brought in, maybe. “A few players who haven’t played in the last couple of years maybe need to move on. “We’ll see Chelsea back and competing for the top players who are out there at the moment.</p>
              <p class="article">“The likes of Ribery, Villa — these are the kind of players we want to attract. “We need those kind of players to strengthen the side and, at the same time, we need to keep hold of lads like Didier Drogba, Ashley and Joe Cole, who are up for contract talks.</p>
              <p class="article">“When big players become available, we need to show people and let them know that, yes, Chelsea are back.”</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Chelsea risk isolating Ancelotti over assistants row</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p>Departing AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti is desperate for Filippo Galli to follow him to Chelsea.</p>
              <p>The <em>Daily Mail</em> says it is no secret that he wants to
              bring his assistant from Milan, Galli, who is an English speaker, but
              Chelsea are equally insistent that the new manager will work with
              existing coaches, including Ray Wilkins and Paul Clement. They want
              continuity; Ancelotti wants a familiar support system.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti is described by those who have dealt closely with him
              as a man who likes his allies to be friends, who is happiest working in
              a social environment and who will need more than Wilkins’ membership of
              the old boys club at AC Milan to form a bond.</p>
              <p>His grasp of English is not great and even if he has more than
              a month to learn before the players report for training, he will still
              be dependent on his support staff in London. Chelsea say there is no
              problem with bringing an assistant but do not want a vanload of Italian
              coaches displacing those already employed. Everyone in Italy who is
              familiar with Ancelotti and the way he works believes this could grow
              into an issue, long-term.</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p>Glenn Hoddle believes Carlo Ancelotti will struggle to get to grips with managing Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Hoddle, who was in charge at the Bridge from 1993 to 1996, said: "We
              won't know how he will do until he gets here, but having been at Milan
              for so long he's going to find the culture a big change.</p>
              <p>"English football's also a bit different. In the last few years the domestic game in Italy has suffered a lot.</p>
              <p>"But he has vast experience and could do a good job."</p>
              <p>Ancelotti, 49, guided Milan to one Scudetto and two Champions League crowns.</p>
              <p>And Hoddle believes the Champions League will either make or break him at Chelsea.</p>
              <p>The ex-England playmaker, 51, said: "Success at Chelsea now is
              whether they can have a real go at the Champions League again next
              year. Chelsea won the FA Cup but it would have been a slightly
              disappointing season as they had the Champions League in their sights."</p>
              <p>Ancelotti does not speak English, but Hoddle said: "He might be
              coming to manage an English club but he will not be managing an English
              team.</p>
              <p>"There are only three English players in the Chelsea team. The rest probably speak either French or Spanish.</p>
              <p>"If you have to go through an interpreter it is not ideal.</p>
              <p>"But he will have such a vast array of talented players to work with. Any manager could go in there and achieve some success."</p>

              <p>Ancelotti is an impact for italian soccer , all his life in Italy , in England .... he need sometime .... 50 millions cannot buy him the title in his first season .</p>
              <p>Chelsea must start regrouping ... younger players to takeover the aging ones ....</p>
              <p>An average age must be maintain .... but ...</p>
              <p>Unless Roman wanna be like second AC , many old aged players , but good enough to win the European Cup .</p>
              <p>Aiyo , Roman only got an eye on UCL .....</p>
              <p>50 millions to regroup make more sense , than winning the BPL .</p>

              <p>Siao one.. Sell Malouda? I thought he is playing very well at the moment.</p>
              <p>I think Roman s desperate to win CL. If Jose last time can win CL for Chelsea, he will not be sacked even he talk nonsense. Ancelotti football style is hardly entertaining.</p>
              <p>He say before, if u want entertainment. Go and watch hollywood movie!  LOL.</p>

              on Sunday, has signed a three-year-contract and will start on
              July 1, the English club said in a statement.</p>

              <p>He was obviously employed for one objective - to do one notch better in the UCL !!!</p>
              <p>Chelsea has been doing well in UCL , just that little experience needed . He could well be the missing link !</p>
              <p>Roman don't allowed Carlo Ancelotti to bring in his won Asst Mge , cos he wanted the more experience Englishman Ray Wilkins into the EPL . He to the UCL .</p>
