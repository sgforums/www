              <p class="imageCaption"><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1165234" rel="1165234|3| nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1165234/From-Gazza-Guvnor-How-Euro-96-stars-flopped-bosses.html"> </a></p>
              <p><strong>Ah, the heady days of Euro 96. The sun shone, football came home and then Germany turned up and spoiled the party.</strong></p>
              <p>But at least Gareth Southgate was able to cash in on his semi-final penalty miss with a tongue-in-cheek Pizza Hut advert.</p>
              <p>Now, 13 years after his tame spot-kick was saved by Andreas Kopke, Southgate is under fire again after taking Middlesbrough down to the Champsionship.</p>
              <p>And he is not the only one. Alan Shearer also suffered relegation as Newcastle boss.</p>
              <p>Sportsmail looks at how a golden generation have failed in the world of management.</p>
              <p>Tony Adams, Paul Ince, David Platt and Paul Gascoigne have hardly been success stories, although Stuart Pearce has gone some way to redressing the balance.</p>
              <p>Steve McManaman has been wise to stick to the safety of the TV studio.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 style="color: #339966;">Alan Shearer</h2>
              <p>Shearer's managerial record stretches to just eight games but during that time Newcastle suffered a harrowing relegation from the Barclays Premier League.</p>
              <p>Arguably, the damage was already done thanks to the inept administration at St James' Park over recent years.</p>
              <p>But Shearer has done himself few favours when it comes to establishing himself as a top-flight boss.</p>

              <h2 style="color: #339966;">Gareth Southgate</h2>
              <p>The former Aston Villa and Middlesbrough player had the debatable honour of being Steve McClaren's first signing at the Riverside.</p>
              <p>Southgate was a natural leader on the pitch and Terry Venables had no hesitation in recommending him to Boro chairman Steve Gibson when McClaren left to lead England to ignominy in the summer of 2006.</p>
              <p>And so Southgate became a Premier League manager aged just 35. Boro finished 12th in his first season and 13th the year after, but are now staring relegation in the face.</p>
              <p>Gibson is not a chairman familiar with wielding the managerial axe, but a quick look up the A19 would have shown him the benefits of acting decisively - Roy Keane's resignation in December seems to have saved Sunderland from the drop.</p>

              <h2 style="color: #339966;">Tony Adams</h2>
              <p>A highly successful leader of men at Arsenal, Tony Adams cannot be accused of moving into management blindly.</p>
              <p>He served under the likes of George Graham and Arsene Wenger, completed the League Manager Association's Certificate of Applied Management and studied sports science at Brunel University.</p>
              <p>But the Adams who bolted off the pitch at Wembley after that Euro '96 semi-final defeat to throw as much beer down his neck as possible was a very different proposition to the manager he became.</p>
              <p>Wycombe were relegated from League Two in 2004 under Adams' watch, signalling a two-year absence from the English game as Adams spent time coaching at Feyenoord. He returned to management as assistant boss to Harry Redknapp at Portsmouth in 2006 and took over as Pompey manager when Redknapp joined Spurs last October.</p>
              <p>Following 'Arry was always going to be a difficult task and Adams lasted little more than three months before being unceremoniously sacked.</p>

              </div>
              <h2 style="color: #339966;">Paul Ince</h2>
              <p>It all started so well for Ince as he rolled his sleeves up and saved Macclesfield Town from relegation in 2007. The club were bottom of League Two when Ince joined in the previous October and he kept Macclesfield up by an impressive 12-point margin.</p>
              <p>An appointment at MK Dons followed in the summer of 2007 and Ince enjoyed more success, guiding the club to the League Two title and victory over Grimsby Town in the final of the Football League Trophy in March last year.</p>
              <p>But then the Guvnor moved up to the Barclays Premier League and experienced a woeful six months as Blackburn boss. Tackling his players in training did not work out and Ince was sacked in December as Rovers took drastic action to try and maintain their place in the top flight.</p>

              <h2 style="color: #339966;">David Platt</h2>
              <p>It was assumed Platt's transition from player to manager would be a smooth one when he retired in 1998 to concentrate on coaching. The former England midfielder got involved with the national youth sides and returned to one former club Sampdoria as 'Overall Supervisor' for a brief, ill-fated period.</p>
              <p>In 1999 he replaced Ron Atkinson at Nottingham Forest and spent two years at the City Ground, trying to build a team capable of challenging for promotion to the Premier League. But he could hardly be called a fans' favourite after he failed to reach the play-offs in either of his two seasons in charge, despite spending ?12million.</p>
              <p>Platt resigned in 2001 to become England Under-21s coach, guiding the side to the 2002 European Championships. But, when they failed to reach the same tournament two years later, Platt was replaced by Peter Taylor.</p>

              </div>
              <h2 style="color: #339966;">Paul Gascoigne</h2>
              <p>Quite what Imraan Ladak, the chairman of non-league Kettering Town, thought he was doing when he appointed Gascoigne as manager in October 2005, we'll never know. Presumably it was a publicity stunt but Gazza lasted just 39 days before being sacked.</p>
              <p>Kettering's results weren't even that bad (two wins, two draws and three losses), but Ladak was apparently unimpressed with Gascoigne's drinking. Surely that was part of the territory?</p>
              <p>Gazza, who says he has now gone four months without a drink, is talking about a return to coaching, but the range of 'offers' he discusses have yet to be verified by any clubs.</p>
              <p>The jury is out as to whether the most naturally gifted player of his generation could ever become a manager, but the odds are stacked against him. Gazza needs to learn to manage his own life first.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>

              <h2 style="color: #339966;">Stuart Pearce</h2>
              <p>Pearce's management career got off to a poor start as he stepped into the void left by Frank Clark's departure at Nottingham Forest in 1996.</p>
              <p>The Forest legend could not save the club from relegation during his 23-game stint as caretaker boss, but it did not put him off returning to management when he retired from playing in 2001.</p>
              <p>'Psycho' stayed at Manchester City, learning the ropes as a defensive coach, and took over as caretaker boss when Kevin Keegan left the club in March 2005. Pearce guided City to safety and became the manager on a permanent basis, combining the role with the England Under 21 job from February 2007.</p>
              <p>But, despite Pearce's histrionics on the sideline, his tenure in Manchester achieved little success. He was sacked in 2007 after City had managed just 10 goals at home all season - a record in English top flight football.</p>
              <p>Pearce still had the Under-21s job and has resurrected his reputation by taking the youth side to the semi-finals of the 2007 European Championships. He was given the role on a full-time basis later that summer and was last year named as part of Fabio Capello's coaching set up for the senior squad.</p>
