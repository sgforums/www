              <h1>Wayne Rooney is 'worn out' says USA star Landon Donovan ahead of 
              World Cup showdown<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Wayne Rooney is 'worn out' ahead of the World Cup finals in South 
              Africa, according to United States midfielder Landon Donovan who 
              believes the long season is catching up with the England striker.</p>
              <p>Rooney
               has been troubled by an ankle and groin injuries in recent weeks, the 
              latter of which forced him off early in Manchester United's final Barclays Premier League 
              encounter with Stoke last weekend.</p>
              <p>That match was Rooney's 
              49th for club and country in a season when the 24-year-old has 
              shouldered United's hopes like no other time during his Old Trafford 
              career.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/13/article-1278044-0981A7B4000005DC-63_468x318.jpg" alt="Worn out: American Landon Donovan reckons Rooney is feeling the 
              strain of a long campaign" width="468" height="318">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Worn out: American Landon Donovan reckons Rooney
               is feeling the strain of a long campaign</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>And Donovan, who will lead the United States against England in their
               World Cup opener in Rustenburg on June 12, reckons Rooney is showing 
              signs of being 'worn out' after his heavy workload.</p>
              <p>'Rooney is
               a top player. In my opinion, he is one of the best players in the world
               right now,' said Donovan.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/13/article-1278044-09868EA0000005DC-539_306x423.jpg" alt="Struggle: Rooney has been hampered by injuries of late but hopes 
              to fit for South Africa" width="306" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Struggle: Rooney has been hampered by injuries 
              of late but hopes to fit for South Africa</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>'But the other part of it is that he has played a lot of games and he
               is tired. He is probably worn out.</p>
              <p>'Injuries are a part of 
              that. Things happen when players are tired. When they just keep adding 
              games to the schedule, it makes it difficult.</p>
              <p>'Any time you 
              come into a World Cup, because of the timing of it, big players who play
               a lot of games in Europe are coming right at the end of their season, 
              so it is always an interesting dynamic how to balance that.'</p>
              <p>Donovan
               saw the pressure on Rooney and his England team-mates first hand last 
              season when he spent a part of the campaign on loan with Everton.</p>
              <p>The 28-year-old made 10 
              appearances for the Toffees as he sought to maintain his match fitness 
              ahead of this summer's finals and after sampling the football-centric 
              culture in England believes all the pressure will be on the USA's Group C
               rivals in South Africa.</p>
              <p>'Of course, there is more pressure on
               the English players,' he added.</p>

              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/13/article-1278044-08B4441F000005DC-845_468x286.jpg" alt="Pretty in pink: Landon Donovan enjoyed a successful short-term

              </div>
              <p>'If we don't do well in the World Cup, people care for a little bit.</p>
              <p>'But if England doesn't do well in the World Cup, it is absolutely 
              devastating to their country, their families, to their people.</p>
              <p>'That
               is something they [England] live with. I don't know if they look at it 
              that way, but that is how I look at it.'</p>
