              <h1>CESC FABREGAS ON WAY OUT</h1>
              <div class="image-holder"><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00032/FABREGAS_32420a.jpg" alt="" width="516" height="236"></div>
              <h2>Arsenal players turn on big-head skipper</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>CESC FABREGAS has been branded arrogant and out of control - by his own Arsenal team-mates. And while his behaviour has created shockwaves inside the Emirates Stadium, the situation is being monitored closely back in his Spanish homeland. </h3>
              <p>The signals have been picked up at Barcelona - where Fabregas began his career as a trainee. Sources close to the Catalan giants are now convinced the midfielder has set his heart on rejoining the club he has supported since he was a toddler. </p>
              <p>Reports in his native Barca claim that his recent spat with Hull officials after the Gunners' stormy 2-1 FA Cup quarter-final victory have further affected his state of mind. Barcelona are briefing the Spanish media that Fabregas believes there is a witch hunt against him as part of a campaign to drive him away from Arsenal. </p>
              <p>Back in England, there is an entirely different notion. Within the confines of the Emirates, insiders have detected a marked change in Fabregas's attitude since he returned victorious from Spain's success in last summer's European Championships.</p>
              <p>A Gunners insider told us: "Fabregas has changed since he came back from the European Championships. It's as if he thinks he's made it because Spain won. "It was the same with Thierry Henry in his last season - but at least Henry had won everything and had a right to swagger around. People are scared to confront Fabregas in case they upset him and he decides to walk in the summer. </p>
              <p>"But as far as most of the players are concerned, he's going anyway and there is a real arrogance to him now." There is a growing belief amongst Arsenal players and officials that his swagger is threatening the dressing room harmony. </p>
              <p>The Arsenal source said: "Fabregas is almost a law unto himself. He walks around like he owns the place and that's put more than a few noses out of joint. "A lot of the players think he'll be off in the summer to Barcelona - or maybe even Real Madrid - and that he's just swaggering around until he goes. </p>
              <p>"The problem is, he gets away with it. There were a lot of people at the club who were surprised when he was allowed to go back to Spain for several weeks to do his injury rehabilitation because it's normally a strict policy that rehab is overseen by Arsenal medical staff." </p>
              <p>The player's father, Francesc Fabregas Snr insisted his son "is very happy at Arsenal" before adding: "But there are a thousand conditions to be considered. "He has always said that Arsene Wenger is one of the fundamental things for him to be there. "When Florentino (Perez) was at Real Madrid four years ago they came to us and put a lot of money on the table but we said 'No'. </p>
              <p>"We decided that it was not the right moment then for Cesc to make the change. You have to take everything into consideration - money is not everything." </p>
              <p>While manager Arsene Wenger has publicly defended his club captain, there are other senior officials at Arsenal who are concerned at the Spaniard's attitude. </p>
              <p>And there is a feeling at Arsenal the club will not be able to match the £120,000-a-week wages that would be on offer at the Nou Camp. </p>
              <p>Wenger has insisted on basic parity amongst top earners - like Emmanuel Adebayor and William Gallas - of around £90,000 so as not to create any ill-feeling in the dressing room.</p>
              <h4>Agent</h4>
              <p>But that figure is unlikely to satisfy Fabregas, 21, who knows the La Liga giants will do everything they can to lure him home. Significantly, Wenger is already looking to strengthen his midfield department - with Fiorentina's Felipe Melo seen as a possible replacement. </p>
              <p>The young Brazilian has been watched several times in recent week and has confirmed: "I know about the interest from teams like Arsenal and Juventus but I prefer to leave these matters in the hands of my agent and only think about playing football." </p>
              <p>Wenger will not let Fabregas leave willingly. But he will need to use all his powers of persuasion to calm the storm which is brewing inside his dressing room. Ultimately, the solution lies with Fab himself.</p>

But even before he became captain, he was already quite like this... But he seems to over react more these days... Still can remember his fight with Lampard in the Carling cup... Looks like he becoming swell headed liao...</p></div>

              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Hull chairman Paul Duffen is certain the Football Association will uncover the truth during their investigation into claims that Brian Horton was spat at by Arsenal club captain Cesc Fabregas.</strong></p>
              <p>The allegations from the Hull camp followed their 2-1 defeat to Arsenal in a stormy FA Cup quarter-final at the Emirates Stadium earlier this month. Hull manager Phil Brown accused Fabregas of spitting at Horton in the tunnel at the end of the match.</p>
              <p>Hull will make their formal statement to the FA on Monday, which is the deadline for evidence to be submitted, and Duffen is confident Brown and Horton will be vindicated.</p>
              <p>Fabregas had said today: "I think this is completely closed for me.'' But Duffen told <em>Sky Sports News</em>: "If maybe he feels he did behave inappropriately I couldn't understand why he would want to think it was over.</p>
              <p>"The matter has its own momentum now because the Football Association have started an inquiry and they've asked us to submit evidence by tomorrow [Monday] in terms of the players and coaching staff of Hull City who were involved in the incident on that evening.</p>
              <p>"We can't refuse to give evidence to the FA so we are co-operating with it and we totally welcome the inquiry. "There's no question in my mind that Brian Horton, Phil Brown and the coaching staff and players saw something happen that evening.</p>
              <p>"I have absolutely no doubt something took place and I'm sure the inquiry will find out all those facts and details.''</p>
              <p>Although the issue is now in the hands of the FA, Duffen would have welcomed an apology at an earlier stage. "If there was an accommodation between the football clubs, then that would be an elegant way of moving forward,'' he said.</p>
              <p>"If there could be an easier way of moving forward which would be less of a drama then of course we would be happy with that.''</p>
