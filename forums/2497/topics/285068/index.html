It is thought Steve McClaren will stand by the midfield that developed when the Chelsea player was injured, keeping Gareth Barry in the centre with Steven Gerrard.</strong><br><br>Lampard is likely to be reinstated in Moscow four days later, however, as England switch from 4-4-2 to 4-3-3 and he takes a place beside Barry and Gerrard. The formation would allow McClaren to get 10 men behind the ball when necessary.<br><br>The manager is still considering leaving out certain defenders on Saturday so that they do not risk incurring a second booking of the campaign that would stop them facing Russia. Sol Campbell and Nicky Shorey spent part of yesterday's training match in the stronger line-up instead of the captain, John Terry, and Ashley Cole.<br><br>Michael Owen is insistent on playing a full part a mere fortnight after surgery for a double hernia. Some questioned his fitness or motives. "That's why I am in an aggressive mood," the Newcastle United striker said. He will be in the starting line-up at Wembley on Saturday.<br><br>Owen scored the decisive goal as a substitute in the 3-2 victory over Everton last weekend. The Newcastle manager, Sam Allardyce, has been concerned about a heavy workload being imposed too soon but both men deny any conflict. "It's just people trying to get between myself and Michael," said Allardyce.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Barry bubbling as England wake up to the talent of Villa's inspiration</span><br><br>Gareth Barry is emerging from the obscurity of captaining Aston Villa. It is remarkable that for all the experience of his 298 Premier League appearances, gained in 11 seasons at Villa Park, the 26-year-old feels it is only now that he is receiving the respect he craves.</strong><br><br>But far from Barry saying Villa are nothing, he is saying - unlike Newcastle United's Joey Barton - that playing for England is everything. "England's a massive thing. It's fanatically supported all over the country and the recognition comes with it," he said. "In terms of things being written about me and on the radio, you're always going to have this debate because England is so big. That's nice for my name to be mentioned in a positive way."<br><br>After winning his first England cap aged 19, Barry has collected only 11 more in the intervening years. That has not stopped him dutifully attending squads when the call has come, although he has often done so feeling disappointment was inevitable. Indeed, having been used only twice by Sven-Goran Eriksson - as a substitute at the fag end of friendly matches when the Swede used a roulette of replacements in 2003 - he thought the opportunity to have an England career had passed him by.<br><br>"Sometimes it's hard when you're in squad after squad and you're not really being talked about playing," he said. "You go away from England, you get your head down and you try to play as well as you can for your club. You wait for your chance. But I felt that with a new management coming in my chance would come again and eventually it did. The last two games my chance came and you put your name forward. It's patience and it comes with football, especially here with so many good players."<br><br>Barry put in what were as good as man-of-the-match performances against Israel and Russia last month and no one - except perhaps Frank Lampard, the man he replaced - would begrudge him his time in the limelight. But he insists that despite his competition with the fit-again Chelsea midfielder there is no boiling tension about whom Steve McClaren will entrust to start Saturday's match against Estonia alongside Steven Gerrard.<br><br></div>

Boss Steve McClaren must decide whether to stick with Barry or recall Frank Lampard alongside Gerrard in midfield. </strong><br><br>Gerrard, who skippers the side in the absence of the injured John Terry, said: "They are both great midfielders. "Gareth was probably man of the match in the last two games and he might feel hard done by if he was dropped."<br><br>Barry produced two terrific performances in central midfield against Israel and Russia last month as England got their Euro 2008 qualifying campaign back on track with two 3-0 wins. The Aston Villa star was given the nod after injuries to Lampard and Owen Hargreaves and complemented Gerrard perfectly as England dominated both games.<br><br>Lampard and Gerrard have struggled to form a partnership when they have played together, but Gerrard says he is happy to play with either man. He added: "It doesn't matter to me who plays - I played well with Gareth in the last games but I've played well alongside Frank too, I wouldn't say Gareth got the best out of me.<br><br>"I might have to change my game slightly to play with both of them but that is something I feel I can do at this level and I am comfortable playing with both." McClaren has admitted he faces a difficult decision, as Lampard has not been left out of a competitive international when fit since October 2003 when England drew 0-0 in Istanbul.<br><br>The England coach said: "The Barry and Lampard decision is a massive one, but it is a good position to be in. "They are two players who have performed well - Frank consistently over two or three years, Gareth in the last two games. "The team is the most important thing, not individuals and I think all the players understand that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First goal was the result of a sloppy mistake by Kruglov. The other 2 (deflections of Piiroja and RÃ¤hn) were unfortunate. But the Estonians improved and created some chances in the second half, though the Brits at the pub dismissed it as England dropping a gear. I'm still proud of them.</div>
