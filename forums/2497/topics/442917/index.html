              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">CLINT DEMPSEY pinched a dramatic winner as Fulham edged out ten-man Liverpool.</h2>
              <p>Dempsey prodded home on 85 minutes after Pepe Reina had turned away Danny Murphy's shot.</p>
              <p>It had been a real ding-dong battle that saw shot after shot pepper both goals — yet with no result.</p>
              <p>But Jay Spearing's 72nd-minute red card, for scything through Moussa Dembele, gave Fulham the advantage — before Dempsey cashed in by grabbing the points.</p>
              <p>It had taken just five minutes for the first chance to be carved out.</p>
              <p>Moussa Dembele and Bryan Ruiz sliced their way through — only for the Belgian to hit his shot straight at Pepe Reina.</p>
              <p>At the other end, Andy Carroll had a sighter but Mark Schwarzer saved his shot.</p>
              <p>Charlie Adam was next the threaten and pinged a shot at the Fulham stopper.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="margin-top-5 padding-bottom-5 margin-right-10 float-left" style="width: 250px;">

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It was end-to-end stuff already and Dembele and Dempsey both tested Reina with sharp long-rangers.</p>
              <p>Liverpool were a whisker from taking the lead after Jordan Henderson's dazzling 27th-minute run.</p>
              <p>Henderson danced through Fulham before dinking a shot against the post.</p>
              <p>Reina was called into action again when Dempsey hit a wobbler from distance.</p>
              <p>Incredibly, though, neither team could find a way through and the half ended goalless.</p>
              <p>After the break, both sides came charging out of the blocks — and Schwarzer pulled off a cracking early save from Jose Enrique.</p>
              <p>Liverpool then threatened as it pinballed around the box but Fulham held firm.</p>
              <p>Luis Suarez was then shouting for a penalty after going down between Brede Hangeland and John Arne Riise.</p>
              <p>Yet the striker's reputation went before him and his claims were dismissed.</p>
              <p>The Reds had a much more convincing appeal when Charlie Adam's darting run was ended by Phillipe Senderos.</p>
              <p>Senderos hauled down the Scot on the edge — and got the benefit of the doubt when a free-kick was given.</p>
              <p>Bellamy drilled the set-piece wide and it was a real let-off for the Cottagers.</p>
              <p>The Wales man was in the thick of it again shortly after when he dragged Glen Johnson's through-ball wide.</p>
              <p>Fulham were under the cosh now — yet were handed a boost when Spearing saw red for scything through Dembele on 72 minutes.</p>
              <p>The Kop ace dived in with both feet off the air and was sent for an early bath.</p>
              <p>Dempsey hit the bar with 10 minutes to go — and Downing had his own brush with glory when Schwarzer tipped his shot onto the post.</p>
              <p>Incredibly, there was still time for more drama.</p>
              <p>Murphy skinned Glen Johnson on the left before taking a pot-shot at goal. That was saved by Reina, but Dempsey was on hand to turn in.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Luis Suarez  - who is already facing a racism charge - could find himself in more hot water with the FA after making an obscene gesture towards Fulham supporters after Liverpool's 1-0 defeat.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Anfield striker was given a torrid time by the home support throughout the clash at Craven Cottage as he was subjected to chants of 'cheat' for what Fulham supporters perceived to be his constant diving.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">And Suarez cracked after the final whistle by making an explicit hand gesture towards Cottagers fans.  Wembley disciplinary chiefs will decide on Tuesday whether to investigate the incident further.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Suarez has already been charged by the FA for making racist remarks towards Manchester United defender Patrice Evra during the 1-1 draw at Anfield earlier this season.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">And Reds manager Kenny Dalglish admitted he could be forced to talk to Suarez about his conduct after the latest controversy to hit the Uruguay international.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I haven't seen the picture and I'm not taking anybody's word for it,' said Dalglish.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'If you show me the picture and I'm convinced that what you're saying is true, then I've got a decision to make.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">In response to Fulham fans branding Suarez a 'cheat', Dalglish added: 'That's scandalous. We'll look after Luis as best we can, and I think it's about time he got a bit of protection from some people.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'His integrity is impeccable. He can look in the mirror and go to bed at night and sleep soundly.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Liverpool's misery was compounded by Jay Spearing's debatable sending off - the latest incident in a controversial weekend of refereeing decisions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Liverpool midfielder clearly made contact with the ball in his challenge with Moussa Dembele  - but was given his marching orders by Kevin Friend after catching the Fulham forward with his follow through.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">And Dalglish felt his midfielder was harshly sent off: 'I think, you need to ask the referee what their interpretation is? What the level of acceptance is? 'Jay never had another thought in his mind but to win the ball, and he did win it.</span></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'The (offside) goal that Luis scored, Charlie [Adam] could have had a penalty. We played well enough to have won the game.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Fulham boss Martin Jol added: 'Was it a red card?  I think it was a bad tackle. 'If you see from another angle, you saw his ankle up there and I think it was a sending off.' </span></p>

              <p>Although Crouch did not score for Liverpool after 13 matches, he was at least getting the ball and chasing for the ball or providing goal assist.</p>
              <p>I may complained about him but I recognised his attempt in getting his goal eventually.</p>
              <p>As for Carroll, except for playing hard for a few matches, he is invisible. (He can change his name to John Cena, "You can't see me !!!")</p>
              <p>I dun see the value of starting him as he only deserved a place in substitution for time wasting.</p>
              <p>Luis did not score all the time but he is working his heart out when he get the ball.</p>
              <p>He is a player truly worth millions.</p>
              <p>Not really finding a scape goat for the defeat but hope Kenny can recognise that he can only rely on a few men and they are definitely not born in UK.</p>

              <p>Pool beat Fulham 5-2 in May and when asked if Liverpool could challenge for the title in 2012... Murphy replied: "It's hard to say because they have been playing under very little pressure. They haven't needed to go out and win games, and everything they get now is a bonus. It will be a different ask for those players to play under pressure every week if they are near the top, but with Kenny in charge and a few more additions they will be pushing for the top four again."</p>
              <p>Dalglish was unhappy and rebuked Murphy who championed Hodgson's credentials for the Liverpool job. The Liverpool manager said: "He [Murphy] should know there is always pressure here. He played here long enough, didn't he? I just know that we played fantastic that night against Fulham and so does he. (Pool won 2-5).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Looks like Murphy wanted to get one back at Kenny... and did it... lol.</p>
