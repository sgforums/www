              <h2>Rafa Benítez believes that Liverpool's hat-trick of home wins has
              set them up for their next five matches which will make or break the
              club's season.</h2>
              <p>The Spanish coach believes that his side are hitting top form as they
              prepare to face Everton, Manchester United and then Arsenal on three
              consecutive occasions.<br><br>Victory over Reading at the weekend
              ensured that the Reds are still in fourth place and Benítez is hoping
              that the run can continue in their next outing.<br><br>"We now have a
              very tough spell. Everyone kept saying that because of that we had to
              win our three home league games with West Ham, Newcastle and now
              Reading. We have now done that," he explained,<br><br>"Now we have really difficult games and we needed these seven wins beforehand.<br><br>"Now
              we have five very hard games, three with Arsenal plus Everton and
              Manchester United away next week. We will only think of each one as it
              arrives, you cannot start to worry about what is ahead.<br><br>"The
              first one is the most important. If we can keep our momentum then it
              will be easier going into the second one. We must not waste our time
              thinking too far ahead.<br><br>"We started the season playing well,
              winning a lot of games, scoring plenty of goals and we were unbeaten in
              the league until December.<br><br>"Still we have only lost three league games, our problem has been drawing too many and we are aware of that.<br><br>"If we had won just three of those drawn matches things would be very different."<br><br>Benítez
              is still hopeful of putting pressure on the top three in the final
              weeks of the campaign and has asked for patience before predictions are
              made.<br><br>"How near we finish to the top now will be interesting. We
              have been criticised this season, but let us see where we are in three
              or four weeks," he continued.<br><br>"We have important games and if we
              win them we will be a lot closer. If we can beat Manchester United we
              will be closer to the top, and that will give us more confidence.<br><br>"If we beat Everton after that then we will be closer still. Maybe, maybe we can be closer if we do not talk too much about it.<br><br>"Do we have a point to prove? Maybe, but only if we can keep winning three points."</p>
