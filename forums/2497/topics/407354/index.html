              the champions of Spain were preparing one final approach, but Fabregas 
              insists that he is now only thinking about the Gunners.<br> </span></p>
              <p>He said: 'Firstly I would like to apologise to all the Arsenal fans 
              for not speaking sooner about my future but I have not known what I was 
              going to do until this moment.</p>
              <p>'I cannot deny that joining a club like Barcelona was not an 
              attractive move for me.</p>
              <p>'This was the club where I learned my football, it is my home town 
              where my friends and family are and a club where I have always dreamed 
              of playing.</p>
              <p>'There are not many players in the world who would not want to play 
              for Barcelona.'</p>

              </div>
              <p>The 23-year-old told his manager Arsene Wenger before the World Cup 
              that he wanted to go to Barcelona, but the Frenchman remained steadfast 
              in his intention not to part with a player who was still under contract 
              for five more years.</p>
              <p>Fabregas said: 'I have had many conversations with Arsene Wenger both in person and 
              over the phone over the last few months and although the content of 
              those conversations will remain private, the conclusion is that 
              Barcelona have had two formal offers rejected by Arsenal.</p>
              <p>'I am a professional and I fully understand that it is Arsenal's 
              prerogative not to sell me. I owe a lot to the club, manager and the fans and I will respect 
              their decision and will now concentrate on the new season ahead with 
              Arsenal.</p>

In the meantime, the Catalan club have led a public pursuit of the midfielder, with calls from several players from the Spanish giants' fold urging the 23-year-old to join their ranks.<br><br>It had previously been reported that the Gunners had rejected a £29 million bid from the Spanish side to acquire the services of their star, and Wilson is consequently dismayed with the entire saga - insisting that Barca currently do not have the financial muscle to prise Fabregas away from his current employers.<br><br>"I think they have shown complete disrespect throughout the whole episode," Wilson told reporters.<br><br>"They know as well as anyone else that if you are going for the best players in the world then you have to have respect and the bottom line of Barcelona's situation is that they can't afford to buy him for what he is worth.<br><br>"He is worth a minimum of £50m and Barcelona are struggling financially."<br><br>Now, however, there have been reports of Barca pulling out of the chase and looking at secondary targets, and Wilson believes that the World Cup winner will still give his best for Arsenal.<br><br>"I don't think we need to tell him that everyone at the club loves him," he said. <br><br>"He has a second father at the club in Arsene Wenger and I think Arsene will be able to get his head around the fact that he is an Arsenal player and not a Barcelona player.<br><br>"This season, he is going to lead us to something big."<br></span></div>
