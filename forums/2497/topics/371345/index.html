              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsene Wenger</span></abbr> is unhappy with the expectations of fans.</p>
              <p>"I feel that what is accepted at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> is to win the Champions League and the (Barclays <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr>)
              title. Anything else is looked at like a disaster," said Wenger, who
              was at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London on Thursday to help
              launch the club's partnership with the famous children's charity.</p>
              <p>"In 2007, we were very close to winning the championship, last
              year we were in the semi-finals of the Champions League and it was
              looked at like a disaster.</p>
              <p>"A fan who had been a supporter of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> for 50 years, he told me last season had been a disaster. I asked him 'how many times have <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> been to the semi-finals of the Champions League since you have been watching the club'?"</p>
              <p>Wenger, though, insists there are plenty of reasons to be positive.</p>
              <p>"Overall, our results last year were not as disastrous as people think, nor in the way we played our football," said the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> boss.</p>
              <p>"We did not win a trophy, and of course that hurts. but the
              overall assessment of the season has been highly negative because we
              did not win a trophy in the years before.</p>
              <p>"We had a bad start, but then had the longest unbeaten run in the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr>, were in the semi-finals of the FA Cup and the Champions League. We did not lose against bad teams.</p>
              <p>"If you look at the average age of the team and our overall achievement, I think it is quite remarkable."</p>

              <p>"It’s not crucial on the financial side of the club," Wenger told the <em>club's official website</em>. "It’s crucial on the football side. We want to play with the best and that means the Champions League Group Stage.</p>
              <p>"We are conscious that we have tricky teams out there [in the Play-Off

              <p>as a manager, what he should be concentrating is winning games and trophy and not the financial part of the job. no wonder he has no interest in real madrid job because AW like total control of the club. at real madrid he can only do the footballing matters on the pitch. anymore off the pitch such as players transfer, he will have no say.</p>

              <p><br>Actually Arsenal doesn't splash big money on player and they always sell their star player which reduces their wages burden and recruit youngster.</p>
              <p>What he says hold some truth. But they are not going to win anything if they keep relying on youngster. Many top player in Arsenal will just treat Arsenal as stepping stone for better club to win trophy.</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> are playing for a jackpot of £25 MILLION in their Champions League playoff clash with Celtic.</p>
              <p>The <em>Daily Mail</em> says Arsene Wenger’s side will pick up around
              £18m in television money and matchday revenue from six group games if
              they get past Celtic following yesterday’s draw for the final
              qualifying round.</p>
              <p>And should Arsenal win every game of the round-robin phase they
              will get a further £8.5m and it is easy to see why beating Tony
              Mowbray’s team is so important to Arsenal.

              <p>Even
              the fact that the loser will drop into the revamped Europa League is of
              scant recompense given the continued financial disparity between the

              <div class="content">
              <p>Liam Brady has warned his <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> to expect the unexpected in their Champions League playoff against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Celtic</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Brady, the former <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Celtic</span></abbr> manager who is <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr>'s head of youth development, told the <em>Guardian</em>: "Our players have been all over the continent but they will never have experienced anything like it. The atmosphere at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Celtic</span></abbr> Park is unique. <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> have to go and cope with the environment and the pace <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Celtic</span></abbr> will play at and the tremendous following they have. It is different to
              what you get in mainland Europe. Our players will have to be prepared
              for that.</p>
              <p>"The <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Celtic</span></abbr> Park leg is the unknown aspect of this tie. For intensity, it will be a bit like the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>-<abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> quarter-final from a couple of years ago."</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Celtic</span></abbr>'s
              dramatic away win at Dynamo Moscow, to set up this tie , suggests they
              are very much in the mood to upset the odds in this European campaign.
              Brady is conscious of how keenly <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Celtic</span></abbr> respond to adversity.</p>
              <p>"If you match the two teams up player for player, there is no argument about who is the strongest. You have to fancy <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> big-time, but <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Celtic</span></abbr> have proved they can raise their game when they are underdogs," he said.</p>
              <p>"They have started the season well under Tony Mowbray. He gets his
              teams to play football ... But I think there will be plenty of
              aggression, too. You need to be on the inside to realise how big the
              expectation is ... which I discovered during my two and a bit years
              there. It is like leading a community rather than just being a football
              manager."</p>
              <p>The high stakes will only add to the tension.</p>
              <p>Brady said: "Both teams are desperate to get into the group
              stages, and possibly beyond, for the financial rewards as well as
              sporting reasons. <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> are under pressure to get to where the team has been for several years. <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Celtic</span></abbr> badly need it because they get very little domestic revenue in Scottish football."</p>

              <p>Yeah, the match at Celtic won't be easy... Arsenal will have to win at home which I think they will to go through... cos I don't think they can get a win at Celtic Park, at best a draw or maybe even losing is a possibility...</p>
              <p>The lucky part of this is Arsenal play the 2nd leg at home... So whatever damage done in the first leg can still be fix...</p>
