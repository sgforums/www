              <h1>Karim Benzema Outburst Causes Real Madrid Rift - Report</h1>
              <h2>Los Blancos' summer recruit is reportedly unhappy with his role in the squad, and has made his feelings perfectly clear...</h2>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Karim Benzema</span><span style="color: #000000;"> has stunned </span><span style="color: #000000;">Real Madrid</span><span style="color: #000000;"> by stating that he does not want to play up front with </span><span style="color: #000000;">Raul</span></strong><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> and is furious about being constantly substituted during matches, according to a report in <em>Sport</em>.</strong><br></span><br>The moody French striker raged at coach Manuel Pellegrini after the defeat in Sevilla, when he was again withdrawn, because he was assured that he would not be rotated.<br><br>The report states that Benzema's attitude has not gone down well at the Santiago Bernabeu and that his outburst may have more serious repercussions within the squad.<br><br>The €35 million signing reportedly believes that playing up front with Raul is hampering him because he thinks that the Madrid captain is not mobile enough and that they cross over each other.<br><br>Pellegrini chose to listen to the forward's outburst, remaining silent as the Frenchman fumed that it is his right to play whole games after being brought in for such a large fee from Olympique Lyonnais.<br><br>The outburst by the player and the coach's inability to react shows that Pellegrini has less influence than he would like at the club.<br><br>In the summer the Chilean coach wanted to keep Alvaro Negredo and use the €35m that was spent on Benzema to keep Wesley Sneijder and Arjen Robben.<br><br>President Florentino Perez wanted a big name up front, and the move for Benzema was made, but that could be about to backfire as the first signs of his temperament are showing.<br><br>Pellegrini supposedly felt that Benzema was not mature enough for a move to Real Madrid.</p>

              <p>Ya lor I feel him and Ronaldinho the same move to Spain whne they know they could have gone to United. Ferguson has more experience than Pellegrini just look at Rooney.</p>

              <p>well, it was not his fault that he was priced @ 35M..</p>
              <p>Have U seen him play at RM? He is top quality la.. Do note, Berba was also for 30+ M too. I bet he would have more motivation playing alongside a more mobile Rooney. (no discredit to Raul).</p>
              <p>As for troublemaker, we all know that with SAF, he can "nuture" all these kids by giving them the proper care/support/discpline.</p>
              <p>One problem as pointed out in football focus last tues, Berba, was superb at Spurs, cause he was the super star, but at United, he is struggling cause he is among many super stars (who won more than him), so he needs tons of elbow grease to shine his own star. Only now, he is seen to be putting in more elbow grease than the first season. And one thing, Berba is 28+, a mature but ageing footballer already.</p>
              <p>Sorry, for me, Benzema anytime.</p>
              <p>As for ego bit, Rooney was one, Ronaldo was one, Beckham was one, Keano was one... but all nicely packed into SAF's team, right?</p>

              <p>crap la benzema. that means he's not really complete and got a lot to learn. He wants raul to adapt to him instead of vice versa.</p>

              <p>i would like him to come since we have only 3 strikers that have played at the top level.</p>
              <p>owen isnt gonna get many starts, and that leaves us with two regulars. an injury to berbatov or rooney would be disastrous. owen will be 30 at the end of tis year, while berbatov will be 29 early next year.. there is a real need to buy a young emerging striker, &amp; benzema fits the bill.</p>
              <p>we need to sign one more top level striker, preferably the jan transfer window. it would be costly for a raw talent, but haven't fergie polished many players into genuine world beaters already?</p>
              <p>altho he snubbed utd for madrid, as long as he is willing to come now, i would still welcome him into the team.</p>

              <p>Yes i have watched him play this season, just flashes of skills at times only but nothing that make me go Wow you know what I mean... I personally am more impress with Bellamy's form this season than his... And yeah its not his fault that Real paid $35m for him, but if he starts to think just because he cost $35m euros he should automatically start in the first team or not be sub out then there is a problem...</p>
              <p>When he said he was assured that he would not be rotated i think he is being naive... He is at Real Mardid and they have a number of other top players to play as well... And to pick on Raul or all people is even more silly... The guy is their captain and has still kept scoring... He may have been great in litte league France but he is still new to La Liga so he should be more humble and patient... Take this time to gain more experience in his first year... Raul is probably the most experienced Real striker in La Liga... He should learn from him... Moreover, he is not only at a new club, he is also in a new league... Maybe the manager is trying to ease him in bit by bit...</p>
              <p>And lets be serious, even Robinho who cost more is not assured a first team place at City...  Rotation is part of the game now unless he is David Villa, Eto'o, Ibrahimovic or Torres kind of players... All established strikers... He is still considered a relatively new upstart with lots of potential...</p>

              <p>Presently, Liverpool can't function with two out and out strikers la.</p>
              <p>Keane came and gone, and look @ kuryt.</p>
              <p>That space is for Gerrard to burst forward, and does his damage.</p>
              <p>So IMHO, as long as Torres/Gerrard, Pool no need another big striker.</p>

              <p>Yes i have watched him play this season, just flashes of skills
              at times only but nothing that make me go Wow you know what I
              mean... I personally am more impress with Bellamy's
              form this season than his... And yeah its not his
              fault that Real paid $35m for him, but if he starts to think just
              because he cost $35m euros he should automatically start in the
              first team or not be sub out then there is a problem...</p>
              <p>When he said he was assured that he would not be rotated i think
              he is being naive... He is at Real Mardid and they have a number of
              other top players to play as well... And to pick on Raul or all
              people is even more silly... The guy is their captain and has still
              kept scoring... He may have been great in litte league France but
              he is still new to La Liga so he should be more humble and
              patient... Take this time to gain more experience in his
              first year... Raul is probably the most experienced Real striker in
              La Liga... He should learn from him... Moreover, he is not only at
              a new club, he is also in a new league... Maybe the manager is
              trying to ease him in bit by bit...</p>
              <p>And lets be serious, even Robinho who cost more is not assured a
              first team place at City...  Rotation is part of the game
              now unless he is David Villa, Eto'o, Ibrahimovic or Torres kind of
              players... All established strikers... He is still considered
              a relatively new upstart with lots of potential...</p>

              <p>well, I think for a start, we shan't believe all we read from the press la. They make up stories just to sell. And for him to go after Raul, where even Beckham/Ronaldo can't take his shirt number is just absurd.</p>
              <p>I think that all players want to play, and this is an unpolished gem, and what better place than at OT where an accomplished master craftman can make this gem shine, right?</p>
