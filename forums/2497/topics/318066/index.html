              <h1>Dark side of the moon for Chelsea as "ghost goal' ref Michel returns to haunt them in Champions League Final</h1>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/05_04/LubosMichel_468x613.jpg"><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/05_04/LubosMichel_468x613.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="377"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The referee who awarded a controversial "goal from the moon" against Chelsea will take charge of the Champions League Final with Manchester United on Wednesday. Slovakian Lubos Michel was heavily criticised by then Blues boss Jose Mourinho after judging that Luis Garcia's effort had crossed the line at Anfield in the second leg of the European semi-final against Liverpool in 2005.</strong></p>
              <p>Mourinho moaned at the time it was "a goal from the moon" and added: "Football sometimes is cruel. We have to accept the result. They scored a goal, if you can say they scored it." Michel has officiated in a Chelsea match since, having taken charge of the group match with Werder Bremen last season — Mourinho's team lost that game 1-0 as well.</p>
              <p>The referee, who was 40 last Friday, is regarded as one of the top officials in Europe. The former teacher speaks English, Russian, German and Polish and was ranked the world's third best referee in 2005, second best in 2006 and third best again last year.</p>
              <p>But he also drew criticism from Martin O'Neill after he took charge of the 2003 UEFA Cup Final between Porto and Celtic. Michel was accused of poor officiating after sending off Celtic defender Bobo Balde for a second bookable offence during the Scots' 3-2 defeat in Seville.</p>
              <p>Celtic manager O'Neill, who faced a UEFA inquiry because of his complaints about Michel's performance, felt the official tolerated an excessive amount of time wasting by Porto. Mourinho benefited from the decisions made by Michel that day as he was still in charge at Porto.</p>
              <p>His replacement at Stamford Bridge, Avram Grant, will be hoping for the same in Moscow but he may still lose his job even if Chelsea win on Wednesday. It looks increasingly likely that Grant will move back upstairs next season and resume his role as director of football.</p>
