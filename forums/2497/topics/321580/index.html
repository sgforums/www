              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>SAMIR NASRI will become Arsenal's second summer signing after he flew into London for a medical. The French midfield ace, 20, should complete a £13million switch from Marseille within days after reportedly agreeing a five-year contract.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Marseille chairman Pape Diouf said: "There is an agreement between Arsenal and Marseille but Nasri is not officially an Arsenal player. "He must first complete the medical."</p>
              <p class="article">Gunners boss Arsenal Wenger has been linked with the highly-rated playmaker for the past two months. And speculation suggests a deal was struck prior to Euro 2008.</p>
              <p class="article">Nasri's imminent arrival follows Arsenal's £5million purchase of Cardiff midfielder Aaron Ramsey, 17. But Wenger still faces a testing summer as doubts mount over the future of key men Alex Hleb, Emmanuel Adebayor and Gael Clichy.</p>
              <p class="article">Top scorer Adebayor insists he wants to stay. But the Gunners' wage regime means Mathieu Flamini's exit to AC Milan might not be the last blow before the new season.</p>
              <p class="article">Nasri is expected to sign at the Emirates this week before jetting off on a three-week holiday.</p>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>GAEL CLICHY has become the latest Arsenal star to make Europe’s ‘Most Wanted’ list. It means the Gunners could lose three of their top players in a summer of transfer crisis.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Clichy, Emmanuel Adebayor and Alexander Hleb are all targets for clubs in Italy and Spain. Having already lost Mathieu Flamini to AC Milan on a free transfer, boss Arsene Wenger now faces an uphill task to stop his side from disintegrating.</p>
              <p class="article">Both Roma and Juventus are plotting to land left-back Clichy, 22. Roma boss Luciano Spalletti said: “Clichy is an excellent defender of international class. He is also still very young, so has plenty of football improvement left in him. “Certainly, it would please me a great deal to see Gael Clichy in a Roma shirt. We will have to wait and see what develops.”</p>
              <p class="article">Roma signed John Arne Riise from Liverpool for £4million only this week, though they may well decide to use the Norwegian international in more of a left-sided midfield role than as a left-back.</p>
              <p class="article">Former Chelsea boss Claudio Ranieri, now in charge of Juventus, also revealed his desire to sign French ace Clichy. Ranieri declared: “Having worked in England with Chelsea, I know the Premier League players very well and have to admit that Gael Clichy is one of the most impressive players right now. “He is an important player, above all, because of his versatility. I believe he can play anywhere down the left and across the defence, too. He could come to Juventus.”</p>
              <p class="article">Adebayor seems almost certain to leave, after two of Europe’s biggest clubs said they want him. AC Milan confirmed last night they will go to war with Barcelona for the signature of the Togo striker. SunSport revealed on Wednesday that Wenger had already sent Milan a no-nonsense ‘hands off’ fax a week ago.</p>
              <p class="article">But vice-president Adriano Galliani is undeterred and vowed they will fight to land the £24m-rated hitman. Galliani said: “We currently have a single transfer operation under way — the one for Adebayor. “Arsenal, at the moment, do not want to sell. I have a letter from them that says they are not ready to negotiate.</p>
              <p class="article">“Anything can happen but for now we are not authorised to negotiate with the player. “AC Milan are absolutely clear. Either Adebayor arrives or we stay as we are. There is no negotiation for Samuel Eto’o or Didier Drogba.”</p>
              <p class="article">Barca also confirmed yesterday they are in talks with Hleb’s agent over a possible £14m move to the Nou Camp. The midfield schemer from Belarus was one of Wenger’s best players last season but has been unsettled after another barren Emirates campaign. The loss of Hleb would be a real blow to Wenger, given his vital contribution to the team during the last campaign.</p>
              <p class="article">A close mate of Flamini, Hleb was annoyed when the club allowed him to leave and is determined to follow him out the door. Hleb linked up brilliantly with Cesc Fabregas last season but may yet see himself at the same club as Adebayor. Barca are convinced the Gunners’ striker would prefer to move to Spain ahead of Milan.</p>
              <p class="article">The Spanish giants would be delighted to bag both Adebayor and Hleb, though it would take around £40m to get the pair. Wenger is determined not to allow his hard work in putting a team together fall apart, though this could be his toughest challenge to date.</p>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>ARSENAL are back in the hunt for Obafemi Martins — but refuse to pay Newcastle’s £15million asking price.</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The striker, 23, was alarmed when the Toon tried to sell him to Liverpool a month ago. A friend of Martins, who cost £10m from Inter Milan two years ago said: “Oba just doesn’t know what’s going on any more.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“He loves the Toon fans so much but one minute Newcastle are desperate for him to stay, the next they are trying to sell him. "But he would love to play for Arsene Wenger.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Barcelona, Chelsea and Manchester City are also interested.</p>
