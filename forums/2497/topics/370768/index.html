              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Carlo Ancelotti</span></abbr> says his system will be built around a midfield diamond - and he is counting on Deco and Joe Cole to be part of it.</p>
              <p>"<abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> can play Lampard, Deco and also we can play Joe Cole, he has the
              quality to play behind the striker and maybe also Kalou," Carletto told
              <em>chelseafc.com</em>.</p>
              <p>"Lampard can play on the left and he can play offensive midfielder. I
              want to try this because I like games where he is in this position.</p>
              <p>"The other players can play in the diamond in a different role,
              they can play up front or they can play behind the striker, so I want
              to play with the diamond."</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Carlo Ancelotti</span></abbr> insists he will introduce a new style of football at Stamford Bridge this season.</p>
              <p>He told <em>chelseafc.com</em>: "The most important thing to win is the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> and the Champions League.</p>
              <p>"To win these would be a success, but we also need to have an identity
              with the team and I think we are going the right way about doing this.
              In the last games I saw some very good ideas coming from the players."</p>
              <p>It can sometimes take time for a side to reap rewards following
              a change of leadership, but Ancelotti's pre-season campaign proves his
              ability as a manager, and he has no doubts about his best quality.</p>
              <p>"My patience is my biggest strength," explained the
              Champions-League winning coach, "although I also love football and I
              think this is the biggest point.</p>
              <p>"I love the tactics, the play, and I love finding solutions and trying new solutions.</p>
              <p>"But the most important thing is to have a team who play with a
              clear idea of how they need to play. So we prepare the training with
              this objective."</p>

              <p>Juliano Belletti admits he seriously considered leaving <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> last year.</p>
              <p>"Last year was hard, the team was in China and I was here, it was a
              difficult moment because I had some questions about my future and it
              was tense," he admitted to <em>chelseafc.com</em>.</p>
              <p>"But the most important thing was just to keep training, keep the
              motivation, because I remember when the team came back from China and
              played against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> at home. Essien was injured, Mikel was out, so Scolari didn't have a player to play this game, and I played and scored a goal.</p>
              <p>"In another situation if I stayed here and I felt bad and didn't want
              to train, for this game I would not be good to play, so I think in my
              career I learned something then."</p>
              <p>The Brazil midfielder added: "Last year was different, I felt
              nothing and was just looking for my future, but this year I feel more
              important. I can tell you we never know what is next. but now I feel
              important to the team."</p>
