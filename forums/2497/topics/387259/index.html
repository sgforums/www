"If a club gets a lot of money or subsidies from a big backer and is still in deficit in two years then it is a problem and we don't want that," Platini said in August.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Two days after those comments, the European Club Association (ECA) approved Platini's proposals and Uefa privately confirmed yesterday that it is adding the "financial fair play" rules to its statutes in time for the 2013-14 season. The delay in the implementation was yesterday described as an effort to provide clubs a "soft landing", but Uefa firmly envisages that clubs who fail to meet the regulations will be prevented from taking part in its competitions.</p>
              <p>Since the biggest clubs generate interest and revenue for the Champions League, the suspension of those such as Chelsea and City would be a test of resolve. But Uefa has been emboldened by the broad ECA support, and insiders at Uefa are bullish.</p>
              <p>"There needs to be a business model for breaking even within three and a half years," a source said. "The deadline is what it is and we will stick to it; we have tremendous support from the clubs."</p>
              <p>Between them City and Chelsea have declared losses in the year to June 2009 of more than £130m. Chelsea's chief executive, Ron Gourlay, has abandoned a specific target date for break-even, reassessing it as an aspiration.</p>
              <h2><strong>City playing catch-up</strong><br></h2>
              Profits, and so a sustainable place in the Champions League, seem a long way off for Manchester City, even though Sheikh Mansour's £305m of loans have been converted into equity.
              <p> </p>
              <p>Turning Chelsea into regular title challengers has cost Roman Abramovich £500m in cumulative losses. City have not shrunk from that target, spending £117.5m on transfer fees last summer and an estimated £30m a year in wages for Emmanuel Adebayor, Carlos Tevez, Kolo Touré, Roque Santa Cruz and Joleon Lescott. But, crucially, Sheikh Mansour's club start from a weaker base.</p>
              <p>When Abramovich bought Chelsea they were already in the Champions League and had a turnover of £153.6m, £66m – or 73% – more than City have. And City's prospects for raising extra revenues from ticket sales do not look great. Their attendances have risen more than 3,000 from their season average to 46,000, but, right up until its postponement, there were about 400 seats available on general sale for the Carling Cup semi-final against Manchester United: City's first last-four place since the 1981 FA Cup.</p>

              <p>Rafa did say in this interview that he may be forced to sell Torres if someone comes in with a 100mil pound offer if they do not make it to the champs league this season. Makes sense. 100 mil pound offer, who can resist that. The question will be for him to secure most of it to be reinvested in the team which at current situation will be pretty tricky with the American owners....</p>

              <p>Not really, actually I believe that Man Utd is earning more than they spend, just that they have huge debts to cover. But if thats the case then Arsenal have quite a few debts as well cause of their stadium</p>

              <p>Honestly, apart from crazy City, I can't see anyone paying more than $50 or $60 million for him... not even Chelsea. And also I don't think it's in Rafa's hands to decide especially if he cannot get them a CL place... And putting his job on the line won't help much either... If anything it might do, it might actually encourage the owners to make Rafa quit on his own accord and forego his compensation... lol...</p>
              <p>And yeah, the "financial fair play" rules will only effect clubs that make consecutive losses over three seasons... Only Chelsea, City and maybe Pool whose yearly profit isn't great... But I think Chelsea is bringing it under control, 6 straight year of losing... from $140m to present $44m per season... And Pool should too by then. Only City will have lesser time than Chelsea...</p>

              <p>torres will leave liverpool end of this season i strongly believe.</p>
              <p>i think he also know liverpool doesnt have the financial resources to compete and there will not be a chance for liverpool to win EPL or UCL in coming seasons.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>fabregas will also leave if arsenal dont win a trophy or 2 this season. AW stubborness to spent on big players would cause disillusion to the star players whether arsenal would be serious contenters for trophy or more interested in servicing their bank debts.</p>
