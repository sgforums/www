            <div class='col-md body'>Newcastle United are looking for a new manager after parting company with Sam Allardyce on Wednesday afternoon.<br><br><strong>TOON CONTENDERS</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">ALAN SHEARER</span><br>In 10 years on Tyneside as a player, Shearer attained legendary status with 206 goals in all competitions and has long been touted as a potential United manager. He may lack experience but he knows the club - and its politics - better than anybody.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">MARTIN JOL</span><br>The big Dutchman was a popular figure at Tottenham right up to his sacking in October, and he led a Spurs revival which came within a win - and a few healthy stomachs - of Champions League qualification in 2005-06.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">JOSE MOURINHO</span><br>The 'Special One' has been kicking his heels since his shock departure from Chelsea in September. He is a long shot but has all the credentials required - including a notoriously thick skin - to end the Toon's long and painful wait for silverware.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">JURGEN KLINSMANN</span><br>In his only managerial job to date, the former striker led his native Germany to the semi-finals of the 2006 World Cup against the odds. He would bring some fresh ideas and his reputation would guarantee the respect of the dressing room.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">STEVE McCLAREN</span><br>His stock may still be low following his failure to guide England to Euro 2008, but he remains one of the best English coaches in the game. And don't forget he led north-east rivals Middlesbrough, a far smaller club, to the 2004 League Cup and the UEFA Cup final two years later - more than anyone has achieved at Newcastle in many a year.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">MARCELLO LIPPI</span><br>Yet another reported England candidate, who, like Jol, rejected Birmingham earlier in the season. The Italian's track record is second to none with the 2006 World Cup, the Champions League and Serie A titles on his CV.<br><br>The former Bolton Wanderes boss spent just eight months in the job after being appointed by Freddy Shepherd at the end of last season.<br><br>But while new owner Mike Ashley stood by the 53-year-old after his Â£134m summer takeover of the club, rumours of his demise persistently circled St James' Park as the Geordies slumped into the bottom half of the Premier League despite a promising start to the campaign.<br><br>The decision to change manager clearly came as a surprise to Allardyce, who said: 'I'm disappointed obviously but I'd just like to wish everybody at Newcastle all the best for the future and I hope things go very, very well.<br><br>'Yes it was a shock, I didn't expect it.'<br><br>Allardyce launched his tenure in fine style with a 3-1 victory at former club Bolton on the opening day of the season and went unbeaten for five games.<br><br>But a dreadful 1-0 defeat at struggling Derby County on September 17 set the alarm bells ringing and more recently, abject defeats at home to Liverpool and away at Wigan seem to have sealed his fate.<br><br>Every time Newcastle failed to produce results, or much attacking intent on the road, Mike Ashley, who often watched the matches from the stands, was surrounded by fans calling for Big Sam's head.<br><br>And all the while, the shadow of Alan Shearer loomed large with many supporters telling Ashley their prodigal son was the only man who could reverse the club's fortune.<br><br>The former England skipper is out of the country at the moment but speculation is sure to reach fever pitch in the coming days as to whether he will take the job. He is already 4-6 with the bookies to get the job.<br><br>Jose Mourinho's name has also been mentioned in recent days on Tyneside, though that may be more in hope than expectation.<br><br>Allardyce took training as usual on Wednesday morning and held his normal press conference in the afternoon, rebuffing claims that Steven Taylor and Obafemi Martins were the subject of bids from rival Premier League clubs.<br><br>An official statement on said: 'Newcastle United have today parted company with Sam Allardyce as its Manager with immediate effect.<br><br>'This decision has been reached by mutual consent.'<br><br>Newcastle United Chairman Chris Mort said: 'Mike and I would like to place on record our thanks for Sam's efforts and wish him well for the future.<br><br>'A new manager has not yet been appointed at Newcastle United. We will make a further announcement on the managerial position when appropriate.<br><br>Sam Allardyce said: 'I am disappointed to be leaving Newcastle United but I wish the club all the best for the remainder of the season and for the future.'<br><br>First team coach Nigel Pearson will take charge of Saturday's game at Manchester United.'<br><br>Allardyce spent just 24 games as Toon boss, but the Magpies had only won one game in the last six.<br><br>Woeful displays at home to Liverpool and away at Wigan had the loyal Toon Army voicing their disquiet, but after avoiding defeat at Stoke in the FA Cup third round on Sunday it appeared Allardyce had weathered the storm.<br><br>And many will question the time of this sacking and the way it was handled with Big Sam apparently unaware of the move up until around 5pm this evening.<br><br>Big Sam is the sixth manager to be sacked since Kevin Keegan's triumphant reign ended in January</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sir Bobby 'stunned' by Allardyce departure</strong><br><br>Former Newcastle United boss Sir Bobby Robson admits he was 'stunned' to hear of Sam Allardyce's departure as manager of the club - and believes the number of managers leaving their posts is 'sad' for the game.<br><br>Robson, who lifted the club away from relegation after taking charge in 1999 and led them to Champions League qualification, was himself sacked by Newcastle in 2004.<br><br>Allardyce has left his post by 'mutual agreement' after a poor start to the job, having taken over in May.<br><br>Robson told BBC Radio Five: 'Like most people I was very surprised and stunned by the news.<br><br>'I was in his company on Tuesday night, I went to see Newcastle reserves play Sunderland reserves and Sam was there.<br><br>'So hearing the news was without doubt a surprise, and I am stunned. That's the eighth Premiership manager we've lost this season already. The pressure is too much now in the Premiership.<br><br>'The dismissals of manager are coming fast and frequent and it's rather sad for the game in many respects.'<br><br>Newcastle fanzine editor Mark Jensen believes the club's supporters had a 'pre-conceived idea' of the brand of football Allardyce would bring to St James' Park.<br><br>The former Bolton manager parted company with the club on Wednesday after replacing Glenn Roeder.<br><br>He has endured a difficult reign and leaves the club 11th in the Barclays Premier League - 10 points away from a UEFA Cup spot and nine points from the relegation zone.<br><br>The 53-year-old has long been viewed as a purveyor of `ugly' football, and Jensen, editor of The Mag, admits Newcastle fans are desperate for a return to the entertaining approach last seen under Kevin Keegan.<br><br>'At the end of the day it's all about results and entertainment and we had very little entertainment,' he said.<br><br>'Any manager goes by their results. Maybe people felt there wasn't progress on the pitch - whether that would have changed over time we will never know.<br><br>'Newcastle fans had a pre-conceived idea of the football that he would play - I don't think he did much to dispel that.<br><br>'I think he maybe tried to play a style of football that didn't suit players he had available - whether he'd had time to bring in his own players, would he have been able to do it at a higher level than he did at Bolton?<br><br>'But despite that, if he had got the results he would still be manager of Newcastle United.'<br><br>Allardyce was the sixth permanent manager since the departure of Keegan in 1997, but despite his short tenure Jensen is not convinced that he would have brought success even if he had been given time.<br><br>'I'm gutted that another manager goes and another manager who hasn't been able to bring success to Newcastle - he's just another in a long line,' he added.<br><br>'People say you've got to give time to make a success of a club. Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger have been successful because they have been given time.<br><br>'But if you pick the wrong one and give them time then it's time down the drain.<br><br>'I think it was a bizarre set of circumstances that only days after he joined there was a change of ownership at the club.<br><br>'I think any manager would have found that hard to get their head around.'<br><br>Former Newcastle forward Mick Quinn believes the fans got what they wanted and insists the only man for the job now is Geordie legend Alan Shearer.<br><br>'From the fans' point of view they are probably a little bit disillusioned with the way things were. When Sam came to the club they expected a lot more,' he said.<br><br>'There was a whole mood of frustration and nothing much has moved on from previous seasons.<br><br>'Mike Ashley is no mug and he's being sitting amongst them and listening to them.<br><br>'He (Allardyce) is strong enough to take it and he'll be disappointed because he's a passionate guy. The fans have won again and they'll want one of their own now.<br><br>'Alan Shearer would be as good as anyone. He turned down a move to Manchester United - forget the goals he scored - they are eternally grateful for that and they want him as their number one.'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>YOU could be excused for calling it the Curse of the Toon.</strong><br><br>Some might call it the Curse of Kevin Keegan.<br><br>What is undeniable is that managing Newcastle United is one of the most demanding, formidable and fractious jobs in the business. In fact, itÂ’s almost unmanageable.<br><br>When Keegan was England boss, he asked a few of us whether we thought his time at St JamesÂ’ Park had been a success. I told him it hadnÂ’t because of the simple fact the club had not won anything during his time on Tyneside.<br><br>This surprised him. He replied: Â“But what about the football we played? IsnÂ’t that what itÂ’s all about? On that score, I reckon it was a tremendous success. YouÂ’re being a bit harsh.Â”<br><br>He was right. Newcastle may not have won the title for 80 years. They may not have won the FA Cup since the glory days of Jackie Milburn in the 50s.<br><br>Their last piece of relevant silverware may have been the European Fairs Cup in 1969.<br><br>But Geordie fans still judge every manager on what Keegan brought to Newcastle in the mid-90s.<br><br>Yes, they blew a 12-point lead at the top of the table in 1995-96 to let Manchester United back in.<br><br>They then started like a train the following season before, again, having to settle for second place.<br><br>But Newcastle supporters loved the style. They loved players like Peter Beardsley, David Ginola, Les Ferdinand, Alan Shearer and Philippe Albert.<br><br>Embedded in their memories is the outrageous chip by Albert that concluded the 5-0 demolition of Manchester United at St JamesÂ’ in October 1996.<br><br>But that was as good as it got. Keegan left after falling out with the board and it has never really been the same since. That magic has never been recaptured.<br><br>No, they never did win anything but the memories are still vibrant with the team playing football the way Newcastle United supporters liked their football to be played. In fact, it was the way EVERY football fan wanted their team to perform.<br><br>And that, for many of us, has appeared to be the root of the problem at Newcastle.<br><br>In that all-too-brief spell under Keegan, the people of Tyneside were treated to a mesmeric, mind-blowing drug.<br><br>Their club were up there with the very best Â— at many times, they WERE the very best.<br><br>Yet the owners of the club Â— the people least-well equipped to deal with success because they had no experience of the years of famine Â— took the Keegan era for granted.<br><br>In their minds, it would continue. They became arrogant, full of themselves, thinking it was they who wielded the magic wand.<br><br>The Halls and Freddy Shepherd strode about the town Â— and elsewhere Â— imagining they had unlocked the door to success.<br><br>That it was all down to them. That whoever they appointed, the glorious dawn created by Keegan would continue Â— and they would bathe in the magnificent rays of summer that would follow.<br><br>After Keegan, well, just go for another big name. Except Kenny Dalglish, fortunate to inherit a powerhouse at Liverpool, was found out on Tyneside.<br><br>Ruud Gullit and sexy football? That didnÂ’t last long, either. It was all heading in the opposite direction.<br><br>The men who ran Newcastle were discovering that sexy names Â— big footballing stars who they hoped would make them look good Â— did not work.<br><br>And then they went back to their roots. Bobby Robson was a Geordie, here was a man who knew and understood the locality, a man of enormous character and pedigree, a man who would weld together the club and the fans.<br><br>And he did. Three top-five finishes. Champions League football Â— and still it wasnÂ’t enough.<br><br>Still Shepherd wanted more. But what did he want more of?<br><br>He and the Halls had made untold millions out of the club. You got the feeling that now that was all they were interested in.<br><br>And so it was Graeme Souness, Glenn Roeder and now, the final casualty, Sam Allardyce. Shepherd sacked Robson and, in his final act, appointed Allardyce. What a legacy. Having made Â£40million or so, why should he care?<br><br>And so we come to Mike Ashley. A man known best of all in the City for his reticence, he suddenly became a man of the people, a co-traveller with the Toon Army in his black and white jersey.<br><br>Along the way, he heard all the gripes and moans. Novice that he is, he believed them.<br><br>And so he came to the knee-jerk decision to sack the manager. Because, like so many chairmen before him, he thought that would make him one of them Â— by doing what the fans wanted.<br><br>Newcastle supporters, though, are living a very old dream.<br><br>Keegan made them believe they were one of the elite and yet their record over the last 50 years suggests exactly the opposite.<br><br>The 50,000 who pour into St JamesÂ’ every other week may find this unpalatable.<br><br>But the last decade is not so much under-performance as par for the course.<br><br>ItÂ’s time to wake up.</div>

"I'm going to take a break with my wife, come back and move on with my football career," the 53-year-old former Bolton boss said. </strong><br><br>"There is no bitterness towards those in charge at the club (Newcastle). "There is no point being bitter and twisted. It is disappointing, though. I don't know why they've done it now."<br><br>Allardyce's former assistant Phil Brown also believes Allardyce will bounce back. "Someone who was one of the most promising a few years ago now finds himself out of work," Brown said. "He'll want to prove everyone at Newcastle wrong by coming back and managing at the top level again."<br><br>Hull City boss Brown, who worked with Allardyce at Bolton and Blackpool, said he was confident he would have been successful at Newcastle given sufficient time. "The Newcastle job was a big challenge for the man, and given time he would have cracked it, but that's history now," he told BBC Radio 5 Live.<br><br>"This season, eight managers in the Premier League have gone already. "It's a ridiculous amount. It's becoming quite alarming and the pressure is frightening, but it's something we've got to live with. "As Sam will admit, winning games is the only thing that keeps you in a job these days."<br></div>
