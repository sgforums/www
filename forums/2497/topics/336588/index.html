              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has welcomed the heightened security arrangements put
              in place by Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium ahead of Manchester
              United's visit to North London on Saturday.<br><br>When United last
              played at the Emirates, manager Ferguson complained that the Arsenal
              fans were allowed too close to the visitors' dugout.<br><br>However,
              while the behaviour of the Arsenal fans did not impress the Scot, he
              also concedes that United's supporters often cross the line when their
              team take on the Gunners.<br><br>There is one vile 'song' in particular that United fans regularly abuse Wenger with, and Ferguson wants them to cut it out. <br><br>"I hope it stops," he said. "There has been a focus on fans' chants, not just towards Arsene Wenger but other managers too.<br><br>"It is ridiculous. The police should be doing more.<br><br>"When
              you consider the chants that have been levelled at us about Munich you
              would think United fans would understand very well the sensitivity of
              the situation.<br><br>"I don't agree with it at all. Hopefully the fans appreciate when it comes to me too.<br><br>"I
              would like to think other clubs share the same view as I have in terms
              of criticism towards the manager. There is enough to admire in our game
              without denigrating people."<br><br>Having conducted an internal
              review, Arsenal intend to station another three stewards immediately
              behind the dugout, and have an 'ejection squad' standing by to act if
              any fans misbehave.<br><br>Ferguson has welcomed this, but feels the
              design of the Emirates Stadium lends itself to potentially inflammatory
              confrontations.<br><br>"The problem is the fans are right behind you. They are almost in the dugout really," he said.<br><br>"It is quite right they have improved the security because last year was pretty unsavoury. In fact, I think it was nasty.<br><br>"I can turn myself off from it and concentrate on the game. But I knew what was going on.<br><br>"When
              the stewards tried to intervene they were attacked by some Arsenal
              fans. They had to remove our stewards from there and bring their own in.<br><br>"It should not happen when you build a modern stadium like that. It is too open for my liking.<br><br>"It is a weakness in the planning that you don't provide safety for the visiting substitutes and staff."</p>
