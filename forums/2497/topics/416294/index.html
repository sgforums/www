              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Arsène Wenger denied </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Arsenal</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> have a soft centre after consecutive defeats by Tottenham Hotspur and Braga in the past week. Arsenal came in for criticism after conceding goals scored through the centre in both those games. Asked if his side lacked toughness in defence and midfield, the manager defended his players.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Speaking of his defenders Laurent Koscielny, Sébastien Squillaci and Johan Djourou, Wenger said: "They are sharp, good on the ball, defend well. What can I say?" Pressed that the second goal scored by Braga in the 2-0 Champions League defeat on Tuesday occurred because Matheus was able to run at his rearguard, the manager said: "You are entitled to your opinion but for me Koscielny, Squillaci and Djourou are great defenders."</p>
              <p>Wenger's regulation 4-2-3-1 formation usually features Jack Wilshere, Denílson or Alex Song in the two defensive midfield positions and there is a perception that they may lack the requisite steel. But Wenger denied he may need to buy a more robust tackler to shore up this area of the team. "When you don't win your games people always find problems with the team," he said. "But is it the main problem we have? I'm not convinced.</p>
              <p>"If you look at the number of shots we've had and chances opponents have created you don't come to that conclusion. We lost the last two games. We should have beaten Tottenham five or six. We lost in Braga again to special circumstances. I agree we didn't create enough but we were unlucky."</p>
              <p>Instead Wenger claimed that sometimes his team need to curb their desire to attack. "We are in some circumstances not cautious enough," he said. "For example against Spurs there's a free-kick for us and then a goal for them. At Braga it was exactly the same. I think this team has a fantastic attitude and spirit. They want so much to deliver. But sometimes they forget the basic cautiousness." Asked if his players were naïve, he said: "You can call it naivety but it's a harsh word."</p>
              <p>Arsenal travel to Aston Villa tomorrow and Wenger spoke of how fortunate Gérard Houllier was to survive a medical emergency while in charge at Liverpool in 2001, when he required open heart surgery after suffering an acute dissection of the aorta during a game at Anfield.</p>
              <p>Wenger said of the incident, which occurred a day before Houllier was due to fly to Ukraine for a Champions League match: "If that happens one day later, then he is a dead man. He recovered well. But for a while you are not the same person. That damaged certainly his potential to finish the job that he had started so well at Liverpool."</p>
              <p>Wenger was surprised Houllier left his position as technical director at the French Football Federation to manage again in the high-pressure environs of the Premier League. "After Lyon [where Houllier was coach from 2005 to 2007] he moved out because he did not want the kind of pressure that went into this kind of job."</p>
              <p>Robert Pires, a member of Arsenal's Invicibles in the 2003-04 season, may start for Villa, having moved to the Midlands after training with his former club to maintain condition. "I am happy to help Robert as he practised for two to three months, so I'm happy that he has found a club," Wenger said.</p>

              <p class="full-line tweet tweet_button">After one victory in eight league games Villa's season is already looking wan but if they subject <span style="color: #000000;">Arsenal</span> to the kind of barrage which stunned Manchester United a fortnight ago they could win. John Carew is available after a four-match absence and Robert Pires could reacquaint himself with his former team. Arsenal are suffering the sort of injury problems which have been plaguing their opponents, with Cesc Fábregas missing again and Emmanuel Eboué likely to be out for two months. A third defeat in eight days would give Arsène Wenger another worry line.</p>
