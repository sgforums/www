              <p>The former Etihad skipper confided in pal Carlos Jimenez that he is worried the club will leave him to rot for the final two years of his contract.</p>
              <p>His bust-up with City has already cost the Argentine £9million in lost earnings and club fines.</p>
              <p>Inter Milan and Paris St Germain have scrapped moves for Tevez while AC Milan are stalling.</p>
              <p>Argentine singer Jimenez said: "Carlitos and I had dinner a few days ago. I could see he was worried.</p>
              <p>"He says City want to stop him playing for two years as a punishment. He knows he must get out of Manchester by January 31."</p>

              A talent wasted..... 
              
              Tevez has done something wrong but city should let him go instead of forcing him to stay and waste life.
              
              I believe he is in his late20s now, and 2 years could means his peak wasted sitting around and playing golf.

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ROBERTO MANCINI is open to the idea of Carlos Tevez playing for Manchester City again this season — provided he can proves his fitness.</h2>
              <p>Tevez remains a City player after interest from AC Milan, Inter Milan and Paris St Germain failed to turn into permanent move in January.</p>
              <p>Tevez remains in Argentina and has given no indication as to whether he will return any time soon.</p>
              <p>But Mancini, who previously stated it was unthinkable for Tevez to play for the club again, has named him in his 25-man squad for the remainder of the season.</p>
              <p>And, however unlikely, he could play a part in the title run-in.</p>
              <p>Mancini said: "Carlos is not an option at the moment but it is possible in the future if he comes back.</p>
              <p>"I hope for him he has been training in the last three months to help his condition.</p>
              <p>"There is only one thing on my mind, the Barclays Premier League. But if he comes back — and he is fit — it is possible."</p>
              <p>Mancini has confirmed Owen Hargreaves remains available but has struggled to gain any consistent form during his time at City.</p>
              <p>He added: "Owen always has these little problems.</p>
              <p>"When he came to us in the summer we took a gamble because he had not played for two years.</p>
              <p>"We thought we could try and get him fit in two or three months and then he would be able to play.</p>
              <p>"But, like any player who hasn't played for two years, when they start to train, every day there is a problem, with his knee or his hamstring.</p>
              <p>"I hope for him he eventually is able to play all the time. He deserves to."</p>

              City needs his ability to score goals. Now sitting at the top only with goal difference, City really cant afford any mistake and lose a point anymore.
              
              Just hope he and Mancini will sort themselves out.
