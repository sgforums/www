            <div class='col-md body'>Mourinho tells Hedman he is too good to retire<br><br>Jose Mourinho was pleased to introduce Swedish goalkeeper Magnus Hedman at Chelseas training ground on Friday.<br><br>Hedman has signed a contract until the end of the season as cover for injured Petr Cech, Hilario and Carlo Cudicini.<br><br>Mourinho said: "I am very happy with our choice - with all respect to the other keepers we had at the club for a period of trial. I am happy because we brought him back to football. I think he is too young and too good to be out of football so soon and I feel very happy because I have some responsibility for bringing him back to the game. His contract is to the end of the season but nobody can say he will not have an extension of his contract and stay at Chelsea. Nobody knows if his future is at another club and nobody knows if his decision will be to stop after that. But after what I have seen everyday, I believe this is the second period of his career and not the last six or seven months of it."</div>

It has been difficult to settle but it is a good life experience so I dont want to leave in January. For me, thats a definite. My future will be decided at the meetings which are going on between my representatives and the club. The club president has said he wants me to stay and so Im in no hurry."<br><br>Beckham also insists he wants to play for England again. He added: "I desperately want to wear that England shirt again - clearly not as a captain because John Terry is doing very well. It has been my greatest satisfaction to play so much for my country and I want it back. I never said that I wanted to leave the national side after the World Cup. What I actually said is that I would leave the captaincy."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Beckham was given permission to go to Italy<br><br>Fabio Capello has confirmed David Beckhams trip to Rome was sanctioned by Real Madrid - and that he was back in training by Saturday morning.<br><br>Beckham travelled to Italy with wife Victoria on Friday to attend a pre-nuptial dinner with Hollywood stars Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, who married in nearby Bracciano on Saturday.<br><br>It had initially been suggested the former England captain had defied Real in order to make the trip, while later reports declared the club had given him the green light to go.<br><br>Capello confirmed following Saturday nights Primera Liga match with Racing Santander that Beckham had indeed been given permission to go to Italy.<br><br>The Italian coach also said the midfielder had been at the clubs training ground yesterday morning to continue his recovery from the knee injury which ruled him out of the Racing match.<br><br>"Beckham was in Rome with the permission of the club," said Capello.<br><br>"This morning he has been at Real Madrid City. We gave him permission to travel, because the doctor said he could. He has not missed a single minute of his rehabilitation."<br><br>Beckham did not attend Saturday nights wedding ceremony between Cruise and Holmes, with his wife representing the couple in his absence.<br><br>Whether this whole episode will affect Beckhams future at Real Madrid remains to be seen.<br><br>He has yet to sign a new contract with Real - and with his current four-year deal running out next summer, he will be free to talk to other clubs in January.<br><br>Real are keen to tie the midfielder to a new deal. But it is believed Beckham is waiting to see if he can reclaim his first-team berth before deciding whether to commit himself to the Spanish giants.<br><br>The 31-year-old has made just two full appearances so far this season, and has already admitted his frustration at his lack of first-team opportunities.<br><br>Should he decide to bring his Spanish adventure to an end, there would appear to be no shortage of offers for the former Manchester United man - with teams from England, Scotland and America all being linked to him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Baros thinking of leaving Villa</strong><br><br>Milan Baros could be on his way out of Aston Villa after losing his place in the first team to veteran striker Chris Sutton.<br><br>The Czech international was an unused substitute against Everton last weekend, and manager Martin ONeill has admitted that Baros could move on in the January transfer window.<br><br>Baros said to the News of the World: "I thought I would do better this season, but I havent played much and my performances have not been as good as they can be. If the situation remains like this I will have to think about things more."<br><br>Baros has scored just eight goals for Villa since joining from Liverpool in the summer of 2005.<br><br><strong>Robben warning for Chelsea: play me or lose me</strong><br><br>Arjen Robben has threatened to quit Chelsea if the Blues proceed with their plans to sign French ace Florent Malouda for a fee of around Â£15 million (Â€22 million).<br><br>Despite being one of Chelseas most potent attacking threats, the Dutch winger has often fallen victim to Jose Mourinhos squad rotation.<br><br>He warned Mourinho that he may be forced to consider offers from other clubs if he does not get to play more regularly.<br><br>Robben also appeared to take a swipe at squad members who stay despite playing infrequently, such as Carlo Cudicini and Geremi.<br><br>He told the News of the World: "If I am not in the team, I will have to consider my options. There are lots of players here who get a lot of money for doing nothing, but I dont want to be one of them. I am too young for that."<br><br>It is believed that Mourinho would want Malouda as a replacement for Robben, if the winger was to move on. The player is considered one of Frances best young prospects, and already has 26 international caps to his name.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Reports claim Hammers will offload Argentinians in January despite Pardew's praise for Tevez<br><br>West Ham are reportedly set to sell Argentinian flops Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano when the transfer window reopens in January.<br><br>The pair have both failed to settle at Upton Park having joined the club in the summer and are struggling to get regular games in Alan Pardews side.<br><br>According to reports on Sunday, there is a clause in Tevez and Mascheranos contracts which allows the Hammers to terminate the deals during the transfer window.<br><br>West Ham achieved impressive back-to-back victories over Blackburn and Arsenal recently without either player on the pitch while Tevez featured in Saturdays 1-0 defeat at Chelsea.<br><br>Iranian business Kia Joorabchian helped bring the Argentines to Upton Park in a bid to secure a takeover of the club. But that plan seems to have backfired and now Brazilian club Fluminense are willing to bring the players back to South America.<br><br>However, Hammers boss Pardew was delighted with the contribution of Tevez in the defeat at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>"Weve been patient with him and hes been patient with us," said Pardew of Tevez.<br><br>"I think he showed why he is renowned in terms of his reputation. And hopefully we are going to see that against Sheffield United next week, and the week after that and the week after that. I was buoyed by his performance. You can talk about his quality, which was great, but his workrate was fantastic for a world-class player, and I thought that hes taken on board what we do at West Ham, and thats important."<br><br>Pardew added: "Hes comfortable playing in four positions - up on the left, the right, through the middle or dropping off. His versatility is one of his gifts. Its his understanding of the Premiership - hes suddenly realised what it has to take. Chelsea players are an example of that. They are world-class players but you have to work very hard to stay in the team, and Tevez showed that."</div>
