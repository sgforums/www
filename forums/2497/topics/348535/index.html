              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Aston Villa striker Gabriel Agbonlahor has pleaded with
              team-mate and vice-captain Gareth Barry to stay at Villa Park beyond
              this season.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Barry was subject of last summer's longest transfer saga, with the
              player desperate to play Champions League football and Liverpool keen
              to take the England midfielder to Anfield, but unwilling to match the
              Villans's valuation.<br> <br> The current Villa captain, currently deputising for injured skipper
              Martin Laursen having lost the captaincy himself after revealing his
              desire to leave, has 18-months remaining on his current deal.<br>  <br> While O'Neill has recently stated he would not stand in the player's way should he wish to leave again in the summer.<br> <br> However, team-mate Agbonlahor, who has earned two international caps
              with England as a result of Villa's scintillating form this season,
              hopes Barry stays at the club having played a key role in the club's
              rise to third in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>"I think Gareth ought to sign a new contract," he said. "It would
              show our expectations for the rest of the season and next season.</p>
              <p>"I don't really like commenting on him but it would mean a lot,
              especially for the young lads because he's been here so long. I'd like
              him to stay at the club but obviously it's his choice what he does. If
              he stays and Stiliyan Petrov signs his new contract, it will be good
              for the club.</p>
              <p>"Gareth is really good with the whole team and that's why it's been
              good that he's been captain because he sets a good example. I used to
              watch him a lot when I was coming through the ranks here. He's been at
              Villa a long time and he hasn't missed many games either.</p>
              <p>"He does seem like an old man to me. But he doesn't look it, he looks young, and he doesn't play like it."</p>
