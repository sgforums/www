              <div><span><strong>New Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas has warned the race for the Barclays Premier League title is not over as he prepares to take his young Gunners to leaders Chelsea on Sunday.</strong> </span></div>
              <div><span> </span></div>
              <div id="articlebody">
              <p>The 21-year-old Spaniard's reign got off to a winning start with a 1-0 win over Dynamo Kiev at the Emirates Stadium, courtesy of a late goal from substitute Nicklas Bendtner which put Arsenal through to the last 16 of the Champions League.</p>
              <p>While Arsene Wenger's men remain on course in Europe, their domestic challenge has stuttered in recent weeks after the win over Manchester United, the squad enduring a difficult spell on and off the pitch which resulted in former captain William Gallas being stripped of the armband following public criticism of his team-mates.</p>
              <p>Arsenal head to Stamford Bridge 10 points off the pace after five defeats already this season. And another this weekend would leave their title hopes all but over before Christmas and facing a real fight to get back into the top four.</p>
              <p>However, Fabregas feels there is plenty of football left in Arsenal between now and May. He said: "The aim is to lift a trophy. We are in the last 16 of the Champions League and are in contention in every competition.</p>
              <p>"We have played only 14 league games this season and it is not over yet. Nothing is done and we will fight until the end. "Our target is to go there and win, because we could get some points back. "The other teams at the top have some difficult games as well, so we will see."</p>
              <p>Fabregas accepts it can sometimes be difficult for Arsenal to play their way through to goal, but is not expecting a cat-and-mouse affair at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>He added: "We have to play as a team and when we play good and quick passing, we can play against anybody and win. "Arsenal never go for a draw, we always go for a win and I am sure a club like Chelsea will do the same as well because every time I have played against them they have always gone forwards, to go for the victory."</p>
              <p>Wenger feels former Chelsea defender Gallas had been the victim of a "witch hunt" from the English media. And full-back Gael Clichy believes while his team-mate may well have had justifiable cause for concern, he insisted everyone at Arsenal is now looking forwards.</p>
              <p>He told L'Equipe: "William is perhaps right in what he said, but that sort of stuff is between him and the coach. "They have explained themselves to each other, but it is a shame all the same. If that broke something in the squad, it is sorted now.</p>
              <p>"Now we can no longer look back. It is up to the players and the staff to put all the pieces back together and go as before. We must put the resentment to one side and forget about it."</p>
              <p>Arsenal have nine first-team players in the treatment room, but could have midfielder Samir Nasri (knee), Togo striker Emmanuel Adebayor and defender Bacary Sagna (both ankle) available this weekend</p>

              <p><br>Err... You mean Arsenal is it... Chelsea lose still way ahead of them and United... So won't be so bad lah. If Arsenal lose, I think really bye bye to the title liao... But Ballack, Deco and Lampard all back and this match at SB... Somemore Anelka like to score against his old clubs... Quite hard for Arsenal i feel... They need almost a miracle to win this...</p>

              <p><br>Arrggghhh.... for a long time I have this feeling that Arsenal is gradually becoming a feeler club for the other major clubs in Europe.</p>
              <p>We train the talented youngsters before other bigger and more prestigious clubs snap them away.</p>

              <p>I think it has to do with Wenger's transfer policy... If you compare Pool with Gunners, actually they are not very much different...</p>
              <p>Talk about debts, Pool has a bigger debt than the Gunners. Talk about stadium, Arsenal are in a far better position than Pool, years ahead i think... They have a bigger stadium 60,000 to 45,000, location in London, able to price tickets at a higher price therefore has a far better gate collections than Pool.  </p>
              <p>Arsenal also has a much better yearly turnover than Pool and yet Pool don't need to sell their star players or can defend against interest clubs... Apart from this, Pool still can afford or willing to spend more than Gunners even after the 2 Americans arrived.</p>
              <p>I am also not sure whats wrong, The only thing I can think of is the Arsenal board of directors are cashing in on whatever they can and wish to spend as little as possible as they plan to sell the club in a few years time when their collective agreement expire... and of course... Wenger's obsession with trying to win it with kids.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">WILLIAM GALLAS faces another backlash after accusing Chelsea of telling lies to make him a hate figure.</h2>
              <p class="article">The stroppy Frenchman has already been stripped of the Arsenal captaincy for criticising his team-mates last week.</p>
              <p class="article">Now the ex-Blues star will return to Stamford Bridge on Sunday, sure to face an ugly reception from Chelsea fans for his controversial exit to join the Gunners.</p>
              <p class="article">Gallas reckons his problems began when Chelsea claimed he threatened to score an own-goal if he did not get a move.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “They ignored the truth. For them, I was a player who would score an own-goal. Who cared if I’d given them five years of my life, my passion, a Premier League title to share.</p>
              <p class="article">“They remembered only the mega-false version of their club. I was gutted.”</p>
              <p class="article">In his new autobiography, Gallas insists he fell out of love with Chelsea when they snubbed his contract demands and claims they then twisted his words to make him look a traitor.</p>
              <p class="article">He says ex-boss Jose Mourinho asked why he did not want to play for Chelsea again.</p>
              <p class="article">Gallas replied: “You are going to put me on the pitch OK. But if the heart is not there and I’m not concentrating, I risk making errors I’m not used to making. We could let in a goal and so lose a match stupidly.”</p>

              <h1 class="heading">Chelsea will end Arsenal's Premier League title hopes, says Petr Cech</h1>
              <p class="heading"> </p>
              <p class="heading"><img src="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00313/cech2_385x185_313877a.jpg" alt="" width="385" height="185"></p>
              <p class="heading"><em>Chelsea will end Arsenal's title hopes, says Petr Cech</em></p>
              <p class="heading"> </p>
              <p><strong>Petr Cech has set the tone for a potentially combustible confrontation by accusing Arsenal of lacking fighting spirit and vowing to end their Barclays Premier League title hopes.</strong></p>
              <p>Chelsea can open a 13-point gap over their London rivals by beating them at Stamford Bridge tomorrow, which would also extend their lead at the top because Liverpool, who trail on goal difference, do not play until Monday, when West Ham United visit Anfield. Cech, the Czech Republic goalkeeper, believes that Arsenal will be out of contention by then, leaving a three-horse race between his team, Liverpool and Manchester United.</p>
              <p>“If Arsenal lose this game they are out of the title race completely,” Cech said. “Maybe it is even a must-win game because if they don't win it is still ten points, still a big gap. At times they play beautiful football but sometimes you have to know how to win the game in a different way and that is the difference between us and them. You need to be physical and fight and this is what they are missing.”</p>
              <p>Arsène Wenger hit back immediately by claiming that Chelsea are vulnerable, a view supported by their record of four wins from their past nine matches in all competitions. “None of the teams I have seen look to be really dominating this league,” Wenger, the Arsenal manager, said. “There is no team that is not vulnerable, none in the world. I know we can beat them.”</p>
