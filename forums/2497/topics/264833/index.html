            <div class='col-md body'>Mijatovic Discusses Kaka, Robben, Saviola, Milito, And Others<br><br>Real Madrid sporting director Pedja Mijatovic spoke to Madrid based dailies Marca and AS about his plans for the summer.<br><br>"Then the players will arrive. We have already closed some deals and others are in the works, but I am realising that we are building a team that will win."<br><br>The former Madrid striker also hited that it would be a team with young players.<br><br>"We want young people. If it comes to 30-year old veterans and a 24-years old, I'd stick with the latter. However, I'm not planning on seeing ten players come and eight leave every year."<br><br>He then went on to speak about particular targets, admitting that the likes of Robben, Alves, Saviola and Milito were on his agenda.<br><br>Kaka<br><br>"It's not impossible because nothing is impossible, but we can't plan the future of Real Madrid around Kaka because getting him out of [Italy] is difficult."<br><br>Robben<br><br>"He is out of this world. He's a footballer that we've had our eye on since last year. He's a very interesting, top-notch player."<br><br>Alves<br><br>"He is a complete player. I like him a lot, but we have to determine whether he's a priority or not."<br><br>Saviola<br><br>"He has a contract until 30 June. He's a fantastic player and we're not ruling him out by any means."<br><br>Toldo<br><br>"He is a great goalkeeer and a veteran, and he's someone were thinking about."<br><br>Drenthe<br><br>"He's one of the players of the future. I am sure many teams are after him. We have been since last season."<br><br>Chivu<br><br>"He's a footballer we really like and have an interest in, but we're not in the fight. We know other teams have a better chance than we do, and that's why we're exploring other options."<br><br>Metzelder<br><br>"Metzelder has been signed. He's a great player with lots of experience and he will be an important reinforcement for the defence."<br><br>Gabi Milito<br><br>"He's a very talented player with lots of character, and he's another alternative."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Madrid Make Best Chivu Offer, But Still Third<br><br>Real Madrid have topped Barcelona and Inter Milan's bids for Christian Chivu, but remain outsiders in the race.<br><br>Roma's first priority is a straight cash deal worth 18m, and Real Madrid - at the supposed insistence of Bernd Schuster, insist AS - have weighed in with a 16 million euro offer.<br><br>However, Roma - who have very good relations with Barcelona - have refused to speak with Madrid, at least until Barca withdraw from the negoatiations.<br><br>"While Barcelona do not pull out from the negotiations, we cannot consider Real Madrid," said Roma sporting director Daniele Prade.<br><br>"It is a question of moral correctness for us."<br><br>The Giallorossi bosses want to do business with Barcelona, but at the moment, Inter's offer is the tempting one, and a sale to their domestic rivals is looking likely.<br><br>Barcelona are lining up Andrade, Heinze and Milito in case they fail to land the Romanian, while Real Madrid are also looking at same list of defenders, along with PSV's Alex.<br><br>A final decision on Chivu will be made on Monday.
