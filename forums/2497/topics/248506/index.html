Sun can reveal that representatives from Roman AbramovichÂ’s investment company Millhouse Capital have travelled to Los Angeles in a bid to meet with the former Spurs and Germany star.</strong><br><br>It is thought that Chelsea director and Millhouse MD Eugene Tenenbaum was one of those in the party. Klinsmann, 42, took Germany to the semi-finals of the 2006 World Cup where they lost to eventual winners Italy. He turned down offers to become the United States coach after returning to live in Los Angeles. But he fits the Abramovich bill of a young, dynamic personality who would give Chelsea the type of worldwide corporate image which the billionaire owner craves.<br><br>However, Chelsea will have a big job on if they do want Klinsmann to become their new boss. He is known to be settled in LA and is not keen to uproot his family. Current Blues boss Jose Mourinho admitted yesterday he cannot guarantee he will be at Chelsea next season Â— because the club will not tell him.<br><br>He wants to see out his contract until 2010. But when asked why he did not promise he would be staying, Mourinho replied: Â“Nobody has told me.Â” Chief executive Peter Kenyon, chairman Bruce Buck and Tenenbaum have been unable to assure Mourinho about his future.<br><br>That is because Abramovich has refused to say anything due to the ongoing rift with his manager which has meant the pair have not spoken for three months. Kenyon is trying to broker peace talks and Abramovich has indicated he will eventually discuss the future with his boss Â— but for now the cold war remains.<br><br>Mourinho said: Â“I have told them I want to stay. I have spoken to Peter Kenyon and met with him a lot.Â” Mourinho says he has instructed his agent not to talk to Real Madrid after SunSport revealed how the Spanish giants had been back in touch. The Chelsea boss risks losing a Â£15million pay-off if it can be proved he has had contact with other clubs.<br><br>Mourinho added: Â“My contract is here. IÂ’ve forbidden my agent to speak to other clubs Â— I canÂ’t do more than that. IÂ’ve told the board, the players and fans I want to stay 200 times.Â”<br><br></div>

Klinsmann has rejected the chance to replace Jose Mourinho because he does not want to uproot from his home in America. But Roman Abramovich is to offer him the biggest deal in world football in a bid to change the GermanÂ’s mind. </strong><br><br>German legend Franz Beckenbauer has told Klinsmann he should grab the chance to take the Chelsea job. The Kaiser, who was instrumental in making Klin the German boss for last yearÂ’s World Cup, thinks he would be good news for the Blues. Beckenbauer said: Â“I donÂ’t know how far these discussions with Chelsea will actually go but I could certainly imagine him taking over. Â“When Jurgen does a job he is engaging and energetic. He still enjoys great respect in England from his time at Tottenham. "Which other German could become EnglandÂ’s player of the year, as he did in 1995?<br><br>Â“Jurgen and Chelsea fits but it wonÂ’t work if he tries to commute. Â“He would have to move completely from California to England Â— to a league with 20 clubs where they play at Christmas and New Year with national cup competitions and the Champions League. Â“London eats you up with skin and hair. No one has time there Â— unlike when he was in charge of Germany, when he could relax back in America.<br><br>"Roman Abramovich is a strong owner who one should not under-estimate because it has apparently come to a head with Mourinho. Â“Nevertheless, if the chance arises for Jurgen he should grab it. At 42, he is a young man who can work at a top club.Â”<br><br>Sun revealed last week how a delegation from Red RomÂ’s bankers Millhouse Capital jetted to Los Angeles to meet with Klinsmann, a couple of days after ChelseaÂ’s Champions League quarter-final success in Valencia. And yesterday we told how Klinsmann, who had been offered Â£6.4m a year, said Â‘noÂ’, hours before Abramovich hugged Mourinho after the BluesÂ’ 2-1 FA Cup semi-final victory over Blackburn on Sunday.<br><br>But Abramovich still believes Klinsmann is the ideal figure to make Chelsea loved around the world. Red Rom does not think Mourinho can deliver that global affection for the club which he craves. Meanwhile, mystery also surrounds the whereabouts of Peter Kenyon. The BluesÂ’ chief executive was out of the country in the second half of last week Â“on businessÂ”.<br></div>
