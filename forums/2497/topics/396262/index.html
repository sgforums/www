              <h3>MANCHESTER CITY are preparing to break the British transfer record with a 
                                  sensational bid for Cesc Fabregas.<span style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 20px; font-size: 16px;"> </span></h3>
              <p>City's move for the Arsenal midfielder was authorised by owner Sheikh Mansour 
                                  during a meeting with key personnel this week. </p>
              <p>Although their swoop for Fabregas is dependent on a top-four finish, they 
                                  plan to start the bidding at £50m in an attempt to see off Barcelona. </p>
              <p>City now have a "1-2-3 wishlist" of world class targets that is topped by 
                                  Fabregas, followed by Ferdnando Torres and Barca striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </p>
              <p>Although Fabregas has made it clear he wants to return to Barca if he quits 
                                  Arsenal, City have been undeterred after taking initial soundings. </p>
              <p>The Arsenal skipper has made it clear his next move is not about money and 
                                  that he wants to win league titles and compete for the Champions League. </p>
              <p>City intend to make "three or four impact signings" in the summer as they aim 
                                  for a crack at the title next season. </p>
              <p>They are convinced that if they can finish fourth they will be able to 
                                  attract the calibre of player that can win the Premier League title. </p>
              <p>Fabregas is the personal choice of Mansour, who wants to add creativity to 
                                  City's midfield, but other signings are on the way. </p>
              <p>City are close to agreeing a deal with Hamburg for right back Jerome Boateng 
                                  and he will sign in the summer. </p>
              <p>They are also chasing Inter striker Mario Balotelli as they prepare to 
                                  strengthen their squad for a crack at the title. </p>
              <p>City's move for Fabregas is the most audacious of the lot, but the top brass 
                                  are well aware just how difficult it will be to prise him away from Arsenal. </p>
              <p>Although City did business with the Gunners last season for Emmanuel Adebayor 
                                  and Kolo Toure, their move for Fabregas is on a different level. </p>
              <p>Barcelona have made it clear they intend to pursue Fabregas this summer and 
                                  he was spotted mixing with dignitaries at the Nou Camp on Tuesday night in VIP 
                                  lounges. </p>
              <p>City are convinced that they will compete for the Premier League title next 
                                  season, but their recruitment policy and the move for Fabregas depends on 
                                  finishing fourth this term. </p>
              <p>Chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak reiterated the target during a meeting with City 
                                  chief Roberto Mancini this week. </p>
              <p>They have discussed a number of other transfer targets, but face big 
                                  competition from Real Madrid for Benfica duo Angel di Maria and Brazilian 
                                  defender David Luiz. </p>
              <p>City's long-term strategy is to follow Barcelona's model and sign young 
                                  players capable of forcing their way into the first team. </p>
              <p>Luiz, who has made his name at centre half this season, is among the options 
                                  being considered as City gear up for their summer spending. </p>
