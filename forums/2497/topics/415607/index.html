              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">
              </span></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Fabio Capello is on course for a row with </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> after reneging on an agreement to play Steven Gerrard for only 60 minutes of last night's </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">England</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> friendly against </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">France</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Gerrard pulled his hamstring and hobbled off in the 84th minute of a 2-1 defeat, a scoreline that flattered </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">England</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">. He later limped away from the stadium and said: 'It's not good.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">It sparked an instant angry response from Roy Hodgson's coaching department. On his Twitter page, </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">'s head of fitness and conditioning, Darren Burgess, wrote: 'Unbelievable from all associated with </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">England</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> and English FA with regards to SG's injury. Completely ignored agreement and past history. Completely amateurish and now we pay for their incompetence. Absolutely disgraceful.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Capello said Gerrard stayed on because slight injuries had forced Rio Ferdinand and Gareth Barry to come off at half-time, and the manager needed the vice-captain to stay on the pitch.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'We spoke with Steve and said he would play one hour but, after Barry's injury we had problems,' said Capello. 'That was the reason he stayed on the pitch. If it's possible, the players will play the time we agreed with the club. But Barry was injured so we needed someone senior on the pitch.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'We are upset about what happened to Steve, of course. He has a problem and we will have to wait for the scan.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'They asked that he play one hour if it's possible but they can't decide how long a player plays with the national team. If it's possible, he would have played an hour. I understand why they're upset, and I'm also upset.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">By </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">midnight</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">, Burgess had deleted his tweets, although it was unclear if that was done after an edict from </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Earlier Capello's assistant Franco Baldini had felt obliged to phone </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Newcastle</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> manager Chris Hughton and explain why Andy Carroll was starting against the wishes of his club, who were worried he might aggravate a groin injury.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Capello said: 'We checked him before the game. He told me he was fit.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'No player has ever played with me who was not fit. Our doctor said he was fit, so the player was ready to play.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'I was really happy with Andy. He played very well. He understood that he'll be a player who'll be important for the future of </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">England</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">. When he received the ball he played quickly, and his movement was dangerous.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Carroll went off after 72 minutes with </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">England</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> already two down. Peter Crouch grabbed a late consolation, his 22nd goal in 42 </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">England</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> games.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">It was Capello's first Wembley defeat after last month's goalless draw against </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Montenegro</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">. </span></p>

              <p>Dismay at an apparent broken promise regarding his England involvement against France turned to anger as the consequences of the hamstring injury he suffered late in the game became apparent. Liverpool are now expected to claim £500,000 compensation from the FA to cover his wages.</p>

              <p><strong>Gerrard stayed on beyond the agreed hour mark of Wednesday's 2-1 defeat at Wembley and paid for trying to drive his team on, hobbling off with what was confirmed last night as a grade two hamstring tear. </strong></p>
              <p>Given his history of muscle injuries if asked to play three games in a week, Liverpool are up in arms. Their mood was captured in a post-match tweet by head of fitness and conditioning, Darren Burgess, who described Gerrard's prolonged involvement as 'unbelievable' and 'absolutely disgraceful', before later deleting the message.</p>
              <p>Burgess phoned the FA on Thursday to express regret at the tone of his post but, pointedly, there was no apology from the former Australia fitness coach, or the club, over the sentiment.</p>
              <p>Gerrard will miss tomorrow’s must-win home game with bottom side West Ham, difficult trips to Tottenham and Newcastle and a testing Anfield date with former Liverpool boss Gerard Houllier’s Aston Villa.</p>
              <p>Manager Roy Hodgson is seething at the loss of his midfielder for a critical sequence of games, particularly after repeatedly resting him in the Europa League.</p>
              <p>Capello added to the tension by revealing that he would contact Hodgson to explain his actions but not to say sorry.</p>
