              <p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Harry Redknapp has given a damning appraisal of referee Steve Tanner's performance in <a class="instorylink" href="http://www.skysports.com/football/match_report/0,19764,11065_3004291,00.html">Tottenham Hotspur's 2-0 defeat at West Brom</a>. </strong></p>
              <p>The visitors to The Hawthorns were reduced to 10 men
              on 35 minutes when Benoit Assou-Ekotto was adjudged to have stamped on
              Gianni Zuiverloon earning himself a red card.</p>
              <p>Worse was to follow
              as Roman Bednar's headed opening goal on 83 minutes was allowed to
              stand despite a clear push on Michael Dawson as the cross came in.</p>
              <p>Substitute
              Craig Beattie went on to wrap up the points in injury-time and Redknapp
              was left fuming with the official after the final whistle.</p>
              <h4>Anger</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I couldn't even put into words what I thought of his performance," the Spurs boss said.</p>
              <p>"When I walked into the referees' room before the game and saw who was reffing the game I knew what was coming.</p>
              <p>"I
              expected that and it didn't surprise me at all. I've had him many times
              before and I know what he is like - he really isn't good enough.</p>
              <p>"He is just a poor referee unfortunately and I've seen him make a mess of so many games before.</p>
              <p>"I saw him when I was in the Championship and I thought to myself then 'Where has he come from?'.</p>
              <p>"I
              never walk in after game and complain about a referee but this guy
              today is scary. What can you do? Someone thinks he is good enough but
              he is definitely not."</p>
              <p>Curiously, Redknapp did concede he thought Tanner was right to send off Assou-Ekotto though.</p>
              <p>"I
              thought it was a sending-off," he added. "I thought he turned his back,
              he put his foot in and I could see why he sent him off."</p>
              <p>The defeat leaves Tottenham worrying close to the drop zone, just two points above the 19th-placed Baggies in the standings.</p>
