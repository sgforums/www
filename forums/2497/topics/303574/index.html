Portsmouth is not Arsenal or Chelsea. But I know what the big clubs are," he said.<br><br>"I know the trainer of Portsmouth and I know that he will play me. Everything has been very clear."<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fed up</span></strong><br><br>He added in L'Equipe: "I need to play. I am fed up of pleasing people. I am 22-years-old and the most important thing to me is football, my job, my passion.<br><br>"Portsmouth is a respectable club, which has achieved a very good start to the season.<br><br>"I have absolutely nothing against Arsene Wenger. Arsenal is achieving a great start to the season, so Arsene is right. I just hoped to make a name for myself.<br><br>"Some people say I made a mistake by joining Portsmouth considering Les Bleus. I don't think so. I thought a lot. I will play more often."<br><br>Diarra went on to admit that Lyon made an approach, however the French side failed to match his wage expectations.<br><br>"About the interest from Lyon; I will be very clear. At first England was my priority. Then in France, they could not pay my wages," he concluded.<br><br>Meanwhile, reports in France suggest that unsettled Lens defender Lucien Aubey could be heading to Portsmouth or Birmingham City.<br><br>Djimi Traore is also being linked with a January move, with rumours suggesting that he could be set for a loan switch to Rennes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/site_imagery/richard_williams_140byline_Wcup.jpg"><br><span class="small">Richard Williams</span><br><br><strong><span class="large">Thank heavens for little boys who just want to play football</span><br><br>Lassana Diarra chose to proclaim his intention to leave Arsenal on the morning of last month's home match against Chelsea, a vital fixture for which it would be fair to assume that every scrap of the club's collective concentration was required. He did so in the most noticeable manner available to a French sportsman, via an interview in L'Equipe, and having read or been apprised of its contents some of us sat around the press room at the Emirates Stadium that afternoon concluding that the 22-year-old had made a bit of a prat of himself.</strong><br><br>After joining Arsenal in September, already he had grown frustrated. The lack of opportunities coming his way repeated his experience under Jose Mourinho at Chelsea, where he had found himself behind Michael Essien and Mikel John Obi in the queue to understudy Claude Makelele. "When I signed with Arsenal," he said, "promises were made. But since the start of the season I've only played in League Cup games, or in Champions League matches of no significance. I'm not a player who's just come out of the academy and I'm not happy to wait around for someone else to get injured or suspended before I get my chance. It's a tiresome and dispiriting situation."<br><br>Ah, le pauvre petit garÃ§on! Why on earth, we asked each other, had he not followed the example of Mathieu Flamini, his compatriot and club-mate, who came to London from Marseille in 2004, at the age of 20, and endured three seasons of apparent neglect before making his mark?<br><br>On several occasions Flamini had made noises about wanting to leave the club, most notably after ArsÃ¨ne Wenger redeployed him as an emergency left-back. His reward has come this season in the form of a regular starting place in his favourite role as the team's holding midfield player, at the expense not just of Diarra but of the much more experienced Gilberto Silva - the current captain of Brazil, no less. Couldn't Diarra see the lesson in that?<br><br>He couldn't. He persisted in demanding a move and last week joined Portsmouth for an undisclosed fee believed to be at least twice the Â£2m Arsenal paid Chelsea for his signature six months earlier. Portsmouth, he said, knew the score: a clause in his new contract said that, if he did well and another big club came in for him, he could go. On Saturday he made his debut for Harry Redknapp and by all accounts acquitted himself well in a 3-1 victory over Derby.<br><br>It was while the move was being negotiated that I began to see Diarra's point. As a child he was told by Nantes that he would never be tall enough to make a professional footballer (he is 5ft 8in). At Le Mans, his next club as a junior, he was simply neglected. Not until he got to Le Havre was he taken seriously and once he had been given his chance he did well enough to earn a couple of dozen Under-21 caps for France. Even at Chelsea, where he had only nine league starts in two seasons, he impressed Raymond Domenech enough to be given his first senior cap last March, and he has now participated in nine of France's last 10 matches, most of them as the replacement for perhaps the most effective specialist holding midfield player the game has ever seen.<br><br>"He panicked a little bit," Wenger said when the move had gone through, and for once the Arsenal manager got it wrong. Maybe Chelsea and Arsenal do have better holding midfield players. But Lassana Diarra, 22 years old, doesn't want to pick up a couple of million quid a year, or whatever it might be, for sitting on the bench and being tossed the consolation prize of a League Cup medal. He wants more than the money and the flash cars and clothes and girlfriends. He wants to play football and he wants to represent his country at the Euro 2008 finals. And now some of us, having come round to his point of view, will be cheering him on.<br><br></div>
