              <p><strong>There are growing concerns at Anfield that </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool </strong></span></a><strong>co-owner George Gillett is trying to slow down a takeover that falls short of his £600million valuation, by drafting in rival bidders.</strong></p>
              <p>Gillett is worried that the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), which is owed £300m by the club, are holding talks with potential buyers who would give him a smaller return on his investment.</p>
              <p>Middle East businessman Yahya Kirdi re-emerged as a potential investor yesterday for the second time in four months and is said to be the American's preferred option.</p>
              <p>The former Syria football international, who claims to represent a consortium of wealthy Arab businessmen, is reported to have been introduced to senior figures from Anfield and RBS.</p>
              <p>But Kirdi, who is a close friend of Gillett's son Foster, was dismissed as a serious option when he was linked with Liverpool in April and talks broke down.</p>
              <p>Former Celtic player Andy Lynch, the man tasked with brokering those talks, claimed afterwards that Gillett had reneged on a deal. Club sources insist that no bid is expected from Kirdi or his backers on this occasion.</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool chiefs and RBS, who are obliged to listen to any proposals put forward by Gillett and co-owner Tom Hicks, fear Gillett is simply using the Syrian's interest to buy himself time to find an investor who will meet the valuation set by the American co-owners.</strong></p>
              <p>RBS gave the pair a six-month extension on the £100m repayment that was due last month in the hope of avoiding a fire sale of the club that have won five European Cups but are out of this season's Champions League.</p>

              <p><strong>The battle for ownership of </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Liverpool" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong> has returned to the spotlight with reports that the Chinese tycoon Kenny Huang is in negotiations with Royal Bank of Scotland to take control of the club.</strong></p>
              <p>Huang, who is partnered by one of the biggest sovereign wealth funds in the Far East, is determined to seize control before the transfer window closes at the end of the month, according to the Times.</p>
              <p>The current owners, the Americans Tom Hicks and George Gillett, took over little more than three years ago but put the club up for sale in April and appointed Martin Broughton, the British Airways chairman, to oversee any deal.</p>
              <p>Huang was first linked with a buyout at Liverpool two years ago. Sources close to the businessman have reportedly said that he is keen to complete a deal so that the manager, Roy Hodgson, can be given extra funds to sign much-needed players this month.</p>
              <p>On the field, Joe Cole's debut ended in defeat yesterday when Liverpool lost 1-0 at Borussia Mönchengladbach. Hodgson fielded a strong side, including Steven Gerrard, Jamie Carragher and Glen Johnson, while Fabio Aurelio was named on the bench after re-signing for the club today.</p>
              <p>Mönchengladbach, who had arranged the match at Borussia-Park as part of their 110th anniversary celebrations, made the breakthrough in the eighth minute. The Algerian Karim Matmour took advantage of some poor play by Daniel Ayala inside the area and produced a powerful finish. Liverpool had to wait until the 56th minute for their first real chance, when Cole's low drive was parried. The former Chelsea player was withdrawn nine minutes later. Although Liverpool's David Amoo headed narrowly wide, Mönchengladbach deserved their win.</p>

              <p><strong>Few in Britain have heard of Kenneth Huang, the Chinese businessman now in talks to take control of </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Liverpool" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong>. But then, few in China or the United States knew of the sports entrepreneur before he launched an ambitious $70m bid to buy a stake in a National Basketball Association team 15 months ago.</strong></p>
              <p>Born Huang Jianhua in southern Guangdong province in 1964, he is said to have been an outstanding badminton player in his youth. But it is by combining his love of sport and contacts in China with American <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Business" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/business"><span style="color: #005689;">business</span></a> experience – he was the first Chinese graduate to work at the New York Stock Exchange – that he has made headlines.</p>
              <p>He graduated from his hometown's Zhongshan University before moving overseas to study at Columbia University and then complete a masters degree at St John's in New York. He reportedly speaks Japanese as well as Mandarin, Cantonese and English.</p>
              <p>Unlike previous high-profile foreign bidders for British teams, he is not a tycoon but a deal-maker who has built his career on bringing people and organisations together – specifically, American and Chinese businesses.</p>
              <p>His first notable forays into the sports world came when he cut deals to market the Houston Rockets – given the vast appetite for basketball among young people in China where there are said to be up to 300m fans it was an obvious match – and baseball's New York Yankees to Chinese businesses.</p>
              <p>But he grabbed attention when he led a Chinese investment group's move to buy a 15% stake in the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers in spring last year. Months later, he underlined his domestic ambitions with a preliminary deal to take over the Jilin Northeast Tigers, part of the Chinese Basketball Association.</p>
              <p>His Hong Kong-based QSL company also announced a 15-year deal to help develop a youth baseball team in China, investing several million dollars to raise the profile of a sport largely unknown in the country.</p>
              <p>"It seems like he is trying to piece together a one-man-created sports empire: baseball, basketball, football; the US, England and China," said Maggie Rauch, editor of the <a href="http://www.chinasportstoday.com/"><span style="color: #005689;">China Sports Today</span></a> blog. "The industry perception is that they are keeping an eye on this guy and seeing what he is up to. So far he has maybe done more talking than doing as far as building anything here in sports goes."</p>
              <p>Huang is also managing director of Rocket Capital – the investment platform he launched with Leslie Alexander, owner of the Houston Rockets – which focuses on emerging markets and particularly China. So far they have invested in companies ranging from the China Railway Group to carmakers Brilliance Auto, the Xinjiang Xinxin Mining Industry Company and the Longrun Tea Group.</p>
              <p>Unsurprisingly, he appears as well-connected in the world of Chinese business and government as he is in sporting circles.</p>
              <p>A biographical note on the website of Aspen Infrastructure – where he is a director – describes him as "one of the most accomplished business executives partnering with some of the largest state-owned enterprises in China".</p>
              <p>Despite his ambition he has kept a low profile, giving few interviews or press conferences. An employee at QSL Limited said today that no one was available to speak to reporters.</p>

              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1299772" rel="1299772|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1299772/Kenny-Huang-Ill-buy-Anfield-galaxy-superstars-AND-Fernando-Torres.html"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Roy Hodgson will be given the freedom to pursue any transfer target he wishes if the latest move to oust </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong>’s American owners proves successful.</strong></p>
              <p>On the day Fernando Torres returned to Anfield, billionaire Chinese businessman Kenny Huang has contacted the club’s bankers with an opening bid to seize control and has outlined ambitious plans to revolutionise their fortunes after a worrying fall from grace last season.</p>
              <p>Huang is underwritten by a state-backed investment fund and has offered to pay off Liverpool’s £237million debt to RBS in a move designed to put pressure on Tom Hicks and George Gillett and clear the way for a takeover.</p>
              <p>He is determined to push a deal through before the transfer window shuts at the end of the month and has made it clear Hodgson would be granted not only time to prove himself but also funds to attract the world’s best players to Anfield.</p>
              <p>Though wary of following the Manchester City blueprint, and paying inflated prices, Huang is adamant market values would be met to recruit the calibre of player needed to keep the likes of Torres and Steven Gerrard happy.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>According to sources close to Huang, who is head of Hong Kong investment company QSL Sports Ltd, Hodgson could identify any player in the world, and the new regime would check on availability and an asking price.</strong></p>
              <p>‘It could be Lionel Messi, and every effort would be made to sign him,’ said one source. ‘This guy is deadly serious about taking over and wants it done this month so Roy can significantly improve the team and go into the season with a realistic chance of winning something.’</p>
              <p>Though intent on transforming Liverpool with a seemingly limitless transfer budget and a firm pledge to begin building work immediately on a new 60,000-seat stadium, Huang is determined to drive a hard bargain.</p>
              <p>He has concluded that the club’s worth currently stands at little more than the £237m they owe the bank, although it is understood he may be prepared to pay up to £300m.</p>
              <p>But with Hicks and Gillett renowned for digging in their heels and reluctant to lower their valuation much below £600m, Huang may struggle to bring his bold plan to fruition. </p>

              <p>He is rich but not damn rich. He is representing a Chinese consortium  (Similiar to GIC &amp; DIC) to bid for Liverpool. It is his backing that got all the $$. No one knows who backed him but most probably CIC. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Investment_Corp</p>
              <p>The situation at Liverpool could not be any worst than now so rather the take over take place. Torres &amp; Gerrard's shirt will be selling like hot cake in China if that happens.</p>

              <div class="sp-story">
              <p>A takeover bid financed by the Chinese government is reported to be the preferred bidder in the race to buy Liverpool.</p>
              <p> Chairman Martin Broughton is hoping to complete a sale of the club before the end of the month with several interested parties having come forward. According to reports in several of Thursday morning's newspapers, the rival offer from Syrian Yahya Kirdi will not be successful.</p>
              <p>Current owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett were said to favour the interest from Kirdi as they would be able to walk away from Anfield with a profit.</p>
              <p>The Chinese Investment Corporation (CIC), which invests China's cash reserves in foreign countries, is only willing to repay to debt to Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays Capital, leaving the North American duo with no return on their investment.</p>
              <p>Representatives of Kirdi have claimed to be "in the final stage of negotiation" but that appears to be wide of the mark, with the CIC bid - spearheaded by businessman Kenny Huang - at the head of the queue.</p>
              <p>CIC is said to have assets of £209 billion, which would allay fears over the funding of the deal. <em>The Times</em> claims manager Roy Hodgson will be given £150 million to spend.</p>
              <p>The <em>Guardian</em> reports that CIC has spent the past fortnight selling shares in other companies to free up the precise amount of cash to clear Liverpool's debt. The report states: "In a series of trades since July 19, CIC has sold $558 million of shares in Morgan Stanley, equating to £351.4 million. That sum is equivalent to Liverpool's debt to the nearest decimal place, and is exactly the number insiders say has been quoted to interested parties as the sale price."</p>
              <p>CIC's website states: "CIC strives to contribute to the prosperity and development of local economies. CIC usually does not seek an active role in the companies in which it invests nor attempts to influence those companies' operations. CIC seeks long-term, stable, sustainable, and risk-adjusted return."</p>
              <p>New York based Rhone Group and the Al-Kharafi family from Kuwait are also said to be in negotiations.</p>
