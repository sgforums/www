              <h2>Former Italy international Christian Vieri has agreed to join
              Premiership newcomers Hull City, according to British tabloid The Daily
              Star.</h2>
              <p>Vieri is a free agent after his one-year deal at Fiorentina
              expired, and the club opted against offering him a new deal.<br><br>It had seemed as if the soon-to-be 35-year-old was set to
              join Atalanta for a third time, however it appears as if the move collapsed
              following a fan protest against the transfer.<br><br>The Daily Star is now claiming that Vieri has come to an
              agreement with Hull
               City to join them
              instead, and will <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">earn £10k a week</span></span></strong> with the Northern-outfit.<br><br>Hull
               City will take part in the
              Premiership for the first time in their history next season, following their
              promotion from the Championship.<br><br>Manager Phil Brown is hoping that the experienced Vieri can
              score the goals to lead ‘The Tigers’ to safety.<br><br>If the move goes through this will astonishingly be the 14th
              club in Vieri’s career, but it will be the first time he has plied his trade in
              England.<br><br>Vieri, who scored 23 goals in 49 games for the Italy national team, speaks fluent English after
              spending part of his childhood in Australia. His sporting idol is
              Australian cricket legend Allan Border.</p>

              <p>i'm not saying he's highly paid. in fact i think he's playing for the love of the game. thats why he didn't mind the club and the wage with his reputation.</p>
              <p>what i did try to say is that some other players with similar reputation of his, when they turn old, they can't get over the high paycheck and being in a reputatable club.</p>

              <h1><em>Damn thought could see him in EPL...</em><br></h1>
              <h1>Vieri Signs For Atalanta</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/32118_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150"></p>
              <h2>Christian Vieri has returned to Atalanta for the third time in his career, the club have confirmed.</h2>
              <p>Vieri played for the Bergamaschi
              in 1996 before being snapped up by Juventus. He returned to the club 10 years
              later but he hardly played for them, making only seven appearances and scoring
              two goals. He moved to Fiorentina last term on a one-year deal and he has now
              rejoined the Nerazzurri after being released by La Viola.
              <br><br>Reports earlier claimed that the former Atletico Madrid hit-man
              had agreed a £10,000 per week deal with Hull City of the English
              Premier League but Atalanta have moved in quickly and they will be
              looking forward to having Vieri back to his best next season. 
              <br><br>A statement on the club’s
              official website reads:
               
              <br><br>“Atalanta Bergamasca Calcio
              would like to communicate that the club have gained the rights to Christian
              Vieri for the 2008/09 season.”
               
              <br><br>The 34-year-old has signed a
              one-year deal with the club and it is believed he has taken a massive pay cut
              also.
               
              <br><br>The player is getting closer
              to retirement and he is hoping to have one last jingle in Serie A with the Bergamo based outfit.
               
              <br><br>Atalanta just missed out on the UEFA Cup last season and Vieri may be the man to fire them into Europe next term.</p>
