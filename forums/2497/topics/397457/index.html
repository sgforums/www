              Mar (Premier League) v Fulham (A) WON 2-1<br><br><strong>TEAM NEWS<br><br>Arsenal</strong><br><br>The
               Gunners' injury woes show few signs of easing, although Alex Song could
               return if he passes a late fitness test on a cartilage problem in his 
              knee which has kept him out of the last three games - all of which Arsenal 
              have lost. If the holding midfielder is fit, he could find himself 
              deployed in central defense alongside Sol Campbell, as both Thomas 
              Vermaelen and William
               Gallas are out for the rest of the season with calf 
              injuries. <br><br>Manuel Almunia is unlikely to have recovered from a 
              wrist injury, which means Lukasz Fabianski could have 
              another chance to prove that he's not an even bigger liability between 
              the sticks than the Spaniard; goalkeeper is certainly one position Arsenal 
              fans will be expecting Arsene Wenger to address in 
              the summer transfer market. <br><br>Wenger could also give Robin van Persie
               his first start since November, which might go some way towards 
              rectifying the baffling decision to keep the outstanding Dutch striker 
              on the bench until it was much too late against Wigan last week. <br><br>Andrey Arshavin 
              has spoken optimistically of recovering from a calf problem in time to 
              face City, but the Russian must be considered doubtful. Meanwhile 
              captain Cesc 
              Fabregas, Aaron Ramsey, Denilson, Johan Djourou and Kieran 
              Gibbs are all ruled out.<br><em><br>Last starting XI (v Wigan):</em> Fabianski, Sagna, Campbell, Silvestre, Clichy, Walcott, Eastmond , 
              Diaby, Nasri, Rosicky, Bendtner. <br><strong><br>Manchester 
              City </strong><br><br>Mancini should have Micah Richards 
              available again after a knee injury, the England defender having missed 
              City's last four Premier
               League games, although Nedum Onuoha is likely to retain his
               place at right-back.<br><br>There could be three ex-Gunners in City's 
              starting XI: revered former captain Patrick Vieira, who can expect a 
              warm welcome if he plays against Arsenal for the first time 
              since leaving for Italy in 2005; central defender and City captain Kolo 
              Toure, who should also get a friendly reception; and striker Emmanuel Adebayor,
               who is no doubt braced for hostility from the home fans.<br><br>Vieira 
              could start instead of Gareth Barry or Nigel de Jong if Mancini seeks to
               rotate his central midfielders.<br><br>Another former Arsenal player, 
              Brazilian left-back Sylvinho, is doubtful with a calf problem but would 
              probably miss out anyway following the impressive return of Wayne Bridge after 
              injury.<br><br>Michael Johnson, Martin Petrov (both knee) and Joleon 
              Lescott (hamstring) are all ruled out.<br><em><br>Last starting XI (v 
              Man Utd):</em> Given, Onuoha, Kompany, Toure, Bridge, Adam Johnson, De 
              Jong, Barry, Bellamy, Tevez, Adebayor.<br><strong><br>PLAYERS TO WATCH<br><br>Arsenal</strong><br><br>Arsene Wenger has 
              rapidly been running out of players at a crucial phase of the season, 
              and it has cost him and the team dearly. The one bright spot has been 
              the return to fitness of <strong>Robin van Persie</strong>, 
              whose Arsenal 
              career has been blighted by injury but who, when fit, is a class above 
              the other strikers at the club - and most others in the Premier League.<br><br>The
               Dutchman - whose five-month lay-off with ruptured ankle ligaments 
              sustained in a friendly international for Holland against Italy - 
              demonstrated in a 22-minute cameo from the bench against Spurs recently 
              just what a difference he might have made to Arsenal's season if he'd 
              remained injury-free.<br><br>Van Persie, who joined the 
              Gunners from Feyenoord in 2004, has scored 71 goals for the club in 137 
              first-team appearances (plus 57 as a substitute) and is the leading 
              marksman among the players currently at the Emirates. Last season he 
              scored a career-best 20 goals and provided a league-leading 11 assists, 
              and in the current, injury-interrupted campaign, he has scored eight and
               contributed eight assists. <br><br><strong>Manchester City</strong><br><br><strong>Emmanuel 
              Adebayor</strong> stole the headlines in the reverse fixture
               earlier this season when, taunted by the traveling Arsenal fans who 
              perceived him as a mercenary individual in the wake of his acrimonious 
              departure from the Emirates, the former Togo international celebrated 
              scoring against his ex-employers by running the length of the pitch to 
              slide on his knees in triumph in front of the incensed Gooners.<br><br>Adebayor
               also landed in hot water for kicking Robin van Persie in the face
               as the Dutchman lay on the ground, the Arsenal striker claiming it 
              was deliberate. The African incurred a three-match suspension for that 
              action. Kolo Toure and Mancini have both urged him to show greater 
              restraint on Saturday and focus on helping City claim the three points.<br><br>Adebayor
               scored his last league goals for Arsenal in this fixture last
               season, and in fact has scored five goals in the last four Premier League 
              meetings between the two sides - four for Arsenal and one for City. He 
              has returned to form lately, scoring four goals in his last three games,
               and is City's second top scorer with 13 goals (all in the league), 
              behind Carlos Tevez
               who has struck 28 (22 league). <br><br><strong>PREDICTION</strong><br><br>Arsenal
               have won their last five League matches at the Emirates, and it is a 
              little over three years since they last lost three consecutive Premier League 
              games. Meanwhile Manchester
               City have not lost two consecutive Premier League games all
               season, so something may have to give. <br><br>City are also unbeaten 
              in their last five away games and have won the last two, thrashing 
              Burnley 6-1 at Turf Moor in the most recent. There is a great deal 
              riding on the outcome on Saturday, from points to pride to position to 
              prospects in Europe next season. Expect the high stakes to be matched by
               high tension - and a few goals.<br><br><em><strong>Arsenal 2-2 Manchester
