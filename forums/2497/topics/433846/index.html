              <h1>Pool want £9m for Adam - Report</h1>
              <p>Blackpool are believed to have placed a £9million price tag on midfielder Charlie Adam's head</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> <a class="thickbox" title="Adam: Wanted at Anfield" href="http://images.football365.com/11/04/800x600/Charlie-Adam_2589529.jpg"><img src="http://images.football365.com/11/04/640/Charlie-Adam_2589529.jpg" alt="Adam: Wanted at Anfield"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool are thought to be leading the race for Adam after having a couple of bids rejected for his services during the January transfer window.</strong></p>
              <p>Aston Villa and Tottenham are also thought to be keen on the 25-year-old and they are monitoring his situation at Bloomfield Road.</p>
              <p>Blackpool are resigned to losing Adam, but they are holding out for the highest offer for the former Rangers man. And the Seasiders have informed Adam's suitors it will take a fee of £9million for them to let the classy playmaker leave this summer.</p>
              <p>Liverpool are understood to be reluctant to meet the fee, but they are expected to increase their efforts to land the Scotland international in the next few days</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool have agreed a transfer fee with Blackpool to sign </strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/108350/charlie-adam?cc=5739"><span style="color: #225fb2;"><strong>Charlie Adam</strong></span></a><strong>, bringing an end to their six-month pursuit of the Scotland midfielder.</strong></p>
              <p>Adam will now travel to Merseyside for a medical and to discuss personal terms.</p>
              <p>Kenny Dalglish has made it clear ever since he returned to the Anfield hot seat that he wanted Adam, but an initial attempt to sign him in January collapsed.</p>
              <p>Blackpool have been holding out for £9 million during renewed negotiations between the two clubs, but early reports suggest they have settled for a £7 million-plus-player deal.</p>
              <p>Adam, 25, is expected to face no problems when completing his medical, with the deal set to be officially completed within 24 hours.</p>
              <p>The Scotland international will become Dalglish's second signing of the summer as the Reds boss has already bought England international Jordan Henderson from Sunderland for £16 million.</p>
              <p>With two new central-midfielders heading to Anfield, Dalglish will need to make changes to his personnel, with the likes of <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/13752/Alberto-Aquilani"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Alberto Aquilani</span></a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/69159/Christian-Poulsen"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Christian Poulsen</span></a> likely to be shown the door.</p>
              <p>Aquilani has returned from a season-long loan spell at Juventus, who chose not to take up the option to buy the Italy international, while Poulsen became a peripheral figure when Dalglish took over in January.</p>
              <p>There are a number of other players Liverpool would like to move on in order to free up space not only in the squad but on the wage bill. <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/7976/Joe-Cole"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Joe Cole</span></a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/140192/Milan-Jovanovic"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Milan Jovanovic</span></a> are two players who failed to impress in their first seasons with the club.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Roma goalkeeper Alexander Doni could complete a move to Liverpool in the next 36 hours, according to his agent.</p>
              <p>The clubs reached an agreement over Doni's transfer last month but the keeper rejected Liverpool's first contract offer, believing it to be too low. However, the player could still be on his way to the Premier League before the weekend.</p>
              <p>"In the next 36 hours we will know something definite,'' Doni's agent Ovidio Colucci said. "Liverpool are interested in Doni and there is the agreement between the two clubs and with the player.</p>
              <p>"Doni is in Italy right now. We just have to ratify certain details with Roma. If the deal is completed, Doni will join Liverpool on a free transfer and will sign a two-year contract.</p>
              <p>"Doni is very happy with the chance to go to Liverpool and play in the Premier League.''</p>
              <p>The Brazilian joined Roma in 2005 from Juventude in his homeland. He has been an understudy to Julio Sergio in recent seasons, and made 16 league appearances for the <em>Giallorossi </em>last term.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Kenny Dalglish’s grand plan to get the best out of Andy Carroll is falling into place after his six-month  pursuit of Charlie Adam reached a successful conclusion.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Having tried to land the Blackpool star in January, Liverpool finally agreed a fee in the region of £9million for the Scotland midfielder. Adam becomes the club’s second big addition of the summer following Jordan Henderson’s £16m switch from Sunderland.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Where Dalglish fits Adam and Henderson into his new-look team will be pondered by fans but there is little doubt the manager’s recruitment drive  is geared, in many ways, to ensuring Carroll gets enough ammunition to live up to the billing of a £35m striker.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">One of Adam’s qualities is his pinpoint set pieces, while  Liverpool’s relentless pursuit of Stewart Downing — a player well known for the accuracy of his crosses — offers further proof that they are determined to give Carroll maximum  assistance from the flanks.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Liverpool have had a £15m offer for Downing rebuffed but are unlikely to be deterred by Aston Villa’s hardline stance and will return with an improved bid for the England winger, who has his heart set on a move to Anfield.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Villa are adamant their England star is not for sale and are even prepared to invite him to restart talks on a new contract, although he has two years remaining on his current deal. Villa feel they are under no pressure to sell having allowed Ashley Young to join Manchester United this summer.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Liverpool had missed out on a number of targets, leaving some to wonder whether a summer of frustration loomed, but things have picked up in the last 48 hours. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The quest to bring in cover for goalkeeper Pepe Reina is almost over, with Roma’s Brazil international Doni expected to travel to Merseyside for a  medical within the next 36 hours. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">England full back Glen Johnson also signed a contract extension until 2015 yesterday. </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Director of football Damien Comolli said: ‘We are delighted. We were in talks for a few weeks but it was easy to find an agreement because he wanted to stay and we wanted him to stay.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">‘We are very pleased he wants to commit long term and I think he was pleased we went to him and asked him to commit long term.’</span></p>
