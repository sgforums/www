              <p>AC Milan's Brazilian star Kaka has shown that sentiment does count more than money in deciding to remain at AC Milan.</p>

              <p>"I don't want anything, I am happy here at a place where the personnel respect me and love me. I am staying here.</p>
              <p>"I made the decision, my family left me alone and I didn't fight with my father about the decision.</p>
              <p>"At the end of the day what really mattered was my thoughts, where I am bound to and in reality where my heart belongs."</p>

              <h1>Debate: Kaka, City And Silvio - What Really Happened?</h1>
              <h2>The saga is over, but the drama continues. Kaka is staying put, but did the Milan president play us for foools all along?</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/41808_news.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The Kaka to Manchester City saga, which ran for days, ended in mere seconds after AC Milan president Silvio Berlusconi declared his prize asset to be unsellable - but the fall-out from this is set to run and run.</strong><br><br>Indeed, the media circus is likely to continue long, long into the night, as remonstrations from both ends of Europe - north and south - rage on.<br><br>But when the deal collapsed at first, it looked as though that consummate media mogul - Silvio Berlusconi - had orchestrated the whole event for the benefit of him and his club.<br><br><strong>Three Cheers For Berlusconi</strong><br><br>Here's what happened: various Italian TV channels explained that a deal had been agreed between Manchester City and Milan: Garry Cook, Bosco Leite and Milan representatives had signed, sealed and delivered the technicalities. All that was needed was Kaka's signature...<br><br>... But, journalists (such as those on Sky Italia - a non-Berlusconi company, by the way) intoned, there could be another amazing development. If Silvio Berlusconi himself wishes to block the deal, he can still do so.<br><br>Five minutes elapsed and then - surprise, surprise! - none other than Silvio Berlusconi himself surfaces to hoist up the barricades, declare that Kaka is going nowhere, and that the "extraordinary boy" was overjoyed to be a part of his Milan family.<br><br>"Kaka is unsellable, and will not leave Milan," he boomed to <em>Il Proceso di Biscardi</em> - a show hosted by a famous, loved-by-all journalist - and the subtext was clear: Silvio had made this happen. From "probably sellable" to "unsellable" in just a few days, the patron had had a massive change of heart, and couldn't allow his beloved Milan to suffer.<br><br>Of course, Berlusconi's more expansive speech - which helpfully followed just minutes later - was far more ambiguous. "Not only is money not everything to him, he is happy to stay at Milan with all his friends," he simpered. Hmm - now it looks like it was partially Kaka's decision to stay, or at least the Brazilian had gratefully given his approval to Berlusconi's decision. (Probably the latter, in fact.)<br><br>But up in Manchester, a very slightly different story was brewing...<br><br><strong>Fine, Then - We Didn't Want A Deal Anyway!<br><br></strong>Mere minutes after <em>this</em> impassioned announcement from Silvio Berlusconi, Manchester City said that it was in fact <em>they</em> who called off the deal. Silvio, schmilvio - the Citizens had cancelled the whole thing due to a disagreement over terms with Milan.<br><br>Now, in saying this, they were not directly contradicting Berlusconi. After all, Berlusconi's "unsellable" motto would hint at his not playing ball at all. But City implied from their words on their official site that there were, in fact, productive talks that reached a mature stage before their falling through.<br><br>Said Garry Cook: "Whilst Manchester City Football Club has an obvious interest in world class players of the quality of Kaka, we owe it to our fans that such a transfer must work on every level; commercially, financially, in terms of results on the field and within Manchester City's broader community."<br><br>This implies that there was at least something in the talks, and that City took the high road and bailed before things went too far; quite from Berlusconi marching into the meeting room, slamming his hands on the table, and issuing a negative bark, this gives the image that City stood up, shook hands, and parted on positive terms.<br><br><strong>Fight Them On The Beaches<br><br></strong>So, two conflicting accounts of events, and two similar - but slightly different - takes on how things broke down.<br><br>But let's look at this objectively for a moment. The two conclusions, while both stating that a breakdown in agreement between the two clubs was the deciding factor, are designed to make the two clubs look as good as possible. That's no surprise in and of itself: no organisation wants to come out of a transfer saga looking foolish.<br><br>But that they came out tonight with such a dramatic anticlimax - what a contradiction in terms! - was very convenient when one remembers that this was, according to the Italian press as early as the weekend - "Kaka's D-Day".<br><br>In other words, a lot of sources in the media seemed to know a lot about this evening's meetings before they happened, and the conclusion was well-timed. That Berlusconi appeared on TV mere minutes after it was said that only he could intervene, again, appears convenient. In other words, a lot of these little dramas from Monday night look as if they might be stage-managed.<br><br>Milan's official website even thanked their dear Silvio before Kaka himself when confirming their talisman would be staying with the club. "00:16: Our Ricky stays with us," read a statement. "It's the only thing that matters. The love of the Milanisti has won. Thank you, president! Thank you, Kaka! Forza Milan!" Kaka himself said, "Not even for 30 seconds did I think about leaving Milan." If the man in question wasn't even considering the move, what took so long for negotiations to draw to a close? Perhaps it was all part of the time...<br><br>But still, it needs to be said that this was perhaps the most intriguing transfer saga of January, and one with what is at least ostensibly a heart-warming ending. Regardless of the media machinations of the club, the visions of Kaka holding up a Milan shirt and then clapping along with the gathered Milan fans outside <em>his own home</em>, and then pumping his heart, will linger long in the memory. That isn't something that's just put on for the cameras, surely, even if his paymasters and would-be new bosses might have done it differently were they in his shoes.</p>

              <p>There is no way back for AC Milan star Kaka at Manchester City.</p>
              <p>City executive chairman Garry Cook has slammed the door on the Brazilian after yesterday's breakdown in negotiations.</p>
              <p>Cook sensationally revealed to <em>BBC Radio Five Live</em>:
              "The agenda we thought we were on was about Kaka coming on a journey
              with this club but at the end the only journey they were on was a
              fiscal one.</p>
              <p>"We'll continue on our journey but he won't be a part of it. Deals with the greatest players are more than complex.</p>
              <p>"It would have been great to have him with us but what got in the way was the behaviour of AC Milan and I think they bottled it.</p>
              <p>"We got to talk to Kaka's father. His father said he was very
              interested in the project and we talked about humanitarian potential
              factors but when we got into discussions those issues took a back seat
              and financial demands came to the fore."</p>

              <p><br>Personally, I believe all the fuss has to do more with the amount rather than the player in question... No doubt Kaka is a talented player but he is certainly not the Kaka of 2, 3 yrs ago now... Had the Fifa Player of the year not expand it to 5 nominee this year, he wouldn't even be on the list... Althought Robinho also created a bigger fuss first with Chelsea and eventually with City... and it lasted almost like 1 month or more... So I guess whoever City buys with a record sum will surely make a big fuss... </p>

              <p>hmm, I think Kaka at 25 will think City is not even in Europe and why should he burn his youth just trying to get City back into Europe while in Milan, he has a shot at winning?</p>
              <p>Moneywise, these players are played obscene money already. So I don't think he lacks.</p>
              <p>I do think there may be little things that are below the surface that ruin this deal. Rem how gerrard was about to sign for the blues but backed out the last minute? I believe the same thing happen - intimidation by fans..</p>

              <p>i applaud kaka for doing the right thing. man c wld have been a bad choice. lousy manager, club with poor pedigree, etc. and he has to justify his price tag everytime he come on field. the only way for him is downhill from there. so, his heart and head think right this time.</p>
              <p>i hope it sends a message to all the mercenary footballers who join for money, like robinho. even it is a slap to beckham, who joined la galaxy mainly on non-football ground.</p>
              <p>berni, imo, opinion must be cursing and swearing. publically, he may be applauding his prodigal son, but that is a lot of money to turn away. he may never get another opportunity like this again.</p>
              <p>with this, perhaps we can let this rest and go away quietly and refocus on why liverpool self implode in january, hehe...</p>

              <p>I personally thought City were rather lucky that Kaka didn't sign for them cos I don't think he will ever be value for money at that price and he may not even adapt to the fast pace and rough EPL... For a player who has been in Italy for such a long time, I think he has got used to the slower pace and will have big difficulties adjusting to the EPL... And with the English Press ready to pound on his value every week... He could end up being seen as another record $ flop from AC Milan...</p>
              <p>City would be better off concentrating getting EPL experience players for now and when they have made it to the higher level, then consider these fellows... By that time, they will also look more attractive to top players in Europe.</p>

              <p>I personally thought City were rather lucky that Kaka didn't

              rough EPL... For a player who has been in Italy for
              such a long time, I think he has got used to the slower
              pace and will have big difficulties adjusting to the EPL... And
              with the English Press ready to pound on his value every week... He

              <p>City would be better off concentrating getting EPL experience
              players for now and when they have made it to the higher level,

              <p>To your earlier statement that he is 25, Actually Kaka is already 26 and will be 27 in 3 months time... His clock is ticking very fast and he may never regain the form he had 2, 3 yrs ago anymore... Not everyone is like Zidane, Giggs or Cannavaro who can play very top level well into their 30s... Ronaldinho like 28 now and it looks like his best days are behind him already... Shevchenko, Ballack, are just some of the others who reach 30 and their form dip from their best years... Moreover, Kaka even at his best, didn't look as good as Ronaldinho was during his best period...</p>
              <p>Brazil indeed won the WC in 2002, but Kaka wasn't the star... He was only a bench player who played less than 30 mins throughout the tournament...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">So I don't quite understand what "new breed" about him... There are creative players arriving to the EPL as well, namely Luka Modric</span>, Deco are just a few top name players... When they arrived to the premiership, a lot was said and expected of them and what happen? You see Deco has been muscled out, Modric as well... When they come up against teams who gives them very little space and time on the ball and have players like Kevin Davies coming at you... They probably can't hold on to the ball long enough before they get kick...</p>
              <p>City is not exactly like Chelsea, and contrary to your early statement in another thread, Chelsea were already a top 4 side when Roman bought them... But the years before, Ken Bates invested a lot too and eventually taking them up to top 4 position but incur a great deal of debts which Roman eventually took over as well...</p>
              <p>I reckon it would take at least 3 yrs before City can be taken as serious challengers to the EPL title...</p>

              <p><br>Yes I agree with you but I wasn't referring to the Sheikhs... Whatever priced they are willing to pay is one matter but the public and the Press will have their own opinion too... Just like Chelsea perhaps consider Shev as cheap then but others will judge it as a bad deal, over excessive or simply a big money flop regardless what Chelsea thinks... Get what I mean. The same could happen to Kaka...</p>
              <p>I personally think both side will come out poorer from the deal... lol</p>
