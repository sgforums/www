The Special One reckons the Blues were nothing before he took charge three years ago and warns they could fall apart without his leadership. And owner Roman Abramovich is left under no illusion about what he stands to lose if Mourinho leaves Â— or is sacked Â— in the summer.</strong><br><br>Speaking about the team he inherited in 2004, Mourinho says players like Frank Lampard and John Terry only became world-class through his guidance. The Blues boss said: Â“Who were Lampard, Terry, Drogba two years ago? They were certainly not world stars. Â“And in this moment who are they? They are like Shevchenko or Ballack.<br><br>Red RomÂ’s millions have enabled Mourinho to have an unrivalled pick in the transfer market. But the Portuguese chief insists the likes of Â£30.8million summer signing Andriy Shevchenko and German midfield star Michael Ballack would not have moved to Stamford Bridge unless he had already created a special team.<br><br>MourinhoÂ’s ego climbs to new heights as his secret thoughts are unveiled in a thesis written by biographer Luis Lourenco in Portugal. He added: Â“People say I modified my transfer strategy because I bought Shevchenko and Ballack. Â“I did not modify my transfer strategy. I bought stars for the environment of stars. Â“I would never have bought Shevchenko and Ballack for a team without stars, for a team that had won nothing, for a team of players without titles, for a team that would be built around those two figures and 20 Joe Nobodies.<br><br>Chelsea entertain Tottenham today, with Mourinho aiming to make history by capturing his third straight Premiership title as well as the Quadruple. But he has no doubts what would happen if he ever deserted his Blues troops. Despite insisting publicly he will see out the rest of his contract to 2010, Mourinho has increasingly become a marginalised figure at Stamford Bridge and is no longer on speaking terms with Abramovich. The Russian supremo wants to bring in Guus Hiddink as general manager in the summer.<br><br>Mourinho is still reeling from his sideÂ’s 2-1 Premiership defeat at Spurs last November. He said: Â“We had a goal by Drogba disallowed which would have made it 2-0, we had the sending-off of Terry, but itÂ’s best not to talk about that because I might get another fine.Â”<br></div>

"They were certainly not world stars.<br><br>"And in this moment who are they? They are like Shevchenko or Ballack."<br><br>While the exact timing of the conversation with Lourenco remains unclear, it is bound to be interpreted as another clear message to Roman Abramovich.<br><br>The rift between Mourinho and Abramovich has cast serious doubt over his future as Chelsea manager but the Portuguese warns of the consequences of dismissing him this summer.<br><br></div>
