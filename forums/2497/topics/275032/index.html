I think a very, very unfair decision has got Chelsea a point today. But I think we proved today we are capable of challenging.<br><br>"I felt the referee didn't play well today. There was a lot of pressure from the Chelsea players and I thought he eventually cracked."</div>

How can you change a game like this?"<br><br>Asked if he questioned Styles about the decision after the match, Benitez said: "No. It is clear, he can watch the video. He may understand why we are so disappointed. Unbelievable. "<br><br>However, Liverpool's Spanish manager was still able to take positives from a keenly contested match.<br><br>"We had some chances against a very good team. The game was under control but this kind of decision, you cannot explain.<br><br>"Maybe he was under pressure all the time. I prefer not to say too much."</div>
