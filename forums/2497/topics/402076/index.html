              <p><br>You might not understand, but sometimes it's a matter of principle... If this is indeed true, then since he was already on $80k at Chelsea and his contract ended, he expected to be rewarded for his loyalty... And since Chelsea were not willing to offer him what he wanted having seen the likes of Lampard, Terry, A Cole all got what they demanded and also more than what he is currently asking from them... So I guess he might feel they don't value him enough...</p>
              <p>As for Arsenal, a club who hardly pays top dollar, he might feel they really value him highly to make him one of their top earners along with added <span style="color: #333332;">performance-related bonuses...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333332;">Sometimes it's not just the money, it could also be the thought of being wanted or valued that matters...</span></p>
