              <h1>James' glove story: Keeper completes shock move to aid City's Premier push</h1>

              </div>
              <p>Little over a month ago David James was between the sticks for his country as England crashed out of the World Cup.</p>
              <p>But after turning down the advances of Celtic and Sunderland, his next 
              competitive game will be against Millwall for Bristol City next 
              Saturday.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/30/article-1298987-0AA1A47D000005DC-386_468x477.jpg" alt="City slicker: England international keeper James has signed for the Robins" width="468" height="477">
              <p class="imageCaption">City slicker: England international keeper James has signed for the Robins</p>
              </div>
              <p>James completed his surprise 
              move yesterday, signing 
              a one-year deal - with an 
              option of a further season at Ashton Gate - that will earn him around 
              £15,000 a week after collecting a signing-on fee in the region of 
              £500,000.</p>
              <p>The veteran keeper, who reaches the milestone of 40 
              tomorrow, will be paraded today prior to City's preseason friendly at 
              home against Blackpool and his decision will doubtless shock many.</p>
              <div id="ext-gen6674" class="moduleHalf">
              <div class="sport item">
              <div class="have-your-say ccolcc link-box linkro-ccox">
              <div class="have-your-say-container">

              </div>
              </div>
              <span class="tell-us">  </span></div>
              <p>But James has a long-held 
              ambition to help a club from 
              the region to the Barclays Premier 
              League promised land.</p>
              <p>Before joining Portsmouth, 
              that club was almost 
              Plymouth Argyle. As James 
              revealed in the summer of 2006 as he was pondering a move away from Manchester City:</p>
              <p>'I
               had decided I was going to join Plymouth Argyle. My missus was in 
              Devon; I would go down there and get them promoted to the Premier League
               - the first South West club in the league. They never knew anything 
              about it, but it had to be Plymouth.'</p>
              <p>There comes a time in every
               man's life when priorities must be re-examined. If you can shave an 
              hour off your commute to work, all the better.</p>
              <p>James tied the 
              knot with his childhood sweetheart Amanda Salmon last weekend and while 
              it might not be pipe and slippers time yet, it is clear he had no desire
               to uproot his family from their mansion in Chudleigh, Devon.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p style="font-weight: bold;">SOL CAMPBELL<br>Pompey to Notts County</p>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p>And Bristol City fans will be pleased to hear James' ambitions have not been dulled with the passage of time.</p>
              <p>'I've
               had offers to stay in the Premier League but it is more important that I
               play football - which I love - for the right club and be a family man. I
               know all about the plans for a new stadium and desire to win promotion 
              to the Premier League,' he said.</p>
              <p>'The club is ambitious and that's what I am. The south west has not had a club in the Premier League and that needs to change.'</p>
              <p>Fitness permitting, James intends to carry on keeping until he is 45. 
              Plenty of time to achieve his ambition of making it Premier League 
              appearance number 574 with City.</p>
