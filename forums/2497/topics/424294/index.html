              <h1>Arsenal will beat Manchester United to win the Premier League title, insists confident Samir Nasri</h1>
              <h2>Samir Nasri, not content with being branded by Rio Ferdinand as a potential player of the season, has mischievously suggested that he and his Arsenal team-mates have a greater chance than Manchester United to win the Premier League.</h2>

              <p><strong>Looking with relish at the fearsome tests awaiting <span style="color: #000000;">United</span><span style="color: #000000;"> — including matches against </span><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span><span style="color: #000000;">, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and a possibly decisive trip to the Emirates on May 1 — Nasri said: “We have more chance in the Premier League. We have the best schedule. I am convinced of our quality.” </span></strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Warming to his theme, the 23 year-old hinted that </span><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Arsenal</span></strong> could inflict further embarrassment upon United in their FA Cup quarter-final duel at Old Trafford next Saturday, arguing Sir Alex Ferguson’s players were “scared” to face such a freewheeling attack.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>“We can beat Manchester United,” he said. “The last time there [in the league on Dec 13, when United won 1-0], they didn’t play in the normal way. They were scared. They played with three defensive midfielders — they closed the game. I think we know we can beat them.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>“Now we can feel the Premier League,” declared Nasri, who has identified the north London derby at White Hart Lane on April 20 as another crucial staging post in Arsenal’s season. “If we win against Sunderland, we come back to within one point of the top. United play at Liverpool without Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic, so something can happen there. That is why I say we feel we can win the title.”</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>It is proof of the single-mindedness animating this Arsenal side that Nasri, just six days after the Carling Cup defeat to Birmingham that denied the club a first trophy for six years, can sound so bullish. He needs little reminding of his own abilities, having illuminated this campaign with his mesmeric passing and a new-found ruthlessness in front of goal.</p>
              <p>But he has also acquired a deep loyalty to the Arsène Wenger ‘project’, of which he is such an integral part. This midfield zephyr is yet to toast any silverware in his six years as a professional, either at Arsenal or his hometown club of Marseille, and admitted: “It is today or never. It feels like that to me. Chelsea are not as good as last year, Manchester United as well, so it is our time.</p>
              <p>“United are not like they were two years ago, with Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tévez. For me they were untouchable. This year they have drawn or lost a few games away from home, and have been unconvincing. Chelsea fell down after just eight games. This year we have had fewer injuries and everyone has grown up. It is now or never.”</p>
              <p>Nasri’s optimism extended to Arsenal’s Champions League prospects on Tuesday against Barcelona, who once expressed an interest in him as a 16 year-old still finding his feet in Marseille’s northern suburb of La Gavotte Peyret.</p>
              <p>Arsenal would, he promised, not be cowed as brutally as they were 11 months ago at the Nou Camp, when an irresistible Lionel Messi helped himself to four goals.</p>
              <p>“Last year the first touch of their team really was a nightmare,” said Nasri, attending the launch of the Adidas Champions League final ball at Wembley. “For the first time in my life I was frustrated</p>
              <p>“We didn’t touch the ball. They were all over the pitch. It was like playing 16 against 11. This time they have to come and attack us, and they will leave plenty of space for us to score on the counter-attack. We will do it.”</p>
