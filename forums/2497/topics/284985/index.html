One glare from Keano would be enough to make this entire team play better - just don't give him reason to hold a grudge, Alfe<br>We'll miss: The look of total fear in referee Andy D'Urso's face when just inches away from a vein throbbing Keane tirade<br><br><strong>Right forward: Gianfranco Zola (Chelsea)</strong><br>A real winger might have given more balance but you can't leave out the horse faced Italian who turned out to be a thoroughbred. Zola was revered as much for his mesmerising skills as he was for being an all round bloody nice bloke<br>We'll miss: His youthful enthusiasm despite being old enough to father half the team and those flicked goals<br><br><strong>Left forward: Thierry Henry (Arsenal)</strong><br>Not his natural position but the dearly departed French maestro is often found lurking on the left - usually just before breaking the sound barrier. Probably the best player ever to grace the PremiershipÂ…and certainly holder the most irritating goal celebrations<br>We'll miss: The gliding movement, the goals and even those Clio advertsÂ…or maybe not<br><br><strong>In the hole: Eric Cantona (Man Utd)</strong><br>The catalyst that sparked United's resurgence and still the King of Old Trafford.

Bergkamp changed players' attitudes to lifestyle and brought back technique - but he was still the only member of the A team that, "Ain't getting' on no plane, fool"<br>We'll miss: The moment time seemed to stand still as he flicked the ball and spun around Niko Dabizaz to score against Newcastle</div>
