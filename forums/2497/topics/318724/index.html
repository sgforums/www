              <h1>Chelsea Approach Hiddink In Secret</h1>
              <h2>Guus Hiddink’s connection with Roman Abramovich is of course no secret.
              But several British media, including The Guardian, suggest today that
              Chelsea have held talks with the Dutch master and kept them incognito.</h2>
              <p>The reigning Russia boss only agreed to a contract extension up to
              mid-2010 as recently as on March 24. But the newspaper reports that the
              deal is only a provisional one, much to Hiddink’s frustration, and will
              only be ratified after the European Championship – obviously only in
              case the Russians do well.  </p>
              <p><em>The Guardian</em> goes to reveal that Chelsea have been secretly
              talking to Hiddink, who may have denied these negotiations time and
              again in recent months, but is perhaps not feeling too secure in Russia
              these days.  </p>
              <p>“We will evaluate his work after the European Championship,” said
              recently Vitaly Mutko (pictured on the left), head of the Russian
              Football Union and newly-appointed sports minister. Striking detail?
              Hiddink’s salary, a reported 2.5 million euros plus bonuses, is
              actually funded by Abramovich via his National Academy of Football.  </p>
              <p>Hiddink was introduced to the Russian tycoon by fellow Dutchman Piet
              de Visser, a Chelsea (and ex-PSV Eindhoven, one of Hiddink’s former
              clubs) scout and widely considered as Abramovich’s close personal
              transfer advisor.  </p>
