              <p>How Liverpool's strike force may look next season</p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez is eyeing up Blackburn’s in-demand striker Roque Santa Cruz. Liverpool boss Benitez, given a huge £30m transfer kitty this summer, could be ready to rival Manchester City for the Paraguayan centre forward.</strong></p>
              <p>Benitez is keeping close tabs on Santa Cruz, 27, to strengthen his strike force and to work as a possible foil for Fernando Torres. City bid £20m for Santa Cruz in the summer and manager Mark Hughes wants him - but the Eastlands boss is under huge pressure himself.</p>
              <p>Liverpool have been scouting and reporting to Benitez on Santa Cruz who would prefer Champions League football to what City could offer him as Blackburn prepare to launch a big money auction this summer.</p>
              <p>Benitez has already targeted Valencia’s David Silva as a big-money buy but Santa Cruz is on his radar in what would be a major shock but shows the level of Liverpool’s ambition.</p>

              told the Ewood Park strugglers that he wants to leave the club at the
              end of the season.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The 27-year-old, currently recuperating after
              undergoing a surgical procedure on his troublesome right knee last
              week, told Paraguayan radio he has informed Rovers he wants to move on
              in the summer.</p>
              <p>"I have already told them (Blackburn) and they know that before
              the transfer window closes I would like to continue my career at a
              bigger, more ambitious team," he told Radio Nanduti.</p>
              <p>"Even though I haven't heard anything, I haven't changed my mind.</p>
              <p>"I think it will be very difficult for me to play again this
              season because of the recovery. Our last league match is on May 24 and
              I also need a couple of days for my knee to physically recover."</p>
              <p>The former Bayern Munich frontman could, therefore, have played
              his last match for Blackburn, as he does not intend to take to the
              field again before he is 100% fit.</p>

              <p><strong>Blackburn Rovers striker Roque Santa Cruz has revealed he
              has informed the club that he wants to leave Ewood Park at the end of
              the season.</strong><br></p>
              <p>The 27-year-old front-man has endured a frustrating season with both
              injuries and transfer speculation dominating the headlines rather than
              his goal-scoring.<br> <br> He has scored just six goals in 27 outings in all competitions, with
              former Rovers manager Mark Hughes seeing more than one bid to take the
              striker to Manchester City fail during the January transfer window.<br> <br> The Paraguayan - currently recovering from knee surgery - has been
              unable to assist Blackburn's bid to stay in the Premier League in
              recent weeks, with Sam Allardyce's side just one place and three points
              above the drop-zone.<br> <br> And he has revealed that he will seeking a move away from the club this summer, whatever division Rovers are in.<br> <br> "I have already told them and they know that before the transfer window
              closes I would like to continue my career at a bigger, more ambitious
              team," he told <em>Radio Nanduti  </em>in his homeland.</p>
              <p>"Even though I haven't heard anything, I haven't changed my mind.</p>
              <p>"I think it will be very difficult for me to play again this season
              because of the recovery. Our last league match is on May 24 and I also
              need a couple of days for my knee to physically recover.</p>
              <p>"I had to clean the zone where I had the cruciate ligament operation
              I had three or four years ago because there was some liquid there.</p>
              <p>"When I had the tendonitis in the left knee, it made the other leg overwork. That's why it got worse and I needed the surgery.</p>
              <p>"Now it is up to the knee. The recovery time is between four and six
              weeks and I will not hurry. The most important thing is to play without
              any problems."</p>
