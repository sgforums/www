              <p class="stand-first-alone"> </p>
              <p class="stand-first-alone"><img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club%20Home/2009/2/7/1234021916889/Robin-van-Persie-001.jpg" alt="Robin van Persie" width="460" height="276"></p>
              <p class="stand-first-alone"> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/barcelona"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Barcelona</strong></span></a><strong> have placed the core of </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/arsenal"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Arsenal</strong></span></a><strong>'s team on a list of planned ­summer reinforcements, with Robin van Persie a priority target. The Spanish league leaders had an offer of cash plus Alexander Hleb rejected last month but believe they can persuade Arsenal to sell in the close season when he enters the final 12 months of his current contract.</strong></p>
              <p>In addition to recruiting Van Persie as a left-sided attacker, Barcelona are working on approaches for Emmanuel Adebayor and Cesc Fábregas. While they do not consider it possible to capture all three in a single transfer window, Barça regard Arsenal as "a selling club" and expect the London club to release at least one of their star names to raise funds for reconstruction of their own squad.</p>
              <p>Van Persie is considered the most attainable because of his contract situation. The 25-year-old has less than 18 months left on his present deal and is stalling on an extension that would make him one of Arsenal's best paid players. Van Persie is understood to be concerned about Arsenal's failure to compete for ­silverware in recent times.</p>
              <p>Barcelona attempted to exploit the uncertainty last month with a cheeky offer to return Hleb in part exchange. Still angered by the manner in which the Belarus midfielder engineered his exit from the club last July, Arsenal refused to countenance Hleb's return.</p>
              <p>Adebayor is coach Pep Guardiola's choice as a replacement for Samuel Eto'o, who has also entered the final 18 months of his current contract. While other ­members of the Camp Nou hierarchy would prefer a move for Valencia's David Villa or Karim Benzema of Lyon, ­Guardiola's stock is high after an impressive start to his reign as coach.</p>
              <p>Fábregas remains a long-term target for the club who lost him to Arsenal as a teenager. Though Barça are confident that Fábregas would return, the strength of the club's midfield this season has made his recruitment a less pressing issue.</p>
              <p>Arsenal, meanwhile, are preparing an overhaul of their own with signs emerging that the club will invest heavily in one or more established players in an attempt to make their first team more competitive. The club is also aware of the threat to expensive corporate ticket sales posed by their recent difficulties in domestic competition – a concern that partially explains the atypically fevered purchase of Andrei Arshavin last week.</p>

              <p>I don't think Van Persie, Fabregas and Adebayor are a bunch of losers... If anything, they are the "cream of Arsenal's squad"...</p>
              <p>I think Barce plans to replace an ageing Henry before he lose his value... And at 31, he won't last very long... Adebayor seems like a decent replacement...</p>
              <p>The fact Barce view Arsenal as a selling club must be worrying for some gunners fans... And that new boy Arshavin, if he have a good showing and if Barce comes knocking... we can already guess what he is going to do... with Barce being his first choice but they didn't come in for him...</p>

              <p>Actually in my opinion, we can sell adebayor. Because he has simply been a one season wonder for the gunners. Nothing else about him is fantastic. I would prefer and Eduardo-Rvp, Walcott-RvP or Bendtner-RvP Partnership, more than an adebayor-RvP.</p>
              <p>For Cesc, I also dont mind selling him as he can really earn the gunners alot of money for reinforcements to the team. Anyway, arshavin, nasri, rosicky, denilson, wilshere, merida and ramsey can play in that position too.</p>
              <p>But for RvP to go, I would be very reluctant, because he has been simply the most fantastic player this season. Replacing him would be difficult, as no other players in the team plays like him (other than maybe arshavin). Therefore, hopefully the club can hold back RvP. We need him.</p>
              <p>Selling the 3 of them together can earn us around 60+ million pounds which is definitely a very good deal. The club should also sell away diaby abd eboue, and that would bring the total sales earnings to around 70 milion pounds.</p>
              <p>Wenger should use this money to buy some CBs and DMs to strengthen the spine of the team.</p>
              <p>But if arsenal really fail to qualify Champions league next season,then i can reallyforsee that clubs like barca, milan, madrid, city, juventus would be eyeing our players like sagna, walcott, clichy, toure, nasri, vela, adebayor, RvP and Cesc. And that would be very bad for the club. Therefore arsenal should start their revival asap starting from tonight's game.  Foret about Villa, concentrate on being top 4. Fifth place might be chelsea instead. HAHAHAHAHA</p>

              <h3>A TRIO of Arsenal stars will QUIT the Emirates if Arsene Wenger’s side miss out on Champions League football. </h3>
              <p>Robin van Persie, Emmanuel Adebayor and Cesc Fabregas are all increasingly concerned at Arsenal’s lack of silverware and ambition — and the final straw will come if they finish outside the top four. </p>
              <p>Van Persie is yet to sign a new deal and has made it clear it is not just about money but the direction the club is going. And he has been joined by Adebayor and Fabregas who are both targets for Real Madrid and Barcelona. Boss Wenger is also growing increasingly frustrated at the stalemate over Theo Walcott’s new contract.</p>
              <p>The England star’s advisors have been in talks with new chief executive, Ivan Gazidis but are yet to receive any kind of offer despite claims this week Walcott was close to signing. </p>
              <p>There is no suggestion Walcott wants to leave but a source close to Arsenal said: “There is a real problem developing because the big names are bemused at the way things are going. </p>
              <p>“If Arsenal finish outside the top four, there’s no way the likes of Van Persie, Adebayor and Fabregas will hang around. “They love playing for Arsene Wenger but they also want to win things. “And, as things stand, they can’t see that happening. It’s not about how much money they can earn, it’s about winning trophies for these guys. </p>
              <p>“They want to see some ambition and they want to see the club buying the right kind of players. “Andrey Arshavin is obviously a good player but many of the squad thought Arsene should have bought a strong midfielder and a centre-half, not just another neat and tidy ball player because there’s already plenty of them.” </p>
              <p>Van Persie was a transfer window target for Barcelona, who were willing to offer Alex Hleb and cash in return for the Dutchman although that was swiftly dismissed. </p>
              <p>The La Liga leaders will also come back for Adebayor and battle it out with rivals Real Madrid the moment Fabregas shows any sign of losing patience at Arsenal.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>If the club fail to qualify, its not down to them... They as players can only do so much... But if the club management / directors do not have the ambition for the club to excel or show little concern whether they are winning, then they as players will lose interest on it too... If their CEO can come out and say Its ok if the club don't qualify for the CL... It just show how much ambition or expectation they have...</p>
              <p>And as players, that can't be good when you know the board isn't trying as hard so whats the point of playing as hard when you are only 1 of the 23 to 25 players? You see your best players sold each year to other clubs and that will have a mental effect on you... Like can I actually stand a chance when we are letting go the quality players every year? Or will I ever win a title medal if I stay here?</p>
