              <p class="first"><strong>A referee ordered a penalty to be retaken in a
              Sunday league football game when an opposition player broke wind as the
              ball was kicked.</strong></p>
              <p>The Chorlton Villa player got a yellow card for the noise which was classed as "ungentlemanly conduct".</p>
              <p>The
              team, who conceded a goal on the second take, went on to win the match
              6-4 against International Manchester FC at Turn Moss in Stretford,
              Manchester.</p>
              <p>Villa manager Ian Treadwell said their conduct was "normally exemplary".</p>
              <p>"One of our players 'broke wind' and only the referee heard it and he booked the player," he said.</p>
              <p>"The
              other player had the penalty saved because it was a bad penalty; it was
              nothing to do with any noise. They were as shocked as we were as to
              why."</p>
              <p>Mr Treadwell said he was waiting for the Football Association to contact them after it had received a report.</p>
              <p>The Manchester Publicity league club faces total fines of £97 for three dismissals and two yellow card bookings from the game.</p>
              <p><strong>'Just hilarious'</strong></p>
              <p>Mr Treadwell said: "We are not a dirty team and we like to play football.</p>
              <p>"While
              I won't condone the actions of the players, it is an emotive game and
              some of the players were sent off for entering into conversation with
              the referee.</p>
              <p>"This has come at a bad time in the season as we don't have sponsor and we are looking for a new sponsor for next season."</p>
              <p>Pauline Riley, secretary and treasurer of International Manchester FC, said both team were "very friendly".</p>
              <p>"There's no animosity. It was just hilarious," she said.</p>
