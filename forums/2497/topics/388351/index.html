              <p>Chelsea only paying 100,000 and then city is willing to pay 150,000. Then of course jump ship la..</p>
              <p>Joe cole has won quite alot at Chelsea, and now he is near to the 30s and given that he is getting more and more injury prone, he should really think about joining city. Getting injured and still getting paid 150,000 is fantastic!!</p>
              <p>City is simply throwing money at players. I think each and every player that was brought in after the change of owner are getting more than 100,000 per week. City is spoiling the market!!</p>

              <p>Actually if you think about it, its quite worth it for City cos Joe is a good player and if he is free and Chelsea is offering him $100k, the difference is only $50k. The difference would be like 2.6m a season.</p>
              <p>Even if 4 yrs, will be about $10m + the $5m they are prepare to give him for sign on fee... Its like a transfer fee of $15m only to them and all this payout over a longer period too.</p>
              <p>And if Chelsea willing to pay him $120k, the difference is much lesser like $11m transfer fee only which is cheap considering City's players cost close to $20m if not more.</p>
              <p>But whatever happens, Joe is the winner... Lampard used Inter to get his pay increased, Terry used City, A Cole used Real, now Joe is following their footstep... lol.</p>

              <p>Isn't this the year Peter Kenyon said they would break even 4, 5 yrs ago? Now the time has come, it's 2010... Lets see if they can achieve it by the end of this season...which i doubt they can...</p>
              <p>Last year's loss was $44m a lot better compare to $140m a few yrs back... They have manae to bring it down bit by bit. Maybe they can do it if they cut back on high players salaries as well... But the goalpost seems to have been moved a little with City coming in... In the past, only they were able to pay such salaries and there was no competition... its either take it or leave it, so players either stick with them or get lesser. Now W Bridge has gone, SWP has gone and Terry almost left too... and they miss out on Robinho to City as well... They have to think of a new way to deal with City... Cos money is no longer their best weapon when it comes to City... Cos City can blow anyone out of the water if players only talk about dollars and cents...</p>
              <p>Now must depend on relationship... kum cheng... like in Terry's case...</p>

              <p>Cole's playing career in west London has oft been beset by injury, and the 28-year-old has only just returned to action following a long-term sidelining due to sustaining a complex knee problem in September.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti's decision to bench Cole during a Champions League tussle with Atletico Madrid in the group stage is alleged to upset Cole, who was further saddened as he remained an unused substitute.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, reports have emerged that AC Milan have joined Manchester City in the list of Cole's admirers, as both clubs moniter the developing situation with interest.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>But they just bought that new guy already... He will be another 'free player' in June. If Chelsea can't keep hold of him, they risk letting him walk away for nothing... For me, he is one of the few players at Chelsea who can change a game when he comes on as a sub like Robben in the past... Chelsea don't have many of this type of players anymore... His value should be between the $12m to $18m range...</p></div>

              <p>New contract talks between <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Joe Cole</span></abbr> have stalled.</p>
              <p>The <em>London Evening Standard</em> says  the stumbling block is not over money but Cole's concerns over whether he will be employed by <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Carlo Ancelotti</span></abbr> as a first-team regular or a squad player.</p>
              <p>The 28-year-old, who has struggled to get back to his best form since
              returning from a serious knee injury in September, would love to stay
              at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> for the rest of his career.</p>
              <p>But it is believed he expressed his anxiety over his role earlier in
              the season when he was an unused substitute in the Champions League tie
              against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Atletico Madrid</span></abbr>.</p>
