              <h1>Has fame gone to Adam Johnson's head after breaking into England squad?</h1>
              <p id="stand-first" class="stand-first-alone">The manager Roberto Mancini addresses first signs of bigheadedness, believing his winger is not the finished article</p>
              <p><img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2010/11/12/1289591291521/Adam-Johnson-Manchester-C-006.jpg" alt="Adam Johnson Manchester City" width="460" height="276"> <br><em>Adam Johnson, the Manchester City winger, has been too easily distracted by the trappings that can affect young players.

              <p><strong>Roberto Mancini</strong><strong> has defended his selective use of Adam Johnson and, breaking his usual rule of not criticising his own players, questioned whether the </strong><strong>Manchester City</strong><strong> winger has allowed the praise he has received from breaking into the </strong><strong>England</strong><strong> side to go to his head. While Johnson has established himself on the left side of Fabio Capello's team, the former Middlesbrough player has started only one of City's past seven Premier League games, with Mancini preferring David Silva, James Milner or Mario Balotelli.</strong></p>
              <p>Mancini, the City manager, has already felt compelled to address what he perceives to be the first signs of bigheadedness affecting Johnson earlier in the season, and the Italian was as critical of him as he has been of any player during his 11 months in Manchester. "England is like Italy, when a young player plays five games very well all the newspapers say: 'Oh, this Adam Johnson is a fantastic player.' But Adam is a young player, he doesn't understand [the game] very well and he can improve a lot more if he thinks more when he plays.</p>
              <p>"He's a good player but he's only 22, he's played only 20 games in the Premier League and it's impossible to think of him now as a top player. He's a good guy, but when you are young and you read the newspapers: 'I am the top, I am the top.' For this, he must work, he must think, he must work for the team; not two dribbles, two crosses. In a top team you need more. If you're doing only two dribbles, you can't be the best player on the pitch. You must score a goal, you must defend, you must help your team-mates. There is more expected of him." That criticism is likely to sting Johnson but Mancini believes the player is too easily distracted by some of the trappings that can affect young players.</p>
              <p>City's coaching staff were unimpressed by his reaction when he was substituted in one match and he has done himself few favours by being one of the players who ended up drinking into the early hours at a student house party in St Andrews during a recent day off, video footage of which was sold to the Sun and has led to a public apology from Gareth Barry, who arranged the trip. "It's important all the players must have good behaviour during the week because we must prepare for every game very well," Mancini said. "He [Johnson] must keep his feet on the floor and he must stay there. It's better for him [not always starting him] if he wants to improve. He's a good player, he has a fantastic talent but he is not a top player at this moment. Maybe he can arrive at the top but the difficulty is to stay there. Adam has a quality to go to the top and stay there but he must improve."</p>
              <p>Johnson has expressed his unhappiness at being left out. "I wouldn't say I'm great with it. I want to be playing all the time but I've got to get on with it. It's a little bit frustrating because I started the season so well, my form was really good, but I tend to find myself on the bench."</p>
