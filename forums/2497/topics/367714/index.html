              <h1 class="titlestory">Man City convinced of signing Chelsea's Terry before Wednesday</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p>John Terry wants talks with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> owner Roman Abramovich about his future.</p>
              <p><em>The Times</em> says <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> believe that a £35 million deal could be reached before the squad fly to South Africa for their pre-season tour on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Terry, the Chelsea captain, has concerns about the club being unable to
              attract a top player this summer, after several failed attempts, and is
              seeking a pay rise of about £20,000 a week, to increase his wage to
              about £150,000 a week — short of what he could earn at City.</p>
              <p>Chelsea want the dispute resolved as soon as possible to avoid
              it becoming an unsavoury backdrop to their pre-season tour. They travel
              to the United States on Thursday and play the Seattle Sounders in the
              first of their friendly matches a week today.</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> captain John Terry was in crisis talks with club owner Roman Abramovich last night, it has been revealed.</p>
              <p>The <em>Sunday Mirror</em> says the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> star met the club’s billionaire owner at the Cobham training ground.</p>
              <p>Terry asked for the chance to hear what Manchester City want to offer him.</p>
              <p>Cash-rich City, funded by their Abu Dhabi United backers, are poised to table a new, third bid for Terry.</p>
              <p>They will put £50million on the table, believing it is the offer Chelsea can’t refuse.</p>
              <p>Chelsea have insisted that 28-year-old Terry will not be sold at any
              price, but yesterday’s meeting with Abramovich could spark a change in
              policy.</p>

              <p>John Terry, the man often described by burbling Sky pundit Jamie Redknapp as a "modern-day gladiator" seems to have got himself involved in some kind of Mexican stand-off between himself, Manchester City and Chelsea. And "JT", the man described as "Mr Chelsea", seems unwilling to go for his gun.</p>
              <p>After a decade as a Blues first-teamer, a public lack of commitment to a cause for which he has regularly kissed the badge is somewhat telling. When latest manager Carlo Ancelotti was unveiled on Monday, he spoke of how Terry was "unsellable" while chief exec Peter Kenyon talked of private assurances from the club captain that he would be staying at Stamford Bridge. Yet still no statement from Terry, golfing in Tenerife until he returns on Thursday but seemingly unable and unwilling to go on the record.</p>
              <p>But what's this? A "source close to" Terry told Thursday's <em>Sun</em> newspaper that the Londoner now feels "betrayed and unwanted" by Chelsea. How so? "It's unbelievable - even though he's the club captain and one of the Blues' most important players, senior management at the club haven't once tried to talk to him.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="a011640more" class="txt">
              <p>"John wants to know what's going on and, more importantly, whether Chelsea actually want to keep him or cash in while they have a chance."</p>
              <p>So, Terry, with some justification, is demanding respect for his achievements with the club. It seems there is an underlying theme. With Manchester City reportedly prepared to put in another bid for him, and, it is rumoured, pay him £300,000 a week then Terry wants to see what Chelsea are prepared to do to keep him. Will they offer him similar cash and a deal to keep him at Stamford Bridge for the rest of his career?</p>
              <p>That seems unlikely and unforthcoming and this is where Terry, by use of those "sources close" is trying to ensure that the crown of Chelsea kingpin is not allowed to slip, even if he does end up earning over a million a month and residing in a well-appointed Cheshire residence with home gym and cinema room.</p>
              <p>Another ingredient is the presence at Manchester City of Wayne Bridge, avowed pal of "JT". Bridge made a January move north to command the type of wages that even Chelsea would not pay him, and it was Terry and Frank "Lampsy" Lampard who helped him celebrate his new gig with a night on the tiles. It included a posh meal, nightclubbing until 4am and then "JT" and "Bridgey" heading to a casino after a night that had already cost thousands. Still, they can afford it.</p>
              <p>City are reported to be gaining confidence of securing their target because of encouragement from Bridge, who, no doubt, wants a pal to hit the bars of Manchester with. Why they are prepared to pay what looks like ending up an astronomical amount is a burning question. Lucio, from Bayern Munich, looks a far more serviceable and cheaper option; perhaps less injury prone too. Yet Mark Hughes, who coincidentally stayed in the same Dubai holiday resort as Terry last week, seems to have his heart set on acquiring him as an on-pitch leader. For City's owners from Abu Dhabi, to lure the England captain would be quite a coup and perhaps, in their eyes, lend an air of indigenous respectability to their "project".</p>
              <p>What of Chelsea? A club steeped in spin and the PR machine, the words of Ancelotti and Kenyon seem designed to challenge Terry to make the first move so that they are not seen as forcing the club's most successful captain out of the door when to do so would actually give them a significant injection into a transfer kitty that is not the bottomless pit of yore.</p>
              <p>The deal, should it happen, would seem to benefit all parties, though it may come at a price to Terry. And that price is pride. The moment that "Mr Chelsea" label was most famously attached to him was by ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley just as Terry took a fateful step towards what could have been a Champions League-winning penalty in Moscow. Terry has yet to bury the ghost of May 21 2008 and to move to Eastlands would negate the chance of that ever being able to happen.</p>
              <p>The fans to who he delivered a tear-drenched apology will not get to see him right that wrong if he moves to City. A public image of being a "fan on the pitch" is one he obviously relishes and will not surrender easily, though a mega wage could soften the blow.</p>
              <p>His next pronouncement is keenly awaited because an exit from Stamford Bridge no longer looks the impossibility it once did.</p>
