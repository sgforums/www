              <p><strong>New Tottenham signing <span style="color: #000000;">Steven Pienaar</span> has claimed it was the club's attractive football that persuaded him to sign for them ahead of Premier League champions Chelsea.</strong></p>
              <p>Having joined from Everton for around £3 million on Tuesday, Pienaar is looking forward to once again linking up with former Ajax team-mate Rafael van der Vaart and becoming a part of the entertaining style of football that manager <span style="color: #000000;">Harry Redknapp</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span>employs at White Hart Lane.</p>
              <p>"The style of football is really important," Pienaar said. "I played with Rafa at Ajax and we played attacking football and I want to be in a team that plays attacking football that is exciting for the supporters to watch.</p>
              <p>"There is a lot of creativity in this Spurs team and a lot of goals in the side. Everyone can score from all over the team so that is important, but also we have to make sure we don't concede.</p>
              <p>"I want to make sure I work hard and fight for a starting place in the team. I know it won't be easy but I am mentally strong to do that. I hope to bring a lot of energy, creativity and of course hard work to the team."</p>
              <p>Pienaar believes Spurs are perfectly positioned to challenge for major silverware this season - particularly in the cups - and hopes that he can make a major contribution towards that, especially in the Champions League.</p>
              <p>"As a player, you want to play in a good team and challenge yourself and that's what I always try to do as an individual," Pienaar said. "Every footballer wants to play in the big games. We are playing AC Milan in the Champions League and I've got some good history against AC Milan.</p>
              <p>"I've scored against them in the Champions League so if I do get an opportunity against them with Spurs, hopefully I'll do the same again. We are not far off first place in the Premier League so I think we've got a good chance to go all the way and win a trophy this season.</p>
              <p>"When you look at the way the team has been playing, they are really serious challengers for the cups, while the run in the Champions League has made a lot of people change their minds about Spurs. This is one of the reasons I decided to join them."</p>
