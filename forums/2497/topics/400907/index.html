              <h1>Nemanja Vidic turns peacemaker as Serbian thugs run riot during

              <p>Manchester
               United defender Nemanja Vidic was cast in the role of peacemaker on
               Sunday as hundreds of Serbia fans went on the rampage during their 
              country’s 1-0 friendly defeat by New Zealand in Austria.</p>
              <p>Stand-in
               captain Vidic picked up a microphone and addressed Serb thugs through 
              the stadium’s PA system in Klagenfurt to appeal for calm after trouble 
              erupted in the second half.</p>

              <p>Flares and missiles were hurled on to the pitch as Serb fans showed 
              their displeasure at their team. Dozens of supporters invaded the 
              playing surface and were engaged in running battles with stewards as 
              players prepared to flee to the dressing room.</p>
              <p>But the plea 
              for order from Vidic, captain in the absence of Dejan 
              Stankovic, appeared to work and the game was restarted having been held 
              up for several minutes.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Security will have to be stepped up when Serbia play Poland in a 
              potential tinderbox of a friendly in Kufstein, Austria, on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>There
               were 10,000 Serbs, mostly expatriates, at Klagenfurt and Austrian 
              officials fear the same number will turn up for the clash against the 
              Poles, whose supporters also have a violent reputation.</p>
              <p>Serbia’s
               experimental line-up were outclassed by the New Zealanders two weeks 
              before the start of the World Cup.</p>
              <p>New Zealand stuck to their
               trademark hard-working approach and it paid dividends when Shane Smeltz
               scored the only goal in the 22nd minute. The striker took a long ball 
              in his stride and beat right-back Antonio Rukavina, one of Serbia’s 
              second-choice starters, before he steered a low shot home.</p>
              <p>The
               Kiwis, led by Blackburn defender Ryan Nelsen, went close again three 
              minutes later when Plymouth striker Rory Fallon saw a thunderous shot 
              parried after he was set up by Smeltz. </p>
              <p>Serbia improved after the 
              break but coach Raddy Antic could draw few 
              positives from the afternoon.</p>

              <p>European champions Spain also 
              struggled to
              beat Saudi Arabia 3-2 in Innsbruck. David Villa and Xabi 
              Alonso were on target, but Spain needed an injury-time winner from 
              substitute Fernando Llorente. Neither Fernando Torres nor Cesc Fabregas 
              played.</p>
              <p>Lukas Podolski, Mario Gomez and Cacau were on target as Germany 
              crushed Hungary 3-0 in Budapest.</p>
              <p>Hull’s Jozy Altidore and 
              Fulham’s Clint Dempsey scored for the United States in a 2-1 win over 
              Turkey in Philadelphia. </p>
