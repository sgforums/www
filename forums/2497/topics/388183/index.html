              struck eight times in his first ten games for the Latics, but was not
              offered a permanent move after then-manager Steve Bruce branded him
              "the most unprofessional [player] I have ever worked with".<br><br>The
              forward repeatedly failed to return on time from international duty,
              but Hull boss Phil Brown will be hoping the Zamalek man can add
              much-needed firepower to the struggling Tigers.<br><br>He is currently sitting out the African Cup of Nations due to injury, but was apparently able to convince the Premier League side of his fitness before signing.<br><br>Tony Pulis' Stoke City had also been in the running for Zaki's services, but appear to have lost out to their counterparts from Humberside.<br><br>Neither club has yet commented on the deal, but the <span class="style2">forward's official website is already decked out in the Tigers' stripes, with the following announcement:<br><br>"Egypt star striker Amr Zaki has moved to Hull City  on loan [for] the rest of the season. <br><br>"Zaki's passed [a] medical test and signed for  [the] Tigers on a five months loan deal.</span>"<br><br>Earlier on Sunday, <strong>Goal.com Arabia</strong> reported that Zaki had told Egyptian newspaper <em>Addustor</em> that he had passed a medical and hoped to "build a new future" at Hull.<br></span></p>
