            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/01_04/092arsenal1_468x532.jpg"><br>Gunning for trouble: Bendtner and Adebayor clash<br><br><strong>Nicklas Bendtner's father accused Emmanuel Adebayor of being 'mad' as the full extent of his son's extraordinary bust-up during Arsenal's 5-1 defeat at Tottenham became clear yesterday.</strong><br><br>Thomas Bendtner, who also acts as his son's agent, waded into the row after Adebayor left the 20-year-old Arsenal striker with a cut on his nose when he apparently butted him during the Carling Cup semi-final defeat at White Hart Lane on Tuesday. Bendtner's father said: "It's sad that a great player like Adebayor doesn't take his head with him on to the field. He was mad. "I'm sure that Arsenal will take care of this and give him the right punishment. I don't expect anything to happen to Nicklas as he is innocent in this matter.<br><br>"I've spoken to Nicklas and he's unaware as to why this happened. He doesn't understand what took place to provoke it because he didn't do anything wrong. If you ask me, he's without guilt as he, unlike others, took his head with him on to the field. I think it would be a good idea for Arsenal to have a long chat with the two players and find out who is really to blame."<br><br>Sportsmail can reveal that the argument began when Bendtner ignored calls from Adebayor, who had made an immediate impact as a substitute by scoring for Arsenal to make it 4-1, to pass the ball.<br><br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/01_04/092arsenal2_468x328.jpg"><br>Angry: Bendtner puts his side of the story to Arsenal captain Gallas<br><br>Bendtner ran down a blind alley and the feud continued on the edge of the penalty area moments later as they prepared for Cesc Fabregas to take a free-kick with seven minutes left. Adebayor and Bendtner then argued about their positioning at the free-kick, with both wanting to take up a near-post position, and the Dane accidentally caught the back of his team-mate's heel, sparking the incredible scenes that resulted in skipper William Gallas having to separate the warring pair.<br><br>Adebayor was held back from another confrontation with the Denmark international after the final whistle, but it is understood that their disagreement later continued in the tunnel. The pair left White Hart Lane separately Â— Adebayor was detained for a routine drugs test while Bendtner set off for the team bus.<br><br>Arsenal's shell-shocked players were given the day off yesterday, but Arsene Wenger is expected to speak to them before training. The Arsenal manager claimed he knew nothing about the incident Â— a familiar, if incredible reaction from the Frenchman. It seems inconceivable that he missed the flare-up, which was witnessed by 36,000 spectators, several television crews and captured by photographers.<br><br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/01_04/092arsenal3_468x329.jpg"><br>Peace maker: Referee Howard Webb steps in<br><br>However, referee Howard Webb told the FA he had not seen the entire incident and they have asked broadcasters to provide them with any relevant television footage. It is not the first time that Bendtner has been involved in controversy and the word in the game is that the striker believes he is better than he is. He clashed with Denmark team-mate Thomas Gravesen when the midfielder told the striker to do 10 press-ups as a punishment for losing the ball.<br><br>He spent last season on loan at Birmingham and, according to sources at St Andrew's, he upset some of the club's established players with his co.ckiness. He is clearly not short of confidence and is understood to have irritated some members of the Arsenal first team this season, too.<br><br>Bendtner threatened to quit the club when he returned from his loan spell unless he was given a run in the team. He scored his first Barclays Premier League goal within seconds of arriving as a substitute in the derby against Tottenham in December, but remains on the fringes of the first team.<br><br>Despite doubts among the Arsenal coaching staff about Bendtner's prospects of reaching the very highest level, Wenger is impressed by the player's incredible confidence in his own ability. He said recently: With 95 per cent of players, you have to convince them that they have the quality needed to go to the top. The other five per cent come to you and tell you that they should be in the team because they are the best players in the world.<br><br>"Their egos are so big, but I won't sign anyone who doesn't think they can be stars. I only want to help players who want to be a success and you can assess that at 18." That applies to Bendtner, but he showed an aggressive streak when he was sent off at Everton before Christmas. His relationship with his team-mates was hinted at in Adebayor's reference to 'togetherness' in a half-hearted apology, issued by the club last night.<br><br>The Togo striker said: "Overall, I think that we should have been more calm during the game and although I was pleased to get a goal for the team when I came on, I am sorry for the disagreement with my team-mate Nicklas. "We are both passionate about this club and sometimes that can be projected in the wrong way. It was a mistake. We want to focus on the games ahead and rely on our squad's great togetherness to achieve a fantastic season."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Smells like team spirit - when things are so bad, you hit your own club-mates</span><br><br>Arsenal duo Nicklas Bendnter and Emanuel Adebayor may be the most recent team-mates to clash during a game - but they are not the first and won't be the last. Here Sportsmail charts some of the more famous on-pitch, inter-club punch-ups... </strong><br><br><strong>Nicklas Bendtner v Emmanuel Adebayor (Arsenal, 2008.)</strong><br><br>With Arsene Wenger's team 4-1 down against north London rivals Tottenham, Arsenal's famous team spirit was sadly lacking. The strikers started bickering in the Spurs box before Adebayor appeared to headbutt the forget the infamous Wes20-year-old Dane. Wenger's reaction? He didn't see it of course!<br><br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/01_04/DyerBowyer_468x436.jpg"><br><br><strong>Kieron Dyer v Lee Bowyer (Newcastle, 2005) </strong><br><br>With Newcastle 3-0 down at home to Aston Villa, the pair exchanged a series of punches before Gareth Barry intervened. Graeme Souness forced his players to publicly apologise - although they refused to say sorry to each other. West Ham obviously admired their fighting qualities and brought them both to Upton Park.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOJuwuHX8tE" rel="nofollow">Â• Watch the Toon ragers here</a><br><br><strong>Stuart McCall v Andy Myers (Bradford, 2001) </strong><br><br>These two cam to blows during the Bantams' 6-1 demolition at the hands of Leeds United at Elland Road. Bradford captain McCall had to have stitches in a facial wound after Myers struck him just before half-time at Elland Road. McCall then seemed to aim a head-butt at the central defender, but missed.<br><br><strong>David Batty v Graeme Le Saux (Blackburn, 1995) </strong><br><br>Much to the annoyance of Batty, Le Saux took the ball off his teammate, miscontrolled it and conceded a throw-in at Spartak Moscow in the Champions League. Le Saux struck the first blow, breaking his hand in the process. It wasn't long before Batty was sold to Kevin Keegan's title-chasing Newcastle.<br><br><strong>Craig Levein v Graeme Hogg (Hearts, 1994)</strong><br><br>Levein didn't take too kindly to Hogg's criticism of him during pre-season friendly against Raith. Levein broke Hogg's nose, a brawl ensued and both players were given their marching orders - Hogg while he was on a stretcher. The pair received lengthy bans - 14 games for Levein and ten for Hogg.<br><br><strong>Stan Collymore v Trevor Benjamin (Leicester, 2000) </strong><br><br>The pair started arguing during the first half of a reserve team game against Charlton and took their disagreement into the dressing room. The row became so heated that they actually came to blows and Collymore refused to come out for the second-half. The incident hastened Collymore's departure from Filbert Street.<br><br><strong>Steve McManaman v Bruce Grobbelaar (Liverpool, 1993)</strong><br><br>Eccentric keeper Grobbelaar was indignant when McManaman hit a weak clearance that gifted Everton the lead in the Merseyside derby. Grobbelaar, one of the Anfield side's most experienced players at the time, castigated the young winger, who responded by yelling back at him. Grobbelaar grabbed his team-mate by the throat and pushed him away. McManaman wisely decided that enough was enough and swiftly walked away.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFqYv27kHc8" rel="nofollow">Â• Watch the Mersey beat here</a><br><br><strong>Mike Flanagan v Derek Hales (Charlton, 1979)</strong><br><br>Both players saw red as frustrations boiled over in FA Cup tie against non-league Maidstone. Flanagan was exonerated, but Hales was sacked. The law forced Charlton to reinstate him and Flanagan was promptly sold to Crystal Palace before returning to the Valley for an unexpected reunion with Hales.<br><br>With little time left in their FA Cup tie with Maidstone, Mike Flanagan hesitated before putting Derek Hales through on goal and his Charlton team-mate was caught offside. Hales remonstrated with Flanagan and threw the first punch as the pair went toe-to-toe. Both were sent off, but Charlton exonerated Flanagan and sacked Hales.They later had to reinstate him.<br><br></div>

The Denmark forward refused to back down, apologise or accept responsibility for what he believes was an unprovoked butt from Adebayor, which left him with a bruised and bloodied nose during the 5-1 drubbing.<br><br>Adebayor, who in his apology on Wednesday blamed 'passion' for his 'mistake', also explained his version of events to Wenger, who called off today's scheduled press conference, where the issue was sure to have been top of the agenda.<br><br>The FA's decision to take no action will infuriate Chelsea, who have made no secret that they feel victimised by the FA. They have been fined twice this season for failing to control their players and put together their own DVD of offences by rival clubs which have gone unpunished.<br><br>Two players who may also be surprised are Spurs midfielder Tom Huddlestone, sent off and banned for three games for a head butt on Reading's Bobby Convey, and Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo, dismissed for an attempted head-butt at Portsmouth'.<br><br>The let-off will be an enormous relief to Wenger, however, who could ill afford to lose top scorer Adebayor for three games at a time when Robin van Persie is injured and other key players are away on Africa Cup of Nations duty.<br><br>Arsenal will only allow Theo Walcott to go out on loan to a Barclays Premier League rival if the 18-year-old is guaranteed a striking role.<br><br>Championship promotion challengers Stoke City have made an inquiry.<br><br></div>
