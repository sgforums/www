              <p><strong>Tottenham Hotspur are planning to construct their own version of the Kop, a massive single-tier stand in a new development which could also be one of the showpiece new venues for World Cup 2018.</strong></p>
              <p>The North London club announced their ambitious new stadium plans with the "inclusion of new 63 row single-tier stand", which Spurs suggests "responds to club desire to create the most atmospheric stadium in Europe." </p>
              <p>Spurs have lodged planning application with Haringey Council for a "world class stadium" that will also include a public square, hotel, supermarket, homes and space for the Tottenham Hotspur Foundation. The new super stadium is on the current site and adjacent land, "ending concerns about a move out of the Borough with no need for even a temporary move during construction".</p>
              <p>The existing 36,000 capacity stadium has remained unchanged for over a decade and the club is currently in the position of having over 70,000 registered club members and a waiting list for season tickets of more than 23,000 people. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy said: "The submission of the application is a hugely important step for the club. This is a multi-million pound investment in the area which brings with it housing, retail, a hotel, a supermarket, expanded community services and jobs and an exceptional public square.</p>
              <p>"We have designed what will be a vibrant area 365 days a year and not a stadium with dead space surrounding it. Our desire from the outset has been to create a scheme of major benefit for local people and to deliver the most fan-friendly stadium in Europe. The inclusion of a new single tier stand combined with a fantastic stadium design demonstrates our absolute commitment to create the most atmospheric stadium for our supporters.</p>

              <p><em>The north of the existing White Hart Lane stadium will be demolished first</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>"Every fan will have an exceptional view of the action and will find themselves closer to the pitch than at any other comparable stadium.</strong></p>
              <p>Spurs aim to be a host ground for England's bid for the 2018 World Cup and Andy Anson, chief executive of England 2018, said: "Tottenham Hotspur Football Club's provisional designs for their new stadium are very impressive. Potential England 2018 Host Cities will deliver their final bid submissions to us in November and we fully expect the stadium to be one of those included as a potential host venue for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bid. We wish the club every success with their plans."</p>
              <p>The plans submitted also include a new club museum and 434 new homes. Spurs will sell naming rights for the stadium, which would rival Arsenal in terms of size, with the Emirates Stadium holding 60,000.</p>

              <p><strong>The cost of the project is estimated to be in the region of the £400million </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Arsenal </strong></span><strong>spent on Emirates Stadium and it could take up to five years to complete.</strong></p>
              <p>As the plans (left) for the new ground show <span style="font-weight: bold;">(1)</span>, once finished it will include what the club term important public space <span style="font-weight: bold;">(2) </span>for match-day activities; new offices <span style="font-weight: bold;">(3)</span> for use by the Tottenham Hotspur Foundation; club museum <span style="font-weight: bold;">(4)</span>; supermarket <span style="font-weight: bold;">(5)</span>; 500 new homes <span style="font-weight: bold;">(6)</span> and improvements to the High Road <span style="font-weight: bold;">(7)</span>.</p>
              <p>Spurs chairman Daniel Levy said: 'We believe that this scheme has the<br>potential to create a truly inspirational environment for the club and the community as well as acting as the catalyst for the uplift of the wider area.'</p>
              <p>The plan also claims that the 'transport infrastructure is already in place' around White Hart Lane and is able to cope with 90,000 passengers an hour on match days.</p>
