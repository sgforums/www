            <div class='col-md body'>they are definitely more challenging. thats why even smaller club can take away points from them. unlike epl where big clubs are expected to win against the lesser clubs which they do 95% of the time. i don think theres any dropping in standard but rather some of they clubs have improved quicker and better than the rest</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think La Liga is more technical and perhaps more skillful.<br><br>however, not as entertaining as EPL in that it is much faster, and more goals.<br><br>just wonder if Eto got racially abused, what about Henry? Didn't he said he won't join?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>la liga is more challenging....even small clubs like recreativo and levante can sign quite big names players like olivier kapo, javier portillo, kalu uche, simama pongolle........<br><br>and small clubs can sign those quality south americans at cheap cheap prices.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
