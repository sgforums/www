              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez has gone to war with yet
              another Premier League manager, after accusing Everton of negative
              tactics during their FA Cup Fourth Round draw on Sunday.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Benitez was unhappy with the Toffees' approach during the 1-1 draw
              at Anfield - the second in a week following a similar stalemate in the
              Premier League.</p>
              <p>"One team was trying to win and the other team was trying not to
              lose," Benitez said. "They were coming for a draw, we were trying to
              win. It is hard against a team with 10 players always behind the ball.
              I have never played like that here."</p>
              <p>Everton boss David Moyes, on the other hand, was pleased with his
              team's performance, rejecting Rafa's accusations that the Blues - who
              took the lead through Joleon Lescott -  had played for a replay.</p>
              <p>"I have never gone anywhere looking for a draw," he said. "I may
              have taken one in the end. We had a lot of players out and Liverpool
              had all their players available. We did not have the physical
              capabilities within what we had to do anything different."</p>
              <p>Before kick-off, Moyes had attempted to stir up an already fragile
              Benitez by hinting that at least he had control at his club, unlike the
              Liverpool gaffer.</p>
              <p>"The chairman and me make decisions," he said. "The chairman would
              never do anything without my agreement. It’s important for managers to
              have control. It is something you earn by how you work within the club
              and how you deal with people.</p>
              <p>"We do things with a bit of dignity here at Everton. Liverpool is a
              great football club but Everton do things with dignity and style."</p>
              <p>Tension between the two bosses stretches back a year, after Benitez
              branded Everton a ‘small club’ prior to a 0-0 draw at Anfield.</p>
              <p>And after Rafa’s recent rant against Sir Alex Ferguson, it appears
              the Reds boss isn't overly concerned with making friends among his his
              fellow managers as Liverpool aim to secure the Premier League title for
              the first time.</p>
