              <p><strong>No1: Derby (2008)</strong></p>
              <p>The Rams top this list because they look incapable of earning the further five points that would ensure they did not equal Sunderland’s record. Credit must go to Billy Davies for promoting Derby in the first place, while his replacement Paul Jewell arrived too late to stop the rot. But they have never looked anything near a Premier League side.</p>
              <p>  </p>
              <p><strong>No2: Sunderland (2006)</strong></p>
              <p>Who would have thought this record of just 15 points would ever come under serious threat? Sunderland were absolutely awful as they plunged towards the Championship and the fans felt relief rather than anger when the season was over. Roy Keane has now restored pride on Wearside.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No3: Sunderland (2003)</strong></p>
              <p>The Black Cats are arguably the worst team in the Premier League’s history thanks to two dreadful campaigns in three years. The first came in 2003 when Mick McCarthy’s side grabbed just 19 points – the first team to finish below 20 points. Sadly for the fans, deeper embarrassment was to come.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No4: Ipswich (1995)</strong></p>
              <p>Swindon’s stint in the Premiership was soon in the shadows thanks to Ipswich’s desperate season. Not only did they muster just 27 points from 42 matches, they suffered a humiliating 9-0 defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford - a record Premiership loss.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No5: Leicester (1995)</strong></p>
              <p>Leicester may not have finished bottom but just 29 points from 42 games demonstrated their woeful season. It took the Foxes three consecutive play-off finals to reach the top-flight but the fans were left wondering whether it was worth the wait. Luckily for them, Martin O’Neill’s arrival was imminent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No6: Watford (2000)</strong></p>
              <p>When your biggest summer signing is £950,000 flop Nordin Wooter, you can expect trouble on the horizon. Graham Taylor worked miracles to move Watford into the Premiership in the first place but when they got there, the Hornets were shown up for their distinct lack of quality. Just 24 points came their way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No7: Bradford (2001)</strong></p>
              <p>After surviving relegation with just 34 points in the previous season, Bradford’s fans should have seen it coming. Despite big-name arrivals such as Stan Collymore and Benito Carbone, the Bantams finished with just 26 points. They now sit three divisions below the Premier League</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No8: West Brom (2003)</strong></p>
              <p>West Brom were lucky to have such an inept team as Sunderland below them to disguise their own poor season, in which just 26 points were won. The Baggies made an instant exit from the top-flight under boss Gary Megson, who is now battling to keep Bolton in the Premier League.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No9: Swindon (1994)</strong></p>
              <p>Swindon are often harshly regarded as the worst ever team in the history of the Premier League. They did manage to notch 30 points – admittedly from the 42 games played each season up until 1996 – but that total was largely down to the heroics of Jan-Aage Fjortoft.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No10: Watford (2007)</strong></p>
              <p>Aidy Boothroyd is one of the brightest young managers in the game but even he was unable to save Watford from this season to forget. The Hornets’ cause was not helped by Marlon King’s season-long injury and Ashley Young’s departure to Aston Villa but they still only managed 28 points.</p>
