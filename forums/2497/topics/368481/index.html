              <h2>HUGHES REJECTS FERGIE CRITICISM</h2>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p>Manchester City manager Mark Hughes has rebuffed criticism from Sir Alex Ferguson over the club's spending this summer.</p>
              <p>City's latest signing was Carlos Tevez, who spent the last two
              seasons under Ferguson at Manchester United, on whom they spent
              Â£26.5million.</p>
              <p>Ferguson described City's spending this year as "stupid" and "unrealistic".</p>
              <p>But Hughes said: "We haven't had the benefit of Champions League
              money over a long period and we haven't had the success to generate the
              large amounts of money.</p>
              <p>"All the squads and managers have spent large amounts to be
              successful. That has never changed. We are trying to be successful and,
              to do that, we have to spend money.</p>
              <p>"We understand how people may view us at this time, when times are hard financially for a lot of people.</p>
              <p>"But football sometimes bucks that trend, almost always, certainly at the top level."</p>
              <p>Hughes also rejected suggestions City had paid over the odds for Tevez.</p>
              <p>"I think in this current age, and given some of the other
              transfers this summer, notably Ronaldo to Real Madrid, Carlos will
              prove a bargain," he said.</p>
              <p>Hughes cannot wait for the new season to get started.</p>
              <p>The August 15 trip to his old club Blackburn cannot come quickly
              enough as the football world, and City's long-suffering fans in
              particular, wait to discover whether England's big-spenders can match
              the hype surrounding them.</p>
              <p>"I know I am a little bit deadpan at times but I do get excited," smiled Hughes.</p>
              <p>"This is probably the first season when, after a break, I have been really looking forward to getting back.</p>
              <p>"You feel a little bit drained after a long hard season and
              usually wish you could have a couple more weeks but myself and all my
              staff couldn't wait to get back and get stuck in again."</p>
              <p>Little wonder either given the players Hughes will have at his disposal.</p>
              <p>But, in all probability, there will be more new faces but before
              defensive reinforcements have been brought in, skipper Richard Dunne is
              also being linked with Sunderland.</p>
              <p>However, as he landed in South Africa at the start of a
              three-match tour, Hughes dismissed suggestions he was about to offload
              his captain.</p>
              <p>"There has been interest in Richard which is to be expected
              because he is a good player," Hughes told the club's official website.</p>
              <p>"But I have spoken to him already and it is not something on which we are going to dwell.</p>
              <p>"We are looking to strengthen all areas and people make
              assumptions that maybe players we are after will have an effect on
              those who are already here.</p>
              <p>"But we want to make sure the squad is stronger than it was last season."</p>
