              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> chief David Gill doesn't expect manager <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> to buy again this summer market.</p>
              <p>He told <em>MUTV</em>: "We’re not in the market for paying a lot
              of money for players who are 27, 28 or 29. We don’t think it’s good
              value. That would be their last contract and at the end of that
              contract they won’t be worth a lot of money. We’re happy to pay
              significant sums of money for players up to the age of about 25.</p>
              <p>"We’re pleased at the moment with the squad we have and a
              number of young boys are coming through – we have high hopes for
              Federico Macheda and Danny Welbeck. We’ve also bought in Valencia,
              Obertan and Diouf from Molde. He’ll join up with us in January.</p>
              <p>"That’s where we’re at, although it’s worth reiterating that
              people should trust Sir Alex when it comes to what the squad needs.
              Just because we have a lot of money in the bank, it doesn’t mean we
              have to spend it."</p>

              <p>Errr... The word here is, "we are not in the market for paying a lot of money for players who are 27, 28 or 29."... It does not mean they won't buy players that age, just that they find it not worthy to buy a players like for example Villa, coming to 28 yrs old at $40m... Cos after 3, 4 yrs contract, he is almost worthless in the transfer market... Meaning you can't expect to get any return on him...</p>
              <p>But buying players reaching their 30s or over 30s is still not discounted only not with such a high transfer fee... Perhaps those under the $10m range are still acceptable like Henry, RVN, Trezeguet...</p>
              <p>United have alway got some experienced players in regardless of their age, only thing is the price... Is it worthwhile? Laurent Blanc came when he was like 35, 36... Larsson and Van Der Sar both joint when they were like 34 or 35... These are all good bits of business cos they didn't cost alot and yet contributed much... This season they got Michael Owen for practically nothing... A player like him would have cost around $10m last season and considering the market right now, its a great piece of business... He is even willing to take a pay cut somemore...</p>
              <p>Arsenal are rumour to be keen on Patrick Vieira... If he is free or below $4m, I don't see why not. It could give them an experienced head in difficult periods... Something they don't have much of at present.</p>
              <p>So signing older players isn't a bad thing, only the price must be worthy thats all...</p>
