              <div>Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez has hailed the clinic that has got four of his top men fit for Saturday's crunch Premier League encounter with Manchester City.</div>
              <p>Benitez defended the use of a controversial Serbian clinic to get
              Glen Johnson, Fabio Aurelio, Yossi Benayoun and Albert Riera all fit.</p>
              <p>The Belgrade clinic is run by physiotherapist Mariana Kovacevic, and
              the unusual treatment involves massaging with a placenta cream.</p>
              <p>All four are now in contention for the visit of Manchester City, and
              Tuesday's vital Champions League clash with Debrecen which has clearly
              buoyed the Reds boss.</p>
              <p>"We knew of other players at Premier League clubs who have been to
              Belgrade for treatment with this lady, and we were made aware that it
              was very effective," Benitez told the <em>Press Association</em>.</p>
              <p>"[Manchester City's Pablo] Zabaleta told Riera about it.</p>
              <p>"She [Kovacevic] has been working for seven years with top-class sportsmen, not just footballers. So she has the experience.</p>
              <p>"We felt it was a good opportunity to send some of our players. We
              sent two, Benayoun and Riera and they came back and started training
              straight away.</p>
              <p>"So we decided to send two more, Johnson and Aurelio, and the same
              thing has happened. They have been training and all four will be in the
              squad against City.</p>
              <p>"Arsenal's Robin van Persie went earlier, but now there are several
              more top players who are going to have treatment in the same way.</p>
              <p>"City have sent two, [Vincent] Kompany and Zabaleta beforehand, and they were playing within days.</p>
              <p>"There have been no injections, it is a placenta cream applied with a [massage] machine that creates waves of pressure."</p>
              <p>He added: "We sent our players, and Van Persie was there. Kompany
              and Zabaleta have also been there, and we have been made aware of the
              success of this treatment over several years.</p>
              <p>"Many top players have been going there for seven years, it has been successful and I believe it is safe.</p>
              <p>"It is good for specific injuries, doctors have explained the
              treatment and the components of the cream that is used. We are happy
              with it.</p>
              <p>"We checked it out when we became aware of the different players who
              had been there. I must admit we have been surprised with how well it
              has worked.</p>
              <p>"It means we have players available and training that we expected to
              be out for several weeks. Can we guarantee that they are fully fit? We
              will see, but they have trained with the rest of the team for three
              days and they are OK."</p>

              <p>yes.like what you've said-"a broken bone means broken bone. A burst blood vessel means a burst blood vessel"</p>
              <p>which means it takes time to heal right?</p>
              <p>i guess the placenta treatment speeds up recovery process??furthermore,the injuries incured by the players are just some muscle strain/tear.not broken bones.</p>
              <p>so yah lah.i dont think clubs delibrately fake it to hold back their stars.</p>

              <p>but even though there might really be no use at all... can still go for it one... because if the players believe that it will help them, then this treatment will help them psychologically, and may speed up their normal recovery rate because their mentally believing that they feel better after the placenta treatment.</p>
              <p>This kind of effect is called the placebo effect - giving a person a mock drug which he takes and thinks that he was given the actual drug.</p>
