              <p class="small bold"><em>MARK'S SET GO? ... Hughes on the brink at City</em></p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">MARK HUGHES is fighting for his Manchester City future as the club’s superstar Brazilians turn against him.</h2>
              <p class="article">City lost 2-1 at home to Spurs yesterday and SunSport can reveal the club’s mega-rich Arab owners are already talking about replacing the Welshman before the January transfer window.</p>
              <p class="article">They are also aware that star players like Robinho are unhappy. The £32.5m striker, Elano and Jo are said to dislike Hughes’ management style and would be happy to see him go.</p>
              <p class="article">Jose Mourinho has been tipped to replace Hughes but he would be unlikely to take the job now having only joined Inter Milan in the summer. Hughes met his board before the Spurs game to discuss transfer targets but the manager and his bosses have different plans.</p>
              <p class="article">While Hughes is looking to players like Blackburn’s Roque Santa Cruz, the Arabs would prefer bigger names. Hughes said: “The chairman was round my house last night to talk about where we want to take the club and it was all very positive.”</p>
              <p class="article">But a source close to the owners said last night: “Hughes has not got long. Even if he had beaten Spurs his job was in jeopardy — now losing has taken him to the edge.”</p>
              <p class="article">Executive chairman Garry Cook’s job is also on the line as the Arab owners were surprised to discover that he is on a salary of £1.5m a year, which is one of the highest for that position in the Premier League.</p>

              <h1>Mourinho moves to cool City link</h1>
              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho
              has rejected talk linking him with a return to the Premier League with
              mega-rich Manchester City.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The former Chelsea boss, now
              in charge of Serie A giants Inter Milan, was reported by a national
              newspaper to be in the frame to replace Mark Hughes at Eastlands.</p>
              <p>With City now under the control of the Abu Dhabi United Group
              there had been suggestions that the former Blackburn boss' position
              could be under threat.</p>
              <p>But chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak insisted on Monday that there
              were no plans to replace Hughes and that he would be given more money
              to spend in the January transfer window.</p>
              <p>Mourinho enjoyed great success with Chelsea after moving to
              England from Porto, before parting company with the Stamford Bridge
              club in September last year.</p>
              <p>He spent several months out of the game, being linked with a
              number of leading jobs, before eventually joining Inter in the summer
              following Roberto Mancini's departure.</p>
              <p>And while the Portuguese tactician makes no secret of the
              impression left on him by the Premier League, he is focused solely on
              his role at the San Siro.</p>
              <p>Mourinho told Sky Sports:  "Everybody knows I love English football, but everybody also knows I am Inter Milan coach."</p>
