            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Premiership round-up: United and Chelsea win</strong><br><br>Wayne Rooney hit a hat-trick as Manchester United destroyed third-placed Bolton at the Reebok. United's return to the Premiership summit began with a Wayne Rooney brace early in the first-half. The young striker first hit a left-footed drive past Jaaskelainen after 10 minutes and then curled in a shot from twenty yards. Ronaldo rolled the ball in to an open net for the third before Rooney collected the match ball with a right-foot drive, underlining emphatically his recent return to form.<br><br>In the game's early kick-off Chelsea had resumed their equivalent of musical chairs with Manchester United by briefly returning to the top of the table after a hard fought win over Sheffield United. Goals from Ballack, Lampard and a penalty save - United's third miss from the spot this season - by Chelsea's third choice keeper Hilario saw off the wholehearted Blades challenge at Bramall Lane.<br><br>Portsmouth seized the three points from Reading at Fratton Park but it was an own goal from Gunnarsson, under pressure from the lively Kanu, which gave them the lead. Kanu then showed great skill to set up Benjani Mwaruwari who missed an absolute sitter from close range. The same player was guilty of another bad miss in the second half, but Kanu compensated for his strike partners deficiencies in front of goal with a headed second before Pedro Mendes wrapped up the points. Kevin Doyle hit a late consolation for Reading.<br><br>Tim Cahill hit another vital strike as he belted the first goal of the game in Everton's clash with Arsenal at the Emirates. Tim Howard made a fine save to deny Thierry Henry but Cahill then came close to doubling the Everton lead at the other end. Theo Walcott came on in the second half and Arsenal responded almost immediately when Robin Van Persie netted his fourth of the season to share the points. David Moyes was sent to the stand in the last minute for complaining to the referee.<br><br>Aston Villa's unbeaten run to the season came to an abrupt halt as Liverpool put three past them in the first half. Peter Crouch set up Dirk Kuyt to volley home the first before the big England striker hit the second. Luis Garcia ended the game before half-time, tucking the ball under Thomas Sorenson. Martin O'Neill rang the changes at half-time and substitute Chris Sutton, on for juan Pablo Angel, set up Gabriel Agbonlahor but there was to be no comeback for Villa.<br><br>Watford and Spurs shared the points at Vicarage Road. The home side made a lively start to the match, forcing three corners in the first two minutes and coming close to opening the scoring through Darius Henderson and Tommy Smith. Ben Foster again looked sharp in the Watford goal denying Aaron Lennon three times. In the second-half, Ledley King should have opened the scoring when he got on the end of a Jermaine Jenas free-kick but he was unable to hit the target. Watford are still without a win but the point was enough to get them out of the relegation zone.<br><br>Wigan and Fulham played out an entertaining game at Craven Cottage and it was Paul Jewell's men who went home with the points. Denny Landzaat was given the chance to open the scoring when Wigan were awarded a controversial penalty but he hit the crossbar with his effort. Luckily for Wigan Henri Camara was on hand to give them the lead, and the points, with a late strike. Brian McBride had an effort saved by new Wigan signing Chris Kirkland and the Latics held on for their first away win since March.</div>
