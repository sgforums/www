              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ARSENAL have become the first Champions League side to have NO shots at goal during a game.</h2>
              <p>That damning fact has emerged for Arsene Wenger's side following their 3-1 defeat at Barcelona on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Stats gurus Opta have kept detailed records for eight years and the Gunners have recorded a miserable new low.</p>
              <p>An Opta spokesman said: "There have been 981 Champions League games since 2003-04 and Arsenal are the first of 1,962 sides not to manage a shot of any form in a match since then."</p>
              <p>It is an amazing statistic which confirms Arsenal's lack of ambition - before and after having Robin van Persie sent off for time-wasting in the second half.</p>
              <p>Wenger tried to blame Swiss ref Massimo Busacca for the defeat after Van Persie's controversial 55th-minute red card.</p>
              <p>But Barca's ex-Liverpool star Javier Mascherano told Wenger to stop being 'stupid' - and to give Barca the praise they deserve for their display.</p>
              <p>Mascherano said: "It was very strange to me that it was 1-1 at one stage even though they didn't have a shot.</p>
              <p>"Wenger knows how the game went but defeat is tough and nobody wants to be out of the competition.</p>
              <p>"Our team has not achieved as much as it has thanks to the refs, we can't be hypocrites or stupid. Barca win because they play well not because of the refs.</p>
              <p>"Wenger has every right to his opinion but the stats say that it would have been very unfair if we hadn't qualified."</p>
              <p>Arsenal's only effort on target came from a Barca player Sergio Busquets, whose own goal just after half-time gave the visitors hope.</p>

He wants to emulate fergie like in terms of fergie's fledelings? Well but still he needs a roy keane, a dwight yorke and andy cole before he can go further. Oh, not forgetting a schmeichel who has all the luck in the world stopping shots because he's so good.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know that Liverpool is below Arsenal now in the premier league table but the new coach, Kenny just came in.  Please wait and see the improvement in the table as the league progress towards the end.   Changing of coaches and players are part of the game.  You just cannot depend on the same players or coach in the team.  Look at our Lions, the  team has been disbanded but not the coach.  It is a mistake that FAS do not realise.</div>

              <p>Wenger may be fault for not winning any trophies in 5.5 yrs but we can't fault the guy for consistently keeping Arsenal amongst the top 4 clubs despite spending a lot lesser than Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Also between both clubs, Arsenal have made a handsome profit year after year compare to the loss Pool have these last few seasons... Just this season alone, I think Kenny have spent more than what Wenger have in the last 3 seasons at Arsenal...lol. Pool have spent more than $70m already while Arsenal under $20m i think... All these are down to Wenger's abilities. You have to give credit to the guy for this...</p>
              <p>Like I said long ago, the Arsenal board are more interested on making profits as it's a shareholding company rather than a normal football club. The directors are more interested in seeing revenue increase than trophies. But if the can get the odd one or two, I guess they will be happy.</p>
