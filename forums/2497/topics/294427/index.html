The Arsenal boss joked he could be smuggled into the Emirates for the Champions League clash against Steaua Bucharest on December 12 after a UEFA ban. </strong><br><br>It was alleged that ex-Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho used a laundry basket to get into the Stamford Bridge dressing room before a Champions League quarter-final against Bayern Munich in 2005. Like Mourinho, Wenger has been barred from the dug-out and dressing room after clashing with the officials in the 3-1 loss to Seville on Wednesday. Wenger said: Â“We will first try to improve the size of our laundry basket.<br><br>Â“I was surprised first of all that I was sent off for what I said. Â“ItÂ’s like if the speed limit is 60mph, sometimes you are not caught driveing 70mph and sometimes you are caught when you drive 61. I drove 60-and-a-half mph.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m not saying IÂ’m an angel but IÂ’ve done much worse than that. Â“At the end of the day I know what IÂ’ve done. I know I havenÂ’t done a lot Â— but I wonÂ’t appeal. Â“IÂ’m like everybody. There are periods when I am nervous and explode a bit quicker but, overall, I try to control it.<br><br><strong>Sits in the stands</strong><br><br>Â“I said to the officials it was naive to give Daniel Alves time to waste that time. I said Â‘I bet with you he will sprint in two minutesÂ’. It was less than two minutes.Â” Wenger is unlikely to be hiding inside any baskets for the final Champions League group game but he will easily get round the ruling as he sits in the stands.<br><br>He said: Â“You can always communicate with the bench. You know, it is a very artificial rule. Â“If I talk to the guy next to me he can communicate with the bench.Â” The ban could be extended in a disciplinary hearing on December 13 Â— the day after the Steaua clash.<br><br>The Arsenal boss was sent from the technical area in Seville for arguing with Belgian ref Eric Braamhaar. But he ignored the fourth officialÂ’s orders to go to the stands and watched from the tunnel. Yesterday, Wenger opened a sports site in Islington with local youngsters on behalf of Barclays Spaces for Sports.<br><br>And he revealed that Cesc Fabregas is out of tomorrowÂ’s trip to Aston Villa and WednesdayÂ’s game at Newcastle after picking up a hamstring injury in Seville. Wenger said: Â“We are pessimistic for him. He has no chance for next week.Â”<br><br></div>
