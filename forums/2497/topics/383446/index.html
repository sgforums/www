              <p>Drogba celebrates with Lampard as Chelsea run riot at the Emirates Stadium<br><br></p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">DIDIER DROGBA has taunted Chelsea's title rivals, saying: "We have the team to stay at the top. Catch us if you can."</h2>
              <p class="article">The Blues superstar believes the Premier League leaders know how to turn it on when it really matters. When the chips are down Chelsea's big names deliver. That is why they are five points clear of Manchester United at the top of the table. And that is how they cut Arsenal to pieces in the Gunners' own back yard on Sunday to leave them 11 points behind.</p>
              <p class="article">Drogba, 31, was quick to pile the pressure on Manchester United and the rest of the chasing pack following Chelsea's fifth successive League win. He said: "I think we have the team to stay ahead of all the others.</p>
              <p class="article">"Yes, it's not enough to be five points clear. It's a good gap but we have to keep winning our games. "But you know when you're top of the League it's good because you only concentrate on yourself. There's no teams on top of you.</p>
              <p class="article">"They have to chase you, they have to produce more and have to do more to win games. So it's good for us."</p>
              <p class="article">Carlo Ancelotti's Blues proved they are stronger than the Gunners both physically <strong>AND</strong> mentally and it is the way they exposed Arsenal's vulnerable underbelly that will hurt the North Londoners most.</p>
              <p class="article">Drogba has now scored nine times in 10 games against Arsene Wenger's side, but the Ivory Coast superstar insisted that Arsenal are not scared of him. Yet his assessment of what created such a gulf in class between the two teams will trouble Arsenal.</p>
              <p class="article">Drogba said: "No, no, no, they're not scared of me because they play their game. But I think we were strong. "We were stronger than them. "Every time we had the chance to score we did it. We took our chances and I think physically we defended well. "We were really strong mentally as well.</p>
              <p class="article">"I don't know about Arsenal, but our strength is that we are able to switch it on when it mattered. Even against Manchester United, when the game was really difficult, we won it.</p>
              <p class="article">"We know how to go through difficult periods, difficult times. "When the game is hard, we know that when you get a chance it's important to score."</p>
              <p class="article">Gunners boss Wenger amazingly claimed Drogba did not do much during Sunday's derby showdown. Well, the Frenchman was right apart from...an awesome display and two magnificent goals.</p>
              <p class="article">The result extended Chelsea's astonishing run in London derbies to eight successive wins, in which they have conceded just three goals.</p>
              <p class="article">Meanwhile Frank Lampard hailed Ashley Cole's performance and insisted the England left-back rammed the abuse he received down the throats of his Arsenal tormentors.</p>
              <p class="article">The boo-boys let 'Cashley' have it throughout the game at the Emirates - as they cannot forget or forgive the way he left Arsenal to join Chelsea in 2006. Yet Cole responded with two crosses that led to Chelsea's first two goals and killed off the tie as a contest.</p>
