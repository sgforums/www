            <div class='col-md body'><strong>King wary of threat posed by Drogba</strong><br><br>Tottenham captain Ledley King admits he will have to be on top form to get the better of Chelsea striker Didier Drogba at White Hart Lane. Drogba, who on Friday signed a new four-year deal at Stamford Bridge, has 10 goals this season but has earned a reputation for going to ground easily.<br><br>"Hes in great form at the moment," said King, 26, ahead of Sundays clash. "Ive played against him a few times and I recognise him as a great player. I enjoy playing against his style of play, so it should be good."<br><br>He added: "Hes a clever player, there are clever players around who wait for a bit of contact and go down. Im not really thinking about though. Youve just got to play the game and Ive got to be clever in my challenges as well."<br><br>Spurs have not defeated Chelsea in the league since 1990 but King insists the dismal run will not affect preparations, and he is encouraged by his sides eight-match unbeaten run.<br><br>Martin Jols men are running into form after picking up just one win out of their first six Premiership matches this season, a surprising start after just missing out on Champions League qualification in their last campaign.<br><br>"Were going out to win and playing for the three points, the record doesnt matter - win, lose or draw were not thinking about the record," King said.<br><br>"We havent started as well as wed have liked but were slowly finding our feet. Theres a big gap between us and Chelsea but it doesnt mean we cant beat them on the day and thats what well be looking at. We recognise were a young side and were still trying to build. Last season was a good season for us but we realised that this season would be a lot tougher."<br><br>He added: "Theyll be hard to beat on Sunday regardless of any record." Tottenham were defeated at White Hart Lane by Chelsea last season when striker Mido was dismissed in the first half, while William Gallas scored a late winner at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>"Thats what champions are about, they know how to get the job done and that is what they did at Stamford Bridge," King said. "We have to believe we can win the game, theres no point going out and thinking about anything other than trying to win the game, thats how well approach it."<br><br>At the other end of the pitch, King expects Dimitar Berbatov to cause Chelsea problems after the Bulgaria striker netted twice in the 3-1 over Club Bruges on Thursday in the UEFA Cup.<br><br>"That will put us in good stead for Sunday, well be in good spirits for the game," King said. "If we can get the ball in the right areas to him (Berbatov) hes a great finisher. Hes started to show that in games."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Cole expects it to take a year for him to get back to his best</strong><br><br>Chelsea and England left-back Ashley Cole insists it will take at least a season before he is back to his best. Coles move to Chelsea just minutes before the close of the transfer deadline in August, had been shrouded in controversy ever since he was punished for the infamous tapping-up scandal along with Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho.<br><br>The affair left Cole feeling drained of confidence and the uncertainty of his switch across London left the England full-back without his normal self-belief. The former Arsenal star now admits it will take a season for him to get back to his very best.<br><br>Cole said: "Every game is a big game for me now, I have to prove myself and try and play well. Ive come to a new club and Ive had to start again and get my confidence back. It was hard for me to come into the system but I feel Im getting more into it now. Hopefully I can get back to my best and how I was playing before. I think I will take a season for that to happen. Hopefully after next season I will know how the lads play even more and I will get used to it. After the move I lost a lot of confidence and belief in myself. But I am getting that back now with the players and manager around me. It is hard for you to get motivated and be back to yourself when you read things you dont agree with or are nasty about you, then it hurts. It did affect me but I am feeling at home now. I didnt think I would adapt or be brought in as a member of the family so early but I do feel comfortable now and part of the team."<br><br>Cole will face Tottenham for the first time as a Chelsea player at White Hart Lane on Sunday as they champions look to continue their amazing run of success against the north London side. Spurs have not beaten Chelsea in 32 League meetings when Gary Lineker notched the winner in a 2-1 victory at Stamford Bridge in February 1990.<br><br>Spurs have also failed to win any of the last 17 home League clashes since Nico Claesen gave them a 1-0 triumph over Chelsea in August 1987. As an Arsenal player, Cole received his fair share of abuse from Spurs fans because of the north London rivalry between the two sides.<br><br>Now he is expecting to be singled out even more because of his move across London and is hoping to use the example set by former Gunner Sol Campbell, now with Portsmouth. He got through his hate-filled return to Spurs following his free transfer to Arsenal and Cole admitted the reception he got even left him intimidated.<br><br>Cole added: "Ive got to take it. Going back to Tottenham with Sol Campbell was scary, even I was feeling intimidated. But he was strong and came through that game really well and hopefully I can do the same. We want to keep the record going but I dont like to talk about it in case it puts a jinx on it."</div>
