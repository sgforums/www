              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">SOL CAMPBELL has quit Notts County after just ONE game.</h2>
              <p class="article">The former England star stunned team-mates yesterday when he walked into the changing-room to say his goodbyes.</p>
              <p class="article">Campbell, 34, agreed a five-year £40,000-a-week deal at the start of this month and made his debut in a wretched 2-1 defeat at Morecambe on Saturday.</p>
              <p class="article">Campbell went to manager Ian McParland after the game and asked to be released from the deal. The ex-Spurs and Arsenal centre-half was a free agent in the summer after leaving Portsmouth.</p>
              <p class="article">He arrived in a flurry of publicity and hoped for a coaching role under director of football Sven Goran Eriksson.</p>
              <p class="article">His departure comes as County are being investigated by the Football League, as exclusively revealed by The Sun on Saturday.</p>
              <p class="article">League chiefs want details of the money men behind Munto Finance's recent takeover.</p>
              <p class="article">The new owners are understood to have given McParland just two games to save his job.</p>
              <p class="article">County face Port Vale at home this weekend and travel to Lincoln on Tuesday night.</p>
              <p class="article">Executive chairman Peter Trembling said: "Of course we've got to review whether Ian's the man for the job. He's under pressure, we spent a lot of money so it goes with the territory."</p>

              <p>Sol Campbell is considering retirement after leaving Notts County, it has been revealed.</p>
              <p>The <em>Mirror</em> says Campbell, 34, started just one game for the League Two outfit.</p>
              <p>But he has now asked County to terminate his five-year, £40,000 a week contract Campbell snubbed a host of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> clubs to move to County but has quickly realised it was a mistake.</p>
              <p>Campbell will take the next few days to consider his next move but there is definitely no going back with Notts County.</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p>Notts County have confirmed Sol Campbell has left the club.</p>
              <p>County chief executive Peter Trembling told the club's website: "While
              we are disappointed that Sol felt that he could not adjust to the
              long-term nature of the project under way at Notts County, we obviously
              wish him the best with the remainder of his career and hope that he is
              able to obtain a place where he can play at international level ahead
              of the 2010 World Cup."</p>
              <p>Trembling continued: "The investment project is on track; we
              have brought in a lot of new players and resources into the club, but
              obviously this is a five-year project, not a five-week one."<br> Campbell agreed a five-year deal at Meadow Lane in August for a reported £40,000 a week after leaving <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Portsmouth</span></abbr> at the end of last season.</p>

              <p>Why did he agree on a 5 year deal?</p>

              <p>He is already 34 which means he wants to play until 39?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He should have just requested for a one year deal with option to extend if he wants to.</p>

              <p>It should be a walk in the park for him - should just treat it like retirement soccer to pass time.  40K a week is good money for this level. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>at 34, I believe he is the best player at county. Maybe he thought omg, what has he signed for, all these crap players at county that dun deserved to be a professional player. with a standard of players, coaching staff and manager around, how to be promoted to championship division 1. plus I think the training facilities at county are crap, not anywhere near the good facilities at premier league clubs. I think he is not accustomed to division 2 crap football, he sort of regreted his decision. at 34, he still think he has a few more years of premier league football left in him.</p></div>

              <p>look at giggs at 36, who is still playing a vital role at utd. probably he thought he can play like giggs in the premier league and believe he still have a few years left in him as a premiership player. maybe stoke, hull or burnley are interested in bidding for him.</p>
