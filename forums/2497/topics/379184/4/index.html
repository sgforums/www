              <p>I think you are greatly confused... Pool has been a loser team if you put it that way if not winning the title since way back 1991... If as what you are saying is even half true, then he should have pack his bags and left them after winning the Mickey Mouse treble in 2001 where the WC was in 2002...</p>
              <p>Owen joint Real Madrid probably for his own professional reasons... The Zidanes, The Ronaldos, the Figos were all there at that time and he probably wanted to try another football culture as well... Moreover, it was Real Madrid calling... Otherwise he could have easily gone to another English club...</p>
              <p>And Pool fans can't really blame him as there were too many uncertainties at Anfield during that time with the old manager being sack and a new manager arriving... Or perhaps he just didn't like Rafa's style of management...</p>

              <p>one funny thing is.the moment owen left liverpool,liv won CL.the moment owen left RM,RM won the league.the moment owen left newcastle,they got relegated..hmm..he seems like a jinx to me.to the man u fans,dont know if they treat this as a good news or bad news.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway,being a liv fan.i dont blame him for leaving and choosing united. those that suan him until so jialat,bare this in mind,its easier to talk than to show the action.it was owen's career and his last ditch to get into WC.rafa didnt want to sign him,so he have no other choice but to join mu.</p>

              <p><br>I think you are also greatly confused... Working with him doesn't necessary have to be playing one single match for him. Working for him could also meant training under him for 2 months or so during the close season... This amount of time spent everyday is more than enough to form a judgement to the working conditions and environment that will be for the future... </p>
              <p>Owen only left Pool in mid Aug while speculation of Owen leaving only came up after Houllier's was sacked... Rafa was already there before Owen left... He was the one who demanded Antonio Nunez as a part exchange with Real Madrid as well... and not Houllier...</p>
              <p>A lot of clubs asked their players to stay... But in the end, players leave for different reasons... Liverpool themselves are guilty of urging Barry to leave Villa... In the end, he may not have joint them but the chasing made it difficult for Barry stayed back... and he opt for another club rather than Pool also comes from his individual decision probably for a better prospect in his opinion and also a better pay...</p>
              <p>Like I have said, Owen left for his own reasons... He gave them his best years and did his best while he was there, The cup treble probably wouldn't have been achieved in 2001 without him... Pool fans should realize this... And going to Real Madrid was like a step upwards for him... And apart from testing himself in a different league, the salary was also a lot better than what Pool was paying him... Imagine getting paid a lot more and playing alongside the likes of Zidane, Figo, Beckham, Raul and all those...</p>
              <p>Gerrard today is regarded like a Pool hero, but was he any different when he handed in his transfer request when a better offer came along from Chelsea? Handing in a transfer request is not to be taken lightly... It means it has got to a very serious stage already... Have Owen ever handed in a transfer request to Pool? I am not too sure on this but you are a Pool fan, maybe you know better and can enlighten me...</p>
              <p>Whatever is said, we can't deny Gerrard was thinking for himself too correct? But was he wrong? I would say No, cos every player would have to think for themselves correct? </p>
              <p>A once great Liverpool hero is declared a bankrupt (John Barnes)... He gave the club 10 of his best playing career years... So is the club going to think for him and help him out now? You do the maths and tell us...</p>
              <p>In Gerrards case, it was probably because he knew he would lose his "star player" status he enjoys not just at Anfield but in the City of Liverpool as well and be just one of the many stars in the Chelsea squad but never surpassing John Terry or Lampard in their eyes... I guess a huge pay increased back then also played a part and kept him from going... So do you still think he stayed at Liverpool because of his loyalty? No, he was thinking from an individual viewpoint too of whichever benefitted him most which he was entitle too. </p>
              <p>Ronaldo joint Real in the summer but I am still happy for him and what he gave the team during his time there... He will always be a United hero to most of the United fans. And I can accept and admit that he contributed a great deal to the honours won these last few years... He left for personal reasons... and if United couldn't even match the offer he received, then they should not stand in his way for he has given a lot to the club already...</p>
              <p>In the end, I guess its not because he joint Real Madrid or Newcastle or whatever else... It just comes down to Some Pool fans are just bitter that he joint United rather than anything... Owen only had offers from Stoke and Hull City and maybe Everton at that point, Rafa didn't want him back, so United came in... He only took the best deal on the table, even Gerrard would probably done the same if he was in that position given how he handled his own transfer deal...</p>

              <p>its very hard to say, liverpool is quite a temperamental and unpredictable team nowadays.</p>
              <p>Regarding the owen issue, it would certainly be a lethal partnership between owen and torres but we got in return something different after owen left. So i dont see any point or difference owen would have made if he stayed.</p>
              <p>For me Liverpool has certainly improved over the last few years to catch up with the other top3. During houllier's time, pool werent even up there. Benitez has done his part in strengthening the team.</p>

              <p><br>I think you are also greatly confused... Working with him doesn't necessary have to be playing one single match for him. Working for him could also meant training under him for 2 months or so during the close season... This amount of time spent everyday is more than enough to form a judgement to the working conditions and environment that will be for the future... </p>
              <p>Owen only left Pool in mid Aug while speculation of Owen leaving only came up after Houllier's was sacked... Rafa was already there before Owen left... He was the one who demanded Antonio Nunez as a part exchange with Real Madrid as well... and not Houllier...</p>
              <p>A lot of clubs asked their players to stay... But in the end, players leave for different reasons... Liverpool themselves are guilty of urging Barry to leave Villa... In the end, he may not have joint them but the chasing made it difficult for Barry stayed back... and he opt for another club rather than Pool also comes from his individual decision probably for a better prospect in his opinion and also a better pay...</p>
              <p>Like I have said, Owen left for his own reasons... He gave them his best years and did his best while he was there, The cup treble probably wouldn't have been achieved in 2001 without him... Pool fans should realize this... And going to Real Madrid was like a step upwards for him... And apart from testing himself in a different league, the salary was also a lot better than what Pool was paying him... Imagine getting paid a lot more and playing alongside the likes of Zidane, Figo, Beckham, Raul and all those...</p>
              <p>Gerrard today is regarded like a Pool hero, but was he any different when he handed in his transfer request when a better offer came along from Chelsea? Handing in a transfer request is not to be taken lightly... It means it has got to a very serious stage already... Have Owen ever handed in a transfer request to Pool? I am not too sure on this but you are a Pool fan, maybe you know better and can enlighten me...</p>
              <p>Whatever is said, we can't deny Gerrard was thinking for himself too correct? But was he wrong? I would say No, cos every player would have to think for themselves correct? </p>
              <p>A once great Liverpool hero is declared a bankrupt (John Barnes)... He gave the club 10 of his best playing career years... So is the club going to think for him and help him out now? You do the maths and tell us...</p>
              <p>In Gerrards case, it was probably because he knew he would lose his "star player" status he enjoys not just at Anfield but in the City of Liverpool as well and be just one of the many stars in the Chelsea squad but never surpassing John Terry or Lampard in their eyes... I guess a huge pay increased back then also played a part and kept him from going... So do you still think he stayed at Liverpool because of his loyalty? No, he was thinking from an individual viewpoint too of whichever benefitted him most which he was entitle too. </p>
              <p>Ronaldo joint Real in the summer but I am still happy for him and what he gave the team during his time there... He will always be a United hero to most of the United fans. And I can accept and admit that he contributed a great deal to the honours won these last few years... He left for personal reasons... and if United couldn't even match the offer he received, then they should not stand in his way for he has given a lot to the club already...</p>
              <p>In the end, I guess its not because he joint Real Madrid or Newcastle or whatever else... It just comes down to Some Pool fans are just bitter that he joint United rather than anything... Owen only had offers from Stoke and Hull City and maybe Everton at that point, Rafa didn't want him back, so United came in... He only took the best deal on the table, even Gerrard would probably done the same if he was in that position given how he handled his own transfer deal...</p>

              <p>Rafa joined Liverpool on 16 June 2004, and Owen left Liverpool in 14 August 2004...Euro2004 started on 12 June 2004 and finished in 4 July 2004. After that the players were given time off...he must be super brilliant to know Rafa management style within such a short period of time. If he didn't like Rafa's management style, he wouldn't want to come back to Liverpool not once, but twice. So Rafa management style is not the issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rafa first task as Liverpool manager was to convince both Gerrard and Owen to stay...but luckily Gerrard did stay and LUCKILY Owen left too! At the end of the day,it benefit both Liverpool and Owen hence his departure is not a bad thing at all for Liverpool.</p>

              <p>Alan Shearer was a good commentator, wasn't he? The issue is not about pettiness. Owen is injury prone, no one willing to take the risk on him but SAF. SAF took a risk on Owen Hargreaves as well and it seems like he made a mistake on that. Owen still is a good player, if he is not injured...and that remains to be seen.</p>

              <p><br>Errr... Since you bring up the Euros, then i supposed you also more or less knew when England was eliminated from it right? So his break, together with the rest of the squad would probably start from that period onwards and not after the finals on July 4... That's for Portugal and Greece players...</p>
              <p>The whole England squad who got eliminated early, would probably be back home or somewhere across the world having started on their early holidays by the time the final even started... Therefore, you would expect that even if given a 3 weeks or lets make it one full month of holiday, which is already a lot... He would still be back at Anfield way before Aug, let alone Aug 14 true?</p>
              <p>So, two, three weeks training under him is more than sufficient to form an idea to the different working conditions and environment to what he was used to under Houllier wouldn't you agree?</p>
              <p>Actually I would say even one week is more than enough to know if you will like or dislike the person, his style, character and all those things... Moreover, I have said earlier its more than just Rafa, It was also Real Madrid calling, Zidane, Figo, Becks, Carlos and all those, not to mention an increase salary too...</p>
              <p>And you are correct, one of Rafa's first task was indeed to persuade him to stay back but he fail... Gerrard stayed back for his own reasons too and not because he was very loyal... Pool lost Owen and they couldn't allow Gerrard to go as well therefore he got his increment and stayed back... Pool fans sing about Gerrard's loyalty but who was the one who handed in a transfer request? Gerrard or Owen?</p>
              <p>And if any Pool fan is really honest, its the reason he joint United rather than anything else that trouble them more than anything... But have they all forgotten he gave them 10 of his best years too?</p>
              <p>And honestly, I never once thought Alan Shearer was a good pundit or manager... lol</p>
              <p>And I think the reason you gaves for Rafa not going for Owen is kind of weak cos Rafa just paid $20 million pounds to sign probably an even more injury prone player in Alberto Aquilani whose last 2 years record is worse than Owen's... and has not even played 1 league match so far when the season is already 1/4 over. And Owen was a free player somemore and his salary was not even going to cost Liverpool much...</p>
              <p>And on Owen Hargreaves, let me just say this... He is not a flop, cos his free-kick goal against Arsenal probably won them the title the year before... I can still recall very clearly in that season, in mid April, last 5 matches left, United were under a lot of pressure from Chelsea, he scored what no one expected against a strong Arsenal side... So when the last match of the season came, United were still on level points with Chelsea... had he not made that, United would probably be 2 points behind rather than level. Moreover, its not as though he is Robbie Keane, came and went within six months so the judgement of his $20m moved is more or less settled... Hargreaves is about to return next month... So there is still a lot for him to play.</p>
              <p>So on Owen again, like I said... It's his personal choice, like it or not, every player makes them for their own benefits... So Pool begged him as you put it. But he left for his own good, so he is disloyal?</p>
              <p>I asked earlier, A once great Liverpool hero is recently declared a bankrupt (John Barnes)... He gave the club 10 of his best years... They won lots of trophies while he was there, from League titles to FA cups to Carling cup and even the Shield. But now he is in trouble, so should he go and beg the club to help him? And do you honestly think Liverpool will help clear his debts and support Barnes for the rest of his life? So the question becomes, Can we now say... Is Liverpool football club disloyal to John Barnes?</p>
              <p>On your last statement, "A friend in need is a friend indeed." I don't doubt your sincerity towards your friends... I think it's a great virtue for one to have... And you are correct that there are not many such people out there these days... Nevertheless, there are still some genuine ones...</p>
              <p>This is just a forum where we put across our different opinions... Other then that, its nothing more... No resentment or any grudge towards you... and I hope you feel the same way too... lol</p>
