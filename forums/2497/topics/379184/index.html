              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Michael Owen</span></strong> <strong><span style="color: #000000;">has accepted that he will get a hostile reception when he returns to</span></strong> <strong><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span></strong> <strong><span style="color: #000000;">as a</span></strong> <strong><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span></strong> <strong><span style="color: #000000;">player this weekend but insisted that he does not believe he let down his first club by joining their fiercest rivals.</span></strong></p>
              </div>
              <p>Owen is acutely aware that many supporters at Anfield cannot forgive him for switching allegiances to United, but the striker considers it unfair for him to be accused of disloyalty. To illustrate the point, he said he planned to celebrate as normal if he scored in Sunday's game.</p>
              <p>"I'm human," said Owen. "I'd prefer people to sit down and recognise what you did for them and for the team in years gone past but I'm pretty realistic as well. Now that I'm playing for their local rivals – I'm not holding my breath, put it that way.</p>
              <p>"People talk about loyalty in football, and for a football supporter it's easy to preach about that. As a father and a brother and a son there's no one more loyal than me. But when you're a player, you're not a fan. I've got to earn a living, provide for my family. I supported Everton as a kid. I never supported Real Madrid, but I played for them. It's a job opportunity, just like anyone else's work.</p>
              <p>"The longer you're at a team, if the fans make you feel welcome and the players take to you, then you build an affinity. So now obviously I look for Real Madrid results and Newcastle results, but it doesn't make me any less loyal to Manchester United."</p>
              <p>Owen is still hopeful that his move to Old Trafford will lead to him going to the World Cup next summer and he pointed to his past international record as justification to be included in Fabio Capello's squad.</p>
              <p>"I'm hopeful but the last thing I want is to be campaigning," he said. "Everyone can see how many games I've played, how many goals I've scored, how many World Cups I've been in, my record against strong opponents in big games.</p>
              <p>"Everyone can see everything with their own eyes. There are no secrets with me – I've played 89 games, I've scored 40 goals. Everyone knows if I play I'm likely to score every other game. Playing in a World Cup wouldn't bother me. In fact, I'd raise my game, as has happened before in big games. I like big games. For some reason I find an extra certain percentage. Everyone knows these things."</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson, who is likely to be charged with improper conduct by the Football Association tomorrow for his comments about the referee Alan Wiley, may leave Ryan Giggs, Wayne Rooney, Patrice Evra, Nemanja Vidic and Darren Fletcher behind when the team fly to Russia for Wednesday's Champions League tie against CSKA Moscow to ensure they are fit for Sunday.</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool say that normal rules about bringing objects into the stadium will apply on Sunday, and fans will be searched randomly in conjunction with this policy.</strong></p>
              <p>Given the fact that bargain 'beach sets', reduced from £20 to just £10, have completely sold out at the club's online store since Saturday night, it is safe to assume that one of the banned items will be a certain, large, red beach ball.</p>
              <p>The thing about inflatable beach balls though, is that they can also be deflated. And reduced to very, very small packages. And hidden rather easily about the person. And smuggled in to just about any venue. Including football grounds. Even heavily stewarded football grounds.</p>
              <p>Now, I'm not an expert on the consumer trends of northern England, but I'd hazard a guess that some of those bargain beach sets snapped up over the weekend made their way to addresses in the proximity of the Manchester area. And, let's face it, to addresses in the proximity of the greater London area as well.</p>
              <p>So when Manchester United visit Anfield on Sunday, expect - no doubt at some crucial stage during the game - a spectacular avalanche of huge, spherical objects to cascade down from the corner of the Anny Road end.</p>
              <p>The beach set also contains a towel, which offers a suggestion for Anfield's resident DJ as he searches for appropriate music to play during the most eagerly anticipated contest of the English football season.   </p>
              <p>Nena, that wonderfully hirsute German chanteuse (who, it is a little known fact, was a closet Crewe Alexandra fan after studying at South Cheshire College in her youth), should provide the backdrop to the big game on Sunday. What better soundtrack than her all-time classic 99 Red Balloons? </p>
              <p>It's gonna be great isn't it? And given her undoubted genius, Nena has a lyric to sum up the magnificent rivalry between these two remarkable clubs. "This is what we've waited for/This is it, boys, this is war". Bring it on, 99 red balloons and all.</p>

              <p><strong>Javier Mascherano has revealed that </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong> will hold crisis talks as Rafa Benitez attempts to save his job ahead of the crunch clash with arch rivals </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong>.</strong></p>
              <p>The Reds boss is under intense pressure after four straight defeats threaten to extinguish their dream of winning the Champions League and Barclays Premier League.</p>
              <p>Tuesday's 2-1 loss at home to Lyon leaves Benitez battling to avoid the axe and Mascherano insists they must reverse the damage before it is too late. 'Rafa didn't say anything after the game, he didn't want to talk because everyone is disappointed,' revealed the Argentina midfielder.</p>
              <p>'But I think on Wednesday we will talk a lot. We need to talk and we need to see all the mistakes we have done and try not to repeat them against United.'</p>
              <p>The match against United at Anfield on Sunday is expected to ultimately decide Benitez's future. Defeat against their old foes would leave the Spaniard facing the axe.</p>
              <p>However, Mascherano has attempted to shift the spotlight away from his manager by claiming that the players are to blame for Liverpool's woes.</p>
              <p>'It's not the manager's fault. It's the players' responsibility,' he added. 'The manager can say how to play but on the pitch it's down to us. We were not intelligent. 'We are so very disappointed as it was important for us to win. We lost, so we know we are in a difficult situation.</p>
              <p>'We are a team that was doing well last season but we have got to keep going, we have to keep working really hard and we have got to try to win the next game.</p>
              <p>'United will be a massive test for us. It is all about confidence. When you have confidence you can do everything but we know the team is not playing well.</p>

              <p>'In football, you never know what will happen but we can't afford to think about what has happened in the past. All we can think about is the future and we need to beat United.'</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool fans might see it as a case of too little too late but £20million signing Alberto Aquilani finally made his debut in a red shirt on Wednesday night.</strong></p>
              <p>As Rafael Benitez's side cry out for more inspiration, co-owner George Gillett turned up at Tranmere to check out what his club's hefty investment has bought in a reserve game against Sunderland.</p>
              <p>Before last night, an ankle injury that required surgery had prevented Aquilani from kicking a ball in anger since joining Liverpool from Roma on a five-year contract worth £80,000-a-week in the summer.</p>
              <p>His last competitive match was back in March and the Italian midfielder, signed as a replacement for Xabi Alonso, was tentative at Prenton Park.</p>

              <p><strong>Aquilani played for the final 15 minutes and showed some neat touches but had few opportunities to impress Gillett or watching assistant manager Sammy Lee.</strong></p>
              <p>Understandably, he showed no appetite for a 50-50 challenge that came his way late on as Liverpool won 2-0.</p>
              <p>Aquilani said afterwards: ‘It’s not easy after such a long time out. But my ankle is good and all I want to do is play.’</p>

              <p>well, why was he not played much? cause due to age/injury, his prime is over, and errors creeping into his game. He was better than Carra, but not anymore.</p>

              <p>the titles of threads seems to change everytime there is a new update. While it may serves to freshen things in your opinion, it is making reading very confusing cause the replies don't link. also, there are simply too much information and too many sub-topics in one single thread, making reading a big headache.</p>
              <p>If U just want to control the number of threads in this space, perhaps U can include/create topics that are interesting and readers can discuss/debates, instead of just creating mundane threads that are based on news with no value, which most of us can read off the internet soccer pages.</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Man Utd captain Neville: Liverpool clash not decisive</h1>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> captain Gary Neville says Sunday's clash at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> will not be decisive in the title race.</p>
              <p>Neville acknowledges that the Reds from Manchester go into the game in a better frame of mind than <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>, but that will count for very little when the two teams cross the white line.</p>
              <p>"This is always a great fixture, a passionate fixture but a game that can always go either way,” he told <em>MUTV</em>. “We just hope we’re at the top of our game, because you have to be in these ones.</p>
              <p>"It was important to keep a clean sheet against CSKA, especially going into Sunday’s game. We're happy with how we defended.</p>
              <p>"The fact <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> lost [against Lyon] and we won in Moscow will mean nothing come Sunday
              lunchtime. They're at home in front of their fans. It's always
              difficult at Anfield. We have to make sure we're on top of our game.</p>
              <p>“It's far too early to talk about knocking <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> out of the title race, we're only nine or ten games into the season.
              Any team in the top four is capable of winning six or seven games on
              the trot and getting back into it. We just need to think about our
              performance and what we do.”</p>

              <p><strong>John Terry has heaped more pressure on beleaguered </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong>, claiming that the Blues have the strength in depth that struggling Liverpool can only dream of.</strong></p>
              <p>The England captain, swooning at his <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span></a> side's 4-0 demolition of Atletico Madrid, hinted that he thought Liverpool would be out of the title race if they lost on Sunday at home to rivals <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United</span></a>.</p>
              <p>When asked if Rafa Benitez's Reds will be out of the championship contest if they lose against United, Terry told the <span style="font-style: italic;">London Evening Standard</span>: 'I'm not sure, but when Stevie and Torres get injured they seem to be very short in the squad they've got.</p>
              <p>'We're very fortunate at Chelsea. Since Roman Abramovich came, we have had a lot of strength in depth in the squad - like with Salomon Kalou scoring twice against Atletico with Didier Drogba being out.</p>
              <p>'People said we would struggle without Didier, but we didn't. If you take Torres out of their team, who do they bring in? It's difficult.</p>
              <p>'We have players that are not here only to make up the numbers, but players that are fighting and working hard every day in training to come in and really prove themselves.'</p>
              <p>Terry says Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez has a tough job to turn their season around after seeing his side lose their last four games in all competitions - with the looming prospect of facing Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday without the injured Gerrard and Torres.</p>
