              <p>mr moderator,</p>
              <p>the titles of threads seems to change everytime there is a new update. While it may serves to freshen things in your opinion, it is making reading very confusing cause the replies don't link. also, there are simply too much information and too many sub-topics in one single thread, making reading a big headache.</p>
              <p>If U just want to control the number of threads in this space, perhaps U can include/create topics that are interesting and readers can discuss/debates, instead of just creating mundane threads that are based on news with no value, which most of us can read off the internet soccer pages.</p>
              <p>Just my two cents.</p>

              <p><strong>Glen Johnson and Fernando Torres should be available for Liverpool's crucial clash with Manchester United, but Steven Gerrard remains a doubt.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Johnson and Torres missed Tuesday's Champions League defeat to Lyon with hamstring and groin problems, while Gerrard limped off after only 25 minutes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Gerrard's removal was described as cautionary, but Johnson is not sure that he will recover in time for the game at Anfield, as Liverpool look to avoid their fifth loss in a row.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Johnson said: "I think I will be all right for Sunday. We haven't tested it today, just soft tissue work and massage, but it seems a lot freer than it did.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I think Nando [Torres] might be all right for Sunday but I am not too sure about Stevie."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Albert Riera is also doubtful for the game with his own hamstring injury.</p>

              <p><br>Well my dear friend, the main idea is not to remove the old news related to the existing one... Therefore doing so would defeat the purpose... Its very easy to open a new thread, But if we were to open a new thread each time we have a latest news on the Pool v United match, then in a short space of time we could have like 4, 5 or even 6 threads on a single topic.</p>
              <p>With different people contributing to this topic itself, be it a mod or a member, it would be a better way to keep them all within this thread as I believe it would cause less confusion and you can find all the related stories in one single thread rather than surfing and searching for each related ones.</p>
              <p>This is a unique thread by itself as this is supposed to be a "match thread"... But being a general news forum, hosting a match thread so early would be meaningless as you can find those at the Pool and United forums... Therefore since it has been started by one of my mod, we will keep it as a news thread until closer to the match day when we will either have an EPL - in the thread title to indicate it's a match thread and follow by the news title or a simple Pool v United on it...</p>
              <p>Whether it's convenient or not, it's basically still a news thread for all to discuss and be informed on the latest development leading up to the match... On whether it could be a match thread, it's basically up to the people, we can only do our bit... There is a United and Pool forum hosting it as well... But some wouldn't want to go there or some would prefer to discuss it in a general forum where different supporters, not just from these 2 clubs come together...</p>
              <p>And if a new reader comes into this thread, I guess he wouldn't know the changes in the title would he? And since all the news are supposed to be related... I think he may actually find it more interesting getting more than what he had thought wouldn't you think so?</p>

              <p><strong>Angry Liverpool fans are planning a 10,000-strong protest march on Sunday in a renewed attempt to drive co-owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett out of Anfield.</strong> </p>
              <p>Liverpool will step up security for the visit of Manchester United in an eagerly anticipated clash, which is likely to be played out without home skipper Steven Gerrard and United talisman Wayne Rooney.</p>
              <p>As the crisis at Anfield grows, supporters group Spirit of Shankly have reacted to the Americans' expected presence at the crunch Barclays Premier League clash with Manchester United by organising a demonstration against them.</p>
              <p>Around 4,000 banner-waving protesters descended on the famous old ground prior to last season's match against United but such is the strength of feeling at the club that at least double are expected on Sunday.</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez has been in the firing line since Tuesday, when his side were beaten 2-1 by Lyon in the Champions League - their fourth consecutive defeat.</strong></p>
              <p>Reflecting on Liverpool's worst losing streak for 22 years, SoS spokesman Paul Gardner said: 'There are two culprits - Gillett and Hicks.</p>
              <p>'They are the ones who put us into £245million worth of debt, promised us a stadium which has not been built, took money out of the club to pay for their own expenses. We want the owners out now.'</p>
              <p>Liverpool Supporters Club spokesman Les Lawson it won't be easy to oust the Americans, but he won't be deterred.</p>
              <p>'There have been protests before, but the Americans do have elephant-thick skin,' said Lawson, 'But there is no point in sitting back and doing nothing. This will be a direct action to keep the campaign in the public eye.</p>
              <p>'There are plenty of other things going on behind the scenes to keep the campaign going, though. The fans have to do something to show their anger at the way Liverpool is being run.'</p>
              <p>There is mixed news on the injury front, with Gerrard expected to be ruled out but Fernando Torres likely to win his fight for fitness, along with Glen Johnson.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/10/23/article-0-06E96E3C000005DC-977_306x423.jpg" alt="Alberto Aquilani" width="306" height="423">

              <p><strong>Rooney remains a doubt for United. The England striker has been out with a calf injury since England's World Cup qualifier in Ukraine a fortnight ago.</strong></p>
              <p>Benitez needs a positive response to stay within range of the Premier League pacesetters and silence the doubters as to his position. But he has warned fans his £20m summer signing Alberto Aquilani will not be making an impact for some time.</p>
              <p>The Italian will not play against United and Benitez said: 'Always, with a new player, we talk about the problems they have settling down because the Premier League is quick and more physical.</p>
              <p>'So for a new player who has been injured, like Alberto, it will be even more difficult.'</p>
              <p>Although Jose Mourinho is known to be the preferred choice of Hicks and Gillett to take over from Benitez, the cost of paying him off, as revealed in Sportsmail yesterday, and financing the Inter Milan boss's arrival and transfer demands would prove prohibitive.</p>
              <p>Benitez knows victory against United would go a long way to silencing his critics while dispelling a growing theory that Liverpool rely too heavily on Gerrard and Torres.</p>

              <p><strong>Chelsea skipper John Terry chipped in by saying: 'When Stevie Gerrard and Fernando Torres get injured, they seem to be short in the squad they've got. If you take Torres out of their team, who do they bring in? It's difficult.</strong></p>
              <p>'We have players who are not here only to make up the numbers.'</p>
              <p>Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge underlined the significance of avoiding a fifth straight defeat by saying: 'How the season unfolds could hinge on this game. You can tell confidence is low but this is where you find out about them.'</p>

              <p>I will not go so far as to say that it will be a trashing.....</p>
              <p>However, it is true that while Man Utd has depth, that is something that Liverpool is sorely lacking in.</p>
              <p>I can agree that no team is ever 100% effective without their star players, but a good team is one that has enough depth to still be 80-90% effective in such cases.</p>
              <p>Even without Rooney, Man Utd still has Macheda, Welbeck and Owen to partner Berbatov up front. They are not as good as Rooney, but they can still get the job done reasonably well.</p>
              <p>But Liverpool? Take out Gerrard, and there's no one capable enough to fill in the gap.</p>

              <p>Correct me if I am wrong but didn't Liverpool beat United without Gerrard and Torres last season? So its still practically the same side minus Alonso but plus Johnson only what...</p>

A 5th record could probably be 50 yrs or has it even ever happen before? </p>
              <p>If I am being honest, I doubt United can get 3 points from it... One point only or maybe zero may be the result... I just hope I am very wrong about it... And I wish for an Owen dream outing if he plays...</p>

              <p>Something tells me the determination of the Pool players to save Rafa will work out for them...</p>
              <p>I say you can have form, skills, star player... But nothing can outdo a determine set of players... If they are motivated enough, they will be almost invincible... But the problem with this kind of form is... They don't last very long, change to another team and they could go back to their old self again...</p>
              <p>So my guess is, they could beat United... But one, two weeks later they could lose to Fulham or City again kind of stuff...</p>
