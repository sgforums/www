              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Cool head: Sir Alex Ferguson insists Michael Owen will have no problem in dealing with the pressure of a return to Anfield on Sunday</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1222592" rel="1222592|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1222592/Michael-Owen-treated-like-hero-Anfield-Sunday-says-Sir-Alex-Ferguson.html"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson believes Michael Owen deserves a hero's reception when he runs out for Manchester United at Anfield on Sunday and has claimed the former Liverpool striker remains one of the best goalscorers in world football.</strong></p>
              <p>United manager Ferguson will have Wayne Rooney back in his team after the striker came through a full training session yesterday, but Owen will be on the bench at least against his old club as United attempt to make it five defeats in a row for their fierce rivals.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: 'Michael's record at Liverpool stands him apart. Michael played for Liverpool for over a decade and the goals he scored for them mark him down as one of their best-ever strikers.</p>
              <p>'That should stand him in good stead with the Liverpool fans but it will be interesting to see what reaction he gets. Whatever happens, he's got the experience to handle it.</p>
              <p>'There have been very few players who have played for both clubs. Paul Ince got a bad reception from our fans when he joined Liverpool. Michael may well get that again on Sunday but it is difficult to say.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>'He had 10 or 11 years with them. But I don't think it will bother Michael. Everyone wants to be liked but I don't think it will bother him.'</strong></p>
              <p>Ferguson surprised everybody this summer when he signed injury-prone Owen on a free transfer after he left Newcastle.</p>
              <p>He has scored only twice this season, including a dramatic winner in the 4-3 derby victory against Manchester City, but is likely to play some part at Anfield.</p>
              <p>'He is capable of scoring in any type of match, including the highest level,' added Ferguson. 'He has done that throughout his career. He has got a proven record in that respect. We knew that when we bought him. If you are looking only at his c.v. then every club in the world would have taken him.</p>
              <p>'The Liverpool thing was never mentioned when we met in the summer. I never even thought about it. I made my mind up about Michael and there was no negotiation. He was desperate to come. It was so simple. He wanted to be back at a top club and have European football.'</p>
              <p>With Rooney back in full training and Ryan Giggs also fit, United will be strengthened as they look to earn revenge for the two Barclays Premier League defeats inflicted on them by Liverpool last season.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #e01c44;">GERARD HOULLIER</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool's treble-winning manager </strong></p>
              <p>I always remember Michael at the party we threw at the club after winning the three trophies in 2001. Michael was having his photograph taken with the cups and I asked him which one was his favourite.</p>
              <p>'The FA Cup,' he said. 'Why?' I asked him. 'Because every kid in this country dreams of winning the FA Cup. It's special.'</p>
              <p>And then he said it was easy to work out which one I liked the most. 'Go on then, tell me,' I said. 'The UEFA Cup,' he said. 'How do you know that?' I asked. 'Because before every European game we could see it in your eyes, in the way that desire surged through your veins. We knew it was the one you really, really wanted.'</p>
              <p>That same desire surged through Michael's veins in every game. In every training session, too. I know Fergie loves him because the boy is just a joy to work with. Never any trouble, always 100 per cent.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>He never wanted to be rested. He never liked it when I rotated him with Robbie Fowler or the other strikers we had at the club at the time. 'I'll rest when I've retired,' he used to say to me.</strong></p>
              <p>He has two great qualities. Great enthusiasm for the game and great confidence in himself. The kind of confidence that, I believe, will enable him to get back to his very best now he is at Manchester United.</p>
              <p>He might have had his injury problems but his game has developed and he remains a top, top player. This is someone who always delivers in the big games. He is very clever when it comes to moving between the lines, dropping off into midfield and moving into the space between defenders.</p>
              <p>He can work brilliantly off a centre forward, the way I often had him playing with Emile Heskey. It was a tremendous privilege to work with him for six years.</p>
              <p>When Fergie signed Michael in the summer, I thought it was a very astute piece of business. Here, after all, was a player of the highest quality available for nothing. Michael will do well for United. Of that I am absolutely certain.</p>

              <p><strong>He's finally listened to me. I told him he should join United when he was at school! </strong><strong>There were a lot of clubs looking at him at that age, even though he was already training with Liverpool. He went to United for two weeks and I asked him to keep them in mind. When he eventually got there, I was delighted.</strong></p>
              <p>I'm sure that if he plays, he'll score. He's been doing it all his life. He was doing it when he came to us at the High School at the age of 11 and he'd been doing it before that.</p>
              <p>I could see the first time I saw him that he was going to be special. He showed the potential and he was scoring goals for fun, a lot of them terrific goals. He was prolific in the box. He had that predator's instinct.</p>
              <p>I'd like to think the Liverpool fans will give him a good reception. They've done it in the past for their heroes who've gone back.</p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>Chief executive at Anfield when Owen joined Liverpool </strong></p>
              <p>He was so outstanding that in his very early days I told him he should get an agent to look after his commercial interests. I recommended Tony Stephens and the relationship proved very successful.</p>
              <p>Steve Heighway, who was in charge of what was the School of Excellence at the time, was so convinced about him that he came to see me personally about signing him. Normally, he would just send a memo.</p>
              <p>Later, he did the same with Steven Gerrard and, indirectly, the promise of that pair, along with Jamie Carragher, Stephen Warnock and players like David Thompson, who had a lot of ability but later was affected by injuries, led to me recommending that we bought land at Kirkby, where we built our academy.</p>
              <p>I would hope the fans won't have a go at him when he returns, even though he's now with our big rivals. Normally, the Liverpool supporters are remarkable in the way they welcome players back.</p>
              <p>I hope he gets a similar reception to the one Kevin Keegan got when he came back with Hamburg.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><span style="color: #e01c44;"><strong>ROY EVANS </strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>Manager who gave Owen his first-team break on May 6, 1997 </strong></p>
              <p>He came through the system and from the start he always looked as if he would be a top player. He's carried that on through every level. It was the whole package with Michael. It was more difficult to keep him out than put him in because of his ability.</p>
              <p>He was only 17 when he got in the side (he came on as a substitute and scored a consolation goal as Liverpool lost 2-1 to Wimbledon at Selhurst Park) and maybe he could have got in a bit earlier, but you are always a bit worried about size in a player so young. But there were no problems once he got in there. He's been a great player.</p>
              <p>Obviously, he's with the opposition now, but Liverpool supporters should never forget what he did for us. At times he was fantastic.</p>
              <p>Hopefully, there'll be no problems. It's always going to be a problem whoever you are playing for Manchester United at Anfield, but let's hope he is shown respect for what he did for the club.</p>

              <p><strong>Former Liverpool striker</strong></p>
              <p>A lot of fans wanted Michael back at the club but it was clear Rafa didn't. He obviously feels that Michael wouldn't fit into the style he wants to play. Michael will probably be mindful of that and may want to prove a point.</p>
              <p>The fans will certainly be wary of what he can do, as will the players. Liverpool need to make sure he doesn't come back to haunt them.</p>
              <p>He was always popular with the fans, maybe not so much as some of us who came from the city, but he still had a rapport.</p>
              <p>The trouble is now not everyone will reason with the move he has made. I'm not sure going to Manchester United is something I could have done, but Michael is a lot more businesslike in his decisions.</p>
              <p>You don't know what other offers he had. It's not as if he has moved from Liverpool directly to United - that wouldn't happen, there have been clubs in between - but all the same he'll get a hot reception.</p>
              <p>We saw what the United fans gave Paul Ince a few years back when he returned and I think Michael will get the same from the Anfield crowd on Sunday afternoon.</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool ended their worst sequence of results since 1987 and eased the pressure on manager Rafael Benitez in the most satisfying manner possible as Manchester United were deservedly beaten at Anfield.</strong></p>
              <p>Fernando Torres demonstrated his world class with a 65th-minute opener, comfortably shrugging off the attentions of Rio Ferdinand before powering an unstoppable finish high past United keeper Edwin van der Sar at The Kop end.</p>
              <p>And after United's Nemanja Vidic was sent off for the third successive time against Liverpool and Javier Mascherano also saw red in a thunderous finale, substitute David Ngog raced on to Lucas's pass to wrap up a fully-merited victory.</p>
              <p>Anfield was awash with ecstasy as goalkeeper Pepe Reina rushed the length of the field to join the celebrations with Ngog - a sign of what was riding on this result for Liverpool and manager Benitez.</p>
              <p>Reds boss Benitez entered this crucial game with spirits lifted after managing director Christian Purslow added his weight to co-owner George Gillett's message that his future is not under threat.</p>
              <p></p>
              <table style="height: 4px;" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="7" align="right">

              <p></p>
              <p>But it was the commitment and energy shown by Liverpool in the face of four successive defeats that was always going to be the most realistic measure of the current circumstances surrounding Benitez.</p>
              <p>And Liverpool delivered in emphatic fashion, backed by fervent Anfield supporters who recognised Benitez had reached a pivotal point in his five-year reign.</p>
              <p>Liverpool held sway for most of a match that only occasionally touched the heights, but the workload of the respective keepers confirmed this was a victory well-earned by Benitez's side - and which now leaves them only four points behind the Premier League champions.</p>
              <p>United mounted a late rally of sorts but Ngog's late goal gave the scoreline a more realistic appearance.</p>
              <p>And watching it all after a late cameo as substitute was Michael Owen, returning to Anfield for the first time since joining United and being subjected to a venomous reaction from Liverpool's fans.</p>
              <p>Owen was involved in the late drama as he was fouled by Jamie Carragher with United trailing 1-0 and boss Sir Alex Ferguson felt the Reds defender should have been shown a red card rather than yellow.</p>
              <p>It was perhaps the stroke of luck Liverpool have been missing recently.</p>
              <p>Events on the pitch, as ever, will ultimately dictate Benitez's fate and United fans arrived at Anfield in the mood to revel in Liverpool's current misfortune.</p>
              <p>Eric Cantona masks and a succession of banners served as a reminder that they now equal Liverpool's total of 18 league titles - with beach balls thrown on to the Anfield turf to mock the manner of Liverpool's defeat at Sunderland.</p>
              <p>The Kop rallied behind Liverpool, who as expected were without injured captain Steven Gerrard, and they responded with an energetic first-half performance in which United keeper Van der Sar was fully extended.</p>
              <p>Van der Sar leapt brilliantly to claw out Aurelio's free-kick in the 14th minute after Patrice Evra had been booked for his third foul in quick succession - even recovering to keep out Kuyt's effort from the rebound.</p>
              <p></p>

              <p></p>
              <p>Kuyt was guilty of missing Liverpool's best chance of a frantic opening three minutes later when he failed to hit the target from the angle after he was released by Lucas.</p>
              <p>Valencia's pace was posing real problems for Liverpool left-back Emiliano Insua, and he was the provider with a cross that saw Wayne Rooney's header clutched by Reina in front of an anxious Kop.</p>
              <p>Liverpool were rising to the challenge of ending their recently dismal sequence, and Aurelio should have given them the lead 10 minutes before half-time, heading straight at Van der Sar from Yossi Benayoun's cross.</p>

              <p></p>
              <p>Benitez's side started well again after the break and Kuyt, his confidence perhaps sapped by earlier failures in front of goal, tried to set up Benayoun when the Netherlands striker would have been better served trying to test Van der Sar.</p>
              <p>The goal Liverpool craved eventually came - and from a predictable source as Torres showed searing pace and clinical finishing to shrug off the attentions of Ferdinand before lashing a finish high past Van der Sar at The Kop end.</p>
              <p>It was the signal for former Liverpool striker Owen to warm up, and he was subjected to a torrid reception and cries of "Judas" from the supporters who once idolised him.</p>
              <p>Owen almost delivered the perfect answer to the taunts when he set up Valencia, but his shot smashed against the bar from a tight angle and United's last serious chance had gone.</p>
              <p>There was still time for a frantic finish, with Vidic achieving the unenviable feat of a third red card in three games against Liverpool when he picked up a second yellow card for a foul on Kuyt.</p>
              <p>Mascherano joined him on the sidelines for a similar offence, this time a late challenge on Van der Sar - but the final word was left to Liverpool and youngster Ngog.</p>
              <p>As United pressed forward in numbers, Liverpool broke and Ngog finished with composure from Lucas's pass to set the seal on a day that went almost perfectly to the script for besieged Benitez.</p>

              <p>How come Torres suddenly fit to play? That changed things alot. As usual Vidic cant keep up with Torres pace and collect some more red cards.</p>
              <p>Maybe history repeats itself. Pool beat the champions then next game lose to relegation team. Pool seems to be contended just being able to beat the other top 3 esp MU when its the same 3 points whether its a top or bottom team</p>

              <p>you said it yourself. "super loyal nut". Loyalty only goes a reasonable distance and no rational person would short change himself just for that. And end of the day, he didn't betray liverpool, he went to the best team that wanted him after liverpool didn't want him.</p>
              <p>And since we're on the page of being a super loyal, you might as well say he should play in any league/competition where his team would be opposed to liverpool.</p>
