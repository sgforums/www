              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Jose Mourinho faces a UEFA investigation after Real Madrid were accused of having two players deliberately sent off at</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Ajax</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Both Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos were dismissed in the dying stages for time-wasting - despite Real comfortably leading 4-0 in</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Holland</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Both players were shown second yellows, meaning they will miss the meaningless final game against Auxerre next month. They are now guaranteed to be available for the start of the crunch knockout stages.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">UEFA, European football's governing body, confirmed they will now probe the incidents in Tuesday's Champions League clash at the Amsterdam Arena.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">UEFA said its disciplinary unit will look at the incidents after receiving Thomson's official report. Under article 5.1 of UEFA's regulations dealing with loyalty, integrity and sportsmanship both players could be charged and have their suspensions extended.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Mourinho attempted to thrust the standard of Scottish refereeing in the spotlight again by trying to justify the sending offs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The former</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Chelsea</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">boss claimed he was puzzled by official Craig Thomson's decision to show Alonso and Ramos their second yellow cards for time-wasting.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">But Dutch TV coverage showed Mourinho speaking to Alonso moments before his dismissal. And Spanish newspaper Marca published pictures of Mourinho passing a spoken message to Ramos via goalkeepers Jerzy Dudek and Iker Casillas.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Casillas claimed: 'Dudek was asking me about my stomach problems. I told Ramos to keep an eye on one of their strikers, who was a constant threat inside the area.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ramos insisted Real had not hatched a plan to ensure both players would be dismissed despite shaking the referee's hand after being sent off. He was dismissed for having taken an age to take a goalkick after spending several seconds adjusting his socks.</span></p>

              <div><em>UEFA probe Mourinho and Real Madrid over stars that were 'deliberately' sent off. <span>Both Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos were dismissed in the dying stages for time-wasting when they were leading 4-0.</span></em></div>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>'We didn't go looking for the cards,' Ramos said. 'Seeing what the score was, the referee could have saved them. But he sent me off and that's  that.'</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Paisley-born Thomson's decision to give Ramos and Alonso their marching orders put the performances of Scottish referees in the headlines again.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Referees in</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Scotland</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">are currently on strike at the amount of recent public criticism and pressure they have received for their officiating in the Scottish Premier League.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Scottish Football Association are still attempting to avoid the referees' planned walkout for this weekend by meeting with the officials on Wednesday.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Mourinho, meanwhile, when asked about the red cards of Alonso and Ramos, claimed Thomson had made some 'strange' decisions and claimed it was an 'easy game to control' for the Scot.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Real manager said: 'I spoke with many players throughout the game, not only with Ramos and Alonso.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'Stories sell, but the important thing is the 4-0 win and the fantastic game we had. Let’s talk about that and not other things.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'The sendings-off came after an easy game where the referee has shown some strange yellows.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'They are cards that I don’t like. It was an easy game to control.</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Ajax</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">made a lot of fouls and in the first from Ramos he was shown a yellow card.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Portuguese coach admitted it did not matter that Alonso and Ramos would miss their final meaningless group game at home to Auxerre but insisted he still wanted to beat the French side when they meet at the Bernabeu in December.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">He added: 'The red cards we picked up don’t matter hugely as we have already qualified ahead of the next game against Auxerre. If Ramos and Alonso can’t play against Auxerre then there will be others, but we are not going to gift the game to the French. We want to win them all.'</span></p>

              <p>It's a smart plan actually because their yellow cards will be carried over to the knockout stages until they hit 3 yellow card.</p>
              <p>So since Real Madrid has already qualified and since Ramos and Alonso are 1 card away from suspension, might as well get sent off and "clear" the suspension at the meaningless match against Auxerr so that they can start the knockout stage "fresh" with 0 yellow cards to their names.</p>
              <p><strong>According to UEFA Champions League rule:</strong></p>
              <p>Article 21<br>Yellow and red cards</p>
              <p><br>21.01 As a rule, a player who is sent off the field of play is suspended for the next<br>match in a UEFA club competition. The Control and Disciplinary Body is<br>entitled to augment this punishment. For serious offences the punishment<br>can be extended to all UEFA competition categories.</p>
              <p><br>21.02 In case of repeated cautions, a player is suspended for the next competition<br>match:<br>a) after two cautions in two different qualifying matches, as well as after the<br>fourth caution during the qualifying phase;<br>b) <strong>from the first match in the group stage, after three cautions in three<br>different matches, as well as following any subsequent odd-numbered<br>caution (fifth, seventh, ninth, etc.)</strong>.</p>
              <p><br><strong>21.03 Single yellow cards and pending suspensions are always carried forward either to the next stage of the competition or to another club competition in the current season.</strong></p>
              <p><br>21.04 Exceptionally, single cautions from the qualifying phase that have not<br>resulted in a suspension expire on completion of the qualifying phase in<br>question.</p>
              <p><br>21.05 Cautions and pending yellow-card suspensions from club competition<br>matches expire at the end of the season.</p>

              <p>But the Arsenal boss insisted that after seeing Real Madrid allegedly do just that in Tuesday's Champions League game at Ajax, he would never contemplate such a "horrible" deceit.</p>
              <p>Real coach Jose Mourinho and four of his players have been charged by UEFA with improper conduct following an investigation into events towards the end of their 4-0 Champions League win at the Amsterdam Arena on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Mourinho is accused of instructing midfielder Xabi Alonso and defender Sergio Ramos to pick up second yellow cards towards the end of the match.</p>
              <p>Both were sent off for time-wasting, earning them suspensions for next week's Group G dead rubber against Auxerre and wiping out their disciplinary records ahead of the knockout stage.</p>
              <p>The duo and team-mates Iker Casillas and Jerzy Dudek, who allegedly relayed Mourinho's orders, were the four players charged by UEFA.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Mourinho has denied issuing such instructions.</strong></p>
              <p>But Wenger called for European football's governing body to punish the former Chelsea boss and his players if found guilty, despite conceding such action had occurred to him.</p>
              <p>The Gunners supremo said: "You never say that it doesn't cross your mind, and you have to be completely honest about it.</p>
              <p>"But when you see how it looks on television, I must say, what happened there is the best demonstration to think, 'Never do that again'.</p>
              <p>"For yourself as well, never envisage to do that because it looks, frankly, horrible.</p>
              <p>"But it crosses your mind if two games later you play the biggest game of the season and you have a meaningless game just after and the players can be suspended."</p>
              <p>He added: "It's a pity to see that from a big club. You can call it what you want, but it's not what you want to see on a football pitch.</p>
              <p>"It's always the same — on a football pitch, you want to respect people who pay money to watch a football game.</p>
              <p>"What they want is to watch football, not to watch these kinds of things.</p>
              <p>"If it's Arsenal or Real Madrid, or anybody else, you don't want to accept that."</p>

              <p>The Real Madrid coach taunted his rival over Arsenal's failure to win a trophy in the last five years.</p>
              <p>Mourinho rapped: "He should especially explain to Arsenal supporters how he can't win one single little trophy since 2005."</p>
              <p>The former Chelsea boss was retaliating after Wenger denounced Real's controversial time-wasting tactics at Ajax on Tuesday, which saw two of the Spanish giants' players conveniently sent off.</p>
              <p>He also mocked the Gunners' 2-0 midweek Champions League defeat by Braga, which has left Arsenal in danger of crashing out, and slammed the Frenchman's claims his side is still mostly inexperienced.</p>
              <p>Mourinho added: "Instead of speaking about Real Madrid, Mr Wenger should speak about Arsenal and explain how he lost 2-0 against a team in the Champions League for the first time.</p>
              <p>"The history about the young kids is getting old now. "Sagna, Clichy, Walcott, Fabregas, Song, Nasri, Van Persie, Arshavin are NOT kids. They are all top players." </p>
              <p>Wenger has angered his old Premier League adversary after slamming Real's antics near the end of their 4-0 win in Amsterdam.</p>
              <p>Mourinho and four of his players have been charged by UEFA with improper conduct.</p>
              <p>The Real chief is accused of instructing midfielder Xabi Alonso and defender Sergio Ramos to pick up second yellow cards deliberately and be sent off so they will be banned for their team's 'dead' final Group G clash with Auxerre and then take clean disciplinary records into the knockout stage.</p>
              <p>Mourinho pleads not guilty but Wenger hit out: "It's a pity to see that from a big club. It looks, frankly, horrible. You don't want to accept that."</p>

              <p><strong>Getting frisky</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>In one of many spiky encounters with Barcelona, Mourinho accused Frank Rijkaard, the Barcelona coach, of making a visit to the room of Anders Frisk, the referee, at half-time during their Champions League clash at the Nou Camp in 2005.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>Mourinho complained to Uefa, and in the ensuing maelstrom Frisk announced his retirement after receiving email death threats over the issue. Volker Rioth, the head of Uefa’s referee committee, branded Mourinho “an enemy of football.” Mourinho was handed a two-match touchline ban.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p><strong>Hat's not football</strong></p>
              <p>Mourinho allegedly overcame his two match touchline ban in scenes more reminiscent of <em>Last of the Summer Wine</em> than top level football. During the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final with Bayern Munich at Stamford Bridge, Mourinho’s fitness coach Rui Faria was seen wearing an ill-fitting woolly hat and often scratching his ear, raising suspicions that he was wearing an ear piece with his manager feeding him instructions.</p>
              <p>Further skullduggery was alleged in the second half, when Silvinho Louro, the goalkeeping coach, was seen repeatedly going to and from the dressing room, carrying pieces of paper – his arrival coinciding with a number of substitutions in the 4-2 win.</p>
              <p><strong>Cleaning up the game</strong></p>
              <p>The best allegation of the Bayern saga was saved for last when reports suggested that Mourinho allegedly hid in a laundry basket used for transporting the club's kit to get round the Uefa ban. It was claimed that Mourinho arrived early at the ground, watched the game on a TV in a dressing room and delivered the pre-match and halftime talks.</p>
              <p>Then, 10 minutes before the end of the game, Mourinho clambered into one of the laundry skips and was then wheeled away to the Stamford Bridge leisure club where it was claimed he had spent the entire evening.</p>
              <p><strong>Voyeur of the beautiful game</strong></p>
              <p>Having become increasingly annoyed by comments from Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger about his Chelsea team, Mourinho hit out at what he perceived was an obsession by the Frenchman. He claimed he had compiled a 120-page dossier of Wenger remarks and labelled the Gunners manager a 'voyeur'.</p>
              <p>Mourinho said in typical style: "He is someone who likes to watch other people. There are some guys who have this big telescope to see what happens in other families. He must be one of them." Wenger responded by saying: "When you give success to stupid people, it makes them more stupid sometimes and not more intelligent."</p>
              <p><strong>Giving them the finger</strong></p>
              <p>During the 2005 Carling Cup final Mourinho celebrated Chelsea’s late equaliser against Liverpool – a own goal from Steven Gerrard – by sauntering down the touchline in front of the massed Liverpool fans and placing his finger to his lips in a ‘shush’ motion. Mourinho later claimed that, despite where he had been stood, the 'shush’ was actually directed at the English press.</p>
