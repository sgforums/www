              <h1>Schuster To Quit Madrid Next Summer - Report</h1>
              <h2>Bernd Schuster will not stay on as coach of Real Madrid beyond the end of this season because he cannot stand the interfering of Ramón Calderón and Predrag Mijatovic.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/33578_news.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The German coach began to question whether he would stay for a second term within weeks of taking over but winning the title eased all the tension that had been building within the club, according to Sport.<br></strong><br>But the new season has seen Schuster, who penned a two-year deal with the option for a further season, revert to doing things that president Calderón does not like and neither party are keen to exercise the option of the trainer staying for a third year that is in his contract.<br><br>While Calderón gave the coach a rise after winning the title because he credited him with the success, unlike the previous season when he believed the players and not Fabo Capello had changed things.<br><br>Schuster's lack of humour and resistance to speak at leisure with the media has caused divisions and now the club believe that he is playing games with Raúl's place in the team.<br><br>After demanding that a new striker was signed in the summer, the former Barça, Atlético and Madrid playmaker is keen to add more strength to his forward line from the squad that he has.<br><br>Raúl was dropped from the team against Zenit, despite Schuster claiming in a press conference before the game that he would field the same side that won at Real Betis four days before.<br><br>Mijatovic and Calderón are also a problem for the trainer as he views them as being too vociferous on team affairs and not truly listening to what he needs and wants to improve things even further.<br><br>While he is keen to improve his résumé at the club, Schuster knows that he would find it difficult staying for a third term and the feeling is said to be mutual from those in the boardroom.</p>
