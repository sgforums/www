              <p> </p>
              <p>Kolo Toure has arrived at the City of Manchester Stadium to undergo his medical as the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal </span></a>defender looks set to complete his £15million move to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester City</span></a>.</p>
              <p>The 28-year-old is believed to have agreed a £120,000-a-week deal deal after Arsene Wenger confirmed on Tuesday, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/index.html"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: #003580;">Sportsmail's</span></span></a> exclusive story that the Ivorian is the latest big name player to leave the club this summer joining Emmanuel Adebayor.</p>
              <p>'We will see what's happening in the next 24 hours, nothing is decided yet,' said the Frenchman.</p>
              <p>'We have seven centre-backs and I am in the position where I have to play some in midfield but of course Kolo is a very good player and we will see what will happen in the next 24 hours.'</p>

              <p><strong>Toure played for Arsenal on Monday night in a pre-season friendly in Hungary. The move would take City boss Mark Hughes' spending close to the £100million mark.</strong></p>
              <p>But the spree will not stop there, with <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/everton.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Everton </span></a>defender Joleon Lescott and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/west-ham-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">West Ham</span></a>'s Matthew Upson also in their sights, while reports in France link them to Roma's Philippe Mexes.</p>
              <p>Arsenal by contrast have made just one signing, central defender Thomas Vermaelen from Ajax, and have also sold Emmanuel Adebayor to City for £25m.</p>
              <p>Wenger hinted that he will make more signings before the transfer window closes.</p>
              <p>'I am more focused on getting everybody fit for the start of the season but we are looking at opportunities as well,' he said.</p>
              <p>'There are still some pre-season games to see what we really need. When the time comes we will do something.'</p>

              <p>i discover Man City actually hunt for players who they think it's instrucmental for that team .</p>
              <p>Especially if that team possessed threats to MC surge for their Top-4 .</p>
              <p>They took Adebayor and Toure from Arsenal , so Arsenal is very much weakened .</p>
              <p>Before that , they signed Barry from Villa , Villa will be weakened without their former skipper .</p>
              <p>Then they wanted to sign Lescott , whom i thought , is very important to Everton .</p>
              <p>They also signed Santa Cruz , which is an important man to Rovers ...So which position did Everton , Arsenal , Villa lies last season ?</p>

              <p>i discover Man City actually hunt for players who they think

              <p>Especially if that team possessed threats to MC surge
              for their Top-4 .</p>
              <p>They took Adebayor and Toure from Arsenal , so Arsenal is very
              much weakened .</p>
              <p>Before that , they signed Barry from Villa , Villa will be
              weakened without their former skipper .</p>
              <p>Then they wanted to sign Lescott , whom i thought , is very
              important to Everton .</p>
              <p>They also signed Santa Cruz , which is an important man to
              Rovers ...So which position did Everton , Arsenal , Villa lies

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Welcome: Kolo Toure with City boss Mark Hughes</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1202743" rel="1202743|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1202743/PICTURE-SPECIAL-Kolo-Toure-signs-year-deal-Manchester-City--19m-Lescott.html"> </a></p>
              <p><strong>Manchester City failed with a £19million bid for Everton's Joleon Lescott on Wednesday night after completing the signing of Kolo Toure from Arsenal.</strong></p>
              <p>Manager Mark Hughes showed his determination to beef up his options at the back with an increased offer for the England man after an earlier £15m deal was rejected. </p>
              <p>An Everton statement read: 'We can confirm we have received an offer of £18million for Joleon Lescott from Manchester City and that offer has been rejected outright.'</p>
              <p>Hughes has also given Nedum Onuoha a new five-year contract.</p>
              <p>Barry, a £12m signing from Aston Villa and candidate for the City captaincy, was carried off amid fears he had suffered a serious injury but later walked unaided to his car after it was discovered he had suffered only bruising.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/07/29/article-1202743-05E174F4000005DC-730_468x290.jpg" alt="Shake on it: Arsenal defender Kolo Toure arrives in Manchester to undergo a medical ahead of his £15million switch to Manchester City" width="468" height="290">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Shake on it: Arsenal defender Kolo Toure arrives in Manchester to undergo a medical ahead of his £15million switch to Manchester City</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em></em></p>
              </div>
              <p>That left Hughes to carry on with the more pleasurable tasks of completing the £15m transfer of Toure, 28. The Ivorian, who will earn £90,000 a week, became City's sixth summer signing after passing a medical yesterday and Hughes said: 'It is no secret that I have been looking to strengthen the defence, and in Kolo I feel we have recruited a world-class player. He brings a wealth of Premier League experience.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/07/29/article-1202743-05E30BED000005DC-949_233x527.jpg" alt="Last of the Invincibles" width="233" height="527"></div>
              <p><strong>'Kolo has been a central figure in a very strong Arsenal team for many years, and I have been an admirer of him for a long time. He is strong, quick, reads the game well and will be an influential figure in the dressing room.'</strong></p>
              <p>Toure said: 'It's always difficult to leave a place where you have spent the last eight years and had good times but I felt the time was right for a new challenge. I am at an age, 28, where I feel I am at my peak and will play my best football.'</p>
              <p>Hughes will be happy, too, with Onuoha's commitment, which will see him earn £65,000 a week. He is one of the most promising and popular players in the dressing room.</p>
              <p>Hughes was impressed with how he slipped in at centre half last season after Micah Richards was moved to right back and also with his showing for England in the European Under 21 Championship in Sweden.</p>
