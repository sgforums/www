              <p>The <em>Sunday Times</em> says City have agreed personal terms
              with Toure as the Premier League’s most affluent football club continue
              their assault on the English transfer market. City expect to sign
              Toure, Joleon Lescott (<abbr><span class="glossary-term">Everton</span></abbr>) and John Terry (<abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>) by the end of August for combined fees of around £100m.</p>
              <p>Occasional <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> captain Toure has been seduced by City’s standard double-your-money
              offer and following a season in which he was not consistently Arsene
              Wenger’s first choice should be sold for around £15m.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester City </strong></span></a><strong>last night edged closer to signing England and </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span></a><strong> captain John Terry for a British record transfer fee of £35million.</strong></p>
              <p>And City's most recent signing, £25m striker Emmanuel Adebayor, said he believed Terry would follow him to Eastlands.</p>
              <p>Adebayor said: 'I think there is a big possibility John will join us.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">'People didn't believe six months ago that Carlos Tevez or myself would be playing here. We have come to Manchester City to be THE big team. Why shouldn't John be persuaded to come here, too?'</p>
              </div>
              <p>New Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti has staked his credibility on Terry staying at Stamford Bridge and resisting the temptation to double his £135,000-a-week wages by moving to City.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/07/25/article-0-0240F892000005DC-663_468x405.jpg" alt="John Terry" width="468" height="405"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Eastlands bound? John Terry could be off to City for a British record transfer fee</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Terry's refusal again yesterday to commit himself publicly to Chelsea has strengthened City's confidence that he will return to England this week with an open mind, despite Chelsea trying to force him to declare his intentions.</strong></p>
              <p>But Ancelotti, speaking in the United States after Chelsea had defeated his former club AC Milan 2-1 with goals by Didier Drogba and £18m debutant Yuri Zhirkov, said: 'For sure, Terry will stay at Chelsea. We have never had a problem. You have to have trust in me.'</p>
              <p>Moments later Terry left the M and T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, without offering as much as a word about his future.</p>
              <p>Chelsea appear confident Terry will not risk ruining his reputation as 'Mr Chelsea' by asking for a transfer, which is the only way they would allow him to leave. A source close to Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich said: 'I think he will stay.'</p>
              <p>And Drogba, asked if he would take over as captain if Terry departed, insisted: 'He's not going to leave. He's our captain. There's only one captain.'</p>
              <p>But City think Chelsea's attempts to force Terry into a corner could backfire and regard his failure to talk throughout the team's pre-season tour of America as a sign he wants to investigate further the prospect of moving to the north-west.</p>
              <p>After a third and final World Football Challenge match in Dallas early tomorrow morning against Mexican side Club America, Chelsea return home with less than two weeks to go before the Community Shield against champions Manchester United.</p>
              <p>It is unthinkable that Terry would be allowed to go into that game without having reached a decision, and the situation is expected to be resolved before Saturday's friendly at Reading.</p>

              <p><em>On the move: Kolo Toure has ended several months of speculation by agreeing to sign for Manchester City</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester City </strong></span></a><strong>moved on from the disappointment of missing out on England captain John Terry by striking a £15million deal for Arsenal defender Kolo Toure.</strong></p>
              <p>The 28-year-old has agreed personal terms of around<span style="color: #000000;"> £120,000 per week — </span>doubling his wages at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal</span></a>. He is expected to be unveiled later this week and could even figure in Saturday’s friendly at Barnsley.</p>
              <p>His signing ends a nine-month pursuit by City manager Mark Hughes who first earmarked the Ivory Coast centre half back in November. Toure is one of three defenders Hughes wants to bring in as he re-assesses his targets following Terry’s decision to stay at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span></a>.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/everton.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Everton’s</span></a> Joleon Lescott remains in his sights, despite Everton being reluctant to sell, and Hughes is also considering a move for <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/west-ham-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">West Ham’s</span></a> Matthew Upson.</p>
              <p>Toure’s capture is still seen as a significant step forward by City’s hierarchy. Despite an indifferent past season he was viewed as a key member of Arsenal’s squad and his departure from the Emirates, so quick on the heels of that of Emmanuel Adebayor, seriously weakens another of City’s rivals for a place in the Premier League top four.</p>
              <p>Toure asked to be placed on the transfer list in January after a bust-up with fellow defender William Gallas. City made several attempts to sign him but in the end decided to shelve their efforts until the summer.</p>
              <p>Hughes still wants another two midfielders as City’s big spending continues.</p>
              <p>Depleted Arsenal, who also look likely to offload Philippe Senderos, may now make a move for Fulham’s Brede Hangeland.</p>

              <p><strong>Ironically, Toure wore the captain’s armband on his last appearance for the Gunners — Monday night’s 5-0 win over Hungarians Szombathelyi Haladas as Arsenal continued their pre-season preparations in Europe.</strong></p>
              <p>The capture of Toure will help solve City’s central defensive problems caused by the loss of form of Richard Dunne and Micah Richards, but not the leadership issue.</p>
              <p>Richard Dunne proved himself to be a less than adequate captain last season as Hughes wrestled with problems with players such as the Brazilians Elano and Robinho. In pursuing Terry, Hughes had intended to cure that.</p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>Arsenal’s worries in central defence, meanwhile, run far deeper. </strong><strong>Toure’s exit could be followed also by the loss of William Gallas, who is being pursued by Lazio.</strong></p>
              <p>Wenger has signed Ajax’s Belgium stopper Thomas Vermaelen but Johan Djourou will now have to step up and prove himself capable of dominating Premier League strikers if no other replacements are signed.</p>
              <p>Certainly there is some unease in the Arsenal camp and their £15m Russia winger Andrey Arshavin identified a real challenge for a Champions League place next season.</p>
              <p>He said: 'Manchester City, Everton, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/aston-villa.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Aston Villa</span></a> and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Tottenham</span></a> will join the contest, as well as <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United</span></a>, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool</span></a> and Chelsea.’</p>

              <p><strong>Kolo Touré is scheduled to leave </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/arsenal"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Arsenal</strong></span></a><strong>'s training camp in Austria this evening to fly back to England to complete his move to </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Manchester City</strong></span></a><strong> after the two clubs agreed a fee of £14m for the defender.</strong></p>
              <p>Touré is expected to fly directly into Manchester to take a medical examination tomorrow and finalise the personal terms of a contract that will see him join the growing band of players at City who earn in excess of £100,000 a week.</p>
              <p>He will become the second Arsenal player to move from Arsenal to City this summer, following Emmanuel Adebayor for a combined outlay of £39m. In total, City have now made six signings in preparation for the new season, with Roque Santa Cruz, Gareth Barry, Carlos Tevez and Stuart Taylor being added to the club's payroll for a total of £94m. An extensive recruitment programme, overseen by the billionaire Abu Dhabi royal family, has been offset by the departure of 12 players, but Touré's imminent arrival consolidates City's position as the biggest spenders in the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span></a> by some distance this summer.</p>
              <p>To put it into context, Manchester United have spent around £17m in the same period, despite banking £80m from Real Madrid for the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo. Chelsea have spent around £20m whereas Liverpool have made only one major signing, Portsmouth's Glen Johnson, for £18m and Arsenal have made a considerable profit, their one big-money recruit being Thomas Vermalen, Ajax's Belgium international defender, for £10m.</p>
              <p>City now hope to take their summer spending well beyond the £100m mark by prising their last remaining target, Joleon Lescott, away from Everton, their interest in the player remaining enthusiastic despite his club steadfastly refusing to offer them any positive signs. Information has reached City that Lescott is determined to go through with the transfer but it is also clear that the process of extracting him from a club of Everton's own ambitions may have some distance to go, and will be considerably more complicated than the negotiations for Touré.</p>
