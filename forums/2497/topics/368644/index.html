              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">GARETH BARRY has hit back at accusations by Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez that his move to Manchester City was motivated by money.</h2>
              <p class="article">The midfielder, a £12million signing from Aston Villa, claims that City's other big signings justified his decision to go to Eastlands.</p>
              <p class="article">Barry's switch to City last month was a snub to Liverpool, who had made no secret of their long-standing interest in the England man.</p>
              <p class="article">Anfield chief Rafael Benitez criticised the decision, suggesting it was all about "money, money, money."</p>
              <p class="article">But Barry said: "I think there was maybe a bit of frustration because it was well documented that Liverpool were in the market to sign me for a couple of years.</p>
              <p class="article">"But Manchester City had agreed a fee with Aston Villa. Once I'd spoken to the manager, heard the ambition and he told me what the club were aiming for, that suited me.</p>
              <p class="article">"People can talk about the money because of the speculation in the media but the players who are now joining City are proving my decision to be correct.</p>
              <p class="article">"These are players who are really going to improve Manchester City and take us to where we want to go."</p>
              <p class="article">Barry was speaking on City's pre-season tour of South Africa ahead of their first game against Orlando Pirates on Saturday.</p>

              <div class="imageExtras"><span class="caption"><em>Defensive midfielder: Gareth Barry says his big-money move to Manchester City was not about cash, as Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez claimed.</em></span></div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>To Rafael Benitez and countless others, the answer is simple: "Money, money, money. The transfer was 100 per cent about money."</strong></p>
              <p>The charge of greed is one that City, and all associated with them, cannot escape. Carlos Tevez, persuaded to swap red for blue in Manchester, John Terry, his head apparently turned by the riches on offer at Eastlands, and Barry, delaying his dream of playing in the Champions League for at least one more season, all stand accused of measuring bank balance above trophy cabinet.</p>
              <p>Barry, of course, is adamant his new club do not represent a sinecure, little more than a sky blue pension plan. It is easy to scoff, at least until the subject turns to the tortuous saga of last summer's abortive move to Liverpool.</p>
              <p>The disappointment still rankles. In a year when he thought he would be winning over the Kop, Barry instead had to win back the Holte End. His move was not about wages. City offered him what he wanted, simply because they wanted him.</p>
              <p>"I found Rafa Benitez's comments a bit disrespectful," Barry said. "By that stage my decision was made and people should move on. There was genuine interest from Liverpool and I think he's probably just upset I chose City.</p>
              <p>"I've been in the Premier League for 10 years, more, and the money I've been paid is phenomenal compared to your average, everyday working man. You live and work away from normal life anyway, so money's not a big factor.</p>
              <p>"The difference was that City made me feel wanted. Liverpool had a chance to buy me last season but failed to pay the money, and only found it this year when they knew someone else had reached an agreement.</p>
              <p>"There was a feeling of being let down. Excuses were made about things going on behind the scenes and in the boardroom, but I came out of it looking like a bad person. It took a long time for me to get back into the squad at Villa afterwards. It was tough to deal with.</p>
              <p>"That's why there's nothing better than a club making you feel wanted and getting a deal done in days. It's not about money, it's about the chance to be part of something big from the very beginning at a club who really want you."</p>
              <p>Speaking in the opulence of Abu Dhabi's seven-star Emirates Palace hotel – as a guest of City's new sponsors, Etihad Airways – Barry knows he is an easy target. But his new club's plans for global expansion are proof enough for the England international that he is where he should be.</p>
              <p>"Most people would snap your arm off to do what I've done, but for me to be able to say my career was successful I need to have some trophies and some medals in my cabinet when I finish," Barry said.</p>
              <p>That would be achieved quicker if he was joined at Eastlands by Terry. Hughes "looked me in the eye when I signed and said he was confident of getting players like that, and in quantity", Barry admits, "and that they've even gone for him shows City mean business".</p>
              <p>Such a coup would surely cast off the image of City as the foolish, naive nouveaux riches, established in those regrettable few days, in the immediate aftermath of Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan's takeover, when Sulaiman Al-Fahim, quickly dismissed, spoke of £134 million bids for Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>Hughes is clearly working to a plan. Barry has been taken from the bosom of Aston Villa, most likely City's strongest competitors to break the Big Four cartel, and from the fingertips of Liverpool. Tevez's arrival hurt Manchester United, the departures of Terry and Adebayor may yet damage Arsenal and Chelsea. Hughes is systematically weakening his opposition.</p>
              <p>"Taking their best players hinders them and strengthens us," admits Barry, "but it's not about signing the very best players, it's about gelling them together."</p>
              <p>The spending spree must excite, though? "When Tevez has just trained for the first time and you turn on the TV and suddenly Adebayor's in talks, you think: 'They're not messing about, are they?' Even for a player, you wonder what's going to happen next."</p>

              <h1>O'Neill: Liverpool Never Made A Bid For Barry</h1>
              <h2>'MON' is not sure why Rafa Benitez is complaining about Barry's move, given that Villa never received a bid from the Reds.</h2>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/50359_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="281"></p>
              <p>Martin O'Neill, the Aston Villa manager, has claimed that Liverpool lost out on Gareth Barry because they were too complacent in their bid to sign him him. <br><br>Rafa Benitez hit out at Barry for being 'greedy' after he chose to join Manchester City, but O'Neill saw things differently.<br><br>He told <em>The Daily Express</em>, "Did Liverpool take it for granted that Gareth Barry would sign for them? They may well have done.<br><br>"And they missed out on Barry for that reason? They may well have done.<br><br>"All
              I will say is that I said to Barry’s agent for us not to have the same
              debacle as last year, that they were perfectly at liberty to speak, I
              assumed to the top four teams. Liverpool were aware of the price we
              were asking if that was the case.<br><br>"Liverpool did not contact us directly at all in this matter and never offered any money for him.<br><br>"So the impression I got was that eventually it was a straight choice."<br><br>O'Neill
              then admitted that Barry's decision had taken him by surprise,
              continuing, "I am not protecting anyone here because it doesn’t really
              matter.<br><br>"I said I was a bit surprised because Barry had
              mentioned playing in the Champions League as a reason for going, that’s
              a person’s prerogative, but Liverpool had not put a bid in."</p>
