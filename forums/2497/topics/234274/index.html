            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://soccernet-att.espn.go.com/design05/i/players/13069.jpg"><br><br><strong>Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech wants manager Jose Mourinho to stay at the club and believes winning trophies will help keep him there.</strong><br><br>The Czech Republic keeper, recently returned after three months out with a skull fracture, steered clear of commenting on tensions between Mourinho and the Chelsea board during a news conference before Sunday's FA Cup tie against Nottingham Forest.<br><br>But with Mourinho's future under discussion almost daily in the British press, he said at the club's training ground: "I think it's important to keep the best manager and best players at the club." The 24-year-old is focusing on what happens on the pitch. "It's not in my hands to change something in the club," he added.<br><br>"We want to do the best for our manager and for the club and you want to do the best for yourself too... But of course for the manager it's a good help if you keep winning too," said Cech, who returned to action last weekend wearing a protective skull cap.<br><br>Cech conceded two goals at Liverpool in the Premier League, in his first game back but kept a clean sheet in Chelsea's 4-0 win over lowly Wycombe in the League Cup semi-final last Tuesday. Chelsea, who trail Manchester United by six points after some indifferent recent Premier League form, are still in competition for four trophies, including the Champions League.<br><br>Cech said Mourinho had been his staunchest supporter since he and the Portuguese arrived in 2004. "When he came to the club I arrived as a new player and he gave me the confidence to play and he's been doing the same for two and a half years. This for me is the best form in my career. And when you have the manager on your side and he trusts you it's important."<br><br>Cech started the season with a shoulder problem and was taken to hospital last October after a sickening collision with Reading winger Stephen Hunt. He needed surgery on his skull but says he is now fully recovered.<br><br>"I feel really good," he said. "In terms of physical strength and speed and reactions I might be even better than before because I've been really working hard for a long period and it's made me stronger. "I have not even a little doubt about the injury. I just don't think about it," he said.<br></div>
