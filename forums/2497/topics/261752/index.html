            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Stuart Pearce spoke of his disappointment at racist abuse directed towards Nedum Onuoha, but insisted his side would rise above the controversy to focus on their semi-final with Holland.</strong><br><br>Onuoha - Pearce's former charge at Manchester City - was subjected to racist abuse from Serbian fans in Nijmegen, and goalscorer Leroy Lita alleged after the game that Justin Hoyte had also been targeted in the tunnel.<br><br>Whilst registering his unhappiness at the incidents, Pearce called on his side to put the row behind them and make it a summer to remember in the European Under 21 Championship.<br><br>"I didn't hear it myself but obviously the people on the bench heard it [abuse towards Onuoha]," Pearce told the website. "There is no doubt about that.<br><br>"It's very, very disappointing, The FA have to do whatever they deem necessary to do.<br><br>"I think one or two things were said, but as far as we are concerned, as a group of people, we feel we are above that to be quite honest with you.<br><br>"We have got out of the group, we have kept a clean sheet and we have won 2-0 in a game that lacked a bit of 'oomph'. We like to feel as though the incident is put to bed.<br><br>"The score is 2-0, we have reached the semi-final and that is all we are concentrating on.<br><br>"We have two matches left this summer hopefully, and we have to win both of them, I'm delighted with the players' input today."<br><br>Both sets of players also clashed on the field after Matt Derbyshire infuriated the Serbian side by scoring the second goal whilst a defender lay injured on the turf.<br><br>However, Pearce defended his striker to the hilt at the end of a controversial night in Nijmegen.<br><br>"Serbia were disappointed, they felt we should have kicked the ball out of play but I don't think Matty's actually seen the lad down," Pearce added.<br><br>"If he has seen him down, then in the Premier League we are told to keep playing and the referee deals with that, if he had seen him he might have put it out."<br><br>Blackburn Rovers striker Derbyshire insisted he did not see the Serbian player lying injured, as he was so focused on claiming the second goal of the game.<br><br>"To be honest with I didn't see the player on the floor, all I was looking at was Kieran [Richardson] and bending my run into goal so I didn't see him there," said Derbyshire.<br><br>"At the end of the day I played on to the whistle and luckily we got through to the semi-final. At the end of the day as a professional footballer, even in training, you carry on playing until the whistle blows, definitely."<br><br>Derbyshire also admitted he knew nothing of allegations he had been spat at in the tunnel ruckus that erupted after the final whistle, adding: "No I didn't have a clue. It's just handbags, people don't like to lose, they are sore losers and that's about it really."</div>

We knew they were going to do something in the end, so it was a bit unfortunate that we got into that but the lads reacted well.<br><br>"Justin took a lot of stick and he is not very happy but as I said to him we can't worry about things like that, you just move on."<br><br>Manchester City defender Onuoha also stated that he was aware of racist abuse spilling from the stands in Nijmegen.<br><br>"I was [aware of it] but it didn't stop me playing the game, I think Uefa will deal with it and I will just carry on," said Onuoha.<br><br>"I've had it before in the past, I suppose the world is a changing place, maybe it will eventually stop, but until then we just have to deal with it."<br><br>A Uefa spokesman added: "We will be waiting to receive the delegate's report before instigating any disciplinary proceedings.<br><br>"Uefa condemn all types of discrimination and have a series of disciplinary measures which can be imposed to help combat such unacceptable behaviour."</div>
