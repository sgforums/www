              <h1>Blue Murder! More misery for Benitez as Gerrard is crocked in Chelsea rout</h1>
              <p><img id="mainpic" src="http://images.football365.com/09/04/Others/305365.jpg" alt="Gerrard Feels His Groin..." width="224" height="193"></p>
              <p><em>Gerrard will have a scan on his groin today</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Steven Gerrard will go to hospital for a scan on his groin today after Liverpool’s Champions League dream was crushed by Chelsea at Anfield last night.</strong></p>
              <p>Liverpool captain Gerrard, who was marked out of the game by Michael Essien, left the field in pain at the end of their 3-1 quarter-final drubbing and the club fear bad news.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">The midfielder had surgery on his groin last August and the fresh concern over his fitness added to a night of misery inflicted by two Branislav Ivanovic headers and a Didier Drogba strike after Fernando Torres had given Rafael Benitez’s side a sixth-minute lead.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Gerrard had a poor game and could be out for some time, destabilising Liverpool’s season and giving more reason for Chelsea to expect to advance to the last four. The teams meet in the second leg of the tie on Tuesday, when Chelsea’s away goals should see them through.</p>

              <div><span><strong>Liverpool are awaiting the results of a scan that could rule skipper Steven Gerrard out of the Champions League quarter-final second leg at Chelsea. Gerrard had the scan on his troublesome groin problem on Thursday afternoon, and the club may not have the results until Friday morning.</strong> </span></div>

              <div id="articlebody">
              <p>The 29-year-old arrived on Thursday morning at the club's Melwood training complex for fitness tests which were reviewed by Liverpool's medical team before it was decided he needed a scan.</p>
              <p>The England midfielder struggled with the injury during Wednesday night's 3-1 first-leg defeat by Chelsea, when he was man-marked by Michael Essien.</p>
              <p>Gerrard was sidelined in February with a hamstring injury sustained in the FA Cup trilogy with Everton, and he has also suffered previous groin problems this term.</p>
              <p>Before the Chelsea defeat there had been fears Gerrard was still struggling from the ankle injury that forced his precautionary exit from Saturday's win at Fulham. But Gerrard trained with the squad on Monday and Tuesday, and was passed fit to play.</p>
              <p>But now Liverpool are bracing themselves for Gerrard missing Saturday's home Premier League game with Blackburn as well as the quarter-final second leg at Stamford Bridge next Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez was concerned about his captain's fitness after the Blues match. He said after the game: "Steven was not 100%, you could see that. It was the same for Fernando Torres, you could see that they were a little tired, not as sharp as before. "But they have been playing well and we felt it was okay to use them both in this game. We need them.</p>

              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez faces a critical decision on Steven Gerrard’s fitness today as the success of </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong>’s season hangs in the balance.</strong></p>
              <p>Tests revealed last night that the team’s talisman had suffered another groin strain during the 3-1 Champions League defeat by <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span></a>.</p>
              <p>After sensationally blowing the Premier League title race open in recent weeks, the<br>Spaniard must now decide whether to risk aggravating the injury by playing the inspirational Gerrard against <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/blackburn-rovers.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Blackburn</span></a> tomorrow or rest him until next week’s return leg against Chelsea.</p>
              <p>The scan confirmed Gerrard has suffered a strain in his adductor muscle, but he has made it clear he is ready to play through the pain.</p>
              <p>Benitez and his medical staff are wary of the possible repercussions and may reluctantly conclude he needs to rest.</p>
              <p>Victory is essential against Blackburn tomorrow and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal</span></a> a week on Tuesday to keep alive title hopes, while all Gerrard’s dynamic qualities will be needed at Stamford Bridge next Tuesday if Chelsea’s commanding quarter-final first-leg lead is to be overturned.</p>
              <p>The injury has left Benitez facing an agonising decision for the most pivotal month<br>of Liverpool’s season. <br></p>
