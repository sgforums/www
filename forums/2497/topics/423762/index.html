              <p><span><strong>The jury may still be out on Sturridge. Certainly Manchester City were wary of his talents and neither was he then the expected success at Chelsea.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>No such problem at Bolton, where meat pies and mushy peas maybe the staple diet, but with a manager who knows footballing cordon bleu when he sees it.</span></p>
              <p><span>Sturridge, sent by Chelsea on loan during last month's transfer window, scored his fourth goal in as many games to rescue a point and end a run of six successive away defeats for Bolton. </span></p>
              <div class="artSplitter">
              <p class="imageCaption"><span style="font-size: small;">His 38th-minute strike always seemed on the cards after the 21-year-old had missed the target with three efforts. His finish after Johan Eelmander had provided the pass was crisp and accurate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Bolton's cause was helped when Ryan Taylor was shown a straight red card for a reckless high tackle on Elmander early in the second half. It was Sturridge's pace and energy that impressed, giving full-back Jose Enrique an uncomfortable afternoon. Last season Owen Coyle's shrewd loan acquisition of Jack Wilshere proved of triple benefit - to the player; Bolton and Arsenal. Sturridge looks to be following in his footsteps.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Coyle said: 'Jack Wilshere did it for us on loan from Arsenal and took his game to another level. I'm sure Daniel can do the same. That is  why I brought him to the club, because he's special.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'There's no shame in not being in the Arsenal or Chelsea side on a regular basis. For me, it's a win-win situation. Chelsea get a better player back and we get a quality player who improves us</span></p>

              </div>
              <p class="artSplitter"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>'Daniel scored a terrific goal. He can finish with his left or right foot, score headed goals and has pace to burn.'</strong></span></p>
              <p class="artSplitter"><span style="font-size: small;">The goal spoiled a personal celebration for Kevin Nolan who notched the 50th goal of his career against his former club. The Newcastle skipper met a Cheik Tiote cross with a superb, low header to give Newcastle a 13th-minute lead. It was a Newcastle high point on an afternoon which started badly when Joey Barton damaged his thigh in the warm-up and got worse with Taylor's dismissal.</span></p>
              <p class="artSplitter"><span style="font-size: small;">Nile Ranger headed home in added time but the goal was chalked out for offside.</span></p>

              <p>I think it must be a real disappointment now that Kenny didn't want him at that time when Chelsea was ready to offload him cheaply...</p>
              <p>And for Chelsea, they must now be thanking their stars up there that Pool didn't take him and wanted Anelka instead when they offered him in the Torres deal...</p>
              <p>A $45m plus him would have been a great deal for Pool... This guy is young and I feel better than Ngog and he can also help with the quota somemore... lol.</p>
