            <div class='col-md body'>Barcelona Vice President In Rome For Chivu Talks<br><br>Catalan daily Sport are claiming that Barca vice president Ferran Soriano is set for dicussions with Roma officials over transfer of Christian Chivu.<br><br>Assured that a bid could succeed, vice president and head of finance Ferran Soriano has himself decided to carry out the negotiations, and will speaking with Roma technical director Daniele PradÃ©.<br><br>The player was close to signing for Inter Milan after he reportedly agreed personal terms, but the Catalans have successfully hijacked that move, with Roma relatively happier if the Romanian defender moves outside Italy.<br><br>That the Giallorossi have completed the signing of Juan from Bayer Leverkusen, and that Chivu will move into the final year of his contract on July 1, will also hasten negotiations.<br><br>However, Barcelona have not offered the player a 4 million euro contract (as Inter have), and want to stick to their philosophy of a lower base salary, along with incentives.<br><br>The report suggests that Barcelona are also considering Marco Materazzi as an option, should Chivu move to Inter.<br><br>The World Cup winner has reportedly threatened to leave if Chivu moved to Inter denying him a first team spot, and Barcelona want someone with his aerial presence.<br></div>

They suggest that an informal deal was struck, one which would see Barcelona offer Ludovic Giuly, Juliano Belletti or Sylvinho, and 12 million euros in exchange for Chivu.<br><br>The paper-work is expected to be completed early next week, when Barcelona will return with an official offer.<br><br>The Catalan giants are keen to complete the deal quickly after losing skipper Carles Puyol until October, to a knee ligament injury. With Yaya ToureÂ’s signing set to be completed on Sunday, Monday could be an important day in the career of Chivu.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chivu's Arrival To Inter Not Fundamental - Moratti<br><br>The Inter President declared how the Romanian defender is not an important target for the Nerazzurri as the player is currently very close to a Barcelona move.<br><br>"His arrival is not fundamental," explained Moratti. "I want to valorise at the fullest the team which won the last Scudetto. For me this is a priority."<br><br>This was confirmed by the Director of Sports of Roma, Prade, following the meeting with the vice-President of Barcelona.<br><br>"Roma has not reached any agreement with Inter for the transfer of Chivu. We just built the basis to negotiate the transfer of the Romanian defender.<br><br>"There's no reason to be optimistic or not. Next week we shall meet up again, and Barcelona is a serious club and has shown great appreciation for Chivu. But I repeat, there's no type of offer, I just  want to re-state that there's no agreement with Inter."<br></div>

"We have talked about Chivu. Concrete offers have not been made yet. Next week we will meet again."<br><br>The meeting will be for Barcelona to come in with an improved offer. By then, they will also have had time to understand whether players being offered would actually be willing to move to Rome.<br><br>Roma would ideally like a straight cash deal worth 18-20 million euros, or 12 million euros along with Giuly and Belletti, while Barca are currently offering 13m along with just one of Belletti, Sylvinho and Giuly.<br><br>The estimated difference is said to be worth less that 2 million euros, something Barcelona are in no mood to miss out over.<br><br>Goal.com expects the deal to be tied up early next week!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Inter Overtake Barca In Chivu Race<br><br>The Nerazzurri are back in the driver's seat to sign the Roma defender after the Blaugrana were the closest to sign him up until yesterday.<br><br>Inter have in fact increased their initial bid of 11 million Euros to 14 million Euros, thus increasing their chances to take the Romanian defender as Barcelona have so far offered 'just' 12 million Euros and Giuly.<br><br>It is yet unclear whether the Spanish giants will try to improve their bid, but the Nerazzurri managed to find those extra three millions from the probable co-ownership sale of Andreolli to either Fiorentina or Parma.<br><br>Roma's original request for Chivu was of 18 million Euros, therefore Barcelona still have the opportunity to make an offer to the Giallorossi which can help them land the former Ajax defender, considering that Inter will not increase any futher their current 14 million bid.<br></div>
