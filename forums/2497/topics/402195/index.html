              <p>England launch their World Cup campaign against the
               United States with manager Fabio Capello fixing his
               sights on the final.</p>
              <p>Capello admits he is living a dream as he 
              carries the hopes of his adopted nation on to football's biggest stage.</p>
              <p>On
               Friday night, he declared James Milner fit to play in England's first 
              match. The midfielder has missed two days training this week with a 
              stomach virus.</p>

               good start against the United States in Rustenburg" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Come on England: Captain Steven Gerrard knows 
              the nation expects a good start against the United States in Rustenburg</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The news means Milner will almost certainly start ahead of Joe Cole 
              as Capello looks to the Aston Villa midfielder to provide extra defensive 
              cover for Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard in the centre.</p>
              <p>On 
              Friday night, after watching his team train here, Capello said: 'I am a 
              normal man. But, yes, my job is important at this moment because the 
              World Cup is important for the country, the fans.</p>
              <p>'I understand 
              perfectly it is a tough job - not only for me but for all managers - 
              because you can feel that, behind you, you have a whole country. I feel a
               great responsibility. I feel a nation, the whole people, but I always 
              like difficult things.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Talking tactics: Fabio Capello goes through his 
              pre-match instructions with his England squad</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>'It is a dream. It was a dream to be England manager and I hope the 
              next dream comes off, too. Why not?</p>
              <p>'In my career as a manager, I
               have built teams, worked with teams, with players, and I have always 
              been focused to win.</p>
              <p>'That's all that matters to me - to win and 
              get to the final. In my mind, we play to win. That's all. I exist to 
              win.</p>
              <p>'The challenge is to win. Anything else is just words. We 
              have to win. No more. It is fantastic for me. Exciting.'</p>
              <p>But 
              Capello gave a warning to his star striker, saying: 'Wayne Rooney played
               all the qualifying games for the World Cup and had no problems with the
               referees. I hope we see the same Rooney during the World Cup. I have 
              spoken with him but Rooney is a fantastic player because he wants to 
              win. But you have to be careful every time and you have to be careful 
              and respect referees.'</p>
              <p>England are itching for their games to 
              begin after two weeks in a training camp in Austria and 10 days at their
               World Cup camp in Rustenburg.</p>
              <p>Capello, who played for Italy in 
              their disappointing 1974 World Cup campaign and was omitted four years 
              later, said: 'When you arrive here it's completely different. You have 
              to live for one month with policemen, press conferences every day, TV, 
              everything, at every moment.</p>
              <p>'You switch on the television and it
               is all about the World Cup. There is really strong pressure from the 
              media. We have to live with this pressure. It is not easy. But I try. We
               try.'</p>
              <p>The manager said he will tell his players the team just 
              before they leave for the stadium today and called for England fans to 
              rally behind the side as they did in the qualifying campaign.</p>

              <p>'My team, I think, is OK,' he said.</p>
              <p>'We have arrived at a good
               moment. We trained really well, we spoke with the players.</p>
              <p>'The 
              players will be really focused. The altitude and the balls are terribleâ€¦
               terrible. It's impossible to control when you play long balls, but I 
              hope I can help the players to be perfect. Also, the performance like a 
              team will be really good.</p>
              <p>'Usually the first game is hard because
               the expectation and pressure is big.</p>
              <p>'We are sure we can go 
              forward in this competition. The biggest challenge is to win.'</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Raring to go: Wayne Rooney prepares for

              </div>
              <p>Capello said Gareth Barry would start on the bench, and the manager 
              is also seriously considering a first competitive appearance for rookie 
              goalkeeper Joe Hart, although he remains concerned by the 23-year-old's 
              lack of experience and may well yet turn to Robert Green.</p>
              <p>He has 
              already dismissed David James amid concerns about his knee. Capello 
              appears to think the problem has damaged the 39-year-old's confidence in
               training.</p>
              <p>Hart has been the best of the three keepers all season
               as well as the best in training since the squad flew out to Austria.</p>
              <p>Up
               front, Emile Heskey is almost certain to get the nod ahead of Peter 
              Crouch for the place alongside Rooney.</p>
              <p>Crouch has scored 21 goals
               in 38 internationals but Rooney, in his last nine starts with Heskey, 
              has scored nine goals.</p>

              <p>Don't underestimate the USA, they are a lot better now than say 4 to 10 yrs ago... And I think they are the only side to have beaten Spain since they last won the European Championship... And it certainly wasn't a friendly... Spain had their best players in that match and was going all for it... So no excuse there that they didn't try... Torres, Villa, Fabregas, Ramos, Casillas, Puyol, Xavi, Pique, Alonso... all played.</p>
              <p>And the ironic part is, it also happened in South Africa... In theÂ 2009 Confederations Cup final.</p>

              <p>Â </p>
              <p>For me, it's a 50 / 50 for both sides unless Rooney shines or someone gets sent-off could change the whole match... I guess it could be a draw with both sides being very careful not to lose their first match at this tournament...</p>
              <p>As for whoever wins this, I think they will be Group C leaders...</p>

              <p>Safest is to bet on England.</p>
              <p>Wayne Rooney, James Milner, Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard starting against USA is already quite a relief for many.</p>
              <p>Hope its not deja vu like what happened during the friendlies when Japan led 1-0 until half time . Haha once that happens, Rooney's mouth gonna open and close and that's it man.</p>

              <p>Surprisingly! Not much comments after the match.</p>
              <p>This is my take:</p>
              <p>The way england plays, they are an above average team but they will never beat a team as technical as Argentina and Brazil.</p>
              <p>Before Green conceded that silly goal, I noticed his positioning when catching ground balls is not good. He should grab the ball and pounce forward to secure it. When Clint Dempsey shot, his body position was a little out and that allowed the ball to bounce off his hands and into goal. It would have been prevented had he positioned himself a little further to his right.</p>
              <p>Lampard....where was he? He looked ordinary and did not stamp his class. People say Gerrard is world class but he looked nowhere like a midfield maestro in the class of Zidane, Beckenbauer or Dunga, all crucial players for a successful world cup.</p>
              <p>Aaron Lennon's high ball crosses are absolutely pathetic. His saving grace is his pace and cut ins into the penalty box. SWP, what the hell is he doing there? lol He looked clueless most times, senseless running, can't get past opponents and his crosses are shitty. He also scuffed a glorious chance at goal and still had the cheek to smile after that.</p>
              <p>Carragher may have loads of experience but he can't handle quick players. When Liverpool played Man U earlier in the season, while Owen was through on goal and proved too much for him, he sliced in with a cynical tackle that was nowhere near the ball. And looking at John Terry....he's world class? My ass. He is good at tackles and headers but he has a tendency (like Rio Ferdinand) to distribute high balls from the back. And many times I have seen him clear the ball into no man's land......like all British defenders, their technical ability is crap, that's why the unease when under pressure,</p>
              <p>And Rooney, only god knows what happened. He doesnt seem to excel for country as shown in all the pre WC friendlies. He scored against a an African club of which whose presence is negligible.</p>
              <p>And England, despite being under Capello, still plays those traditional high balls. The defending sucked too, a lot to learn from Mourinho when it comes to tactical defence. I give England at most, a run into the q-finals. I will come back and check this prediction again.</p>

              <p>I think we are too harsh on the England players, but I agree that some of them has not performed up to mark.</p>
              <p>Surprisingly, Glen Johnson was 1 of the best player in the match, however, his cross is decent but still unable to find the targets such as Rooney/Heskey/Crouch!</p>
              <p>Â Ashely Cole sadly wasn't given the space enough or chances to cross with his left foot on the left wing, the left wing was basically pretty impotent. Playing Millner on the left seems to be a bad bad idea! And whats the point with subbing Millner at 35min when SWP and Millner is the same, except that SWP contained a little more pace?</p>
              <p>Heskey was disappointing, where was the striker finishing? So many chances and yet he wasted it again and again.</p>
              <p>Was Rooney on the field? But lets not be too harsh for him because we all should know that Rooney was marked so tightly that whenever he have the chance to touch the ball, the next moment he will loses it.</p>
              <p>Lennon IMO was the worst player on the pitch. How many times we saw him have the ball, yet he was unable to pick out ANYONE in the box from the right wing. His passing was slow, crossing was slow, I was surprised that he could play full 90.</p>

              <p><br>whether Messi plays well or not is not a major issue, maradona know lots about pychological football, in his heyday, he uses his skill to motivate his teammates and influencedÂ the referees as well, therefore, Messi alone is a great bonus and motivator for the whole team.</p>
              <p>Referees on the pitch tends to concentrate more on the top players, the lines man will alway look up for messi offside, and the main referee will alway look out for any tackle onto Messi, and that alone put so much attention away from the other players, in fact if you look at the goal of Heinze...he was not marked at all, and there was a pulling of a nigerian defender who was going to block him. So, every nigerian marked Higuain, trevez, messi,...but they forget Heinze</p>
