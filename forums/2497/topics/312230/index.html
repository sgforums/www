              <strong>New member: David Beckham is set to join the England '100 club'</strong>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>David Beckham will not be allowed to celebrate his 100th cap with the captain's armband - as all four of England's previous centurions were. John Terry will lead England out against France tomorrow, having been given a first chance to impress upon Fabio Capello that he is leadership material.</strong></p>
              <p class="story">Happy enough with his recall, Beckham would not dispute the arrangement. He also insisted that this would be no Sinatra-like farewell appearance and that his ambitions to keep representing his country reach as far as the next World Cup, when he will be 35.</p>
              <p class="story">"As much as reaching 100 is a milestone in an Englishman's career - and there are not too many who have done that - it is important for me to carry on," he said. "I am very honoured to be talked about in the same company as Bobby Moore and Bobby Charlton - they are players I have always looked up to. But I want to go beyond that.</p>
              <p class="story">"I want to carry on for quite a few years yet. I'd have turned around and retired if I didn't and I don't feel like doing that now. I wouldn't be here if I didn't feel I could do it physically any more.</p>
              <p class="story">"There are plenty of young players coming through but I feel I can still offer something." Among them is Blackburn's David Bentley, Beckham's chief rival for his customary station on the right flank. "You have got to have personality to succeed at this level and he has definitely got that," Beckham said of Bentley. "He's a good lad, a London lad and he is very funny with it."</p>
              <p class="story">Terry, who was injured for <span style="color: #000000;">Capello's opening game against Switzerland,</span> will wear the armband tomorrow night. After watching Steven Gerrard lead England at Wembley last month, the England manager stated he intended to rotate the captaincy before deciding on a permanent leader.</p>
              <p class="story">However, his decision to return to the Chelsea captain at the first available opportunity suggests Terry is in pole position for that race. Wayne Rooney and Frank Lampard, who were doubtful after the weekend fixtures, trained yesterday.</p>
              <p>Facing a French side badly weakened by injury - they are without Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira, Karim Benzema and Bacary Sagna - Capello will be tempted to employ Gerrard just behind Rooney. Gerrard may not have the captaincy but at least he will be handed his favourite position.</p>

              <h1>Rio skippers England in Paris</h1>

              <p><span id="intelliTXT">England coach Fabio Capello has appointed Rio
              Ferdinand as captain for Wednesday evening's friendly international
              with France in Paris.</span></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The Manchester United defender takes over from
              Steven Gerrard, who led the side out in Capello's first match in charge
              against Switzerland at Wembley last month.</p>
              <p>John Terry, who had been appointed as skipper by previous head
              coach Steve McClaren, is back in the squad against the French after
              missing the 2-1 win over Switzerland through injury.</p>
              <p>But Capello is maintaining his policy of looking at other
              potential leaders within his squad before deciding on a permanent
              appointment for the World Cup qualifiers, which get under way in
              September.</p>
              <p>It represents a major turnaround for Ferdinand, who only four
              years ago received an eight-month ban from the Football Association
              after failing to attend a drugs test at United's Carrington training
              ground.</p>
              <p>That resulted in him missing the European Championship finals in Portugal.</p>
              <p>But Capello has given the clearest indication that will not
              count against the former West Ham and Leeds player, who has already
              publicly stated his desire to lead his country.</p>
              <p>An FA statement read: "Fabio Capello has confirmed that Rio
              Ferdinand will captain England against France tomorrow night in Paris.</p>
              <p>"Capello has confirmed this continues his policy of rotating
              the captaincy between players in the friendly matches before confirming
              a permanent captain for the World Cup qualifying games."</p>
              <p>The Italian will hold a press conference on Tuesday night in Paris, with Ferdinand also available to the media.</p>

              <p>Don't know when was the last time England had a black captain... Anyone?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00458/sport-backpage-spla_458580a.jpg" alt="" width="516" height="250"></p>
              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>JOHN TERRY has been sent a clear message about his conduct after Rio Ferdinand was made England skipper.</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Boss Fabio Capello gave the Chelsea captain a dressing down over his behaviour ahead of tonight’s friendly in France. And when asked why he had overlooked Terry, he said: “I don’t have to explain my decisions to anyone.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">We need to be role models when we play for England and for our clubs. “Part of this involves fair play and respect towards the referee and the public who come to see the games. “In that respect, we need to get back something we may be losing a bit.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Capello has stressed to Terry that displays of dissent to referees similar to his antics at Spurs last week will not be tolerated. The Three Lions chief added: “A captain must be an example to follow in training and a leader during the game. “And, of course, I would hope he could be an example, a role model outside the game as well — in life. “That’s very important. Not just for the England captain but for everything that we, as sportsmen, show youngsters. He has to be an example.”</p>
              <p class="article">Terry was made full-time England skipper by previous boss Steve McClaren in August 2006 and has led his country on 13 occasions since then. But he was out injured for Capello’s first game against Switzerland last month when Steven Gerrard was given the armband.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Capello has made no promises that Terry will be restored to the role in the future. But he did admit: “I will rotate the captain and I will name a permanent one in August. Until then, John Terry has a chance to become England captain.”</p>
              <p class="article">The Italian has clearly forgiven Ferdinand for his missed drugs test in 2004 which saw him banned for eight months. Capello said: “The past is the past. From watching Rio play and in training, I’ve seen a very good professional. He can be a very good England captain.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Alex Ferguson last night backed Capello’s decision. The Manchester United boss said: “He wouldn’t have captained my side if he wasn’t capable of captaining England, I can assure you of that. “Experience is important in the England role and Rio has more than 50 caps.”</p>

              <p><strong>Gilberto finally gets a game at Emirates - leading Brazil</strong></p>
              <p><strong><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/graphics/2008/03/26/sfnbra126.jpg" alt=""></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Gilberto Silva will captain Brazil in a friendly against Sweden at the Emirates Stadium tonight, a match the midfielder has described as a welcome distraction to the ongoing uncertainty surrounding his long-term future at Arsenal.</strong></p>
              <p>A combination of injury and the brisk progress of Mathieu Flamini has restricted Gilberto to 29 appearances this campaign with only 15 of those games from the start. Frustrated with his lack of involvement, the Brazilian, who joined Arsenal shortly after winning the 2002 World Cup, has hinted he may leave north London this summer, a year before his contract with the club expires. Juventus are reportedly among the clubs preparing to tempt the 31-year-old.</p>
              <p>Gilberto is, however, putting all the speculation to one side as he looks forward to getting back in action at his club ground tonight and earning his 60th international cap. "It is always important for me to play for Brazil and I am happy that now I can just think about that," he said. "When it comes to my future at Arsenal, I will have to wait and see what happens from now until the end of the season. I'm not playing at the moment, which is difficult, but I am still working hard on the training ground and hopefully I'll get my chance to join the team. It will be difficult but I'll not give up."</p>
              <p>Arsenal have seven matches left to revitalise their stumbling assault on the Premier League title - they are six points behind Manchester United following their defeat to Chelsea on Sunday - and the awkward task of facing Liverpool in the Champions League quarter-finals next month. Gilberto could prove crucial in both campaigns, not only because of his experience - he has made 237 appearances for the club - but also because he passionately believes the squad can still be crowned champions and capture Europe's most treasured trophy despite their current slump. Arsenal have won only one of their last eight matches. "Of course we have a chance in both competitions," he said.</p>
              <p>Tonight's match marks the 50th anniversary of Brazil's first of five World Cup triumphs. They beat the hosts Sweden 5-2 in the 1958 final with a 17-year-old Pele scoring twice. Kaka and Ronaldinho are unavailable to the manager, Dunga, because of injury which opens up the possibility of Milan's teenage striker Pato making his debut for the senior side. "It will be difficult because every team wants to play well against Brazil," said Gilberto. "But we will enjoy this match and it will be important in our preparation for the World Cup qualification games that are to come."</p>

              <h1>England boss Capello ready to drop Cole in battle against abuse</h1>
              <h3>England v France:</h3>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/ColeRef2003_468x476.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>Lack of respect: Cole turns his back after being booked by referee Mike Riley</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p>Fabio Capello is seriously considering leaving Chelsea defender Ashley Cole out of his England starting line-up to meet France tonight. Capello will not reveal the team to his players until a few hours before kick-off but it is understood that Cole, who attracted severe criticism for his lack of self-discipline in last week's turbulent London derby against Tottenham, is coming under increasing pressure to keep his place.</p>
              <p>The player pushing Cole all the way is not Chelsea team-mate Wayne Bridge but Everton's emerging star Joleon Lescott, who has been outstanding this season and particularly impressed Capello in a recent match against Fulham.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/chelsea2003_468x331.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="331"></p>
              <p><strong>Argument: Cole, and several other Chelsea players including Frank Lampard and John Terry, make their feelings known to referee Riley after Cole's nasty challenge on Alan Hutton</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Capello is keen that his England players set the right standards both on and off the pitch and he will not have been impressed by Cole's antics at White Hart Lane last week — when he turned his back on referee Mike Riley — despite the fact that he later apologised.</p>
              <p>The England coach, who also confirmed that David Beckham would win his 100th cap in the Stade de France, sprang a surprise by naming Rio Ferdinand as captain but is expected to give John Terry the armband in either of the next two matches, against the United States at Wembley or on the trip to Trinidad.</p>
              <p>Terry did not help his cause with his England boss after his Bentley was pictured parked in a disabled bay in Esher last week and he then led the protests against Riley at Tottenham.</p>
              <p>Terry, who is still due to partner Ferdinand tonight, will get his chance while Capello intends to try out at least one other captain, possibly Wayne Rooney or Gareth Barry, before he announces his permanent skipper for August's match against the Czech Republic, the last before England begin their World Cup qualifying campaign.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_04/BecksAutograph_468x312.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="312"></p>
              <p><strong>Centre of attention: England midfielder David Beckham keeps his fans happy after arriving at the team hotel in Paris yesterday, ahead of earning his 100th cap for his country against France tonight</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All eyes will be on Beckham tonight though, whether he starts the match or comes on as a sub. The midfield star says he wants to carry on after he reaches the coveted century mark and Capello certainly did not rule out that possibility when he said: "I know David Beckham and if he carries on training the way he is, then he could certainly go on to 2010."</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Calamity - James in the dock again as England fall to a spot kick but don't panic says Fabio, it'll be OK by September</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00459/SORT__DEJA_VU_459170a.jpg" alt="" width="516" height="250"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even David Beckham, playing for the 100th time and reinstated on the right of England's midfield at the expense of David Bentley, couldn't stop Franck Ribery dash manager Fabio Capello's dream of an away win in Paris. Ribery, the Bayern Munich right-winger, struck from the penalty spot after Nicolas Anelka tumbled over David James' challenge in the 31st minute.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>90mins, France 1 England 0:</strong> FULL TIME</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>89mins, France 1 England 0:</strong> England are resorting to speculative long-balls towards a packed France penalty area.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>86mins, France 1 England 0:</strong> Downing corner leads to a lightning-fast France counter-attack through Ribery. Cisse collects Ribery's pass but is put under just enough pressure by Ferdinand to shoot into England's side-netting.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>83mins, France 1 England 0:</strong> England are playing it down the flanks and Bentley and Downing are peppering France's 6yrd box with searching crosses but Crouch and Owen are struggling to find room.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>80mins, France 1 England 0:</strong> FRANCE SUB: Anelka off, Cisse on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>78mins, France 1 England 0:</strong> Bentley floats a cross towards Crouch in the area but France have three defenders hovering around him. Easily cleared.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>74mins, France 1 England 0:</strong> Ribery - in acres of space - drives a low shot from the edge of the area. Ball goes wide of James' right post. England simply not pressing the play.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>68mins, France 1 England 0:</strong> France passing it around - over a dozen passes now. England seem to have lost control of midfield and Anelka and Malouda are linking up well down France's left. Anelka shoots but his effort goes wide.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>63mins, France 1 England 0:</strong> FRANCE SUB: Trezeguet off, Govou on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>62mins, France 1 England 0:</strong> ENGLAND SUBS: Beckham off, Bentley on. Johnson on, Brown off.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>61mins, France 1 England 0:</strong> Downing cross blocked by Clerc. France dictating the pace now as England re-group after wholesale substitutions.</p>
              <p><strong>57mins, France 1 England 0:</strong> Ashley Cole finds room for a left-hand cross but he can't pick anyone out in the area. His soft drops tamely to keeper Coupet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>53mins, France 1 England 0:</strong> England playing patiently and more confidently than they did against Switzerland, passing it around, looking for a gap. But Crouch looks stranded as the lone striker with Owen playing off him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>51mins, France 1 England 0:</strong> France's Malouda shoots from 30yrds but his low effort skids wide of England's left post.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>48mins, France 1 England 0:</strong> Beckham takes a left corner and finds Crouch in the 6yrd box but his header loops over the bar.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>45mins, France 1 England 0:</strong> ENGLAND SUBS: Lescott on, Terry off. Crouch on, Rooney off. Downing on, Joe Cole off. Owen on, Gerrard off.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>45mins, France 1 England 0:</strong> HALF-TIME</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>41mins, France 1 England 0:</strong> England, over-committed in midfield leave space at the back but Ribery's lofted pass drops to James.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>38mins, France 1 England 0:</strong> BOOKING: Beckham for pulling back Ribery.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>36mins, France 1 England 0:</strong> Nasri shoots from close-range after Brown kicks thin air trying to clear. James saves, dropping to his left to block the shot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>31mins, France 1 England 0:</strong> GOAL. Ribery sends James the wrong way by slotting his spot-kick into the bottom-right corner.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_04/2603freng5G_468x404.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="404"></p>
              <p><strong>30mins, France 0 England 0:</strong> PENALTY to France. Anelka breaks clear chasing a Clerc through-ball and is one-on-one with James. The Chelsea striker flicks the ball past the keeper and then tumbles over him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>23mins, France 0 England 0:</strong> Gerrard is at the heart of all of England's play at the moment. He threads a pass through to Hargreaves in France's area but the United player's shot is blocked by a lunging Thuram.</p>
              <p><strong>20mins, France 0 England 0:</strong> Gerrard again, perfect cross from the right by Beckham finds Stevie in a crowded France 6yrd box but his header goes well over.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>19mins, France 0 England 0:</strong> Gerrard shot, 20yrds out from the left side. Balloons over for a goal-kick.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>16mins, France 0 England 0:</strong> England are pressing with J Cole in a floating role from the left. Hargreaves still playing uncharacteristically up-field.</p>
              <p><strong>12mins, France 0 England 0:</strong> France switch to the right with Ribery taking the play to England. A Cole gets back to cut off his options. Goes for a throw.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>10mins, France 0 England 0:</strong> France attack down left flank. Abidal and Makelele link up to put in a deep cross. Makelele's pass snuffed out by James who comes for the ball.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>7mins, France 0 England 0:</strong> Anelka, lurking in the England area, fails to latch on to a free-kick from the left and heads wide of James' left post.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>2mins, France 0 England 0:</strong> England push forward through the centre with Hargreaves forcing the play.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The teams:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>France:</strong> Coupet, Abidal, Gallas, Makelele, Malouda, Toulalan, Clerc, Thuram, Trezeguet, Ribery, Anelka. Subs: Landreau, Mexes, Cisse, Govou, Squillaci, Alou Diarra, Flamini, Evra.</p>
