Boss Jose Mourinho made no secret of his dislike for the Dutch centre back, giving him just 10 Premiership starts and often choosing midfielder Michael Essien to play in his position during the Blues' defensive crisis.</strong><br><br>The German giants are reportedly ready to overlook his horror season in England, with their interest stemming from the form he showed at Hamburg that prompted Chelsea to buy him last year. The 25-year-old is thought to be keen to leave Stamford Bridge after Alex, granted a work permit after being loaned to PSV, joined the club to push him down the pecking order.<br><br></div>

The experienced Peruvian striker is out-of-contract at the Allianz Arena and is understood to have held talks with Chelsea, Juventus and former boss Felix Magath at Wolfsburg. </strong><br><br>However, Pizarro is expected to put pen to paper on a four-year deal at Stamford Bridge with unsettled defender Khalid Boulahrouz tipped for a move in the opposite direction. Boulahrouz has failed to settle in England following his Â£10 million move from Hamburg last summer and would welcome a return to Germany.<br><br><strong>Meanwhile, agent Rune Hauge has revealed that England's top five clubs are monitoring Morten Gamst Pedersen. The Blackburn winger, 25 has become a target for Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham. Hauge said: "All the big five follow Morten's situation. We are in contact with the clubs. Morten plays in a special position on the left and can play as well both in 4-3-3 and 4-4-2. "The big ones might not have space for players of his type and we might see players in that position leave some of the clubs in the coming weeks." </strong><br><br>Chelsea's interest in Pedersen maybe fuelled by the uncertainty over the future of Dutch winger Arjen Robben who has yet to sign a contract extension and has been linked with a move to Bayern Munich. However, Chelsea appear to have lost out on Barcelona youngster Iago Falque after he elected to remain in Catalunya.<br><br>Frank Arnesen's scouting network earmarked the youngster for a move to the Blues but the Spanish youth star rebuffed the offer to move to West London. The 17-year-old was offered terms by Arnesen, but has instead opted to remain with Barcelona 'B' for the coming season with the hope of making the breakthrough to Frank Rijkaard's first team.<br><br>But Chelsea are delighted with the signing of 16-year-old Philliskirk, son of Latics youth team coach Tony, who signed a four-year deal. Philliskirk will undertake a two-year scholarship before moving onto a professional contract for the remainder of his spell. Oldham chief executive Alan Hardy said: "We're delighted for Danny - he is joining a massive club with fantastic resources which will help him develop his game.<br><br>"Talking with Tony, I know he has been impressed with the facilities. Danny has four years of security and time is now on his side to develop into an excellent player. Also, we may have an opportunity of taking him on loan at some stage." Oldham are expected to benefit from numerous add-ons and Chelsea have agreed to send some of the club's top youngsters out on loan to Boundary Park.<br><br></div>

And if to leave, why not go back to the country where he did well in the first place? Makes sense. Bayern probably did try to buy him previously but Hamburg might have been less willing to sell to rival club at that time.<br><br>Moreover it's half the price Chelsea already paid. If Bayern were to try buying him a year ago, he might have cost more for all we know. But even if Hamburg did jack up the price against Chelsea, I doubt Hamburg's original selling price would have been 3.5mill or less.<br><br>Not a bad buy in any sense, at least not yet.</div>
