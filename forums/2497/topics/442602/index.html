              <p><strong>The club believed that Bruce's reputation had been damaged beyond repair in the eyes of <span style="color: #0000ff;">Sunderland </span>supporters. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>O'Neill appears to be the people's choice but there is also serious consideration being given to Hughes, who has done well at previous clubs on a limited budget.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>Other names have been discussed, including Everton manager David Moyes and former England manager Steve McClaren, but O'Neill and Hughes would almost certainly have to turn the job down first. Assistant manager Eric Black will look after first-team affairs until a new manager is appointed and is expected to be in the dugout at Wolves on Sunday.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>Bruce was sacked after chairman and owner Ellis Short decided he had to protect the business by removing the manager immediately, rather than give him another two games to show he could resurrect their season. Although a prominent section of the club's support turned against Bruce weeks ago, it became mass opposition after the 2-1 home defeat to Wigan Athletic last weekend.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>After four days of reflection, Short decided Bruce had to go late on Tuesday night as the American feared the effect of falling attendances. Sunderland have won just twice this season, in sharp contrast to bitter local rivals Newcastle United, who are flying high in fourth. Despite finishing in the top 10 for only the third time in more than 50 years last season, Bruce's side have won only three games at the Stadium of Light this year.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>O'Neill has previously pushed all the right buttons on Wearside, reminiscing about his childhood in Northern Ireland listening to Sunderland games on the radio as a supporter. That is in stark contrast to Bruce, a Geordie who made no secret of his affection for Newcastle when he was growing up. O'Neill also has an outstanding CV and is desperate to get back into management after quitting Aston Villa in August last year.</p>
              <p>One thing that may work against O'Neill is the amount of money he will want to rebuild the side. Short has had to cover losses of more than £25 million in each of the last two years and had not planned to spend much, if anything, in January.</p>
              <p>Hughes, on the other hand, has done well with limited resources at both Blackburn and Fulham and is happy to work with the players he would inherit. He regards Sunderland as a bigger club than Fulham and believes success would give him greater funds in the long run.</p>
              <p>Short said: "This has been a difficult time for everyone at Sunderland and is not a situation that any of us envisaged or expected to be in.</p>
              <p>"It is my job as chairman to act in the best interests of our football club at all times and I can assure everyone that this is not a decision that I have taken lightly. Sadly, results this season have simply not been good enough and I feel the time is right to make a change.</p>
              <p>"Steve has acted with honesty and integrity throughout, which is testament to the character and commitment he has shown during his time at Sunderland.</p>
              <p>"I would like to personally place on record my thanks to him for his significant contribution to our football club over the past two and a half years and everyone here at Sunderland naturally wishes him the very best for the future.</p>
              <p>"I would also like to thank our fans, who have endured a trying start to the season. Their support continues to be the driving force behind our club and is vital as we now look to the future."</p>
              <p>Bruce, who only signed a new 3½-year contract in February, is believed to have been shocked by the decision as he felt he was going to be given another two games at least. His mood at the training ground was far more buoyant than it had been at the start of the week and the players were surprised to learn that a manager who retained the full support of the dressing room had been sacked.</p>
              <p>The former Manchester United captain, who is expected to fly to Portugal for a short holiday, can at least console himself with a multi-million pound pay-off.</p>

              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Sunderland" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/sunderland"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Sunderland</strong></span></a><strong> have confirmed that </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Martin O'Neill" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/martin-o-neill"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Martin O'Neill</strong></span></a><strong> has become their new manager after agreeing a three-year deal. The 59-year-old visited the club's Academy of Light training headquarters with former chairman Niall Quinn this morning after two days of productive talks with chairman Ellis Short.</strong></p>
              <p>And shortly after lunchtime a statement on the official Sunderland website confirmed that O'Neill will take charge of the Black Cats from Monday.</p>
              <p>Speaking after officially joining the club, O'Neill said: "It's a very nice feeling to be back in football and to be the manager of Sunderland. It's a big moment for me. I'd heard about what a good club it was but coming here, seeing the stadium and training ground, I've been bowled over. It's absolutely fantastic. I hope I can help Sunderland to very successful period. That's what I've come for and that's my driving ambition."</p>
              <p>The challenge facing O'Neill is significant. The Black Cats have won just two of their 13 league games to date this season and currently sit 16th in the table on 11 points, just two clear of the drop zone. They have won just three games at home in 2011, a return which severely hampered Bruce's hopes of establishing the club in the top half of the Premier League.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">MARTIN O'NEILL says he is ready to save Sunderland.</h2>
              <p>And he will have to be after this nightmare loss to Wolves.</p>
              <p>The new Black Cats boss watched from the stands as the Mackems chucked away the lead — and missed a penalty.</p>
              <p>O'Neill said: "It's a nice feeling to be back in football and I'm very excited about joining Sunderland.</p>
              <p>"I've always had a great enthusiasm for the game and feel I am ready. I would love to do well, obviously. I'm not trying to earn brownie points but Sunderland were my favourite team as a boy.</p>
              <p>"I suppose I have remained a supporter ever since."</p>
              <p>But O'Neill, who starts work today, was warned by caretaker boss Eric Black to land a top striker. Black said: "Martin will have seen our strengths but he knows there are problems too.</p>
              <p>"We could do with someone to score a goal. We need someone to find the back of the net more regularly when we have possession of the ball.</p>
              <p>"It was a disappointing afternoon."</p>
              <p>O'Neill was at Molineux with coaches Steve Walford and Seamus McDonagh, who will join him at the Stadium of Light.</p>
              <p>Two goals from Steven Fletcher gave Wolves victory as they stormed back from a goal down after Kieran Richardson had put the Black Cats ahead with a wonderstrike.</p>
              <p>Sunderland's Seb Larsson landed in controversy after earning a dodgy penalty, which he missed.</p>

              <p>he is indeed saving sunderland.</p>
              <p>the win over QPR dragged them out of danger.  with a 'superior' goal difference sunderland has a good chance of survival.</p>
              <p>i wonder what blackburn and bolton are waiting for?</p>
