              ANDRE VILLAS-BOAS has pulled out of moves for Joao Moutinho and Yann Mâ€™Vila.
               
              The Tottenham boss is expected to lose midfielder Luka Modric to Real Madrid this month.
               
              But he admits Porto ace Moutinho and Rennesâ€™ Mâ€™Vila will not be heading to White Hart Lane.
               
              AVB took Moutinho to his old club Porto but he said: â€œIt will be very difficult to sign him.
               
              â€œI have experience of Porto and it is a club that sells good products but they are expensive.
               
              â€œIt has been like that with numerous amounts of players and that is why it is very difficult.â€�
               
              France midfielder Mâ€™Vila is also unlikely to sign.
               
              Villas-Boas added: â€œHe is an interesting player but I donâ€™t think he will join Tottenham.
               
              â€œThe player is a player of defensive characteristics.
               
              â€œWe had initial interest in Mâ€™Vila but we have moved on from that one and are now looking for a more creative player.â€�
               
              Villas-Boas has been left with just one recognised striker â€” England star Jermain Defoe â€” heading into the season.
               
              He was planning to add Emmanuel Adebayor to his squad from Manchester City but the former loaneeâ€™s financial demands are scuppering a deal.
               
              Villas-Boas, who takes Tottenham to Newcastle tomorrow, said: â€œWe are trying to be more sensible.
               
              â€œI think the chairman is in contact with the player regularly and Manchester City.
               
              â€œThere is no news. Everyone knows the chairman likes to keep things on a reasonable level in terms of what we spend. He has been very sensitive on that.â€�

              BRENDAN RODGERS has further strengthened his squad after landing Â£2.8million Moroccan flier Oussama Assaidi.
                      
              The Kop boss snatched the Heerenveen winger, 24, from under the nose of Ajax, and he oins Fabio Borini and Joe Allen as the Redsâ€™ summer arrivals.
                       
              Assaidi was all set to join the Dutch champions, but then Rodgers moved in for a man he was monitoring during his days as Swansea chief, and the player had a dramatic change of heart. 
                      
              The Anfield gaffer is determined to add more options out wide, and moved for Assaidi after Cristian Tello chose to fight for a place at Barcelona ahead of a move to Merseyside. 
                      
              Now the Moroccan international can look forward to a Â£1million-a-year contract, a huge rise from his current Â£7,000 a week, and the chance to play a key role in Rodgersâ€™ Red revolution. 
                      
              He was available for such a knockdown fee as he has just 12 months left on his contract, while his wages are further proof of Rodgersâ€™ determination to pay realistic money, rather than the sky high contracts bandied about in recent seasons. 
                      
              Liverpool hope to make it a double swoop by the end of the weekend, as they are confident of landing Real Madrid midfielder Nuri Sahin on a seasonâ€™s loan.
                       
              Arsenal are still fighting to take the Turkish international to the Emirates, but Rodgers hopes his relationship with Jose Mourinho from their Chelsea days will swing things his way.

              SWANSEAâ€™S Scott Sinclair has refused to sign a new deal.
               
              And that has put Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini on red alert.
               
              Mancini is keen on signing winger Sinclair, 23, who is also wanted by Spurs and Liverpool.
               
              Sinclair has 11 months left on his deal but could go for around Â£5million before August 31.
               
              Swans boss Michael Laudrup said: â€œScott wonâ€™t sign a new contract.
               
              â€œBut there is interest from a big club. Cityâ€™s name keeps coming up.â€�

              NORWICH have snapped up Spanish left-back Javier Garrido from Lazio on a season-long loan.
               
              The former Manchester City player will become manager Chris Hughtonâ€™s fifth summer signing subject to international clearance.
               
              The Canaries also have the option to extend the deal for the 27-year-old who made 49 appearances in a three-year spell with Premier League champions City.
               
              Hughton said: â€œIâ€™m absolutely delighted to be bringing in somebody of Javierâ€™s quality. 
              
              â€œIt gives us real competition in the squad, and for me an important factor was the fact that he has played in the Premier League before. 
              
              â€œHe has played in La Liga, Serie A, and the Premier League, so he is a player of real experience.â€�

              <p><span><strong>Sunderland have sealed the £10million signing of England winger Adam Johnson.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>With Scotland striker Steven Fletcher set to make his debut at the Stadium of Light against Reading on Saturday, manager Martin O’Neill has splashed out £22m in 24 hours to address his side’s lack of Premier League firepower.</span></p>
              <p><span>As <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>revealed earlier this week, Wolves forward Fletcher joined after the Midlands club accepted Sunderland’s original £12m offer, with add-ons which could take the deal to £14m.</span></p>
              <p><span>Having secured his priority target, O’Neill immediately pushed through the deal for Manchester City’s Sunderland-born winger Johnson, 24, who had been ostracised by Roberto Mancini, despite being the Italian’s first City signing. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>O'Neill said: 'Adding quality players to the squad has been our main aim this summer and Adam certainly fits that bill.</span></p>
              <p><span>'He has terrific ability, great delivery and I'm sure he is a player who will excite our fans. I couldn't be more delighted to have him at the football club.'</span></p>

              <div class="thinArtSplitter">
              <div class="splitLeft"><span>Johnson was left out of City’s squad for last week’s opener against Southampton, four days after winning his 12th England cap.</span></div>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p><span>But after unveiling Fletcher, 25, O’Neill met Johnson for talks. The former Middlesbrough academy graduate, who came close to joining Sunderland under Steve Bruce before opting for City, has agreed to take a pay cut from his £90,000-a-week wages at the Etihad after securing a pay-off.</span></p>
