              <h1>Jamie Carragher: Sven-Goran Eriksson was more of a playboy than an England manager</h1>
              <h2>Sven-Goran Eriksson has been described as "a better Casanova than a manager" by Jamie Carragher.</h2>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/00800/sven_800101c.jpg" alt="Seeing double: Mexcian papers used Sven's look-a-like to mock his reputation" width="460" height="288"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Before announcing his retirement from international football, Carragher represented England while Eriksson was in charge. During his tenure with England, the Swede earned a reputation as a bit of a lothario, with girlfriends including Nancy Dell'Olio, Ulrika Johnson and, most controversially, Faria Alam, the Football Association secretary who resigned after relationships with both Eriksson and chief executive Mark Palios.</strong></p>
              <p>Eriksson, now in charge of the Mexico national team, was also, apparently, more than willing to give advice to his players on matters of the bedroom while away on international duty, and in his new book Carragher said: "I was never sure if Eriksson was an international manager or international playboy. I know what he was best at.</p>
              <p>"The longer he spent in the job, the worse his status became as a football coach and the better he became a Casanova.</p>
              <p>"Before one of his early World Cup qualifiers, a story broke about girls finding their way into the team hotel to provide some of the players with pre-match 'entertainment'.</p>
              <p>"Eriksson summoned us for what we expected to be a stern warning. Instead we received some fatherly advice. "'There's no need to have girls in the team hotel,' Sven told us. 'If you see someone you like, just get her phone number and arrange to go to her house after the game. Then we will have no problems.'"</p>
              <p>Carragher eventually became disillusioned with international football under Eriksson's replacement Steve McClaren. He made his last appearance wearing the Three Lions on June 1 2007, when England drew 1-1 against Brazil at the new Wembley.</p>
              <p>He then chose to turn his back on the national team after finding himself below Rio Ferdinand, Sol Campbell, Jonathan Woodgate and Ledley King in the pecking order.</p>
