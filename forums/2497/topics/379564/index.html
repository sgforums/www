              <h1 class="titlestory">Klinsmann keen on Premiership as Liverpool talk emerges</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p>Jurgen Klinsmann won't rule out a move to the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premiership</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p><em>The Sun</em> says Klinsmann's clandestine meetings with George Gillett and Tom Hicks caused chaos in their relationship with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rafa Benitez</span></abbr> a couple of years ago.</p>
              <p>And asked if managing a <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> club still appeals, Klinsmann said: "You never rule anything out.</p>
              <p>"Once you've experienced the emotions that football can give you, you
              want to continue having them. I never thought I would manage Germany in
              the World Cup and then become Bayern Munich manager last year."</p>
              <p>Curiously, the ex-<abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> striker is in England this week - and was shocked by <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>'s loss at home to Lyon on Tuesday in the Champions League.</p>
              <p>But he said: "I think a tie in Lyon and if you beat Fiorentina at home that will probably put you through.</p>
              <p>"So nothing's lost yet. It's a difficult moment for Rafa. Maybe the game on Sunday is the right one to beat <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> at home to turn the situation around."</p>

              <p>I think the reason why some people are geting frustrated with rafa's management is that he does not want to rectify the obvious glaring striking problem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In fact he contributed to it by selling off his strikers one by one over the past few seasons for strange reasons only he himself would know (There is another thread on the strikers he sold - Crouch, Keane, Bellamy etc), leaving him with just one outright top striker.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wenger on the other hand has always been prudent with finances, choosing to go with his youngsters.  So he does in a sense, have an excuse for not winning titles.   Rafa was given a fait bit of money over the past few seasons and he basically spent a lot of it on a lot of mediocre players.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He has this funny habit of wanting to shop for all sorts of fringe players, buying them only to sell them off after 1 season or after a few starts. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>actually, do anyone knows how the scouting system works in Pool??</p>
              <p>cause in MU, I do know that SAF's brother or scouts will do their work, and then SAF will go watch, then bid comes in and etc etc...</p>
              <p>Comparingly, it seems Pool's failure rate with new buys are higher. So did Rafa buy the players based on scouting reports or he made personal visits? or worse, like Keagan, recommended via youtube??</p>

              <p>if u want to have a football discussion, keep it that way.</p>
              <p>if i bother to reply, it means u have a potential to keep things
              clean IF you choose to.</p>
              <p>if i don't bother, it means i have already placed that person in
              the same group as the clones / trolls.  and i have been around
              long enough to ignore trolls.</p>
              <p>by bothering, it shows that i don't consider the forumite as a

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rafa Benitez</span></abbr> has been assured his job is safe at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>The <em>Mirror</em> says Benitez is safe in his job, even if <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> lose on Sunday, but if they were to crash out of the Champions' League,

              <p>But insiders at the club insist that the manager would be given until
              the end of the season, with no chance of the axe being wielded until
              then.</p>
              <p>Benitez finds himself in an unusually secure position, despite
              the poor run of results, because of the fraught political situation at
              Anfield, with the joint owners unable to agree on anything.</p>

              <p><strong>George Gillett last night responded to growing pressure on </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Rafael Benítez</strong></span><strong> by assuring the </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span><strong> manager that he retains the unequivocal support of the club's American owners.</strong></p>
              <p>Benítez is experiencing the most fraught on-field period of his six seasons in charge of Liverpool after a run of four successive defeats, the club's first since 1987, left them seven points behind <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a> in the Premier League and under serious threat of elimination from the Champions League group stage.</p>
              <p>Gillett was at Anfield on Tuesday as <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/lyon"><span style="color: #005689;">Lyon</span></a> inflicted a stoppage-time defeat on Liverpool and faced angry remonstrations from several fans after César Delgado's winner. His co-owner, Tom Hicks, is expected to run a similar gauntlet on Sunday when Sir Alex Ferguson's champions arrive at Anfield. Despite the despondency around Liverpool and the first serious stirrings of discontent towards Benítez among the club's support, Gillett, who once sought to replace the Spaniard with Jürgen Klinsmann, insists there is no question of the manager's position being under threat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Asked if his support for Benítez remained intact, Gillett said: "Absolutely. We have just entered into a long-term agreement with Rafa. Our family is extraordinarily pleased with him, we think he is absolutely as good as there is in the business and I am sure the Hicks [family] feel the same way. We just extended his contract."</p>
              <p>Benítez signed an improved contract in March that committed him to Liverpool until 2014 and, though Gillett insists his backing is based purely on coaching ability, it would cost the club over £20m to pay up the remaining four and a half years of the manager's deal. Hicks and Gillett are also unlikely to risk fresh instability at Anfield at a time when they are independently seeking to attract new investors.</p>
              <p>"I think the run of results disappoints everybody," Gillett added. "Certainly, it disappoints the fans and it disappoints Rafa. I know he is disappointed. We are all disappointed but we are in this together. I think we all saw the same thing [that Benítez looked downbeat following the Lyon defeat] but that's not something I am going to comment on publicly."</p>
              <p>Gillett claimed he and Hicks are allowing for improvement through "being supportive. Which I am and which Tom is." He refused, though, to indicate whether new investment is on its way to assist Benítez in the January transfer window. "I don't think that is something I am prepared to comment on at the moment," the Liverpool co-owner said.</p>
              <p>Benítez's preparations for the United game have also been undermined by a succession of injuries to key players, with Fernando Torres, Glen Johnson and Albert Riera all missing the Lyon game through groin and hamstring problems and Steven Gerrard limping out after 25 minutes having aggravated an adductor strain. All four will continue to receive intensive treatment ahead of Sunday with Gerrard and Riera the main doubts.</p>
              <p>"I think I will be all right for Sunday," said Johnson. "We haven't tested it today, just soft tissue work and massage, but it seems a lot freer than it did." The England defender added: "I think Nando [Torres] might be all right for Sunday but I am not too sure about Stevie."</p>
              <p>There was one important injury breakthrough for Benítez last night, however, when Alberto Aquilani made his first appearance in a Liverpool shirt since his £20m summer move from Roma. The Italian midfielder, signed to compensate for the loss of Xabi Alonso to Real Madrid, has not made a senior start as a result of ankle surgery in May. He last made a competitive appearance for Roma in March.</p>
              <p>Aquilani came off the bench for Liverpool's reserves in the 75th minute of their 2–0 win against Sunderland reserves at Prenton Park, but is unlikely to feature on Sunday. The midfielder's rehabilitation may continue with a first senior appearance next week when Liverpool face Arsenal in the Carling Cup fourth round.</p>
