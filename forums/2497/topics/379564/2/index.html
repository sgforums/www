              <p>He is his biggest shortcoming - his ego.</p>
              <p>Just re-trace his past seasons - instances of deploying players out of position, constant tinkering, sticking with hopeless players, wasting money on insignificant players, downplaying players with potential.</p>
              <p>We are going in circles.</p>
              <p>Alonso was pissed off with Ah Ben's insistence of asking him to play against Juventus when his girl friend was going to give birth.</p>
              <p>The Barry issue was the last straw.</p>
              <p>That is why he played well cos he want to get a good price and get out of anfield.</p>
              <p>He is the vision for the goal scorer in front.</p>
              <p>So, alonso and benny saved ah ben's ass last season.</p>
              <p>You can sensed that Ah Ben is football crazy and dun really care very much about his players.</p>
              <p>Only SG and FT understand what Ah Ben is doing.</p>
              <p>But, players are human too and they need a pat on the shoulders.</p>
              <p>Human Touch - is what Ah Ben lack.</p>

              <p>liverpool has no proper scouting system. The players that they buy are all rubbish... not good at all... who the hell is Ngog?? or Lucas?? Oh my god!!!</p>
              <p>Arsenal has the world's best scouting system. They have scouts in almost every league and watches every damn game. The youngsters reported by the scouts need to go through wenger to vet, then the scouts go and watch them again and again and again.</p>
              <p>For example, cesc fabregas was watched by the scouts 40+ times before arsenal snapped him up.</p>
              <p>Therefore, many managers like steve bruce, will give arsene wenger a call and ask for opinion on which player to buy.</p>
              <p>So rafa benitez is no wenger in scouting, no saf in winning games, and no mourinho in cockiness.</p>

              <p>Rafa was a fantastic manager during his time at Valencia.</p>

              <p>As for Jose, he does know EPL too but I feels he needs to be in a team with big players, and funds. Not sure whether he can work in Pool's circumstances now.</p>
              <p>As for Dutch fella, he did well in barca, but that's a different league.</p>
