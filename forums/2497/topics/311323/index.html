              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>ALEX FERGUSON has ordered his Manchester United players to put their foot on the gas and motor to a 10th Premier League title.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">The Red Devils can go three points clear at the top if they beat Bolton at Old Trafford on Tuesday. And boss Fergie said: “We need to get our foot down and start motoring on now. We want to drive home our advantage at the top of the league by winning our game in hand. “We want the three points against Bolton, then look forward to a real battle against Liverpool on Sunday.”</p>
              <p class="article">Ferguson also wants his players to deliver a high level of performance from now until the end of the season. He said: “The important thing is to get consistency to make sure we don’t drop from a good level. “We have got a tough programme. But then I look at Arsenal’s and Chelsea’s and it is equally tough.</p>
              <p class="article">“It is not going to be easy. It is going to be very, very close this season — it could even go to the last game. “So to give yourself a proper chance you have to have a good consistency — that is what is going to win it.”</p>
              <p class="article">Arsenal have handed the impetus to United by drawing their last four domestic games. And Fergie said: “I said some months ago that there would be points dropped by the leading teams and that is happening. “Ourselves, Chelsea and Arsenal have all dropped points. Therefore if we can go on a consistent run from now to the end of the season it will give us a better chance.”</p>
              <p class="article">Arsenal’s poor run began when United thumped them 4-0 in the FA Cup fifth round. United then suffered their own Cup defeat to Portsmouth but bounced back with victory against Derby on Saturday. Ferguson added: “You have to deal with and react to defeats — that is the nature of this club.</p>
              <p class="article">“It happens. It is part of football. The important thing is to do something about it.” United needed Cristiano Ronaldo’s 31st goal of the season to dump the Rams. But that came only after they had missed a host of chances.</p>
              <p class="article">Fergie admitted: “The missed chances are becoming a concern. “Against Portsmouth and against Derby, we were really charitable. “It’s a sticky spell that we must get over because we’ve got big games coming up — against Bolton and then Liverpool at home. “We want to start taking our chances. If we start taking them then someone is going to suffer. We’ll just have to keep going at that.”</p>
              <p class="article">Defender Wes Brown agrees United must develop their ruthless streak. He said: “We’re getting some really good chances and we’ve got to start putting them away. “We made it very hard for ourselves against Derby. We could have finished the game in the first 10 or 15 minutes. “Luckily, we got the winner but if we hadn’t, it would have been very disappointing.”</p>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>CHELSEA’S man-eaters are lurking just below the surface and sensing blood. That is the stark warning from title-hungry Joe Cole as Avram Grant’s men prepare to take a giant bite out of their rivals this week. The basking Blues have gradually chomped away at the gap at the top of the table and are now within striking distance of leaders Manchester United.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Victory at Tottenham tomorrow will take them level on points with second-placed Arsenal. And a home win against the Gunners on Sunday could just take them back to the summit for the first time since August.</p>
              <h4>Cole is ready for onslaught</h4>
              <p class="article">Cole said menacingly: “We’re happy in the shadows, lurking there. “Now we’re ready to build some good form and go on the onslaught. “This is a great time for Chelsea.”</p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea have not lost in the Premier League for more than three months and have accumulated 30 points from 12 games since that defeat — 1-0 at Arsenal in December. Both Arsenal and Manchester United have still to visit Stamford Bridge and Cole knows that if Chelsea win their remaining nine league games they will be champions for the third time in four years.</p>
              <p class="article">Cole added: “It is very tight at the top and the race is wide open. So we need to stay focused because this is the time when you can’t afford to throw anything away. “No one on the planet knows who is going to win the league at the moment. It’s just a case of making sure we keep performing. “But I think we’re hitting form at just the right time and, hopefully, this is the start of bigger and better things for Chelsea.”</p>
              <p class="article">Grant’s men have extra motivation at White Hart Lane following last month’s shock 2-1 Carling Cup final defeat by Spurs. Cole, 26, was kept on the bench for most of that match as boss Grant was accused of getting his Wembley team and tactics hopelessly wrong. But the England midfielder draws a diplomatic curtain over that Wembley fiasco.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “The Carling Cup is in the past and so is the FA Cup defeat at Barnsley. “We’re not focused on those games, only on what lies ahead. "Our form was indifferent leading up to the Carling Cup final and it culminated in that match where we didn’t play anywhere near as well as we would have liked.</p>
              <p class="article">“But losing those cup ties might be a blessing in disguise if it helps us address where we were going wrong in the weeks leading up to those games — and make us wonder if we’d taken our eye off the prize a little bit.</p>
              <p class="article">"Maybe now we’ve seen the other end of the scale. “The Chelsea everyone saw lose to Spurs was low on confidence and didn’t play with anywhere near enough intensity and confidence. “We’ve come back well but we know there are still improvements to be made. “We’ve seen the best and worst of Chelsea recently but we need to make sure it’s only the best we bring out from now on.”</p>

              <p>Edwin van der Sar's groin problem is set to keep him out and although Tomasz Kuszczak is available after suspension, Foster should continue in goal.</p>

              <p><strong>Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson is a new injury worry with an ankle problem, while captain Ledley King is still troubled by his on-going calf injury.</strong></p>
              <p>Younes Kaboul (knee) is in contention but Gareth Bale is out for the season.</p>
              <p>Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech is very close to a return from his ankle injury and he may be included in the squad.</p>
              <p>Chelsea have no fresh injury worries but coach Avram Grant must decide whether to choose Nicolas Anelka or Didier Drogba to lead the attack. </p>

              <h2>CARVALHO ISSUES RALLYING CALL</h2>
              <p><img src="http://clientimages.teamtalk.com/08/01/240/ricardocarvalho_619294.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180"></p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Ricardo Carvalho has called on his Chelsea team-mates to keep the pressure on at the top of the Premier League with victories over Tottenham and Arsenal in their next two matches.</strong></p>
              <p>The Blues turned in a disappointing performance to lose to Spurs in the Carling Cup final last month and Carvalho is keen to exact revenge. If Chelsea can beat Juande Ramos' side on Wednesday and then follow it up with a win against Arsenal at the weekend, they could find themselves top of the table.</p>
              <p>Manchester United, who face Bolton and Liverpool in their next two matches, are three points ahead of Chelsea and Carvalho admits it is crucial not to lose further ground. "These two derbies are decisive for us. If we get the six points then we will put the pressure on Manchester United in the race for the title," the defender told the <em>Daily Mirror</em>.</p>
              <p>"We cannot afford to fail now. We know that the Tottenham and Arsenal games are so important because it will put us back in touch with the leaders. "We suffered a big blow when we lost to Tottenham in the Carling Cup final and, of course, we want to make up for that and show people what we are capable of.</p>
              <p>"It was the same in the FA Cup. Some people lost belief in us and that did affect our confidence, of course. "But if we win these two games we will be back in the title race - believing we can win it."</p>
              <p>Carvalho has been encouraged by Chelsea's recent performances in the league and has warned United and Arsenal that they will keep fighting all the way until the end of the season. He said: "Even though we have suffered badly in the two cup competitions, we have come back strongly and fought like lions in every match since.</p>
              <p>"We are as dangerous and as strong as ever, and determined to win a trophy this season. "We know for a club like Chelsea it would be a failure not to win a major title."</p>

              <h2>SPURS `READY` FOR CHELSEA</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"><br><br></div>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Didier Zokora and Jonathan Woodgate say that Tottenham are ready to repeat their Carling Cup heroics and derail Chelsea's title challenge.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ivory Coast international Zokora is targeting three wins from three games against Chelsea, Portsmouth and Newcastle as they are unbeaten at home in the league since early December.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The first of those games is against Chelsea, who Spurs beat 2-1 in the Carling Cup final.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We've now got three home games in a row and I'm looking at nine points because the confidence is there and we will have the fans behind us," Zokora told the club's official website.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Chelsea will be wanting to beat us because they can go joint second in the table, but I'm always confident when we play at home because our fans always get behind us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The players are ready for Chelsea because it's a London derby and we are always ready for games like this."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Defender Jonathan Woodgate said: "It will be a harder game than the final, without a doubt and they will want to put that right.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"They are going for the league title, they've always been there or thereabouts and the race is still wide open. They've top players who are hitting form at the right time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"But we always fancy ourselves to beat anyone, home or away, and this is no different. We also want to put matters right after losing at Manchester City.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"When you are a professional footballer you want to win as many games as you can and keep pushing up the league. We don't want to be in the bottom half of the table.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We've nine games left, 27 points to play for and we'll be looking to win every game."</p>

              <div class="sh"><strong>Tottenham 4-4 Chelsea </strong></div>
              <div class="sh"><strong></strong></div>
              <div class="sh"><strong>Robbie Keane's stunning goal gave Spurs a thrilling point against Chelsea.</strong></div>
              <p class="sh">Didier Drogba headed Chelsea in front after three minutes but Jonathan Woodgate rose to equalise for Spurs. Michael Essien's clever finish restored Chelsea's lead after 21 minutes and Joe Cole looked to have sealed the points with a third in the 52nd minute.</p>
              <p class="sh">Dimitar Berbatov's header and a Tom Huddlestone strike put Spurs level, and after Cole hit his second, Keane curled in superbly two minutes from time. Spurs fielded the side that beat Chelsea in the Carling Cup final - and showed videos of their triumph on the White Hart Lane big screens before kick-off.</p>
              <p class="sh">The cheers were swiftly silenced as Chelsea swept into a third-minute lead, Drogba heading in John Terry's cross at the far post. Joe Cole thought he had doubled Chelsea's lead three minutes later when he rounded Spurs keeper Paul Robinson to score, but the strike was ruled out for offside.</p>
              <p class="sh">Spurs delivered a timely response to level after 12 minutes when Wembley goal hero Woodgate rose above Drogba and Terry to send a powerful header high beyond Carlo Cudicini from Jermaine Jenas's free-kick. Chelsea looked the more dangerous side and should have restored their lead when Salomon Kalou just failed to apply the finishing touch to Joe Cole's driven cross. But they did not have long to wait before going back in front, Essien beating Robinson with a neat finish after 20 minutes with the outside of his right foot after a clever ball from Joe Cole unlocked the Spurs defence.</p>
              <p class="sh">Drogba wasted a good chance to extend Chelsea's advantage two minutes before the break after Frank Lampard robbed Jenas. The striker selfishly shot straight at Robinson with the England midfield man unmarked. There was an unsavoury scene on the stroke of half-time when Ashley Cole floored Spurs defender Alan Hutton near the touchline with a tackle that was both high and late - and worthy of a red card in the current disciplinary climate. Chelsea's players - led with an air of inevitability by England captain John Terry under the watchful eye of coach Fabio Capello - rushed and surrounded referee Mike Riley in a chaotic scene that did them no credit. When the crowd of Chelsea players finally dispersed, Riley showed leniency in producing only a yellow card - and even then Cole stood pointedly with his back to the official before receiving his punishment.</p>
              <p class="sh">Joe Cole had been a shining light for Chelsea, and he added a third for Chelsea after 52 minutes when he escaped a flimsy challenge from Pascal Chimbonda to score via Robinson's body. But Spurs were back in contention after 61 minutes when Berbatov rose above Terry to meet Huddlestone's corner and send a looping header over Cudicini.</p>
              <p class="sh">The Italian keeper produced a stunning save three minutes later to preserve Chelsea's lead, denying Keane at point-blank range after he was picked out by Berbatov's pass. It was an end-to-end affair, and Essien almost grabbed his second with a low shot that beat Robinson but rebounded to safety off an upright. But Spurs' all-out attacking approach paid off with 15 minutes left when Keane's corner fell to the giant Huddlestone, who fired a superb left foot drive beyond Cudicini.</p>
              <p class="sh">Spurs sensed an unlikely victory, but Chelsea responded in style and the inspirational Joe Cole put them back in front in the 80th minute, shrugging off another weak tackle from Chimbonda to beat Robinson emphatically. There was another twist after 88 minutes when a long clearance hit Ricardo Carvalho on the back and Keane reacted quickly to curl a 20-yard shot past Cudicini. And in a grandstand finish, Cudicini produced a wonder save from Berbatov when the Bulgarian looked poised to cap a magnificent match with the winner.</p>

              <p><strong>Chelsea defender Ashley Cole has apologised for his tackle on Alan Hutton and his reaction to referee Mike Riley.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cole's tackle on Tottenham defender Hutton during the 4-4 draw at White Hart Lane on Wednesday night sparked a red card storm. The incident provoked an angry reaction from both sets of players and both benches with Spurs feeling the former Arsenal man deserved a red card for the tackle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cole also had a stand-off with referee Mike Riley over the tackle with the official booking the defender for the offence. The England international has now issued a double apology for the tackle and his actions to Riley after reviewing footage of the incident.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I'd like to apologise to anyone I offended and of course Alan Hutton who I tackled. "I didn't mean to go in hard that way, it was high but I tried to read the ball and get the ball first, but he was a little bit too quick for me. "It wasn't malicious and I'm a little disappointed with what people are saying, that I meant it. Of course it was a bad tackle at the time but in the heat of the moment you want to win the game and win every tackle, and as I said I'm sorry for Alan, but it was never meant.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cole also insisted he never meant to disrespect Riley and admitted he needs to work on controlling his emotions. "I'm an emotional person, things can happen on the pitch very quickly but I didn't mean to disrespect the referee," added Cole. "I recognise this is a part of my game that I need to work on and control."</p>
