The midfield duo were heavily criticised by England fans after the frustrating goalless draw in Israel on Saturday. But Liverpool ace Gerrard insists he will continue to fill in wherever boss Steve McClaren needs him.</strong><br><br>Gerrard said: "The manager will pick whatever midfield he thinks is best suited for the game coming up. "I can't really say much more Â— other than what the manager wants me to do, I'll do."<br><br>Gerrard also reckons England can rescue their Euro 2008 qualifying campaign with a convincing victory over minnows Andorra tomorrow night. He added: "We are favourites but an early goal would be appreciated and make it easier for the rest of game. "It's important we start winning matches and try to turn things around.<br><br>"The results haven't been good and we as a bunch of players have to change that. "We've made it really difficult for ourselves but there is a lot of football to be played. "We've got to play Russia twice but our next two games give us a great chance to pick up six points. "The players look at the bigger picture Â— and we are confident we can be at Euro 2008."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Steven Gerrard deserved much credit on Tuesday, and not just because he had the courage to contradict an England coach who is fast becoming impossible to comprehend. From Gerrard there was no attempt to hide the truth with questionable statistics. No suggestion that, while "dealing in reality", everyone else suffered from a lack of perception. Even for Gerrard, however, there were things that had to remain unsaid before WednesdayÂ’s match against Andorra here. Things that occupy his mind whenever he represents England and often leave him frustrated and unfulfilled.</strong><br><br>If the opposition pose a threat and Hargreaves has to occupy the holding role, McClaren abuses GerrardÂ’s remarkable versatility and pushes him to the right. If McClaren wants to play with wingers, Hargreaves now appears to pay the price. The problem, of course, is how McClaren accommodates Frank Lampard. Rather than make what would be a brave decision, EnglandÂ’s coach would prefer to take what looks like the easy option. Hargreaves is used to being left out.<br><br>Lampard, of course, is not. Even when his form is suffering. Which is ridiculous when McClaren has seen on so many occasions how unhappy a midfield marriage Lampard and Gerrard represent. Who sits and who goes? It is a problem EnglandÂ’s two finest midfielders have never solved. A problem Sven Goran Eriksson blamed on their mutual reluctance to shoulder the defensive responsibilities.<br><br>Hargreaves provided a solution during the last World Cup and what must depress both Gerrard and the hugely talented Bayern Munich midfielder is that not once have they been given the opportunity to form an exciting new partnership. Unless, that is, LampardÂ’s injured wrist does rule him out. An argument that McClaren does not need a holding midfielder against part-timers who boast a policeman and an insurance broker among their ranks is a flawed one because EnglandÂ’s forwards can perform more effectively when there is balance in central midfield.<br><br>Likewise, an argument that England will score four or five anyway offers no guidance for the more demanding challenges ahead. The injury Lampard suffered in training on Monday provided McClaren with a reason for dropping the Chelsea vice-captain but he has even shied away from that, preferring to indulge a player who, to his credit, is prepared to play through the pain.<br><br>It means McClaren will learn nothing, the only benefit to this evening being another three points and a minor boost to EnglandÂ’s shattered confidence.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>gerrard looks set for the central role. they needa change downing though, maybe when joe cole comes back.<br><br>and the andorran players are all actors..<br><br>also interesting to note is that an england centreback was always attacking only leaving 2 behind. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lampard has more luck but he does not defend.<br>Gerrard is the same as Lampard when it comes to long shot and attack but the only thing is that he drops back to help out with the defence.<br>People argue that Gerrard can act as a Vice-Captain for England but Lampard is equally good as a leader. Plus there is a tough John Terry.<br>the best solution, re-call Beckham, partner Defoe and Crouch, as Rooney is more of a second striker. Becks pinpoint crosses will suit Crouch's play, they two work well together, lennon's play suit rooney and owen more as lennon cannot cross as well as Becks but he is more of a direct player like Joe Cole.<br>Steve Mc does not have the guts to drop Lampard or Gerrard as they are two worldwide big name playes, drop one, another gets fed up.

A team England should beat easily no matter the team they put it out. Credit still to Gerrard for being hardworking and getting the two goals, but overall for the team, they did end the first half 0 - 0, and overall, it was still a below par performance by England.<br><br>I'm not saying Gerrard isn't good, in fact I pretty much agree with your points. I'm just saying the result of this last match is inconclusive in confirming this Gerrard or Lampard debate.<br><br>What would really make or break would be when the team faces strong opposition.</div>

Now; the Qualifiers &amp; friendlies simply substantiated this driving point - that he is utterly useless, not as capable as Stevie G and simply cannot work with someone who has the same style of play as him, yet is better than him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>
