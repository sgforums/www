The ex-England skipper has not played since announcing he will join LA Galaxy at the end of the season.</strong><br><br>Boss Fabio Capello had frozen Beckham out as he attempts to revive Real as Europe's top side. But Becks is back for the crunch La Liga clash as Real seek to avoid a third straight defeat.<br><br>The former Manchester United star Â— who is yet to win a trophy during his four-year stay at the Bernabeu Â— admitted yesterday that he wants a big finish to his time in Spain.<br><br>Becks, 31, said: Â“I want to leave this club on a high. Â“IÂ’m desperate to play again. I donÂ’t know if I will but IÂ’ve got to keep on training.  Â“It is very hard for me because I would like to help the team.Â”<br><br>Prior to his recall, Beckham had been left out of Capello's squad for every game since agreeing a Â£128million contract to switch to Major League Soccer. His last appearance was as a substitute during the defeat at Deportivo La Coruna on January 7.<br><br>Club captain Raul has given his support, saying Becks should continue playing until the end of the season.<br><br></div>

The former England captain was today named in the squad for tomorrow's Primera Liga match against Real Sociedad, the first time head coach Capello has picked him since Beckham announced he will leave in the summer to join Major League Soccer's Los Angeles Galaxy.<br><br>Capello declared at the time Beckham would not play for the club again, but has since softened that stance with the club struggling for form. However, the Italian refuted rumours that senior squad members had pushed for Beckham's reinstatement. 'The only thing has influenced me has been Beckham's work and attitude,' Capello said. 'I have spoken with him and he is very happy, as we are.'<br><br>Capello admitted he was sceptical over Beckham's commitment to the Madrid cause following his decision to see out his contract and agree a five-year deal with the Galaxy, which reportedly could be worth up to Â£128million. 'We had doubts after he signed such an important contract with the Los Angeles Galaxy that he could play and train with the same desire,' Capello said.<br><br>'This week he has taken part in training perfectly. He has always had the support of his team-mates, the only doubts we had were about his desire.<br>'He has behaved like a great professional and he returns to the squad.'<br><br>Capello's decision represents a remarkable U-turn from his and sporting director Predrag Mijatovic's previous stance, which both appeared to be sticking to earlier in the week. While Mijatovic said on Monday: 'Beckham has been a great professional these years, but he has decided to leave for another team. 'Now we want to give more opportunities to the younger players so they have more minutes.'<br><br>However, Beckham has had support from within the Madrid side, with one of the team's three captains, Guti, stating this week he would like to see the former Manchester United star return to the side.</div>

The former England captain netted his third league goal of the season when he sent a 25-metre free kick skidding under goalkeeper Claudio Bravo and inside the far post to cancel out an early header from Sociedad midfielder Mikel Aranburu.</strong><br><br>Beckham's former Manchester United colleague Ruud van Nistelrooy grabbed the winner three minutes after the break when he headed in a cross from right back Miguel Torres. It was the first time in 11 outings Real had scored more than one goal in a game.<br><br>The victory, coming after back-to-back defeats by Levante and Villarreal, lifted Real to third place in the table with 41 points from 22 games.It also eased the pressure on coach Fabio Capello, who backtracked on his decision to leave out Beckham following the midfielder's announcement last month that he would be joining Los Angeles Galaxy at the end of the season.<br><br>"I'm happy he scored a goal from a free kick as he hasn't scored many this season," Capello told reporters. "He played a great game today." Sociedad remain one point off the bottom and eight from safety with all their immediate rivals yet to play this weekend.<br><br>Beckham, in the starting lineup for only the sixth time this season, hardly got a touch before his team fell behind after an uncharacteristic error from Iker Casillas. The Real Madrid goalkeeper misjudged a deep seventh-minute cross from Xabi Prieto, palmed the ball into the path of Aranburu and the midfielder headed home. Madrid barely threatened in the opening half hour but got a break when Emerson was fouled and Beckham, who last appeared for the club as a substitute on Jan. 7, drove in the 37th-minute free kick.<br><br>Van Nistelrooy put Real ahead early in the second half but the visitors then had to weather a storm of attacks, with Prieto going close and Casillas making a superb reflex save soon after.</div>
