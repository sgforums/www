Neill, who was boss at Highbury from 1976 to 1983, attended SundayÂ´s game in which Wenger also snubbed PardewÂ´s post-match handshake.<br><br>"I like both managers, I think of both of them as very good friends, and IÂ´ve got say I was disappointed with Arsene," Neill said on BBC Radio Five Live. "I would have though he would have been bigger than the reaction he showed."</div>

We must be an example for young boys that try and play football," he told reporters on Friday.<br><br>"It was a bad situation. Sometimes you cannot control your temper but as managers we must do it. Managers have a responsibility and while you can be passionate, afterwards you must be polite.<br><br>"People were talking here about (former Liverpool manager) Bill Shankly having passion and nothing happened with him."<br><br>Liverpool and Arsenal have both struggled to mount a title challenge this season and Benitez said his side could not afford to lose many more matches and still hold out hope of winning the Premier League.<br><br>"It's important to beat the top teams, but when you are 11 points behind it's important not to lose any games -- especially against the top sides," he said.<br><br>"We know we need to win in the premiership and we need to win against the top sides."<br><br>Liverpool are without midfielder Momo Sissoko for the next three months after he underwent surgery to repair a dislocated shoulder.<br><br>"It is a blow for us. When I look at my team I always think which players can keep playing and Momo could always play," Benitez said. "Even if the game were two days later he would be fit. He is a big player for us."<br></div>
