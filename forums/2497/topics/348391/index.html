              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">ALEX FERGUSON has revealed how he dreads picking his team.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article">The Manchester United boss says the whole squad is playing so well at the 
                  moment it is proving a nightmare choosing 11 and telling some of his stars 
                  they are left out.</p>
              <p class="article">Mind you, he admits the problem is great news for the champions.</p>
              <p class="article">Ferguson said: “Everyone has done so well that I’m beginning to dread picking 
                  the team.</p>
              <p class="article">“I feel guilty when I am forced to leave someone out who has not only done 
                  nothing wrong but who has played exceptionally well.</p>
              <p class="article">“It puts the club in a strong position, of course, but it doesn’t make the 
                  manager’s job very easy.”</p>
              <p class="article">Fergie has a big seven days ahead of him, in which he has to pick three teams.</p>
              <p class="article">Tonight, they take on Fulham, then it is Blackburn at home on Saturday 
                  followed by a Champions League crunch in the San Siro against Inter Milan 
                  next Tuesday.</p>
              <p class="article">He will want to field his strongest team against the Italian champions but 
                  right now he admits to not knowing what that is.</p>
              <p class="article">Fergie said: “People sometimes ask me what I consider to be my best side and 
                  the short answer is that I don’t have one.</p>
              <p class="article">“I can give you my best 14 or 15 but, better than that, all I can say is that 
                  it’s a squad game and we have a damn fine squad. In fact the best!”</p>
              <p class="article">They need it as well, as they take on the job of winning an unprecedented five 
                  trophies this season.</p>
              <p class="article">The Club World Cup is in the bag and they have a date at Wembley against 
                  Tottenham in the Carling Cup final on March 1.</p>
              <p class="article">Victory over Derby on Sunday booked them a trip to Swansea or Fulham in the FA 
                  Cup last eight.</p>
              <p class="article">And, tonight, they can go five points clear of nearest Premier League rivals 
                  Liverpool in their long-awaited game in hand.</p>
              <p class="article">United have been playing catch-up due to their European Super Cup and Club 
                  World Cup exploits.</p>
              <p class="article">Ferguson said: “Once we have played Fulham, we’ll know exactly what position 
                  we are in.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">United have not conceded in 13 league games, allowing them to win games by 
                  just scoring a single goal.</p>
              <p class="article">Nine of their 17 league victories this season have been 1-0, an indication 
                  that the division is now tougher.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “There were signs last season that the league was firming up. Games 
                  have become more difficult than they have in the past.</p>
              <p class="article">“It’s very unforgiving. Make a mistake at this level and it’s odds-on you will 
                  be punished.”</p>
              <p class="article">Fergie must decide whether Wayne Rooney faces Fulham after seven games out 
                  with hamstring trouble.</p>
              <p class="article">The Scot said: “Wayne has not had a hamstring injury before and there is no 
                  way we will be bringing him back before we’re certain he’s ready.</p>
              <p class="article">“We must make sure enough work has been done on the hamstring so that it 
                  doesn’t break down again.”</p>
