Knight signed his contract on Wednesday after both clubs had agreed a fee for the 27-year-old late last night.</strong><br><br>Villa boss Martin O'Neill said: "Zat has got a lot of natural talent. I'm hoping that if he performs the way he can perform and has done in the past, we can expect him to be a big asset."<br><br>Knight was born in nearby Solihull and is a lifelong Villa fan. In 1999 he moved from his first club Rushall Olympic to Fulham for a 'fee' of 30 tracksuits. Knight only signed a new three-year deal with Fulham in the summer but boss Lawrie Sanchez was prepared to let him move on.<br><br>Knight, who made two full England appearances in 2005, will give O'Neill options at centre-back alongside Olof Mellberg, Martin Laursen and Gary Cahill.<br><br>Knight could make his debut for Villa against Chelsea this Sunday.</div>

He don't seem happy...<br><br><blockquote>Roman Abramovich's relationship with Jose Mourinho looked under strain again as the Russian stormed from his seat before the end of ChelseaÂ’s 2-0 loss at Aston Villa last night. The Chelsea owner left the directors' box two minutes from time, apparently disgusted at seeing his side concede Gabriel Agbonlahor's late second goal, which followed a Zat Knight debut opener for the hosts. Abramovich paused only to shake the outstretched hand of former Villa chairman Doug Ellis but hardly broke stride as he headed away ...</blockquote></div>
