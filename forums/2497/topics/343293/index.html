              <p><strong>Chelsea boss Luiz Felipe
              Scolari feels he cannot partner Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka in a
              two-man attack at the moment as he does not have a genuine left winger
              at his disposal. </strong></p>
              <p>Scolari thinks only Florent Malouda, who is injured, can play
              on the left of a 4-4-2 formation, despite seeing Joe Cole previously
              playing in that position for England.</p>
              <p>Wayne Bridge would also have offered a solution but the
              left-sided player, who can play full-back or midfield, has been sold to
              Manchester City.</p>
              <p>"I will play 4-4-2 when I have a winger who can play on the left and with his left foot," Scolari said in the <em>Evening Standard</em>. "When you don't have players with these characteristics it is difficult to adapt one player to play in 4-4-2.</p>
              <p>"Florent Malouda is the only player who can play with his left foot and he is injured. Everyone else is right-footed."</p>
              <p>Scolari has favoured a 4-3-3 formation but Chelsea have won only
              three of their last 10 games ahead of the Barclays Premier League clash
              against champions Manchester United at Old Trafford this weekend.</p>

              <p>Cole is usually deployed as a left/right sided attacker under both Scolari and Mourinho. A left sided attacker and a left winger are different.</p>
              <p>Seems like the "special one" has formed a strong 4-3-3 stucture within the chelsea team that even after he left, his successors Grant and Scolari are still using the formation, because the players were bought and trained for that formation. There are many candidates to fill the 3 central midfield roles, but only Malouda is a natrual winger. In fact i think he played more of a forward role during his time at Lyon.</p>

              <p><br>lampard is indeed clumsy but i would not call him useless as a midfielder...in the end, the object of the game is to score as many as you can...no?</p>

              <p><br>Yes but if you rely on him too much then the other team neutralize him how is it gonna affect the rest of the team? And if he can't create its just another player wasted</p>

              not sure what you're trying to point out..anyone who gets neutralized is ineffective what? i think his ballet toes does plenty of assists...his passes are quite pinpoint....rooney is rated but what has he done really this season? scoring is what matters....if a sissy pot were to be playing in my team but scores plenty, i'll still play him regardless...
              
              i think big phil is not mercurial as many have made him out to be...he can shout but really not much of a tactician...or even a motivator at that....i will place my money on pool to wrap things up by end april....

              <p>Rooney is good, but unable to deliver on a more consistent basis. There was a short spell of 4-5 games this season where he was on red-hot form and looked like the best player in europe... but that form has eluded him since.</p>
