              <p><a title="More 
              from guardian.co.uk on Manchester City" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity">Manchester City</a> are 
              demanding an official explanation after the referee responsible for the 
              infamous "Fergie Time" controversy was put in charge of tomorrow's 
              Manchester derby.</p>
              <p>Senior officials at Eastlands are so concerned 
              about Martin Atkinson's appointment that, with Roberto Mancini's 
              agreement, they were trying to contact the <span style="color: #000000;"><a title="More from
               guardian.co.uk on Premier League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague">Premier League</a>'s head of <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Referees" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/referees">referees</a></span>, Mike Riley, 
              tonight to express their concerns. The club will demand to know why 
              another referee was not appointed.</p>
              <p>Atkinson has been switched from
               Stoke's match against Bolton Wanderers despite being heavily criticised
               when the teams met at Old Trafford in September. He was the official 
              who awarded four minutes of stoppage time but actually played seven, 
              with Michael Owen scoring a 96th-minute winner for Sir Alex Ferguson's 
              team.</p>
              <p>tomorrow's match was due to be officiated by Steve Bennett 
              but he has been on a Uefa course in Romania and contacted the 
              Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) this afternoon to 
              inform them that he had not been able to fly back because of the 
              Icelandic volcano eruption.</p>
              <p>Mancini was not at the club at the 
              time of the earlier game but his predecessor as manager, Mark Hughes, 
              was so incensed by Atkinson's timekeeping that he requested an 
              explanation from the Premier League, and the club was not satisfied with
               the response. Atkinson was absolved by Riley, and the PGMOL has taken 
              the stance that it cannot be influenced by what it perceives to be 
              unfair criticisms.</p>
              <p>Atkinson will go into both dressing rooms 
              before the match to remind the players to do nothing to incite the crowd
               in what Ferguson described as potentially the most important Manchester
               derby since he took control of United in 1986.</p>
              <p>Ferguson's side 
              are four points behind Chelsea at the top of the league and a defeat 
              would all but end their hopes of a fourth successive title. City are 
              fourth in the league, hoping to qualify for the Champions League, and 
              the club Ferguson derided as "noisy neighbours" have scored 14 times in 
              the last three games.</p>
              <p>Six have come from Carlos Tevez, taking his 
              total to 28 in a season when he has been nominated for the Professional 
              Footballers' Association player of the year award, but Ferguson said he 
              had "no regrets" about losing the Argentinian to City, even though Wayne
               Rooney's ankle injury has been a devastating blow.</p>
              <p>"You cannot 
              dispute the fact that he [Tevez] has had a great goalscoring season but 
              I've got no regrets at all. None whatsoever. We tried to buy him but we 
              didn't match the money they wanted [the consortium that owned Tevez's 
              registration] and therefore the boy moved on. There is no bitterness for
               me. Players leave here – some do well, some don't. You just have to 
              move on."</p>
              <p>Ferguson added: "I thought he had a good first season 
              with us, I must admit, but in the second season he didn't feature as 
              much. This is a very big club and there is a big demand here. And he had
               far more competition with us than he has at City, there is no doubt 
              about that."</p>
              <p>City's decision to put up a "Welcome to Manchester" 
              billboard after signing Tevez led Ferguson to describe them as a "small 
              club with a small mentality" and the striker has continued to be a 
              central figure in the rivalry, most notably by describing Gary Neville 
              as a "boot-licking moron".</p>
              <p>But Tevez also angered his own club 
              this week with a newspaper interview in which he said the players were 
              "not happy" with Mancini's double training sessions. Mancini will not 
              fine his leading scorer but he will summon him to his office for an 
              explanation. "This week, the most important thing for me has been the 
              game," he said. "I will have time, though, in the coming weeks."</p>
              <p>Mancini
               hopes the striker will regret his remarks. "I know how footballers 
              work. When I was a player [at Sampdoria] I publicly criticised the 
              manager for his training. I would say: 'Oh, this training is no good for
               us and blah blah blah' but when that manager, [Vujadin] Boskov, was 
              sacked I was sad because I knew he was the best manager and that I had 
              made a mistake. I knew I was wrong."</p>
