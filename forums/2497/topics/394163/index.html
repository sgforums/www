              <p>Arsenal
               fans sang ‘We are top of the League’ and the Tannoy man played the 
              old Curtis Mayfield classic Move On Up.</p>
              <p>With 10 men, tense 
              and tentative it may have been at times, but Arsenal eked out the win 
              that gives them the leadership — and it could even be the shape of 
              things to come as the season enters endgame.</p>
              <p>Barcelona will 
              pre-occupy them in the coming weeks for a mouth-watering Champions 
              League quarter-final but alongside, the prospect of a Premier League 
              title is edging from possible towards probable, even if Manchester 
              United and Chelsea overtake them again on Sunday.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>

              </div>
              <p>After ailing Birmingham City at St Andrews 
              next Saturday, Arsenal have Wolves at home — on the day United and 
              Chelsea meet. To follow, only Tottenham and Manchester City appear as 
              form teams likely to interrupt a winning sequence that currently stands 
              at six League matches.</p>
              <p>It could also help that Saturday’s events 
              will not breed complacency but have instead confirmed that there is to 
              them a new-found strength in adversity, on which they even seem to 
              thrive.</p>
              <p>After Denilson had given Arsenal a fifth-minute lead, the 
              Emirates settled down for a goal feast but the sending-off of defender 
              Thomas Vermaelen for a clumsy challenge on Guillermo Franco just before 
              half-time meant that the script had to be rewritten.</p>
              <p>Alessandro 
              Diamanti saw his subsequent penalty saved by Manuel Almunia and it 
              proved costly.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/20/article-1259444-08CCED0F000005DC-242_468x286.jpg" alt="Arsenal's Brazilian midfielder Denilson" width="468" height="286">

              dazzling strike</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Arsenal still had enough left on the break 
              and Cesc Fabregas converted a late penalty — his 18th goal of the season
               — on his return after injury after Matthew Upson had handled.</p>
              <p>‘We’ve
               improved in our maturity and when we need to accelerate we can do it,’ 
              said Arsene Wenger. ‘We are all conscious that we have won nothing yet 
              but the hunger is there, the talent is there and the nerve is there.’</p>
              <p>The
               manager and his team were fortunate, though, that West Ham were too 
              limp to profit from their numerical advantage in the second half.</p>
              <p>The
               Hammers — four straight defeats now as they sink deeper in the 
              relegation mire — are in turn fortunate that Hull City and Burnley keep 
              losing.</p>

              </div>
              <p>This week, they are at home against Wolves 
              and Stoke and must surely start winning, even if it might take just 36 
              points to stay up this season.</p>
              <p>‘This week will tell us a lot,’ 
              said West Ham manager Gianfranco Zola. ‘It is going to be massive.’</p>
              <p>At
               least he will have back two key figures in Scott Parker and leading 
              scorer Carlton Cole, the first held back on Saturday, the second 
              appearing only belatedly.</p>

              <p>Zola’s selection — which hinted at keeping frontpowder dry — duly 
              looked weak initially and they made the worst possible start.</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Arsenal (4-2-3-1):</span> Almunia; Eboue, 
              Campbell, Vermaelen, Clichy; Song, Denilson; Nasri (Sagna 74min), 
              Fabregas, Arshavin (Eduardo 84); Bendtner (Diaby 58). <span style="font-style: italic;">Subs (not used):</span> Fabianski, Rosicky,

               Ham (4-4-2):</span> Green; Spector, Tomkins, Upson, Daprela; Diamanti, 
              Behrami, Kovac (Noble 70), Stanislas; Franco (Cole 57), Mido (McCarthy 
              75). <span style="font-style: italic;">Subs (not used)</span>: Stech,

               M Atkinson (West Yorkshire).</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Backing off, they allowed Denilson to play a one-two with Nicklas 
              Bendtner on the edge of the area and the Brazilian drilled a low shot 
              into Robert Green’s left corner.</p>
              <p>It was the signal for some 
              mesmerising attacking movement by the home side of the sort that West 
              Ham legends from Ron Greenwood to Trevor Brooking would have purred 
              over.</p>
              <p>Arsenal were so nearly punished for failing to finish, 
              however, and West Ham left cursing that they were not level at the 
              interval when they should have been grateful they were just one goal 
              behind.</p>
              <p>Diamanti sent a high, hopeful ball forward for Franco
               to chase and Vermaelen appeared to claw him back. That was certainly 
              the verdict of referee Martin Atkinson, who immediately pointed to the 
              penalty spot and showed the Belgian the red card.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Full stretch: West Ham's Alessandro Diamanti 
              (left) has his penalty saved by Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Almunia
               dived to his left to beat away Diamanti’s kick and preserve Arsenal’s 
              lead but Wenger was still left fuming and waited by the touchline for Mr
               Atkinson as the half ended to remonstrate with him.</p>
              <p>Wenger moved 
              Alex Song into the back four for the second half — a move he is likely 
              to repeat next Saturday with Vermaelen now suspended and William Gallas 
              still injured — and Arsenal coped comfortably enough, thanks to West 
              Ham’s inability to move the ball quickly enough to drag the 10 men 
              around.</p>
              <p>Cole did hit the outside of a post with a shot but any 
              Arsenal nerves evaporated when Fabregas flicked the ball up on to 
              Upson’s hand and Atkinson evened up the penalty count, the Spaniard 
              tucking the ball home comfortably.</p>
