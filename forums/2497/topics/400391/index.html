              <p>Being the most entertaining football team in the world, 
              having the most fearsome attacking unit in football and not to mention 
              becoming one of the greatest club sides in history simply isn’t enough 
              for Barcelona.</p>
              <p>The Catalan behemoths are hell-bent on strengthening the team even 
              more and with Joan 
              Laporta eager to bring in as many big name signings as he 
              can before his presidential mandate is over, and the candidates to 
              replace him looking to infuse their own influence in transfer matters 
              when they move into office, the Blaugrana could have a wave of megastars
               in their dressing room next season.</p>
              <p><strong>Goalkeepers</strong></p>
              <p>No additions will be necessary here. After a spectacular season in 
              which he won his third Zamora Trophy and was further rewarded with a 
              call-up to the Spanish national team for the World Cup, Victor Valdes will 
              not be going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
              <p>Back-up goalkeeper Jose Manuel Pinto appears content to stay on and 
              play second fiddle to Valdes and earn first team minutes in Copa del Rey games. In
               addition, coach Pep 
              Guardiola could promote a youngster from the reserve team to
               start earning valuable experience and become Valdes’ deputy in the 
              future, and eventually his successor.</p>
              <p><strong>Defence</strong></p>
              <p>Simultaneous injuries and suspensions have on occasion stretched Barcelona’s
               backline to the limit this past season, especially in the big games. 
              Although they always seem to pull through unscathed, Guardiola needs 
              sufficient depth in his defense if he wants to challenge for the treble 
              again.</p>
              <p>Dmytro Chygrynskiy’s woeful debut season could force Barca to look 
              for a new centre-back to strengthen the rearguard, especially if the 
              coaching staff does not feel that the Ukrainian can lift his game.</p>
              <p>The Catalans already boast two of the best center-backs in Spain and 
              no names have so far been linked to the club. Instead, a position that 
              Barca may need to focus on is the left-back slot. Maxwell has provided 
              decent cover, but a world class talent like <strong>Ashley Cole </strong>could
               effectively patch up the last of the team’s weak links. The Chelsea man fits Barca’s 
              style of play as he loves to join in in attack, but he doesn’t neglect 
              his defensive duties either.</p>
              <p><strong>Philipp Lahm</strong> could also be a good alternative, as 
              his ability to play in both right and left full-back positions would 
              allow Carles Puyol
               to remain at the heart of defense whenever Dani Alves is unavailable, 
              or even allow Eric Abidal to be pushed inside to center-back.  </p>
              <p>In truth, there is no shortage of central-defensive cover at the Camp Nou. Gaby Milito 
              and Rafa Marquez, when fully fit, are more than qualified deputies, 
              while Henrique will return on loan from Racing Santander after a 
              commendable season with the Cantabrians.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://u.goal.com/44100/44114_hp.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>Midfield</strong></p>
              <p>One of Txiki Begiristain’s prime transfer objectives before his boss Joan Laporta leaves
               office is to sign a world class holding midfielder. And with Yaya Toure looking 
              almost certain to leave Catalunya, there will be a need to fill the gap.
               One man who can take on that role is <strong>Javier Mascherano</strong>,
               who recently opened the door to a move to the Camp Nou by admitting 
              that he wanted to join the Blaugrana last summer and Barcelona
               remains the city that appeals to him and his family the most.</p>
              <p>The Argentine will not come cheap, however, and plans for the Liverpool
               man could be scratched if Laporta manages to pull off the biggest of 
              coups and land <strong><br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Cesc 
              Fabregas</strong>.</p>
              <p>The Arsenal 
              captain is not a player that Barcelona are in desperate 
              need of at present, but the temptation to bring back one of their 
              starlets from La Masia is just too strong. Also, the risk of missing out
               on what could potentially be the only window of opportunity is just too
               great, especially now that Fabregas himself has admitted he wants to 
              return to his boyhood club. And if Arsenal do agree to sell 
              their star playmaker, then Barca should do all they can to bring him 
              back to La Liga.</p>
              <p>An alternative to Mascherano would be Athletic Bilbao’s <strong>Javi 
              Martinez</strong>. The young midfielder, who is going to the World Cup 
              with Spain, has recently been linked with Real Madrid, but rumors are 
              that the Blaugrana are also keen on his services.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://u.goal.com/89000/89014_hp.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>Attack</strong></p>
              <p>Do Barcelona really need more attacking firepower?</p>
              <p>Having just signed David Villa, and with Laporta assuring that Zlatan Ibrahimovic
               is not for sale, any more signings in attack will really tip the team 
              off-balance. Just 24 hours after Barca officially sealed Villa’s 
              transfer, rumors surfaced that presidential candidate Sandro Rosell had 
              made <strong>Fernando
               Torres</strong> his election promise.</p>
              <p>But with a transfer fee expected to skyrocket to the region of €75 
              million, a realistic swoop for ‘El Nino’ this summer is unlikely, unless
               Ibra is off-loaded for a significant amount.</p>
              <p>Forgotten man Keirrison will remain on loan for another season at Fiorentina.</p>
