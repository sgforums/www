              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Big-money man: Manchester City saw off United 
              with a huge outlay of £45m for striker Carlos Tevez</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Pressure? Real pressure? How about languishing four points adrift at 
              the foot of the Barclays Premier League and calculating the cost of 
              relegation with a lavish squad and a mammoth wage bill?</p>
              <p>'We 
              were bottom of the league and the chairman hadn't slept for a few 
              weeks,' says Harry Redknapp. 'He just kept telling me, "We can't get 
              relegated, Harry, we mustn't get this club relegated". So I helped him 
              sleep by getting us out of trouble.'</p>
              <p>Redknapp grins as he 
              recounts the story ahead of tonight's game at Manchester
               City, where a win for Tottenham
               will guarantee a top-four finish and a ticket into the lucrative 
              Champions League for the first time.</p>
              <p>The game is 'massive', 
              he admits, but the Spurs manager is training the heat on his opponents, a
               club with seemingly limitless financial muscle who are itching to 
              dominate the world. Their impatience has seen them dispose of one 
              manager this season.</p>
              <p>'There's no pressure on us,' says 
              Redknapp. 'We set out for a top-seven finish so we've definitely 
              exceeded expectations. There's more pressure on them.</p>
              <p>'If 
              you'd asked me for a top five, I'd have put Liverpool
               in it for sure - I thought they could win it this year after 
              finishing second - and I thought Man City could beat anyone. I thought 
              they could even be champions this season.</p>
              <p>'Everybody in 
              football knows it's only a matter of time before they win the title. I 
              think they'll win it in the next three or four years. They're a powerful
               outfit with the owners they've got.</p>
              <p>'With the players people
               tell me they're trying to bring in over the summer, they're going to 
              put a team together to win the championship. They probably will do. If 
              you bring enough world-class players, you're going to have a chance.'</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Bidding war: City warned Spurs off a move for 
              Craig Bellamy, says Redknapp</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>If Redknapp's assessment of City is accurate, this game has 
              repercussions on the speed of their unstoppable progress. With the added
               lustre of Champions League football, what is there to stop a procession
               of top players beating a path to the City of Manchester Stadium to 
              pocket Europe's fattest pay packets and play in the world's best club 
              competition?</p>
              <p>Redknapp revealed yesterday how Spurs had been 
              bullied out of their attempt to sign striker Craig Bellamy from West
               Ham last year because City threatened to 'blow them out of the 
              water' in their efforts to sign midfielder Wilson Palacios from Wigan.
               Money talks.</p>
              <p>'I mean, Carlos Tevez, he cost £45million, 
              didn't he,' says Redknapp. 'That's what the whole deal came to, 
              apparently. That's why Manchester
               United didn't take him in the end. That's big, big money? And 
              obviously massive wages. But that's the level they're at.'</p>
              <p>The
               knock-on effect of this policy appears to be incessant pressure on the 
              manager. Roberto Mancini replaced Mark Hughes in December and his future
               is uncertain, even if he finishes fourth.</p>
              <p>'That's up to the 
              owners, ' Redknapp shrugs. 'It's fierce when you think about it. Mark 
              Hughes was doing fine. It's difficult.'</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/04/article-1272335-096E5FA8000005DC-304_306x869.jpg" alt="Team news" width="306" height="869"></div>
              <div class="floatRHS"><br></div>
              <p>Spurs can put the brakes on City by keeping them out of the top four 
              for another year and boosting their own interests: the endless pursuit 
              of neighbours Arsenal and expensive projects to build a new stadium and 
              new training ground.</p>
              <p>'No one is walking around here thinking,
               "Cor, we can get in the Champions League",' said Redknapp. 'It has 
              never been mentioned. I've not even spoken to the players about it. 
              Hopefully it will happen. If we can get in the Champions League next 
              year, it would be great for us. I'd be pleased to be a part of it. We'll
               give it our best shot.</p>
              <p>'But if you start thinking, "Am I 
              going to make it?" and then you don't make it, you will commit suicide 
              in this game. You can't get ahead of yourself. I can't get too up before
               it happens. Or too low if it does not happen. I don't think the players
               think that way. It's difficult to explain sometimes.'</p>
              <p>Redknapp
               can afford to play it cool. He has transformed Spurs from bottom of the
               Premier League to the brink of the Champions League in 18 months and 
              the £5m paid to release him from Portsmouth
               will go down as one of Levy's best investments. Unlike Mancini, his
               job and his popularity are safe.</p>
              <p>He may go to Manchester 
              fretting over the fitness of captain Ledley King and goalkeeper Heurelho
               Gomes but he has assembled a strong squad at White Hart Lane.</p>
              <p>On
               Saturday his six outfield substitutes (Palacios, Aaron Lennon, Eidur 
              Gudjohnsen, Jermaine Jenas, Peter Crouch and Sebastien Bassong) would 
              have made any rival manager envious.</p>
              <p>A win tonight and he 
              will join a small band of English managers who have appeared in the 
              modern Champions League.</p>
              <p>'What gets me excited?' Redknapp mused. 
              'My missus is still trying to find the answer.'</p>
