              <p class="small bold">OFFER ... Jose Mourinho</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">JOSE MOURINHO was sounded out about the Liverpool job — in case Rafa Benitez decided to walk away. </h2>
              <p class="article">Benitez raised doubts about his Anfield future by refusing to sign his new contract offer. Those fears effectively ended after Wednesday’s 1-0 Champions League win at Real Madrid, when the Kop boss revealed he plans to stay. </p>
              <p class="article">Yet the club’s American owners were so wary of being left without an alternative if the Spaniard quit, they targeted Mourinho as a possible replacement. </p>
              <p class="article">And middle men sounded out whether the former Chelsea boss would be interested. An insider confirmed: “The Americans had read Mourinho was interested in returning to the Premier League and wanted to know if he meant it. “But it wasn’t a firm approach or a job offer. It was more a case of testing the water in case Rafa did decide to walk out.” </p>
              <p class="article">Benitez had refused to commit his future to Liverpool until he got assurances he could have more control over transfers and a bigger say in the club’s academy. He was also unsettled that the rift between owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks cast him as piggy-in-the-middle, leaving him in an untenable position. But further talks have taken place with Benitez’s representatives over the past two days and he has no plans to leave. </p>
              <p class="article">He is now expected to commit himself to another four years in charge sooner rather than later. Mourinho was one of the leading candidates to replace Gerard Houllier five years ago, before Benitez got the job, and has revealed he would love to return to the Premier League at some stage.</p>

              <p>How can no money to spend? Rafa has been spending a lot of money mah... Jamie Reeves mentioned on Football focus that Rafa spent more money than United over the last 5 years since he took over... Only thing is he buy a lot of those under $10m players then when it doesn't work out, he get rid of them cheaply lah...</p>
              <p>I think Rafa himself want to stay... But George Gillett and Parry want to get rid of him... While Hicks want to keep "his man" Rafa on the job...</p>
              <p>I somehow belief there was something going on this week to get rid of him... But the win at Real Madrid may have saved him for the time being and made Gillett and Parry to hold back on their plans... Cos it seems strange that only Hicks camp instead of the 2 owners came out to deny Rafa was leaving the club on the recent rumour... Gillett and Parry didn't seem too bother by it just before an important match...</p>

              <h1>Former Chelsea boss Mourinho on the Anfield radar if Benitez leaves Liverpool<br></h1>

              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/02/26/article-0-00800998000004B0-211_468x441.jpg" alt="Jose Mourinho and Rafa Benitez" width="468" height="441"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Sounded out: Liverpool would consider an approach for Jose Mourinho should Rafa Benitez leave the club</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1156732" rel="1156732|3| nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1156732/Former-Chelsea-boss-Mourinho-Anfield-radar-Benitez-leaves-Liverpool.html"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Jose Mourinho has been sounded out about the </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong> manager’s post amid continuing doubts over Rafa Benitez’s Anfield future.</strong><br><br>Sportsmail understands that the former <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span></a> manager is growing increasingly disenchanted at Inter Milan and has been made aware by intermediaries — albeit unofficial — of potential interest from Liverpool, should Benitez leave. <br><br>Despite heading for the Serie A title in his first season at San Siro, Mourinho has indicated to advisers he would welcome a return to the Barclays Premier League. Taking charge of Manchester United is his main objective, and he is believed to have been earmarked as an eventual replacement for Sir Alex Ferguson, possibly at the end of next season.</p>
              <p>Liverpool maintain a compromise can be found with Benitez but are likely to consider an approach for Mourinho should they fail to resolve their contract impasse. <br><br>The Liverpool manager tried to play down concerns over his position in the wake of Wednesday’s Champions League win at Real Madrid, and is still exploring ways of reaching an agreement.<br><br>Spanish sources have increased the uncertainty, though, by claiming he feels increasingly isolated and is beginning to question whether he still has unequivocal backing from the dressing room.</p>
              <p>Mourinho, who figured prominently on Liverpool’s wanted list when Gerard Houllier was sacked, is clearly in the thoughts of co-owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett as they bid to find common ground with Benitez.</p>
              <p>Talks between lawyers and advisers over contentious clauses in a proposed four-and-a-half-year deal resumed on Wednesday but again failed to satisfy all parties.</p>
