              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr>'s title hopes took a dive as they crashed 3-1 to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Everton</span></abbr> at Goodison Park.</p>
              <p>United took an early lead through Dimitar Berbatov, but the Toffees
              quickly levelled through a superb Diniyar Bilyaletdinov effort.</p>
              <p>Then, with the game seemingly heading for a draw two <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Everton</span></abbr> youngsters took centre stage.</p>
              <p>Both 20-year-old Dan Gosling and 18-year-old Rodwell came off
              the bench in the second half to hand United their sixth league loss of
              the season with goals in the 76th and 90th minutes respectively.</p>
              <p>United boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> conceded his side were second best, particualrly in the second half.</p>
              <p>"We were well beaten, simple as that," assessed Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"We started the game well enough, but their goal galvanised them and gave them the incentive.</p>
              <p>"You don't want to lose a goal so quickly after going in front,
              but the real effect showed in the second half when we were second best.</p>
              <p>"I'm disappointed and the players are disappointed. They're human beings, they play for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr>, and they don't like losing, but they've lost today.</p>
              <p>"This is a bad result, and at this time of the year we can't afford results like that.</p>
              <p>"We hope others drop points, and that's the way it's been going this season. Hopefully it turns out right again."</p>

              <h1>Everton 3 Manchester United 1: Dan Gosling and Jack Rodwell come off the bench to halt Reds' title charge<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>After flattening Chelsea with a sucker punch on their last league outing, Everton completed a spectacular one-two to leave Manchester United's title challenge on the ropes.</p>
              <p>Just
              as they did against Carlo Ancelotti's men 10 days ago, David Moyes'
              team roared back from a goal down to register another famous win, which
              could have even greater consequences at the top given United are the
              ones playing catch-up.</p>
              <p>This time, young substitutes Dan
              Gosling and Jack Rodwell did the damage, Gosling bundling home Steven
              Pienaar's cross 15 minutes from time before Rodwell sent the home fans
              into ecstasy at the end.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/20/article-1252436-08629E3A000005DC-740_468x286.jpg" alt="Everton's Jack Rodwell (second left) celebrates with his team mates" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Applying the gloss: Jack Rodwell (second left) is jubilant after notching Everton's third</em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For Wayne Rooney, Everton's first victory over United - excluding
              penalty shoot-outs - for five years, and only their second in 32 games,
              would have been particularly galling given his history, although for
              once, England's talisman failed to make much of an impact.</p>
              <p>Unlike Rooney, the debate over Dimitar Berbatov's value to United continues to rage.</p>
              <p>At £30.75million, the Bulgarian cost them more than any other player.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/20/article-1252436-08628D49000005DC-143_468x306.jpg" alt="Everton's Dan Gosling" width="468" height="306">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Blue heaven: Dan Gosling fired in from close range</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Yet
              he has largely become a peripheral figure, to the extent that he was
              making his first away start since December when he strutted into
              proceedings.</p>
              <p>The argument goes that Berbatov's languid style is
              not suited to United's all-action approach and with Ferguson preferring
              to use Wayne Rooney as a lone front-man, flanked by a couple of
              industrious wingers, the former Tottenham star frequently finds himself surplus to requirements, as he was in Milan this week.</p>
              <p>Yet there is little doubt either that Berbatov is blessed with sublime skill.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/20/article-1252436-08626D95000005DC-730_468x348.jpg" alt="Everton's Russian midfielder Diniyar Bilyaletdinov " width="468" height="348">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Letting fly: Everton's Diniyar Bilyaletdinov levels for the hosts</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>And when Sylvain Distin failed to cut out Antonio Valencia's low
              cross, he killed the ball with one touch before smashing it into the
              roof of Tim Howard's net.</p>
              <p>Given the dominance United had enjoyed until that point, Everton desperately needed to score next.</p>
              <p>That they did so inside two minutes was probably beyond David Moyes' wildest dreams.</p>
              <p>The goal had route one stamped all over it as Phil Neville launched the ball out of his own half.</p>
              <p>Jonny Evans jumped with Louis Saha but, off balance, could only head the ball straight to Diniyar Bilyaletdinov.</p>
              <p>There
              appeared to be no imminent danger to Edwin van der Sar's goal, but,
              spotting a gap low to the Dutchman's left, Bilyaletdinov let fly with
              such power, there was no chance to move before it flashed into the net.</p>
              <p>The atmosphere instantly lurched from apprehensive to expectant.</p>
              <p>As
              Rooney, possibly guilty of trying too hard against his old club, was
              having a rare off-day, the visitors' dominance of possession failed to
              translate into threats on the Everton goal.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/20/article-1252436-086243EA000005DC-877_468x319.jpg" alt="Everton's Leon Osman (left) and Phil Neville (right) stand dejected as Manchester United celebrate Dimitar Berbatov's (centre) goal " width="468" height="319">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Flying start: Manchester United hail Dimitar Berbatov's opener</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Instead, United were the ones who found themselves rocking, just as Chelsea had<br>done once their lead disappeared.</p>
              <p>Bilyaletdinov
              drove over following an excellent piece of skill from Saha, then Landon
              Donovan wasted an even better chance after Wes Brown had prodded
              Leighton<br>Baines' cross into his path.</p>
              <p>The interval was not
              kind to Everton in the sense that it allowed their visitors time to
              regroup and rediscover the poise and authority they had enjoyed before
              Bilyaletdinov's leveller.</p>
              <p>Darren Fletcher exchanged passes with Rooney before drilling a shot wide.</p>
              <p>Berbatov
              then showed his frustrating side when he glanced a header wide from
              Rooney's cross when he should have at least kept his effort on target.</p>
              <p>It
              proved to be the Bulgarian's last meaningful contribution before
              Ferguson reverted to the two winger approach and introduced Gabriel
              Obertan with a quarter of the contest still remaining.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/20/article-1252436-0862732D000005DC-786_468x315.jpg" alt="Landon Donovan (R) of Everton is challenged by Darren Fletcher and Gary Neville of Manchester United " width="468" height="315">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Hard fought: Everton's Landon Donovan is tackled by Duncan Fletcher and Gary Neville</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Moyes made the most telling substitution shortly afterwards, when he replaced<br>Bilyaletdinov with Gosling.</p>
              <p>Ferguson will be demanding to know why Valencia let Steven Pienaar run unchecked onto Donovan's short pass towards the byline.</p>
              <p>It
              provided the South African with time to pick out Gosling's run and,
              getting in front of Patrice Evra, the youngster duly bundled home from
              six yards.</p>
              <p>Hearts continued to be in mouths and fingernails shorn as Rooney's free-kick shaved the post.</p>
              <p>But this was to be Everton's day.</p>
              <p>It has been claimed Rodwell will one day follow Rooney out of the blue half of Merseyside to Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Once
              Ferguson has spat out the bitter taste of his side's sixth defeat of
              the season, even he will probably admire the clinical way he finished
              off Mikel Arteta's through-ball at the death.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think fergie substitutions were the killer. Berbatov was playing well and he was hauled off, he may be injured, ok thats fair enought but park was working off his socks and he was replaced by the pacy but ineffective obertan, whose crosses likened to Nani cross from the left lol. then fergie also hauled off Valencia, and in came owen, who did almost nothing on the pitch at all.  then fletcher had to play at right side instead in the centre, where he can run tirelessly and harry and tackle in the middle of the pitch.</p></div>
