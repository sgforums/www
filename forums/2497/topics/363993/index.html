              *Chelsea Offer Andriy Shevchenko To Lyon, Marseille &amp; Monaco - Report*
              .
              
              â€˜Shevaâ€™ appears unlikely to start the season at Stamford Bridge, with the Blues offering him to the French giantsâ€¦
              .
              .
              
              *Olympique de Marseille have reportedly rejected the chance to take Chelsea forward Andriy Shevchenko to the south of France next season and the Blues are now ready to offer the Ukrainian veteran to Olympique Lyonnais and Monaco, according to a report in Aujourdâ€™hui Sport.*
              
              The 32-year-old goal-getter spent last season on loan at Milan after enduring a difficult two-years at Stamford Bridge, where he is still contracted. The Rossoneri arenâ€™t expected to gamble on signing â€˜Shevaâ€™ on a permanent basis as he made very little impression at all last season.
              
              Two mediocre campaigns in the Premier League mean that Chelsea are trying to find a new home for the former Dynamo Kyiv man as a matter of urgency. OM have already turned down the chance to take the 2004 Ballon dâ€™Or winner to the Stade Velodrome and the report from France suggests Chelsea will now offer the ageing forward to Lyon and Monaco.
              
              OL, though, have their eyes on different targets. As well as Portoâ€™s Lisandro Lopez, general manager Claude Puel is reputedly interested in a move for Valenciaâ€™s Nikola Zigic, a giant of a centre forward, who netted 13 times on loan at Racing Santander last term. It is believed that the Spanish outfit, who are in well publicised financial difficulties, are seeking â‚¬10 million for the 6ft 8in striker.
              
              Lyon, it seems, will not gamble on Shevchenko, however, Monaco could be tempted into a move. Lacking a world-renowned forward for several years, les Monegasques are attempting to rebuild a formidable squad, the like of which carried them to the Champions League final of 2004. 
              
              Shevchenkoâ€™s wage demands may simply prove too much for the Mediterranean coast club, who have boasted forwards the calibre of Juergen Klinsmann, Christian Vieri, Javier Saviola, Thierry Henry, David Trezeguet and Fernando Morientes in the past.
