              <p><strong>Angry Liverpool boss Roy Hodgson last night accused Barcelona of 'turning the head' of Javier Mascherano as the Merseyside club found themselves embroiled in a bitter and desperate battle to keep hold of the Argentine midfielder.</strong></p>
              <p>Mascherano was left out - declaring himself unavailable after Liverpool turned down a £16m offer from the Catalan giants. In his absence, Hodgson's team were swept aside by City who wrapped up their first win of the League season. </p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Afterwards, Hodgson warned Mascherano that he may not get his move to the Nou Camp but did not contradict suggestions that negotiations with Barcelona were being conducted without his consent by the Anfield board.</p>
              </div>
              <p>The Liverpool manager said: 'Mascherano was not in the right frame of mind to play. His head has been turned. But he should know that the fee we would want and the fee we have been offered by Barcelona are some distance apart.</p>
              <p>'That being the case, it could be that he is unhappy for a long time yet.'</p>

              <p><strong>Barcelona's bid is understood to have included the former Arsenal midfielder Alexander Hleb as a makeweight. Liverpool would prefer a straight cash deal.</strong></p>
              <p>Having missed out on a move to Inter Milan, Mascherano has now got his heart set on a move to Spain and decided to make a stand yesterday in a bid to force Liverpool's hand.</p>
              <p>Hodgson added: 'The discussions are being held at a high level and I don't want to say things that will create headlines.</p>
              <p>'It's not the first time these things have happened and there are a lot of clubs at the moment suffering from their players being courted and players therefore being unhappy and fulfilled to require their contracts.'</p>
              <p>Liverpool are weighing up a free transfer move for Real Madrid midfielder Mahmadou Diarra should they sell Mascherano.</p>
              <p>The powerful 29-year-old is one of four players earmarked for sale by Jose Mourinho and Real had slapped a £6m price tag on him. However, it is understood they will now allow him to leave on a free transfer for the right club.</p>
              <p>Agent Frederic Guerra said: 'Mahmadou is still a top player and he can do a great job in the Premier League. There is a lot of interest.'</p>
              <p>Manchester United and Blackburn have also been credited with interest but Liverpool would be his preferred option.</p>

              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1305666" rel="1305666|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1305666/Liverpools-Javier-Mascherano-agrees-85-000-week-deal-Barcelona.html"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Javier Mascherano has already agreed terms on an £85,000 a week contract with Barcelona, it has been claimed.</strong></p>
              <p>The midfielder refused to play in <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool</span></a>’s 3-0 defeat by Manchester City on Monday night, with boss Roy Hodgson admitting that the 26-year-old’s head had been turned.</p>
              <p>The Reds have rejected a £16million offer that included a £4m-rated Alexander Hleb as part of the deal, but reports in Catalonia believe the clubs will soon find some common ground.</p>
              <p>Barca coach Pep Guardiola refused to speak specifically about Mascherano, but admitted that signing a replacement for Yaya Toure was his only aim before the transfer window closes next week.</p>
              <p>'I will speak about him when he's here - if he comes,' said Guardiola. 'If a defensive midfielder arrives the needs of the team will be resolved.</p>
              <p>'If one arrives I will be satisfied. I understand that the club is doing everything possible to sign this kind of player.'</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>However, Hodgson insisted that Liverpool would not bow to pressure and accept a bargain basement fee, despite Mascherano’s determination to leave.</strong></p>
              <p>‘Mascherano was not in the right frame of mind to play,’ he said at Eastlands. ‘His head has been turned.</p>
              <p>‘But he should know that the fee we would want and the fee we have been offered by Barcelona are some distance apart. That being the case, it could be that he is unhappy for a long time yet.’</p>
              <p>Liverpool have offered the Argentina captain a new contract that would see his earnings jump dramatically from £30,000 to £100,000 a week.</p>
              <p>Mascherano, who reported in at Liverpool's Melwood training ground on Tuesday,  indicated last season he was happy to stay and eager to sign a new deal.</p>
              <p>However, he performed a U-turn earlier this month by insisting he wanted to quit the country. Hodgson revealed that the former West Ham midfielder’s wife had not settled on Merseyside.</p>
              <p>Barca’s four-year offer may be lower than that on the table from Liverpool, but Mascherano expects he would fit in well at the Nou Camp and has a huge dressing room ally in Lionel Messi.</p>
              <p>Guardiola confirmed he was trying to off-load Hleb and the Belarus international is understood to be keen to join Liverpool, but Hodgson may seek a straight cash deal.</p>
              <p>Real Madrid’s Mahamadou Diarra could be signed from Real Madrid as a direct replacement for Mascherano.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">INTER MILAN confirmed last night they have made an official £20million bid for Javier Mascherano.</h2>
              <p>Inter sporting director Marco Branca moved for the unhappy Liverpool player, also wanted by Barcelona.</p>
              <p>Branca said: "I sent an offer to Liverpool by fax on Tuesday and am waiting for a reply from them. "We're not speaking to the player at the moment because we want to do this in the right way and make sure that Liverpool are happy.</p>
              <p>"Everybody knows that Mascherano would like to change team and to change country. He also has a good relationship with our manager Rafa Benitez.</p>
              <p>"We've made a very good offer, around the amount they are asking for. We have a strong team here, the best in Europe, but we would like to add one or two players to make us even stronger."</p>
              <p>Barcelona have also tabled a £12m offer for him, £8m short of Liverpool's valuation. Mascherano was left out of the side beaten 3-0 at Manchester City on Monday, and had to train by himself the following day.</p>
              <p>He did not travel for the Europa League game away to Trabzonspor tonight. Kop boss Roy Hodgson admitted: "If he played against Trabzonspor it might prejudice the transfer and I don't wish to do anything like that to the player.</p>
              <p>"I'm hoping in the next couple of days things will be sorted one way or another but I have no idea which way that will be."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">JAVIER MASCHERANO will join Barcelona with a parting blast from Roy Hodgson ringing in his ears.</h2>
              <p>The unhappy Argentine finally got his way yesterday when Liverpool agreed an £18million deal, which could rise to £22m with add-ons.</p>
              <p>It brings to an end the 13-month saga surrounding the midfielder's bid to quit Anfield, after his wife had failed to settle in England.</p>
              <p>Yet while boss Hodgson granted his wish, it came with a sting in the tail - after Mascherano's amazing refusal to play against Manchester City on Monday.</p>
              <p>The fallen Kop idol's decision sparked fury among team-mates and fans alike - and now Hodgson has slammed his lack of professionalism.</p>
              <p>Hodgson blasted: "Players don't mean it as a challenge to your authority or the club's.</p>
              <p>"But it's a selfish situation when they want something and then expect the club and me to bow down and accept they're going to get their way.</p>
              <p>"Unfortunately, when that happens, there will be periods of time when there is a bit of unpleasantness.</p>
              <p>"Players must also understand when they sign contracts, they do so to play.</p>
              <p>"If the club decides it's going to accept an offer and let you go, that's one thing.</p>
              <p>"If the club say 'you have a contract, we're not selling', then they are staying."</p>

              <p><strong>Javier Mascherano has described his impending move to Barcelona as a dream come true.</strong></p>
              <p>Mascherano arrived in the Catalan city on Saturday as he looks to put the finishing touches on his switch from Liverpool.</p>
              <p>The Argentina midfielder, whose transfer will reportedly cost Barca 22million euros (£18million), will undergo a medical on Monday before, if all goes well, putting pen to paper on a four-year contract with the Spanish champions.</p>
              <p>The 26-year-old told Barca TV: "The truth is it's a dream, it's a great joy and a reason to be proud for me and my family because of what it all means, for everything they've achieved in the last few years.</p>
              <p>"As well as being a great team they are also a great group of people. Hopefully things will go well from the start."</p>
              <p>He added: "I'll give the same as I always have for all the teams I've played for; sacrifice, desire and I will try to do things as well as possible and help all the time.</p>
              <p>"It's a great club with great players and I will try to adapt as quickly as possible."</p>

              <p>Hope Ah Roy recruit more reliable players to form his team.</p>
              <p>If he cannot prove himself, he would have let go of more players next season.</p>
              <p>That is the reality of Liverpool.</p>
              <p>If the money dun come in, no players would want to play for Liverpool in a lower salary.</p>
              <p>It will be a difficult season for Liverpool, its players and his fan.</p>
              <p>But, it is also difficult for the last few seasons.</p>

              tired of this sort 'family not settling in' excuses. Who wouldn't want to move with 55K pounds per week salary adjustment and play for barca?
              I used to rate barca highly..but their players act like a bunch of gangsters who put no respect towards other clubs..anyway, although masch is the best holding mid imo, he can easily bee replaceed, unlike alonso!!!t
