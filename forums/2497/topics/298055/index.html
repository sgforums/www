            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Police are investigating claims a woman was raped during the Manchester United Christmas party. The 26-year old woman called 999 claiming she had been sexually assaulted at a luxury hotel where the squad were entertaining 100 "gorgeous girls."</strong><br><br>The alleged 4am incident was said to have occurred after the players visted a lap dancing club in Manchester only to leave within a minute when they released they had been spotted. The team had invited the women - including models - as guests to their private party at the Great St John Street Hotel in Manchester after WAGS were ordered to stay away.<br><br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/12_03/MANUdm1812_468x285.jpg"><br><span class="small">Manchester United players celebrate earlier in the evening during their Christmas party. There is no suggestion any of the players was involved in the rape claim</span><br><br><strong>The Â£395 a night hotel had been closed off to the public whilst the players partied until dawn. Boss Sir Alex Ferguson is believed to have given a reluctant blessing to the party but had warned the players to be on their best behaviour. Greater Manchester Police today confirmed a woman had made a complaint of rape at the five star boutique star hotel just a stones throw from the Granada studios in Manchester.</strong><br><br>The woman will be fully interviewed and invited to give a statement after she is examined at a rape crisis centre at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester. She was believed to have made a complaint to officers before being allowed home to sleep. Officers were searching the building for evidence and the hotel remained closed to the public.<br><br>One guest said: "A lot of the players were really letting their hair down and really enjoying themselves in a big way. "Lots of drink was flowing and there were a lot of the girls there simply trying to bag a footballer for the night. It was all very very sleazy. I'm just glad none of the WAGS were there. They would have been horrified."<br><br>A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: "Police are currently investigating a report of rape at a hotel in Manchester city centre. "At about 4.15am on Tuesday 18 December 2007, police were called to the hotel on Great John Street to a report that a 26-year-old woman had been raped. "Inquiries are continuing." The dramatic news came after the players went on a marathon 13 hour drinking session to mark their annual knees up.<br><br>The team had decided against fancy dress favorured by rivals and stuck with straight shirt and trousers. But they put on their gimmest expressions as their arrived at their anual players only party - a day after the squad beat Liverpool 1-0 in a vital Premiership clash. Footballers Rio Ferdinand, Wayne Rooney and Ryan Giggs barely raised a smile as they arrived in a team coach for Christmas lunch at the Linen restaurant at the exclusive Manchester 235 casino.<br><br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/12_03/girlE&amp;J_468x611.jpg"><br><span class="small">Girls gather outside the hotel and mingle with Manchester United players at their Christmas party last night</span><br><br><strong>Goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak raised a V for victory sign but still looked down in the dumps as he walked into the venue. The expressions of other team-mates including Michael Carrick, Gary Neville and Wes Brown got on-lookers dubbing them "Grumpchester United." One fan said: "You would have thought the guys would have been all sweetness and light given that it is Christmas - yet most of the players looked as miserable as sin.</strong><br><br>"Anyone with their fame and fortune would have plenty to smile about - but appears not these guys. "Half of them looked decidedly down in the dumps. Perhaps Fergie had just given them the hairdryer treatment for an old times sake." Most of the players tucked into a Â£19,50 set meal of "home cured" salmon followed by roast turkey with apricot and pistachio stuffing and completed with a dessert of baked white cheesecake.<br><br>It was not known which wines or beers the players chose. The party later met at the Grapes pub owned by Coronation Street actress Liz Dawn where they were overheard chanting football songs before leaving at 9.30pm.<br><br>Players Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand, Wes Brown, Anderson, John O'Shea and Danny Simpson left togther in a black people carrier which arived at Manchester's Long legs club. But they departed within a minute when a driver said a photographer was in the area. One on-looker said: "John O'Shea and another player went into the club but left shortly afterwards.<br><br>"The other players remained in the car the whole time. It seems they didn't want to be spotted at the club." The hotel has 30 individually designed duplex suites and features a chic lounge, cocktail bar, restaurant and rooftop garden, plus 3 function rooms. Formerly a school building it opened two years ago.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>British police said on Tuesday they had arrested a 19-year-old man in connection with an allegation that a woman was raped at a hotel where Manchester United players and staff were holding a Christmas party.</strong><br><br>Police said detectives began an investigation after a report that the 26-year-old woman had been attacked at the Great John Street Hotel in the northwest English city of Manchester in the early hours of Tuesday.<br><br>"A 19-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of rape this evening after presenting himself to police. He remains in custody for questioning," said a spokeswoman for the Greater Manchester Police force.<br><br>Reports on the BBC and Sky News said some players and their guests had gone to the hotel as part of the premier league club's annual Christmas party. No one at Manchester United could be reached immediately for comment. A hotel spokeswoman said the hotel was closed to the public but was likely to reopen on Wednesday. "We have had an allegation at the hotel and we are helping police with their investigation, she said.<br><br>In a statement, police said: "Police are currently investigating a report of rape at a hotel in Manchester city centre.

The 26-year-old dialled 999 from a hotel where players including Wayne Rooney and Rio Ferdinand took part in a late-night drinking session.</strong><br><br>The accused player, a young squad member who plays at international level, was arrested on suspicion of rape after presenting himself for questioning. He remains in custody and is said to strongly deny any wrongdoing. Today the full horror of the party was revealed as players were said to be out of control after a 13-hour drinking session. Women at the party complained of being treated like "pieces of meat in a cattle market atmosphere".<br><br>The rape allegation, which came hours after Fabio Capello was unveiled as the new England manager, is another blow to the tarnished reputation of football. Manchester United stars are said to be "stunned" by the teenage player's arrest. The players had reportedly paid Â£100,000 for Monday's party and invited around 100 girls back to the Â£395-a-night Manchester hotel.<br><br>The event is said to have been organised by Ferdinand who is reported to have held a whip round to which 25 players gave Â£4,000 each. Wives and girlfriends were not invited. The alleged victim was there with her boyfriend. The venue, Great St John Street Hotel, which overlooks the Coronation Street set, was closed yesterday as police removed potential evidence.<br><br>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who was not present, is said to have reluctantly approved the day-long celebrations but ordered his team to be on their best behaviour. A total of 35 players, including many multi-million pound stars, began the day with lunch at the Manchester235 casino complex where they were entertained by drag queens and dancers.<br><br>They arrived by team coach and were photographed walking to the venue, dressed in smart shirts, jeans and jackets. They ate a Â£19.50 Christmas menu of home-cured salmon, roast turkey with apricot and pistachio stuffing and baked white cheesecake. After three hours, stars such as Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Gary Neville and Owen Hargreaves, accompanied by junior squad members, headed to Coronation Street star Liz Dawn's pub The Old Grapes for more drinking.<br><br>Later a group including Rooney and Ferdinand drove to a lapdancing club but left without going inside after seeing photographers outside. For the night they had booked out the 30-suite Great St John Street Hotel - a converted Victorian school featured in top hotel guides - where they continued partying into the early hours.<br><br>One female guest described the party as "a horrendous cattle market" She said: "I like the United players but they were out of control. They were treating girls like pieces of meat. "We got special invites but if we ever get asked again there's no way we would go again." Another said: "A lot of the players were really letting their hair down. Waitresses were handing out pink champagne to whoever wanted it. "The players seemed to be drinking beer, vodka and whisky. Lots of drink was flowing and there were a lot of the girls there simply trying to bag a footballer for the night. It was all very sleazy. "Rooney and Rio spent most of the night on the dance floor - but Giggs stole the show when he did an Elvis Presley impersonation."<br><br>The accused player was last night facing the prospect of a police investigation as detectives prepared to take a statement from the alleged victim. Following the phone call to police she was taken to a specialist sexual assault referral centre at St Mary's Hospital, where staff trained in counselling examined her and preserved any evidence that could be used in a future prosecution.<br><br>A  police insider said: "She was at the party with her boyfriend but got really drunk and at some point disappeared off with [the player]. When she came back he asked where she'd been, and she claimed she'd been raped."<br>Manchester United refused to comment yesterday, and the hotel management would only say they were helping police with their inquiries.<br><br>Police said later that a 19-year-old man had been arrested in connection with the case. It is the latest in a series of sex assault claims against Premiership footballers. Most of the cases have ended without a prosecution.<br><br>Two years ago Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo was arrested over claims that he raped a woman at a London hotel. The Portuguese star, who was not at Monday's party, was not charged. Arsenal's Dutch striker Robin van Persie was held for two days accused of raping a beauty queen in Rotterdam in 2005, although the case was later thrown out. The year before that, Leicester City's Paul Dickov, Keith Gillespie and Frank Sinclair were accused of assaulting three women during a training trip to the La Manga complex in Spain.<br><br>All charges were dropped. And in 2003, Titus Bramble, then of Newcastle United, and Chelsea's Carlton Cole were arrested over an alleged gang rape on a 17-year-old former convent schoolgirl at a London hotel, but no charges were brought.<br></div>
