              <div style="margin: 0px 0px 15px;">
              <p class="introcopy"><strong>FRANK LAMPARD will move to Inter Milan for £7million after tomorrow’s Champions League final.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="padding7north" style="font-size: 12px; margin: 4px 5px 4px 0px; line-height: 17px; text-align: justify;">
              <p class="storycopy"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Lampard has agreed a £28m four-year contract with the Italian side, after weeks of agonising following the death of his mother Pat. The news is a desperate blow to Chelsea manager Avram Grant on the eve of the most important game in the club’s history and is certain to damage dressing-room morale.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Lampard’s move to the San Siro could coincide with the arrival of his former mentor Jose Mourinho as coach. Current Inter boss Roberto Mancini is now favourite to succeed Grant as the new Chelsea manager, in what would be a sensational series of events over the next few weeks. The Lampard negotiations took place directly between Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and Inter president Massimo Moratti during the last seven days.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Abramovich has decided to cash in on Lampard, who has only one year of his contract to run and has been refusing to sign a new deal. Abramovich does have Mancini high on his list of targets as a new manager but the Italian, who won his third successive Serie A title on Sunday, still has three years remaining on his deal, at about £5m a year.</p>
              </div>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Grant is set to be offered the opportunity to switch back to the role of director of football he had when he first came to the club last year. Lampard, 29, has refused to sign the £125,000-a-week contract Chelsea have presented him with this season and it looked as though he was certain to quit the club this summer.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">After the death of his mother Pat last month, though, he had a change of heart and seemed set to stay.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">But during the last few weeks, while Lampard and his family have grieved, the player has once again come round to the idea that he has one last big move in his career at his age – and still wants to play abroad.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">A source close to Lampard told the Daily Express last night: “Before the death of his mum, Frank looked certain to go. But then things changed. He was thinking seriously of staying but it has never gone completely from his mind that he only has one big move left in his career – and he has always wanted to go abroad. “Also, he was not happy with the deal that Chelsea had offered him.”</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Lampard remains in contact with Mourinho, speaking to him every week. The Portuguese has been in extensive talks with Moratti in the last few weeks and an agreement between the two is now close to being reached. And one of Mourinho’s demands to any of the clubs which have been interested in him was that Lampard was one of the first players he would be able to buy.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Lampard has played 247 Premier League games for Chelsea since his £11m move from West Ham in June 2001, scoring 71 goals. He has been a linchpin for the club ever since and, under Mourinho, was a key part of the team who won back-to-back league titles.</p>

              international, 29, is ready to quit Stamford Bridge this summer rather
              than extend his contract, which expires in 2009.</p>
              <p>But agent Steve Kutner insisted there was "no truth" in the
              rumours, saying: "I don't know why Inter Milan would think this. Nobody
              has talked to me and I am good friends with the owner, Massimo Moratti.</p>

              <p>"The situation is that Frank has got a massive match on

              he has not had a real opportunity to do that since his mother died.</p>
              <p>"He needs to get away and sort out his personal life and when

              <p>blame it on that Belgian called Bosman.. he would be lucky to be worth 7million given that he is on the last year of his contract, probably arrived at that figure based on his salary or something along this line</p>

              <p><strong>blame it on that Belgian called Bosman.. </strong>he would be
              lucky to be worth 7million given that he is on the last year
              of his contract, probably arrived at that figure based on his
              salary or something along this line</p>

              <p>u should thank Bosman for giving ur team Michael Ballack, Tal Ben Haim, Steve Sidwell, Claudio Pizarro, etc..</p>

              <p>giving my team? you gotta be kidding, i'm no Roman so how would those players be mine? does it all matters that which nick support which club? do we have to  declare our support in here?<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/confused.png" alt="confused.png">   </p>
              <p>actually Bosman ruling doesn't just do the club who is buying the player good even the player themselves gets a bigger salary and bonus or a certain amount of sign on fee.. </p>

              <p><strong>Frank Lampard is to open fresh talks with Chelsea over a new contract at the club after England's friendly internationals. Fabio Capello's side take on USA at Wembley and then travel to play Trinidad<br>&amp; Tobago on June 1.</strong><br><br>England midfielder Lampard revealed he will discuss a new deal to keep him at<br>Stamford Bridge on his return. Lampard's current contract expires next summer and talks over a long-term extension were put on hold for the duration of last season.<br><br>But following Chelsea's dramatic penalty shoot-out heartbreak against Manchester United in the Champions League final on Wednesday night, Lampard is<br>confident a deal can be agreed. "I have got to talk to the club," said Lampard. "My contract has obviously been the last thing on my mind in the last six weeks, but I will sit down and talk with them after the England games.</p>
