            <div class='col-md body'><strong>I didn't come to Liverpool to win the Carling Cup, says BenÃ­tez</strong><br><br>Rafael BenÃ­tez has emerged from his most troubled week since assuming the reins at Liverpool to launch an impassioned defence of the club's progress under his stewardship, warning those who doubt his side's pedigree that they could yet overcome Barcelona and go on to emulate the Merseysiders' 2005 Champions League triumph.<br><br>Having witnessed Arsenal run riot at Anfield in the FA and Carling Cups in the space of a few days, BenÃ­tez was quick to stress that domestic knockout competitions were not his primary focus. Instead, he continues to crave success in the Premiership and European Cup and, having insisted he is at one with the club's board over their transfer policy, believes his side can recover their poise this season.<br><br>Article continues<br>"I did not come here to win the Carling Cup," insisted the Spaniard, whose team visit bottom-placed Watford in the league this afternoon. "I came here to win the Premiership and to win the Champions League. Of course, we would like to win every trophy if possible, but I wanted to ensure that the club progresses. Maybe, in one or two months, those people criticising us now will see us winning against Barcelona and will be wondering whether we are going to win the Champions League again. They must be careful.<br><br>"When we were 11th in the league, people were saying we were a club in crisis, but I always had confidence. I think we will end up closer to the top two. When I decided to come here, it was because I thought we could move forward. We've won four trophies in 2Â½ years, so we're moving in the right direction."<br><br>He was quick to reject criticisms of his team selection - key players were rested - against a second-string Arsenal side on Tuesday. "As manager, I have a responsibility. I pick the best team in my opinion to win a particular game, but I am also thinking about the future of the club, and the future of this club is not about progressing to the semi-finals of the Carling Cup. It's to win the Premiership or the Champions League.<br><br>"In the next month we'll play Chelsea and Manchester United, and Barcelona in Europe, so to risk some players in the hope that you progress in the Carling Cup rather than keep them for these bigger games makes no sense. You have already seen Mohamed Sissoko and now Luis GarcÃ­a injured in the Carling Cup this season.<br><br>"We were in the final of the Carling Cup two years ago but no one remembers that season for that. They remember that season because we won the Champions League. In the last few years, what we achieved in Europe was the reason we had enough money to buy Xabi Alonso, Sissoko, Peter Crouch or JosÃ© Reina."<br><br>BenÃ­tez's immediate reaction to the 6-3 defeat, the club's worst at home in 77 years, had been to express frustration at the length of time it took his board to complete signings. While there has been no progress in the pursuit of Blackburn's Lucas Neill or the West Ham midfielder Javier Mascherano, Liverpool completed three transfers this week with the long-term in mind. The Argentinian winger SebastiÃ¡n Leto will move from Lanus and will join Emiliano InsÃºa, from Boca Juniors, and Sampdoria's Italy under-21 goalkeeper Danielle Padelli at Anfield.<br><br>The manager was particularly pleased to secure Leto, who had been pursued by Real Betis, Sevilla, River Plate and Getafe, and counts the club's scouting department - emulating Arsenal's emphasis on signing youth - as his principal hope in hauling in the likes of Chelsea and Manchester United. "We spent Â€150,000 (Â£100,000) on the 18-month loan fee for Insua, so it's not big money but shows we're doing the right things quickly," he added. "Other clubs wanted those three players so the fact that we got them shows we are moving faster than our rivals.<br><br>"The spine of my team is done and the value of my squad has doubled or tripled since I came here. I am working really hard, with my staff, the board, the chairman and the chief executive, because we all want the best for this club."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One thing you must give it to him is, he is not like mourinho, have a big pot of gold to buy players as and when he likes and how many it doesn't matter until now... Or Wenger the time to build up the youth team... cos he has been at Pool not very long actually...<br><br>So I guess he tried to make do with what he had... by spreading his funds to buy a few players rather than 1 or 2 quality player. He has used the limited funds to buy quantities rather than quality... Therefore his team has a few good players but lack very good players. Only Gerrard can be consider a real quality player in the whole team.</div>

But let's give you credit for winning 2 La Liga titles with Valencia, fighting off the more illustrious challengers like Barcelona and Real Madrid.<br><br>Having tasted what was it like to win the league championship, you came into England hoping to do the same with Liverpool. But what you did not realize is that the English game is completely different from what you had experienced back in Spain. In your 2 1/2 years here in England, you have yet to come to terms with the physical style of the English game, as compared to the more technical and slower Spanish league.<br><br>Have you and Liverpool got what it takes to win the EPL?<br><br>The answer is a resounding NO. You are just not good enough. If you can win it this season, I will take off all my clothes and run round Singapore 10 times.<br><br>I have always maintained that Liverpool are the most over-rated team in the Premiership. What's so good about them anyway? We have all seen how they absolutely capitulated against Arsenal not once, but twice in the space of 3 days, and at the fortress they call Anfield.<br><br>The Gunners have shown us all how to not only beat Liverpool, but beat the daylights out of them: if you can pass the ball quickly, accurately like what Arsenal had done with those quick little one-two's, you can literally walk through the Red's defence.<br><br>Liverpool are only effective when they are playing against teams who are not technically sound. When they come up against technically superior outfits like Manchester United, Chelsea, and Arsenal, they never stood a chance. And that is why Rafa had such a poor record against these teams in the league.<br><br>So who is to blame? None other than yourself, Rafa.<br><br>I have been very impressed by your English when he first came to England, but some of the things you said really wana make me puke in your face. Yes, I know, you said you came here to win the EPL and the Champions League.<br><br>All credit to you for delivering the Champions League trophy in your first season, but I have always maintained that your victory 2 years ago was no more than a fluke. On another day, AC Milan would have beaten the daylights out of you like what Arsenal did to you a few days ago.<br><br>And to prove my point: last season, you were knocked out by an average Benfica team who were clearly a more technically superior outfit than Liverpool. So now you know why the Reds will never do well against technically superior opponents.<br><br>So are the Reds good enough to win the Champions League this season?<br><br>Again, the answer is a resounding NO. Sorry, Rafa, but your pathetic Liverpool outfit are just not good enough.<br><br>So you think you can beat Barcelona? Well, you clearly have no idea how good Barcelona are going to be in another month's time. Samuel Eto'o would be back by then, and with Ronaldinho hitting good form at just the right time, your sorry Reds have no chance. You would do well to just draw up a damage limitation plan, because the likes of Ronaldinho and Deco are going to run rings round your team, and will walk through your defense, and into the next round.<br><br>So stop dreaming, Rafa. Wake up your senses, because if your Liverpool can beat Barcelona, then it would be the joke of the century.<br><br>On to the progress in the EPL that Rafa had been raving about.<br><br>Progress? What progress? For my money, they have not improved a single bit. The league table never lies. There are still some way to go before they can catch up with Man Utd and Chelsea.<br><br>For this, Rafa, you have got to shoulder much of the blame. Your signings for Liverpool have been largely questionable. Only the likes of Xabi Alonso can count as a truly successful signing. Players like Momo Sissoko, Dirk Kuyt, Dan Agger and Craig Bellamy are still trying to feel their way into the team.<br><br>Luis Garcia is too inconsistent; the Spanish trio of Josemi, Antonio Nunez and Morientes had all since left; Peter Crouch is just an average bean-pole, and no more than that; Pepe Reina is more of an entertainer who is more suited to the circus; the likes of Jermaine Pennant, Mark Gonzalez and Bolo Zenden are just not good enough to play for a big club like Liverpool.<br><br>And, oh, who is that chap, Fabio Aurelio? Nevermind, forget it.<br><br>Take a look at his other senior players: Sammi Hyypia is not getting any younger, and his lack of pace is now a liability to the Red's defense; Riise is not a leftback; Jamie Carragher is at best, competent, but not world class, and the same goes for Steve Finnan. And where the hell is Harry Kewell? He is spending far too much time on the treatment table.<br><br>Put them all together, and what do you get? An average team who will never be good enough to win the EPL.<br><br>Look at the other big 3. They all have one thing in common: world class players.  Man Utd have got Christiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand; Chelsea have got Didier Drogba, Michael Ballack, Arjen Robben; Arsenal have got Thierry Henry, Cesc Fabregas, Tomas Rosicky.<br><br>And what about Liverpool? Only Stevie Gerrard can count as one truly top-class player. Can you see the difference now?<br><br>So my dear Rafa, stop all your "I will beat Barcelona" nonsense, or your "I will win the EPL" rubbish. You will never live up to what you say with your current group of either rubbish, crap or pathetic players.<br><br>Please spare the Liverpool fans more anguish and agony. What they want most is not the Champions League, it is not the FA Cup, and definitely not the Carling Cup. It is the League title that the Kop faithful dearly wanted the most.<br><br>It is either you deliver the EPL title, or you go back to Spain. You will find more comfort and joy in the La Liga.  Leave, while you still have your dignity and pride (Minus that humiliating defeat inflicted on you by Arsenal reserves in midweek).<br><br>Yours Sincerely,<br><br>An expert EPL analyzer.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alex and Wenger have been in the EPL for more than 10 years.<br><br>They have struggled in their early years to build their squad into champion.<br><br>Only Jose is the only miracle that won the EPL during the 1st season as he have the best players in each position or he have bought all the best players.<br><br>As for Ah Ben, the liverpool fans have to be paitent as he always have his reason to deploy certain tactics.<br><br>As for the players he buoght, they also need time to blend into the EPL and each other to play well. Some of them that are flop have been eliminated after one season. Ah Ben is more ruthless than Houiller.<br><br>Just look at bean pole, he just need a few more game and he will be sharp enough to score.<br><br>Ah Ben have taken a gamble for the FA Cup and Carlings Cup and lost.<br><br>We have to respect his decision as the present squad and reserves is not good enough to challenge 4 honours at the same time.<br><br>Liverpool may not secured the 3rd spot as arsenal, bolton and portsmouth are breathing down their neck.<br><br>The last thing that Ah Ben need is another injury crisis.<br><br>At this present moment, Liverpool can still win the EPL title this season as Man utd, Chelsea and Arsenal are too involved in the rest of the cup competitions.<br><br>This could be the thinkings of Ah Ben.<br><br>Sacking Ah Ben would not solve the problem.<br><br>His only weakness is his stubbornness to stick to his wrong tactics (Stevie on the right) and still trying to reason it out despite defeat.<br><br>His undoing will be his spanish PRIDE.<br><br>Liverpool fans are already used to the UP and DOWN of the Liverpool team (One week king, one week flop)<br><br>The press love writing about Liverpool beside Chelsea, or else, they will have a hard time selling their paper.</div>
