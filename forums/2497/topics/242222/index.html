            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p143/zococl/jose2-1.jpg"><br><br><strong>JOSE: I WANT TO BE REAL BOSS<br><br>JOSE MOURINHO has placed himself on a massive collision course with the Chelsea hierarchy after openly touting himself to take over at Real Madrid. Mourinho said: "I would like to coach Madrid, and I do not discard doing that in the future. It would be an honour for me." The Chelsea boss flew out to Spain on a private jet paid for by the club on Sunday to watch Champions League quarterfinal opponents Valencia in action against Osasuna.</strong><br><br>But Mourinho incredibly chose to give a television interview after the match in which he admitted his dream to one day take charge at the Bernabeu. And with current Real boss Fabio Capello serving an unofficial notice period to the end of the season, Mourinho's latest piece of effrontery has only widened the rift between the Portuguese and the Stamford Bridge board.<br><br>Despite Mourinho's protestations of his position - "I have a contract until 2010 with Chelsea, besides English football excites me and Madrid cannot have a better coach than Capello" - his decision to answer the question rather than dead-batting it by insisting he was in Pamplona on Chelsea business has further eroded the fragile bonds of trusts within the club.<br><br>Mourinho and owner Roman Abramovich are no longer on speaking terms. The Portuguese raised the stakes last week as he pointed out that he will walk away with millions in his pocket and go straight to another club.<br><br>That went down like a lead balloon with Abramovich and his advisors, who believed Mourinho was deliberately setting out to irritate and anger them.<br><br>And the feeling intensified with Mourinho's latest trick, which Real insiders have noted down as a blatant pitch for Capello's job. Mourinho's representative, Jorge Mendes, has hinted in Portugal and Spain that the Blues boss is on the Real wanted list, although he faces competition from Getafe's former Real and Germany midfielder Bernd Schuster and Sevilla's Juande Ramos.<br><br>These latest comments will do nothing to repair the relationship which appears to be permanently damaged. Mourinho got out of jail earlier on Sunday as Chelsea came back from 3-1 down to earn a 3-3 draw with Spurs in the FA Cup at Stamford Bridge. But then he put his foot in it when interviewed about managing Real on TV station Canal+.<br></div>

The Chelsea board who wants to be the Biggest club in the world may feel that he has made them look smaller than Real...<br><br>But Jose has his own agenda i guess... He probably feel that his days at the Bridge are numbered so he could be making a comment for Real to consider him... But i think Rafa Benitez is their No1 target cos apart from being good, more importantly he is also Spanish and have beaten Barce recently...<br><br></div>

But as Jose Mourinho went public on his Real Madrid job application on Sunday night, the Chelsea boss made the move that guaranteed he cannot win the final showdown with Roman Abramovich.<br><br>Flying to Pamplona on one of Abramovich's private jets to watch Champions League opponents Valencia was only to be expected from a man who believes he can pre-plan every minute of every game, second-guessing all his managerial rivals. Yet the instant Mourinho opened his mouth to place himself in the frame for consideration by the Real Madrid upper echelons, he frittered away the PR advantage he had spent weeks and months stitching together.<br><br>Too late yesterday Mourinho attempted to back-track, aware he had gone a step too far and speaking of his debt of gratitude to Chelsea and the English game. But Abramovich and his coterie of advisers have no further interest in entertaining the man with a Messiah complex beyond the end of the season. And no matter what extra silverware Mourinho delivers in the next two months, even if he brings Abramovich the Holy Grail of the Champions League, there can no longer be any hope of a lasting peace treaty being brokered.<br><br>For Abramovich, winning is not enough. It is about winning with style and elan, and watching the sort of ground-out wins that Mourinho has made his stock-in-trade throughout his spell at the club has lost its appeal for an owner who dreams of Barcelona in blue shirts.<br><br>Yet until last week, Mourinho appeared to be playing his hand brilliantly, making all the right calls as he manipulated the Stamford Bridge fans into his corner. By claiming that he would not voluntarily walk away from the club under any circumstances, adding: "I would never do this to my players, I would never do this to the Chelsea supporters", Mourinho knew exactly what strings he was pulling.<br><br>It was a strategy that was working too, and every chant of "Stand up for the Special One" was a verbal dagger thrust in the direction of Abramovich (above) hands folded across his arms as he sat perched high up in his West Stand eyrie. The more Abramovich kept his distance, boycotting the Chelsea dressing room - even in the aftermath of the dramatic Carling Cup triumph - the more he seemed to be falling into Mourinho's carefully-laid trap.<br><br>Mourinho was aware that Claudio Ranieri had played the same game, keeping the fans onside even when it was inevitable the Italian would be made to walk the plank. That could not save him from the gallows when Abramovich decided a change was necessary, and even the compensation package Ranieri expected was not so easily forthcoming.<br><br>The difference was that in contrast to the smiling, likeable Italian loser, Mourinho is the most successful manager in the cub's history. Resourceful and cunning, Mourinho knew that his status as an heroic, almost mythical figure among the vast majority of Chelsea supporters is set in stone for ever more, irrespective of what happens between now and the end of May. Yet in Pamplona, home of the famous bull run, Mourinho turned from skilful matador into plodding beast. One Chelsea source said: "It's a strange way to act towards your boss in any job.<br><br>"And going to Spain and speaking like that, when he could easily have said nothing or told the interviewer he was just there as Chelsea manager, seemed deliberately designed to cause more problems."<br><br>Judging by his reaction on Sunday, his behaviour hours afterwards suggested he has lost control of himself and certainly his destiny. The powers that be have made their decision. He has just made it easier for them.<br></div>
