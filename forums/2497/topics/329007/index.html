              <h2>Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan has blasted one-time transfer target
              Samir Nasri, insisting the Arsenal gun should have been dismissed for
              his reckless challenge on Joey Barton yesterday.</h2>
              <p>Barton received a hostile reception both on and off the pitch as he
              played his first game since being released from prison earlier in the
              summer.<br><br>While sections of the crowd jeered and taunted the
              former Manchester City midfielder, the treatment dealt out to him from
              his opposition was little better.<br><br>The 25-year-old was, somewhat
              ironically, on the receiving end of a cynical challenge after being
              brought on as a substitute, as an annoyed Nasri vented his frustration
              at loosing the ball shortly beforehand.<br><br>Keegan is livid that the
              French youngster was not sent off and is certain the referee would not
              have been so kind had Barton been the aggressor.<br><br>“I saw Nasri slice down Joey and that’s what I was so upset about,” he told <em>News of the World</em> following his side's 3-0 loss.<br><br>“If it had been the other way round I’m sure Joey would have been sent off.<br><br>“Joey came on and got a very good tackle in on Nasri. Then he tripped Joey when he was running back.”<br><br>Interestingly,
              Nasri was one of a crop of highly talented playmakers the Magpies
              attempted (and failed) to sign during the summer.<br><br>The
              21-year-old made his way to Ashburton Grove from Olympique Marseille in
              July and appears to have settled nicely into his role on the flank for
              Arsene Wenger's side.<br><br>Keegan admitted the French international's
              challenge on Barton was uncharacteristic, insisting he is "too good" to
              resort to such thuggery.<br><br>“I like Nasri and we talked about bringing him to Newcastle, but he can’t do that,” the Toon boss continued.<br><br>“The referee didn’t see it but the linesman did. Under the rules it’s a red card.<br><br>“I spoke to Nasri at the end and told him I thought it was wrong — he is too good a player to do that. <br><br>“He said something back to me but French is one of the many languages I don’t speak.”</p>
