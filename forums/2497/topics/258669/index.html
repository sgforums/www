            <div class='col-md body'>Mac mystified by Lamps abuse<br><br>Steve McClaren has admitted he was mystified by the hostile reception Frank Lampard received from England fans at Wembley on Friday night.<br><br>On what was supposed to be a celebration of England's return to their spiritual home in London, against five-time world champions Brazil, elements of the 89,000-strong crowd voiced their displeasure at the Chelsea man's inclusion.<br><br>Lampard's name was booed as the teams were announced prior to kick-off, and a chorus of jeers also rung out around the new stadium when the midfielder made way for Michael Carrick with two minutes to go.<br><br>The former West Ham midfielder was named as England Fans' Player of the Year for both 2004 and 2005, but his standing has plummeted after a disappointing World Cup - even if McClaren's faith has not wavered.<br><br>"Why he got that reception, I do not know," said McClaren in the Sunday Mirror. "But I thought he answered a lot with his performance.<br><br>"And that is typical Frank. It is what you do on the pitch that counts."<br><br>With Owen Hargreaves absent due to injury, Lampard is expected to retain his place alongside Steven Gerrard for Wednesday's Euro 2008 qualifier against Estonia.<br><br>Much has been made of whether the two stars can be accommodated together in central midfield, but McClaren was encouraged by what he saw in the 1-1 draw with Brazil.<br><br>"I said before the game that the key jobs were those of the two of them. I thought they were exceptional in doing that," McClaren added.<br><br>"Many people have questioned whether they can play together but they have only lost one game when they have been in the same side.<br><br>"They showed great discipline against Brazil. That for me was the platform.<br><br>"They protected the back four, they fed further forward and it was a good performance from both of them."<br><br>Story Tools:<br>Print Email this page Messageboards<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After all, Lampard is just one-trick pony.<br><br>His passes are mostly square passes, with the odd long ball intercepted by the other team's defence. He has no ounce of creativity to split up the opponent and create goal-scoring chances. All he knows is to run into the penalty box when the wingers have the ball and wait for the ball to land on his feet so he can shoot and score. Another note is that he's seldom injured because he rarely gets himself to put a crunching tackle on the other team's players, thus he is unsuitable for a defensive midfielder role.<br><br>The reason he's not scoring for England is because they do not have wingers that can cross the ball in for Lampard to shoot.
