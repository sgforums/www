            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Jose Mourinho refused to appear before the press in the aftermath of Chelsea's 4-1 victory over West Ham at Upton Park.</strong><br><br>An accomplished performance from the champions on their trip across the capital takes them to within three points of league leaders Manchester United, but at the final whistle, their manager was nowhere to be seen.<br><br>Mourinho's absence was explained as being a `club decision' which had `the backing of all his staff', but it will in all likelihood only fuel speculation further that there are problems behind the scenes at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>A Chelsea spokesman went on to confirm that the Chelsea players and their staff received a hostile reception upon arriving at the ground, with a missile having cracked a window on the team coach.<br><br>"It was a rock of some sort and it cracked a window of the coach. But none of the players were injured and none of them were sat by the window that was hit."<br><br>While Mourinho remained silent, one man more than ready to speak to the press was two-goal hero Shaun Wright-Phillips, who conceded it was a fantastic feeling to score a pair of stunning goals.<br><br>Wright-Phillips told the website: "The feeling is really indescribable but I have got to put it out to the lads, they have believed in me since the start and that makes it easier.<br><br>"It is only normal the more games you play the better you get and it is starting to come through as I wanted.<br><br>"We knew what we had to do. We are behind United and we have to win every game to put them under pressure.<br><br>"It was another bridge to cross and the determination is unbelievable."<br><br>While Wright-Phillips enjoyed a night to remember, team-mate Frank Lampard had to endure a torrent of abuse on his old stomping-ground, as the West Ham faithful greeted his every touch with a crescendo of boos.<br><br>The England man, though, came through the game unscathed and after, was gracious enough to accept the abuse that came his way.<br><br>"It inspires me. It doesn't bother me, I enjoy it. It was a bit of banter and there are no hard feelings." </span></div>
