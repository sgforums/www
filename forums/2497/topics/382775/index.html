              <p class="article">The Dutch winger, 22, insists his career has stalled at Anfield and he blames Kop boss Rafa Benitez.</p>
              <p class="article">Babel said: "I have tried to talk to the manager but it isn't of any use. I couldn't really do anything with the feedback Benitez gave me.</p>
              <p class="article">"We have agreed to look at my situation during the winter. If there's no improvement then, I have to be honest, I want to play somewhere else."</p>
              <p class="article">Babel's bombshell comes as the Reds prepare for tonight's must-win Champions League group game at Hungarian side Debrecen - a match that could decide Benitez's future on Merseyside.</p>
              <p class="article">The forward, who scored a long-range stunner in Liverpool's last Euro game in Lyon, added: "I don't play a lot so I can't be happy and I can't cheer out loud.</p>
              <p class="article">"Certain emotions are blocked, they are pushed back by all the worries I carry with me. "Sometimes I wonder how long I can sustain it but I will fight for my position - what else can I do?"</p>

              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Now he admitted he wants away in January if things do not change significantly.</p>
              <p class="article">Babel's rap could not have come at a worse moment for under-seige boss Rafa Benitez ahead of tonight's must-win Champions League clash at Debrecen. Benitez signed Babel in July 2007 for £11.5million and the following summer he was voted Liverpool's Young Player of the Year. But when Babel returned from representing Holland at the 2008 Olympics that same summer, he revealed things began to change. </p>
              <p class="article">He said: "Isn't it unbelievable that in my first year I got chosen as Talent of the Year? "And a season later I hardly play and without getting a proper chance. </p>
              <p class="article">"I don't know if it has anything to do with my little trip to the Olympics - I know the manager wanted me to stay. But I don't believe Benitez is trying to get back at me. "What I do know is our manager tests people on how they react to certain situations." And it is evident Babel struggles to cope with the ways of the Spaniard.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: "Bentitez is not a man who will give you his trust straightaway. "Benitez is a manager who in certain situations can do exactly the opposite of what you expect several times. "Every time me or my agent (Willie Haatrecht) have a chat with him he stresses I can't leave and he believes in me. </p>
              <p class="article">"We have to trust he is telling the truth. Saying it is different to showing it. We have agreed to look at my situation during the winter break. "If there's no improvement then, I have to be honest, I want to play somewhere else. "But until then I will fight for my position - what else can I do? </p>
              <p class="article">"I still want to stay at Liverpool. I just have the feeling, for many people, I still have to prove myself. "I think that is unjustified and a pity. I have shown I can do it plenty of times. I know I could be further in my career but if nobody helps you, if they don't make it easier for you then it is difficult. </p>
              <p class="article">"It is especially tough mentally. Yet curiously it is still expected that you break open a match. "If you look at the statistics I can do that - I have been more important to Liverpool as a substitute than a regular player. </p>
              <p class="article">"Most of the supporters are happy with me because something happens when I come on as a substitute. "However I want to show them more but I'm not given the chance. </p>
              <p class="article">"In 2½ years with Liverpool I have never started three matches in a row. "I don't play a lot so I can't be happy and I can't cheer out loud. "Certain emotions are blocked, they are pushed back by all the worries I carry with me. And I have my pride." </p>
              <p class="article">Babel has tried to express his hurt and frustration to Benitez but insisted he received little encouragement. The Dutchman said: "I have tried to talk to the manager but it isn't of any use. </p>
              <p class="article">"I couldn't really do anything with the feedback Benitez gave me. "His philosophy is simple - try your hardest in training and then your chance will come. But sometimes I wonder how long I can sustain it."</p>
              <p class="article">Babel's problems are not just with his manager. He has also struggled to hit it off with his fellow forwards and tried to adopt a "selfish" attitude to match his rivals for a starting place. </p>
              <p class="article">Babel, who is injured for tonight's tie, said: "All the forwards, they always live for their own success. It is hard for someone who isn't selfish by nature to act selfish.</p>
              </li>
              <p class="article">"I don't know if my team-mates were shocked by my new character but I do notice once in a while they get confused. "Normally I would pass the ball - now I take the shot myself more often. I see how they look at me with a face that says 'Hey I am free!'</p>
              <p class="article">"But I'm not going to explain it any further because they don't give me any explanation when I ask for the ball." Babel also hints at cliques off the pitch. He explained: "We have a lot of different cultures and on the pitch we are a tight group. But outside the pitch everyone goes their own way. </p>
              <p class="article">"The Spanish-speaking guys are very close. The youths hang out together. And I get along with Benayoun and Lucas. </p>
              <p class="article">"Dirk Kuyt? I don't really hang out with him. Dirk got accepted in the group of the Spanish-speaking players. "He is very friendly with them and it looks as if he understands their jokes." </p>
              <p class="article">The winger is clearly upset other players stay ahead of him in the pecking order - even when their performances do not merit it. Babel, who has come off the bench 58 times out of his 105 Kop appearances, said: "Many players can play lots of bad matches and still keep their credits - I can't. </p>
              <p class="article">"I believe when you get a chance you should take it and not let go. Hold on to it - my parents taught me that - and that's why I don't give up. "The traffic light will turn green some time." </p>
              <p class="article">Blue isn't the colour at Anfield - it is banned because of its association with city rivals Everton. And Babel finds the rule petty. He explained: "As a Liverpool player I can't play in my blue Nike boots. They strongly discourage me from doing that. </p>
              <p class="article">"Blue is Everton's colour and Liverpool and Everton are rivals in everything. "As a small boy you dream about a career as a football player. You're willing to give up everything for it. "Once you reach that goal, only then do you get to know the whole world around it."</p>
