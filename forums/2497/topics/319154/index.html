              <h1>Cardiff City reject £5m Liverpool and Arsenal bids for Aaron Ramsay</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/graphics/2008/05/29/ufnaaron.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool and Arsenal, planning to build on their recent summer transfers, have both seen offers for 17-year old midfielder Aaron Ramsey rejected by Cardiff City.</strong></p>
              <p class="story">Both offers, said to be close to £5m, were deemed unsuitable by the FA Cup finalists as a large part of the deals were based on provisions dependant on the teenager's development. Cardiff are looking for a more sizeable cash settlement up front before they release their prize asset.</p>
              <p class="story">It is expected that both Liverpool and Arsenal will respond with improved financial packages after hearing the Welsh club's demands, but their initial reluctance to stump up cash early on will invite other clubs into the bidding arena. Tottenham Hotspur have been monitoring Ramsay for some time, while Aston Villa and Everton are in the market for a promising midfielder.</p>
              <p class="story">Despite rejecting early offers for Ramsey, Cardiff are reconciled to losing the teenager, even though he has two years remaining on his contract. There is little chance that the club will attempt to extend his deal; instead, appropriate recompense is now their priority.</p>
              <p class="story">As for Ramsey, being offered such an array of destinations could have its problems. At this stage in his career he will be looking for first team opportunities, which could be limited should he sign for a Premier League club such as Arsenal.</p>
              <p class="story">Some reports suggest that one proposal being tabled is the option of Ramsey signing to a Premier League club, but then remaining on loan in Wales to gain valuable first team experience as he attempts to build on last season's progress.</p>
              <p class="story">He made 21 appearances for Cardiff last season, and has just featured at international level after Wales manager John Toshack brought him into the Wales squad for this week's friendlies in Iceland and Holland.</p>
              <p class="story">Ramsey's potential is in no doubt. He has already been linked to Manchester United and Harry Redknapp was understood to be impressed with the teenager's performances in the FA Cup. Ramsey featured as a substitute at Wembley, but it was his semi-final performance against Barnsley that won him wide recognition.</p>
