              <h1>Prem clubs 'agree' to overseas plan</h1>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">The 20 Premier League clubs have agreed in
              principle to a radical plan that would see each team playing an extra
              match a season abroad.</span></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Under the proposal, cities such as Hong Kong,
              New York, Los Angeles, Singapore, Sydney, Johannesburg, Dubai and
              Beijing would stage matches between two Premier League sides.</p>
              <p>The League have called a news conference for Thursday afternoon
              where it is expected they will confirm they are to explore the proposal
              of playing games in some of the world's largest cities.</p>
              <p>A meeting of the 20 clubs on Thursday morning has agreed in
              principle to the plan. It is understood that the proposed overseas
              matches would not be the final fixtures of the season.</p>
              <p>The idea would be to cash in on existing interest in the
              Premier League around the world, and the extra money generated from TV
              would be split equally among the 20 clubs.</p>
              <p>The details of how the system would work have yet to be
              finalised but it would mean each club playing 39 games, with a draw to
              pick out each side's overseas match.</p>
              <p>There would be a sporting criteria, such as league position, to decide which clubs play each other.</p>
              <p>And under the proposal, points earned in the overseas game would count towards the final league position.</p>
              <p>One club source said: "The Premier League is a global game now.
              Everyone knows how popular it is around the world and this proposal
              went down so well because every club would be involved, not just a few.</p>
              <p>"The Premier League has always worked as a co-operative of 20
              clubs and this would increase everyone's income, showcase the league to
              the rest of the world, and be exciting to those fans in this country
              who either want to travel to the game or watch it on TV.</p>
              <p>"We now need the League to look at the proposal and see how we can take it forward."</p>

              <h1 class="large">Premier plan down the Japan</h1>
              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7">THE Premier League’s bid for global domination is in tatters already after 
              football’s emerging nations rejected the idea of hosting English matches.</p>
              <p class="article">Japan and Australia became the first to hit out at plans to play a round of 
              matches overseas in 2011 as they would rather focus on developing their own 
              leagues.</p>
              <p class="article">The game’s rulers in America — where the MLS league is just starting to take 
              off — are likely to have the same opinion.</p>
              <p class="article">And UEFA president Michel Platini branded the scheme ‘a joke’. He said: “It’s 
              a strange and comical idea. I laughed because it will never be received by 
              FIFA, by the fans and by the national associations. It’s a nonsense idea.</p>
              <p class="article">“It’s ironic. You already have no English coach, you have no English players 
              and maybe now you will have no clubs playing in England. It’s a joke.”</p>
              <p class="article">World rulers FIFA yesterday complained they had not been consulted and vowed 
              to probe the plan to play matches in foreign cities like New York, Los 
              Angeles, Tokyo and Sydney.</p>
              <p class="article">Premier League chairmen, with pound signs flashing in their eyes, voted 
              unanimously to explore the idea.</p>
              <h4>Invest in the game</h4>
              <p class="article">But Japan FA vice-president Junji Ogura said: “It sounds problematic. We are, 
              in principle, opposed to having their games in Japan as we have to protect 
              our league and clubs.</p>
              <p class="article">“I don’t think we will change our minds. I also wonder if playing matches 
              abroad would really be good for the Premier League.”</p>
              <p class="article">Australian soccer chief Ben Buckley said: “Our overwhelming priority is to 
              promote the Hyundai A-League and to continue to invest in the game in 
              Australia.”</p>
              <p class="article">The idea has been condemned by fans here.</p>
              <p class="article">A Football Supporters’ Federation statement read: “The Premier League have 
              gone too far with their proposals. The time for football fans to stand up 
              and be counted has arrived.”</p>
