              <h1>Sparky's back: Premier League return for Mark Hughes as he agrees to take Fulham job<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Mark Hughes will be announced as Fulham’s new manager within the next
               24 hours after last night accepting club owner Mohamed Al Fayed’s offer
               to replace Roy Hodgson at Craven Cottage.</p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span> revealed on Saturday how, after initial contact, Hughes had re-emerged 
              as the leading contender following Fulham’s failure to lure Ajax manager
               Martin Jol to west London.</p>
              <p>Following further talks with Al 
              Fayed on Tuesday evening, Hughes spent yesterday mulling over Fulham’s 
              offer before delivering the answer they had been anxiously waiting for.</p>
              <p>The
               Welshman, who has been out of work since being sacked by Manchester 
              City in December, will be handed the same £2million-a-year salary that 
              was offered to Jol and can expect a transfer kitty in the region of 
              £20m.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/28/article-0-0611E387000005DC-274_468x421.jpg" alt="Back in business: Mark Hughes will be appointed Fulham manager in the next 24 hours" width="468" height="421">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Back in business: Mark Hughes will be appointed Fulham manager in the next 24 hours</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>His appointment represents a considerable coup for Fulham, especially
               after the  disappointment of failing to land Jol, given that just two 
              years ago he was entrusted with the task of turning City into a top-four
               outfit and was handed a multi-million pound budget to achieve that aim.</p>
              <p>And, although the funds on offer at Fulham are extremely modest by comparison,<br>Hughes
               still faces a tough task to improve on the achievements of Hodgson last
               season after he guided the club to a comfortable 12-placed finish in 
              the league and<br>the Europa League final.</p>
              <p>It had been 
              reported that the number of backroom staff that Hughes would want to 
              bring to Craven Cottage could prove to be a stumbling block. </p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/28/article-0-047D4B17000005DC-149_468x286.jpg" alt="Swift turnaround: After Martin Jol (right) opted to stay at jax, Fulham moved quickly to approach the out-of-work Mark Hughes" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Swift turnaround: After Martin Jol (right) opted to stay at jax, Fulham moved quickly to approach the out-of-work Hughes</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>But sources close to the 46-year-old insist that he is ready to make 
              concessions on that front even though he is highly likely to want to 
              bring in assistant Mark Bowen, who has been by his side during his time 
              with Wales, Blackburn and City.</p>
              <p>Fulham, however, are determined to retain the services of Ray Lewington, who has been acting as caretaker manager.</p>
              <p>Hughes
               is understood to have pondered long and hard whether Hodgson’s 
              spectacular achievements of last season had seen Fulham advance as far 
              as they could go. In addition, Hughes has given plenty of consideration 
              to the subject of disrupting his family’s settled life in Cheshire in 
              favour of a move to the capital.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/28/article-0-098CC6B8000005DC-653_468x259.jpg" alt="Spectacular season: Under the guidance of Hodgson (right), Fulham fell to Atletico Madrid in the Europa League final " width="468" height="259">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Spectacular season: Under the guidance of Hodgson (right), Fulham fell to Atletico Madrid in the Europa League final </em></p>
              </div>
              <p>However, the Welshman clearly feels that, with Al Fayed’s backing, he can build on the success of the previous campaign.</p>
              <p>Despite
               Sven Goran Eriksson being consistently linked with the post, the former
               England manager was never approached by Fulham, while other candidates 
              such as<br>Ottmar Hitzfeld and Alan Curbishley were also discounted.</p>
              <p>Hughes
               had been linked with the Aston Villa job as speculation grew over 
              Martin O’Neill’s future, a situation which prompted him to reject the 
              chance to replace Gianfranco Zola at West Ham.</p>
              <p>But with the start of the Premier League season less than three weeks away, the timing is perfect for both Hughes and Fulham.</p>
