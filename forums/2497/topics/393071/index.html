              <p><strong>Group A</strong> - France<br><br> Arguably the favourites in the group, although South Africa are the top
              seeds, Les Bleus boast some of the best goalkeeping talent at the 2010
              tournament. The first choice glovesman is Hugo Lloris, the Olympique
              Lyonnais player, and his performances for club and country over the
              past few months have been notable to say the least. His stand-out
              showings in the two legged play-off against Ireland in November went a
              long way towards ensuring the French passage to the final tournament.
              He is currently 54 in the Castrol Rankings, perhaps indicating that his
              club side's defensive form has not been all it could be this season.
              Among those clamouring to be his deputies are Cedric Carrasso (36) of
              Bordeaux and Steve Mandanda (599) of Marseille. The form of Monaco's
              Stephane Ruffier (50) also makes him an outside shot.<br><br><strong>Group B</strong> - Argentina<br><br> While AZ's Sergio Romero seems to have finally convinced Diego Maradona
              of his abilities, there is no second guessing what el Dieguito might do
              ahead of the FIFA showpiece. Therefore, Mariano Andujar, the Catania
              shot-stopper, may still usurp the long-haired keeper. Andujar is
              certain to be on the plane to South Africa but may not command a
              starting berth. Nonetheless, his five clean sheets for the Sicilians
              since the turn of the year have helped him catapult up the Castrol
              Rankings by more than 700 places. Andujar is currently at 448 in the
              list.<br><img src="http://l.yimg.com/a/p/sp/editorial_image/ee/eebc9574063c5ae3a799fc9a62fd74d3/.jpg" alt=""><br><strong>Current Argentine shot-stopper of choice, Sergio Romero</strong><br><br><strong>Group C</strong> - England<br><br> The Fabio Capello-coached side have selection conundrums all over the
              field but it is the dilemma over who keeps goal at South Africa 2010
              which is currently unsettling English observers most. Robert Green
              (197) of West Ham United and David James of FA Cup semi-finalists
              Portsmouth (287) seem to be battling for the number one shirt, while
              Capello remains dubious of the credentials of Birmingham's clean-sheet
              specialist, Joe Hart. The on-loan Manchester City keeper is England's
              top ranked player in his position at a lofty 42 in the Castrol
              Rankings. Wigan's Chris Kirkland (267) is another contender but an
              injury blighted season may ultimately count him out.<br><br><strong>Group D</strong> - Germany<br><br> Rene Adler was thought to be in command of the starting shirt in
              Joachim Loew's Germany team, but his far from convincing performance
              against Argentina last week may have planted seeds of doubt in the
              Bundestrainer's mind. Bayer Leverkusen, Adler's club side, have begun
              to stutter too, so the man who weighs in at 438 in the Castrol Rankings
              may yet be replaced. Dependable veteran Hans-Joerg Butt of Bayern
              Munich is a few places behind at 477 whilst Werder Bremen's Tim Wiese
              is further back at 485. The Nationalmannschaft's safest bet may be
              Manuel Neuer of Schalke, who, thanks to his club's gritty and
              workmanlike form, finds himself challenging for a Bundesliga title. His
              displays have earned him 166th place in the latest rankings. Roman
              Weidenfaller of Borussia Dortmund, ranked at 241, is unlikely to be
              considered.<br><img src="http://l.yimg.com/a/p/sp/editorial_image/05/05722f6370514df1d34fb16b511dff35/.jpg" alt=""><br><strong>German contender Manuel Neuer</strong><br><br><strong>Group E</strong> - Netherlands<br><br> Going forward, there are few teams who would have the measure of the
              Oranje. However, in the backline and in goal is where Bert van
              Marwijk's side struggle for dominace. The likes of Maarten
              Stekelenburg, Michel Worm and Piet Velthuizen lack the commanding
              presence of Edwin van der Sar, who insists he will not be tempted,
              again, out of international retirement. The Manchester United stopper
              is still ranked just outside the top 10 of the Castrol Rankings, at 13
              with 812 points.<br><br><strong>Group F</strong> - Italy<br><br> Curiously, Gianluigi Buffon is routinely quoted as the outstanding
              goalkeeper in the world, but on current form, the Juventus custodian is
              well down the Italian order of shot stoppers. Leading the way is Morgan
              De Sanctis of Napoli at 101, up 700 places from the last count, while
              Sampdoria's Luca Castellazzi is one behind at 102. Coming in ahead of
              Buffon, who, due to Juve's patchy Serie A form is down to 311, are
              Bologna's Emiliano Viviano (161), Genoa's Marco Amelia (170), Stefano
              Sorrentino of Chievo at 202, Cagliari's Federico Marchetti (229),
              Andrea Consigli of Atalanta at 267 and Parma's Antonio Mirante at 307.
              Palermo's Salvatore Sirigu is doing well at 401, a 600-place
              improvement on his last ranking.<br><br><strong>Group G</strong> - Brazil<br><br> Julio Cesar of Inter benefits from playing behind one of the tightest
              defences around at club level, and, thanks to Dunga's relatively
              cautious approach, at international level too. However, the former
              Flamengo player has proven time and again his point-saving and
              match-winning credentials. Currently 55th in the Castrol Rankings, the
              30-year-old does not face the stiffest of competition for the gloves in
              the Selecao set-up. Gaffe-prone Dida is 79th, though he has not played
              for Brazil in four years. Elsewhere, Tottenham's Huerelho Gomes, a
              squad member, is at 127.<br><br><strong>Group H</strong> - Spain<br><br> The Spanish have some of the world's foremost goalkeeping talent,
              including their captain and talisman, Iker Casillas. The Real Madrid
              stopper checks in at 89 in the rankings, perhaps surprisingly not
              heading the Iberian list of contenders. Diego Aranzubia of Deportivo
              heads the standings at 45 with the likes of Pepe Reina (103) and Sergio
              Asenjo (132) competing for squad berths. However, playing at Real
              Madrid means that clean sheets do not come easily every week; despite
              shipping goals, Casillas has reason to believe that he is one of the
              globe's best.<br><img src="http://l.yimg.com/a/p/sp/editorial_image/07/074dcb200d4643ef3220ab8b90d2349e/.jpg" alt=""></p>
