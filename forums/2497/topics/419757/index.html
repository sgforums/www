              <p><strong><span>Carlo Ancelotti</span> <span>has seen and heard far</span> <span>worse than the banners</span> <span>outside </span><span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span><span>'s training</span> <span>ground, one of</span> <span>which called for his sacking.</span> </strong></p>
              <p><span>It may have been the first evidence of</span> <span>dissatisfaction among fans but it is</span> <span>nothing compared to some of the abuse</span> <span>Ancelotti received from Juventus fans</span> <span>when he was in charge there.</span></p>
              <p><span>Driving to the club's training ground</span> <span>during his first week, he noticed someone</span> <span>had daubed 'A pig can't coach' on</span> <span>the obelisk in the middle of Turin's</span> <span>Piazza Crimea in disgust at his appointment.</span></p>
              <p><span>The Italian was able to shrug off yesterday's protest. 'If it is only one</span> <span>person then there's no problem,' said</span> <span>the Chelsea manager, smiling.</span></p>
              <p><span>It is important for a manager to have</span> <span>the support of the club, the players</span> <span>and the fans - all of them apart from</span> <span>one. It's the right way to move on</span> <span>quickly.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Two banners were placed opposite</span> <span>Chelsea's Surrey training complex.</span></p>
              <p><span>One read: 'None Of You Are Fit To</span> <span>Wear The Shirt', the other 'Ancelotti +</span> <span>Abramovich Out!!!' </span></p>
              <p><span>They were later</span> <span>removed.</span> <span><br></span></p>

              </div>
              <p><strong><span>Ancelotti said: 'Here it is one person but in Italy you can find</span> <span>a thousand people outside</span> <span>the training ground</span> <span>when they are not happy.</span> <span>It's difficult to fight with</span> <span>1,000 people. With one, we can</span> <span>manage.'</span></strong></p>
              <p><span>Ancelotti's customary humour</span> <span>has survived his team's awful run of two</span> <span>wins in 11 Barclays Premier League</span> <span>games. </span></p>
              <p><span>He retains the backing of owner</span> <span>Roman Abramovich but would welcome</span> <span>a turn of fortune in the FA Cup, against</span> <span>Ipswich, struggling in the Championship</span> <span>and fresh from sacking their manager,</span> <span>Roy Keane.</span></p>
              <p><span>Chelsea are attempting to become the</span> <span>first team to win the trophy three years</span> <span>in succession since Blackburn in 1886</span> <span>and have not lost in 13 ties since suffering</span> <span>a 1-0 defeat at Barnsley in 2008.</span></p>
              <p><span>Last year's final victory at Wembley</span> <span>secured the club's first Double and</span> <span>assured Ancelotti's place in history after</span> <span>his first season in English football.</span></p>
              <p><span>'It's good for us to play FA Cup because</span> <span>we don't have a gap to close,' he said.</span> <span>'We had some very good memories from</span> <span>last season, the semi-final, the final, the</span> <span>atmosphere and the celebrations.</span></p>

We won</span> <span>it last year, the year before and it would</span> <span>be good to be competitive this year.'</span> </strong></p>
              <p><span>Ancelotti insists he will pick a strong</span> <span>team but is likely to rest senior players</span> <span>who are nursing slight injuries, including</span> <span>Ashley Cole and Michael Essien.</span></p>
              <p><span>Youngsters Patrick van Aanholt and</span> <span>Josh McEachran are likely to deputise.</span> <span>Didier Drogba picked up a knock in</span> <span>training and could make way for Daniel</span> <span>Sturridge, who scored five for the</span> <span>reserves in midweek.</span></p>

              <p>This fan is damn stupid, probably he thinks the sack game is the "in" thing now when results don't go their way.</p>
              <p>I think it's fair to agree that Abramovic is the one who pumped in millions of dollars to rebuild Chelsea after Ken Bates sold the club to him. Did anyone recall Chelsea being a title contender prior to the arrival of Abramovic? I doubt so, they were more of a mid-table club.</p>
              <p>The owner has been pumping millions of dollars into the club to poach top players from other club that comes with hefty price tags. Apart from City, Madrid and Barca, which other clubs in the world can afford at least 2 X 30m signing per season?</p>
              <p>And the worst part is he's still posing in front of the banners! What an idiot.</p>

              <p>Maybe he is not Chelsea fan at all.</p>
              <p>Anyway the main thing is the way Chelsea work.... Ancelotti is not the Manager but the Head Coach of the team.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the players themselves are flops. Getting such high pays but unable to give consistent performance.</p>
              <p>Finally the defence and midfield has the regular people back, but the attackers like Anelka and Drogba blames their "malaria" for their slump in form, but to me, its more like they are lazy on the pitch.</p>
              <p>With players out of form, Ancelotti had no other choices but to play them. The poor youngsters sitting on the bench does not even play any reserves match and takes part of only 10minutes on the pitch? What can you do in 10minutes short time? THey are simply rotting and passing time on the bench.</p>
              <p>When Ancelotti said he was giving Ancelotti more opportunities to play - thats additional 10 minutes for him to make a difference. Allowing sturridge to play 20 mins. wtf.</p>
