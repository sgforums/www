He is around 1.88m tall and gives a sensation of being slow, but it is in the first four or five metres that he is very quick, very intelligent and reads the game superbly.<br><br>"Before he was seen as an offensive player, but I think he better in a more defensive role in front of the back line.<br><br>"That does not take anything away from him or make him less important, because he is still dangerous in attack at set pieces.<br><br>"He is also great at winning back possession and starting attacking moves with a good first pass.<br><br>"TourÃ© is a very good player who could adapt to Barcelona's style because he is physically strong, has incredible technique and can pass."<br><br>"Going to a top club and, having already played for teams in various countries he is very experienced at 24.<br><br>"He can play in several positions, but I think he is better in the Josep Guardiola role than where Leo Messi plays."</div>
