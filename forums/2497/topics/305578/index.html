              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Leeds United boss Dennis Wise will be offered a role in Newcastle's coaching set-up.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Leeds refused to comment on speculation linking Wise
                  with a job under Kevin Keegan, who returned for a second spell as
                  Magpies manager earlier this month. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Keegan held talks with Alan Shearer last week, but the
                  former Newcastle hero has declined to return to St James' Park as his
                  assistant. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Wise played for England under Keegan and has enhanced his standing at Leeds.
                   </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The 41-year-old has guided his team into play-off
                  contention in League One despite them starting the season on minus 15
                  points. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">That penalty followed their going into administration last season and being relegated, and money remains tight at Elland Road. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">A Leeds spokesperson would only say: "We don't comment on speculation. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"We have an important game at Southend on Tuesday, and Dennis is preparing his team for that." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">It has been reported on Tyneside that Newcastle are confident of recruiting Wise if they can agree compensation with Leeds. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But Wise is a close friend of Leeds chairman Ken Bates,
                  who will fight tooth and nail to keep the former Chelsea midfielder at
                  Elland Road. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Bates lost assistant manager Gus Poyet to Tottenham earlier in the season. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">A win at Roots Hall on Tuesday could lift Leeds to second in the table. </span></p>

              Wise Is Off To Newcastle
              
              Dennis Wise will join Newcastle United on Tuesday evening after being allowed to leave Leeds United.
              
              A full statement on the Leeds website read:
              
                  "We have agreed a compensation package with Newcastle United for the services of our manager Dennis Wise and he will part company with the club on Tuesday January 29 after completing the preparations for our game at Southend United that evening.
              
                  Newcastle had approached us for permission to speak with Dennis on Friday and since then things have happened very quickly.
              
                  We will always be grateful to Dennis for the way he has turned things around at the club on the playing side and he goes with our best wishes for the future.
              
                  We are not prepared to comment on the inevitable speculation that will now follow about who will replace Dennis. That is not the way we do our business at this club."
              
              Wise has been taken by the Toon to be a new member of the club's coaching staff under recently re-appointed boss Kevin Keegan.
