              <h2><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/32659_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="207"></h2>
              <h2>Fabio Capello's military regime has come under fire once more, this
              time from Liverpool after Steven Gerrard was forced to attend the
              England camp despite being injured.</h2>
              <p>The Reds declared their captain unavailable for international duty
              after he picked up a groin injury during the 2-0 win over Bolton
              Wanderers on Saturday.</p>
              <p>Capello was not convinced, however, as Gerrard had used a similar
              excuse to dodge England's World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and
              Croatia in September.</p>
              <p>The Three Lions boss ordered the 28-year-old to make the trip to
              London so the Football Association's doctors could determine whether or
              not he was fit to face Germany on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>After a quick once-over, the Whiston native was immediately sent
              back to Merseyside to rest his torn adductor muscle - and Anfield is
              fuming, according to <em>The Sun</em>.</p>
              <p>Rafael Benitez and co are livid that Capello forced Gerrard to make
              a 400-mile journey just to assess if he could feature in a meaningless,
              albeit high-profile, friendly fixture.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, they are worried the European Cup winner's recovery
              period - initially pegged at seven to 10 days - might now be longer
              than expected.</p>

              <h1 class="heading">Fabio Capello proves his point over Steven Gerrard fitness row</h1>
              <p class="heading"> </p>
              <p class="heading"><img src="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00415/benitez_360_415857a.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="360"></p>
              <p class="heading"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Benitez: I told you he was unfit</em> </span></p>
              <p class="heading"> </p>
              <p><strong>The tension between Fabio Capello and Rafael Benítez grew last night, with the Liverpool manager bewildered by his England counterpart's insistence that Steven Gerrard make a six-hour round trip to prove that he was not fit enough to play for his country in tomorrow's friendly match against Germany.</strong></p>
              <p>Gerrard is one of seven first-choice players who have pulled out of the match in Berlin, but his absence has caused by far the greatest controversy, with Capello irked by Liverpool's announcement on Sunday that their captain would miss the match, having suffered a groin injury during their 2-0 victory away to Bolton Wanderers 24 hours earlier.</p>
              <p>Eager to prove a point - whether to Gerrard or to Benítez, with whom he has clashed over the player's fitness this season - Capello demanded that the Liverpool captain report to the England team hotel in Hertfordshire to be assessed by the Football Association's medical staff.</p>
              <p>The FA quickly confirmed Liverpool's diagnosis of a torn adductor muscle, leaving Gerrard to make the three-hour journey back to Merseyside yesterday, but tensions remain between Capello and Benítez, with both managers unhappy at the way that the other has handled the matter.</p>
              <p>After Frank Lampard joined the list of absentees yesterday because of a rib injury, the FA moved last night to dispel conspiracy theories that leading players had withdrawn from the squad while fit enough to represent their clubs. The other notable absentees are Wes Brown, Rio Ferdinand, Ashley Cole, Wayne Rooney and Emile Heskey, along with David Beckham, who is considered to lack match fitness, meaning that, of the first-choice starting line-up, only David James, Gareth Barry, Theo Walcott and John Terry - the England captain has recovered from a foot injury - are available to play in Berlin.</p>
              <p>However, a frustrated Capello has reluctantly accepted that all their injuries are genuine, even if in many cases the players are likely to be fit to play for their clubs in the Barclays Premier League next weekend.</p>
              <p>“It's just very unfortunate that we've got a lot of players who are regulars in the squad who are not around,” Adrian Bevington, the FA's director of communications, said. “The fact is that players have been down and have been assessed and we are satisfied that these players have legitimate injuries. The medical scans show it up, so there shouldn't be any suggestion or innuendo otherwise. The players are absolutely gutted that they are not able to play for England in Berlin on Wednesday night.” Jimmy Bullard, of Fulham, and Scott Parker, of West Ham United, have been called up to bolster Capello's midfield resources.</p>
              <p>Gerrard will be more disappointed than any of his fellow absentees, particularly because his commitment to the England cause has again been questioned. Capello was disappointed when Gerrard was ruled out of the opening World Cup qualifying matches against Andorra and Croatia in September, believing that Liverpool had timed his groin operation to serve their interests at the expense of those of his country.</p>
              <p>Benítez felt on this occasion that he had handled the matter in the correct manner, with messages conveyed to Capello via his medical staff, as has become the norm, before a club statement was issued on Sunday afternoon. The Liverpool manager defended his handling of the matter yesterday. “We had to do a scan after the Bolton game because Steven said he had some pain in his groin,” he said. “It is not a massive problem and we hope he will be ready to return in seven to ten days.”</p>
              <p>While Scott Carson, Ashley Young, Gabriel Agbonlahor and Darren Bent expect to appear in Berlin at some stage, the ultra-competitive Capello is likely to keep experimentation to a minimum in the first half, preferring a more solid and experienced line-up in the hope of extending England's unbeaten run to eight matches.</p>
