              <p><span><strong>Rafa Benitez is on the brink of being appointed the new Chelsea manager and could be in place for Tuesday's FA Cup fifth-round replay against Birmingham.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Andre Villas-Boas's team slumped to another embarrassing defeat on Saturday, losing 1-0 at West Bromwich Albion, and the young Chelsea boss admitted he did not know if he would survive in the job much longer.</span></p>
              <p><span>Chelsea have already made contact with former Liverpool manager Benitez and, asked if he thought he would still be in charge for Tuesday's game, Villas-Boas said: 'Don't ask me, ask the owner.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Roman Abramovich's board had been expected to axe the Portuguese if the team failed to overturn a 3-1 first-leg deficit against Napoli in the Champions League in 10 days' time.</span></p>
              <p><span>But the awful performance, which leaves Chelsea in fifth place in the league and three points adrift of Champions League qualification considered vital by the club, seems certain to bring forward that decision.</span></p>

              <p><span>'The pressure at present is on us to perform. We had a good win against Bolton last week and, now, a defeat which is hard to take because we were very, very poor today.</span></p>
              <p><span>'We have four days to prepare for the cup-tie at Birmingham and we have to improve 300 per cent.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Of course, there is high expectation. Everyone expects more from us, particularly the fans, who were excellent today and that makes defeat all the harder to take.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Villas-Boas has attempted to change Chelsea's tactics radically by emulating Guardiola's Barcelona team.</span></p>

              rafa went to liverpool after winning with valencia.  see what happened at anfield and later inter.
              
              AVB won with porto and see what happened to him at chelsea.
              
              now its guardiola's turn.  if he wants to prove his pedigree he should leave barca and win again with another club.  otherwise stay put.

              <p>The former Liverpool boss is one of the favourites to replace <span style="color: #000000;">sacked Andre Villas-Boas</span>.</p>
              <p>Spaniard Benitez is yet to hear from billionaire Blues owner Roman Abramovich — but is ready to talk.</p>
              <p>He said: "As a manager with Champions League experience and experience in Spain and Italy, I am open to offers.</p>
              <p>"How many managers have won trophies in three different countries, the Spanish title or the FIFA Club World Cup? I am a manager now waiting for a job, I can't stop speculation. I can't stop people talking.</p>
              <p>"I have just to wait and see if something happens in the future.</p>
              <p>"I'd like to challenge for trophies and have this option. I am open to these kinds of projects and have to analyse every offer."</p>
              <p>Villas-Boas was booted out on Sunday, just 257 days after taking the job at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>And former Blues boss Felipe Scolari — sacked amid reports of a player revolt three years ago — called the job 'hell'.</p>
              <p>Scolari said: "Chelsea's culture is very different.</p>
              <p>"Some things are known, like the relations with the owner, who has the relationship with some players before the coach."</p>
              <p>Benitez, 51, who still lives in England, shrugged off the turnover of seven managers in eight years.</p>
              <p>He pointed to his record of winning the Champions League with Liverpool, the World Club Cup with Inter and La Liga with Valencia.</p>
              <p>He said: "At top sides, the manager is always under pressure. I have experience in Spain and Italy — so I know."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span><strong>Rafa Benitez's chances of replacing Andre Villas-Boas have been rocked by the hostility of Chelsea supporters.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>More than 3,000 Blues fans were at Birmingham on Tuesday and many made their feelings clear about the idea of former Liverpool manager Benitez taking control.</span></p>
              <p><span>This registered firmly with chairman Bruce Buck, chief executive Ron Gourlay and technical director Michael Emenalo, who were all at St Andrews to see Chelsea win their FA Cup fifth round replay 2-0.</span></p>
              <p><span>Benitez received an informal approach about taking over at Stamford Bridge until the end of the season but, when Villas-Boas was sacked on Sunday, assistant manager Roberto di Matteo was given the job on an interim basis.</span></p>
              <p><span>Opposition to Benitez from Chelsea fans stems from the bitter relationship between him and Jose Mourinho who both arrived in England in 2004 and became locked in rivalry as their teams met regularly in cup competitions.</span></p>
              <p><span>Roman Abramovich has quickly cooled on the idea of appointing the 51-year-old Spaniard, even if the ambitious pursuit of top targets Pep Guardiola and Mourinho fails.<br></span></p>
              <div id="ext-gen3844" class="moduleHalf"> 
              <div class="sport item"><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ChelseaMail"></a><span>Benitez, 51, said: 'When I went to Liverpool I was trying my best for them, for the club, for the city, for the fans and we won a lot of trophies. I was fighting for them.</span></div>
              <div class="sport item"><span>'When I was at Valencia, it was the same. The name of the club doesn’t matter. I will try to win every game from day one. The fans will see I’m working hard and trying to win. And they will be happy with this if we win.</span></div>
              </div>
              <p><span>'I have experience in the Champions League, experience in the Premier League and I know a good project will come along. When? I don’t know.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Now, Di Matteo has done well and you have to respect other managers. I am just waiting and watching games and trying to be ready.' </span></p>

              <p><br></p>
              <p><span><strong>Benitez can claim to know what makes Fernando Torres tick having lured him to Anfield from Atletico Madrid.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Torres, without a goal since October 19, is clearly bereft of confidence and rejected Juan Mata's offer to let him take a late penalty at Birmingham on Tuesday, when Chelsea were already two up.<br></span></p>

              <p>The former Liverpool boss, who led the Reds to Champions League glory in 2005, remains the second favourite for the job.</p>
              <p>Real Madrid chief Jose Mourinho leads the betting to take over from interim head coach Roberto di Matteo in the summer.</p>
              <p>Chelsea supporters chanted anti-Benitez songs at Birmingham in midweek after the Spaniard was linked with the role.</p>
              <p>But he said: "When I went to Valencia they were in the final of the Champions League and I was coming from the second division with Tenerife.</p>
              <p>"The fans complained 'he's a young coach' and they were not sure about me.</p>
              <p>"After winning two league titles and the UEFA Cup, they loved me. So the fans know what they want to see - and that's their team winning.</p>
              <p>"I have done the same for years at different clubs so I have experience.</p>
              <p>"I won the European Cup with an English club. What are Chelsea looking for? A manager who can win in Europe.</p>
              <p>"If they have someone that can guarantee they can win a lot of games and especially in the Champions League, they will be happy."</p>
              <p>On the Chelsea job, Benitez added: "I have said before, many times, that I would like to find a top side that can match my desire to win trophies.</p>
              <p>"I didn't have a proper offer on the table from Chelsea but there is no rush.</p>
              <p>"I have been waiting since I left Inter Milan. I was just analysing football.</p>
