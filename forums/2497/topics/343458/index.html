              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">DECO has blasted suggestions he is Phil Scolari’s Chelsea pet and does not warrant a place in the team.</h2>
              <p class="article">Midfielder Deco, Brazilian-born like his club manager, insisted: “It is absolute nonsense to claim that he is biased towards me. “I do not need to defend myself but it is a fact that I have won many titles in my career without Scolari. “It is just that I am rarely on the subs’ bench at Chelsea. But that has been the case throughout my career. I have always been a first-team player.</p>
              <p class="article">“Scolari and I simply just work together on a daily basis, which is a good experience because he is a fantastic person.”</p>
              <p class="article">Deco, 31, who played under Scolari for Portugal, is Big Phil’s only signing for Chelsea, having joined from Barcelona for £8million in August. But he has failed to impress all his team-mates as the Blues have struggled for consistency.</p>
              <p class="article">Deco has 18 months of his Stamford Bridge agreement to run with the option of a further 12 months. But he admits he is likely to finish his career in the land of his birth when his £90,000-a-week Chelsea contract expires.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “I am very eager to return to living in Brazil. I have been away from home for 12 years and I miss my friends and family. “I loved living in Portugal, where I was well treated and had many friends. And Barcelona was also a fantastic city. But Brazil is where I truly feel at home.”</p>
              <p class="article">While Deco pondered life beyond Stamford Bridge, captain John Terry worried about a Chelsea future without Wayne Bridge who joined Manchester City for £10m last weekend.</p>
              <p class="article">Terry said: “I’m still in shock a little bit because it’s a shame to see one of the lads go who you have grown up with and been with a long time. “The thing with Bridgey is he could play left-back or left midfield and he is a great crosser of the ball and gets up and down — so we will miss him.”</p>
