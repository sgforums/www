            <div class='col-md body'>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has questioned referees' chief Keith Hackett over his decision to meet Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho.<br><br>Hackett agreed to meet Mourinho over criticism of referee Graham Poll's handling of Sunday's game between Chelsea and Tottenham.<br><br>Ferguson posed the question: "Does Hackett ever to go meet Arsene Wenger, or Rafa Benitez or this old guy here?<br><br>"Is there preference going out to Chelsea? It seems ludicrous."<br><br>Ferguson described Poll as the best referee in England.<br><br>"That's why he gets the big games, because he's the best at making the big decisions," said the United manager.<br><br>But Ferguson believes it may now be wrong to put Poll in charge of United's match against Chelsea at Old Trafford on 26 November.<br><br>"I would like him in a way, but with all this controversy I don't know whether it would be a good thing. I'm fearing he gets the game with all the controversy about Chelsea," said Ferguson.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, Graham Poll is in deeper controversy than thought.<br><br><blockquote><strong>McFadden denies comment over Poll</strong><br><br>Referee Graham Poll is at the centre of controversy again after Everton's James McFadden was sent off against Arsenal in his side's Carling Cup defeat.<br><br>Everton boss David Moyes claimed the fourth official told him McFadden was dismissed for calling Poll a cheat.<br><br>But while the striker said he queried Poll's decision not to give a penalty, he added: "I didn't call him a cheat."<br><br>Poll was already in the spotlight after his much-criticised decision to dismiss Chelsea's John Terry against Tottenham.<br><br>Terry said later that he had been given two different versions of why he was issued with a second yellow card in Sunday's game, while team-mate Ashley Cole accused Poll of bias against his club.<br><br>Wednesday's incident came after Everton striker Andrew Johnson was brought down by Philippe Senderos in the penalty area.<br><br>As Poll waved away the hosts' penalty appeals, McFadden was seen to speak angrily to the referee and was then sent off in the 19th minute.<br><br>"The fourth official told me that he had been sent off because he had called the referee a cheat but James refutes that," said a furious Moyes, who took the unusual step of bringing McFadden to his post-match news conference to give his side of the story.<br><br>"And Andy Johnson told me afterwards that he felt he was fouled in the box and it was a penalty. I now feel he is being punished for what other people are saying about him."<br><br>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger and Sheffield United counterpart Neil Warnock have both questioned Johnson's apparent willingness to go down in the box too easily.<br><br>"He is definitely suffering because of what is being said," said Moyes.<br><br>"Other people are talking about our player when they should be keeping their mouths shut. He is being punished."<br><br></blockquote></div>
