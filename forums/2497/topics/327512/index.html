              <p><em>I even get blamed for global warming</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">RAFA BENITEZ launched the new season with a vintage rant, insisting the Gareth Barry transfer fiasco was not his fault. The Liverpool boss claimed the on-off saga was nothing to do with him — and said he was fed up with being blamed for all the sins of the world.</h2>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">He roared: “Some people will blame me for everything — global warming, rises in petrol prices, everything. “In this case, I want to be clear. Since I talked with Martin O’Neill in April, I didn’t talk with anyone else at Aston Villa.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“All the talks have been between Rick Parry and the owner and chief executive of Aston Villa — and they have been pretty good. "If someone wants to talk about Barry, they will have to talk to the owner or chief executive of Aston Villa, or Rick Parry.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“I was not doing the talks about Barry, and I was not doing the talks about Xabi Alonso and Arsenal. “If you want to talk about players, you have to talk to Rick Parry. If you want to talk about football, talk to me.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Benitez seemed irritated by the statement issued by Anfield chief executive Parry over the Barry affair. Parry said he and owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett did not question Benitez’s judgement, but they felt Villa’s £18million price tag was too high.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The Reds manager refused to accept the deal was dead after Barry played for Villa in the UEFA Cup this week. He is still desperate to land the England midfielder but said any new initiatives would not come from him. He said: “I don’t have any problem with the owners. It’s just that I will always try to improve the squad.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“The squad is better and that was my idea. But we do have some problems on the left because we have lost John Arne Riise, Harry Kewell and Sebastian Leto.” Benitez does not usually lose his cool this quickly — it normally happens <strong>AFTER</strong> he slips out of the title race. But Reds fans are steeling themselves for disappointment even before today’s Premier League opener at Sunderland.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Liverpool looked sluggish in their midweek Champions League tie and Benitez said: “We have one or two players who are not playing very well, but I am very optimistic for the Sunderland game.”</p>
