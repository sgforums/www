              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> boss Rafael Benitez says he will remain patient with £20million summer signing Alberto Aqiulani.</p>
              <p>The 25-year old midfielder joined the Reds from Italian outfit AS <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Roma</span></abbr> with an ankle injury and has struggled to regain full fitness since landing at Anfield.</p>
              <p>Recent reports have suggested that Benitez was to hand Aquilani a start in this Saturday’s home clash with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> but the Spanish tactician wants to remain patient with him so he does not re-injure his troublesome ankle.</p>
              <p>"Alberto wants to play for us and he is so desperate to be involved as
              quickly as he can but he understands the reasons he cannot start yet,”
              Benitez said.</p>
              <p>"He wants to keep improving his condition and now it is just a
              matter of him keeping calm as it will not be long before he is there.
              He is pushing us all the time.</p>
              <p>"He is very positive and wants to help the team now but you
              must remember that we have a responsibility to him, and we will not
              take any risks at this stage.</p>
              <p>"We have got to keep analysing the situation and watching him
              in every training session but we know that the right time is nearly
              here. He has a very good mentality."</p>

              <p>To be fair to him, the league this season has become more competitive so Liverpool might still have a chance at a Top 4 finish if they can pull off a few strings of consecutive wins anytime throughout the remaining season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chelsea, Man U and Arsenal have already lost 2-3 games each out of 12 games so based on current form, you can expect some dropped points now and then.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's see which team hits form at the correct time till the end of the season.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>To be fair to the fans, Ah Ben have been given 5 seasons to improve his squad.</p>
              <p>He was able to make it in 2005 as the squad bought by Ah Hou know that they will be clear out in the end of the season.</p>
              <p>As for the present squad of players, the game with Man City have shown that only a few players are keen and hungry to WIN, the rest are just there to stroke the ball around.</p>
              <p>The whole squad is all bought by Ah Ben to wrestle the BPL title.</p>
              <p>But, besides jamie, steve, el nino and benny, the rest of the players are just not good or hungry enough.</p>
              <p>They have to play the same intensity as the man u game for EVERY game and not for just ONE game.</p>
              <p>With all these factors into consideration and the ultra defensive mentality of Ah Ben, Liverpool will NOT perform any miracle this season.</p>
