              <p><strong>Jose Mourinho loves making enemies. He just can't help himself. And in Italy, he has succeeded beyond his wildest dreams.</strong></p>
              <p>The self-styled Special One has gone out of his way to trash Italian football, accuse Serie A referees of conspiring to deny his club the title and turn the entire Italian media machine against him. As ever, it's Jose v The World.</p>
              <p>That animosity will come to a head in a peculiar twist on Wednesday night when a sizeable proportion of the Italian population pin their hopes on the possibility that their countryman, Carlo Ancelotti, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span></a>'s softly-spoken manager, will put Mourinho in his place.</p>
              <p>It matters little that Ancelotti is now in charge of an English Premier League club playing against the Serie A champions-elect.</p>
              <p>Outside the blue and black half of Milan, the view is that Italian pride will be better served by seeing Mourinho humbled. There is no doubt he is public enemy No 1.</p>
              <p>Mourinho is regarded as just too corrosive a character in a league just beginning to recover from the Calciopoli scandal of 2006, where police discovered leading clubs had selected their 'favourite' referees for matches.</p>
              <p>Mourinho has no hesitation in exploiting this whenever results or referees' decisions go against Inter, blaming wholesale corruption in officialdom for any setbacks, as he did again on Sunday when two of his players were sent off in a goalless draw.</p>
              <p>'We are not playing against Milan, or Rome or Sampdoria,' he said. 'We are playing against "other things".' Mourinho accuses the authorities as if they were 'ostriches, with their heads in the sand'.</p>
              <p>Now the Italian game is fighting back. Sampdoria chief executive Beppe Marotta said Mourinho 'creates a nasty climate'. Italian Football Federation vice-president Demetario Albertini accused Mourinho of 'continually throwing dirt at football'. AC Milan general manager Adriano Galliani, former president of the Italian League, went a stage further. 'We cannot continue like this,' he said. 'Mourinho has to stop. His attitude is tantamount to an incitement to violence.'</p>
              <p>And so Mourinho has been hit with a three-match touchline ban and £40,000 fine, which is being viewed as the beginning of a long and acrimonious departure from Serie A for the Portuguese coach.</p>
              <p>A top Italian writer, who deals with the Inter camp daily, said: 'We don't think he will be here next season and we won't be sorry about that. There are plenty of people around who will drive him to the airport.'</p>
              <p>Even allowing for some opportunistic bandwagon jumping by Inter's rivals, there is no doubting the widespread contempt Mourinho's antics inspire.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/22/article-0-08643475000005DC-118_468x321.jpg" alt="Jose Mourinho " width="468" height="321"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Guilty: Mourinho mimes that he is in handcuffs in weekend clash against Sampdoria</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>On Sunday he threw a kit bag over the roof of the Inter dug-out, mimed that he was being slapped in handcuffs, doubled up in sarcastic laughter at some of the officials' decision making and allegedly confronted the referee in the tunnel.</strong></p>
              <p>Inter president Massimo Moratti spent yesterday privately apologising for his manager and seeking to calm tempers at the Italian Federation. Moratti enjoys what Mourinho achieves on the pitch, but finds the accompanying mess an embarrassment.</p>
              <p>It is a situation Roman Abramovich will be familiar with. Although Mourinho's failures in the Champions League and style of play were said to be the main factors behind the Russian owner's decision to remove him, according to one of his aides Abramovich simply decided Mourinho had become 'unmanageable'.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/22/article-0-08642E24000005DC-571_306x423.jpg" alt="Samuel Eto'o " width="306" height="423">

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>There were too many controversies and too many conflicts around the club, and those same quarrelsome distractions are now in danger of running out of control in Milan, where Mourinho is regarded as a never-ending argument. But, oddly, while he seems happy to attract as much opprobrium as possible in Italy, Mourinho has been going out of his way to make diplomatic noises about Chelsea.</strong></p>
              <p>He even fired off a text to Abramovich over the weekend. It said: 'Do you need extra tickets, a box or a hotel in Milan?'</p>
              <p>Mourinho said: 'Whenever I go to London he's available to give me his support, this time I want to see if he needs something from me.' So does Abramovich get the red-carpet treatment? 'For sure,'nodded the Inter boss on Saturday night.</p>
              <p>Mourinho went on studiously to avoid any admission the game is an opportunity for revenge on the club that dumped him two-and-a-half years ago.</p>
              <p>'No, there would be no special pleasure,' he said with a straight face. 'I think it's the same for them if they knock me out.'</p>
              <p>Having highlighted Chelsea's lack of trophies since his departure and Abramovich's 'grave mistakes' in appointing the likes of Avram Grant since, Mourinho would still have us imagine tomorrow night is little more than another day at the office.</p>
              <p>'I'm not especially excited, I promise you,' he says. 'I view it with the same amount of emotion and without any extra nerves or motivation. That's how it is.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><a class="lightboxPopupLink" href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/22/article-0-086BDE7D000005DC-936_468x251_popup.jpg"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/22/article-0-086BDE7D000005DC-936_468x251.jpg" alt="Mourinho " width="468" height="251"> </a></div>
              <p><strong>And, no, I don't believe a word of that either. Chelsea have pursued the Champions League for seven years under Abramovich, but the pursuit is nothing measured against Inter's 45-year hunt for Europe's top prize.</strong></p>
              <p>It is their Holy Grail. Winning Serie A again will not insulate Mourinho from the consequences of his continual feuding. Inter have won four titles in a row and take it almost for granted that any manager they appoint will claim a fifth successive Scudetto.</p>
              <p>But lose again in Europe, as Mourinho did against Manchester United last season, and he will leave Milan a qualified failure.</p>
              <p>He is not expected to stay. If Italian football holds Mourinho in contempt, the feeling is undoubtedly mutual. And he has his eye on Real Madrid this summer, rather than a return to the Premier League.</p>
              <p>Mourinho believes he will establish himself as an all-time great if he wins championships in the continent's three top leagues - England, Italy and Spain.</p>
              <p>He also relishes the chance of usurping Barcelona's dominance, where he worked as Sir Bobby Robson's assistant and some still deride him as 'the interpreter'. But first there is a match to be won.</p>
              <p>Does Mourinho think his knowledge of Chelsea gives him an edge? 'I know the Chelsea players very well, but Ancelotti knows Inter. This is his country, this is the place where he was working all his life, so he knows everything about us. I don't think I have an advantage.'</p>
              <p>These little vignettes are delivered with the usual array of pouts and 'you have to believe me' expressions that Mourinho pulls when he is being charming. H owever the questions about Chelsea are phrased, however the scenario is put to him, he sticks to an uncharacteristically diplomatic line.</p>
              <p>'If a Chelsea player is happier to beat me than to beat another manager I will be very sad to hear it,' he says. 'I wouldn't understand why that would be? 'But I am not sentimental about it. I will face this match like any other.'</p>
              <p>Give that man an Oscar. Mourinho always plays a starring role in the movie that is running in his head. Of course, he can afford to say 'this game is not all about me', because he knows full well that it most certainly is.</p>

              <p><strong>The war of words between Carlo Ancelotti and Jose Mourinho intensified on Monday when the Chelsea manager declared that the whole of Italy would be supporting his side in Wednesday’s Champions League clash at the San Siro.</strong></p>
              <p>Playing on the theme that Mourinho has fast become the most unpopular man in Italian football, Ancelotti declared to one of the country’s news-papers that ‘everyone in Italy, except the Inter fans, will be supporting Chelsea’.</p>
              <p>On Monday Mourinho, former Chelsea boss and one-time ‘enemy of football’, underlined his pariah status when he received a three-match touchline ban for his handcuffs gesture to a referee at the weekend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/22/article-1253046-086B0F75000005DC-259_306x423.jpg" alt="Touchline ban: Jose Mourinho landed himself in hot water for this 'handcuff' gesture" width="306" height="423"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Touchline ban: Jose Mourinho landed himself in hot water for this 'handcuff' gesture</em></p>
              <p><br></p>
              <p><strong>The rival managers clashed when they shared the San Siro as the bosses of AC Milan and Inter, and Ancelotti took a number of swipes at Mourinho in the autobiography he published last year, referring to the self-anointed Special One as ‘His Speciality’.</strong></p>
              <p>But two months after hearing Mourinho express a desire to return one day to Stamford Bridge, Ancelotti chose the week of their last-16 encounter at the San Siro to reignite their long-running feud.</p>
              <p>Il Giornale, the paper that carried the interview with Ancelotti, said he was right to believe most of Italy would be backing the leaders of the Barclays Premier League, declaring that it ‘was not far from the truth’.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti rapped his predecessor for dismissing the achievements of his successors, saying: ‘It’s true that after him (Mourinho) nobody has won anything for Chelsea, although some bloke called Grant didn’t do so bad and came close with the Champions League final.</p>
              <p>‘He is good at charging up the atmosphere and the team, but it’s ground I would never go on.’Ancelotti also revealed that Chelsea would be staying in a city centre hotel normally favoured by Inter.</p>
              <p>Mourinho received a £40,000 fine as well as a three-match touchline ban for his handcuffs gesture in Inter’s 0-0 draw against Sampdoria.</p>
              <p>Italian referees are also threatening strike action as a result of his most recent behaviour. The Italian FA described Mourinho’s actions as ‘excessive and against the decision of the match referee’, and the ban will be immediate for Serie A matches.</p>
              <p>Incredibly, it is the third suspension Mourinho has received this season.</p>
              <p>The controversy is sure to hasten his return to English football, even if his chances of beating his old club were boosted by news Chelsea have a serious left-back problem.</p>
              <p>Ashley Cole was already sidelined, but Yury Zhirkov will not travel because of a calf injury. Juliano Belletti was unable to train properly on Monday because of a knee problem.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti will hope Belletti recovers in time but he may have to turn to Florent Malouda as emergency cover.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Cole’s showdown with the Chelsea board will not take place until after Wednesday's match. </p>

              <p>“I always make my own formation. It’s never told to me. There are many coaches [who are told what to do] who have won the Champions League a few times. Carlo is one of them. He is also the only one to have lost a final after being 3-0 up.”</p>
              <p>“Ancelotti is the only one who thinks Adriano’s goal was a handball. Does he think we are all dumb? Perhaps he is dumb when he fails to speak about Ronaldinho’s offside goal in the first derby when they won.”</p>
              <p>“Ancelotti is forgetting that one of Milan’s most legendary managers, Arrigo Sacchi, never played to any higher standard than me. And my dentist is great, even though he’s never had a toothache.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Carlo Ancelotti </strong>“I have friends outside of football. Mourinho is just a colleague who I respect. Friends? He is not my friend.”</p>
              <p>“If Mourinho is Jesus, then I am certainly not one of his apostles.”</p>
              <p>“Mourinho? I am not fascinated by his personality when he communicates. Sometimes he says useless things. I focus on work.”</p>
              <p>“Is Mourinho up for my job at Milan? We’ve already found someone to replace [Alessandro] Costacurta, but if we’d known earlier, we could have found him a job. Helping the goalkeeper coach? No, he’s never played football, he wouldn’t be capable of shooting on goal.”</p>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Wesley Sneijder is hoping to guide Inter Milan to European glory, and has former employers in his sights. The reigning Serie A champions have been paired against Premier League leaders Chelsea in the last 16 of the Champions League, with the first leg of an intriguing contest set to take place at the San Siro on Wednesday.</strong> </p>
              <p>Dutch midfielder Sneijder accepts that the Blues will provide a stern test of Inter's credentials, but is confident the Italian giants can prevail. </p>
              <p>He also feels Jose Mourinho's side are capable of making it all the way to the final, where he hopes they will come up against Real Madrid - the side who offloaded him last summer. </p>
              <p>"I left Real Madrid to win titles with Inter and I dream of a Champions League final date with Real in the Bernabeu," Sneijder told <em>skysports.com</em>. </p>
              <p>"For that to happen we have to eliminate Chelsea and remain in the competition. I am confident we can do that. </p>
              <p>"This round will be very tough and will require a lot of effort and determination. To advance we will have to pass a difficult test. </p>
              <p>"The key to the game will be in midfield. The team that is able to dominate possession will make the quarter-finals." </p>
              <p>He added: "It is vital Inter win in the San Siro and that we make the stadium a fortress. Our fans understand this and will do all they can to help us to victory. </p>
              <p>"The important thing is to win and take an advantage to Stamford Bridge, forcing Chelsea to change their tactics. </p>
              <p>"If we are able to keep a clean sheet that would be helpfully, but it is not essential as we have the attacking firepower to score goals in London." </p>
              <p>Sneijder is convinced Inter can match Chelsea in every area of the field and insists they have nothing to fear from Carlo Ancelotti's men. </p>
              <p>"The battle in midfield will be terrific because there will be people like (Frank) Lampard, (Michael) Ballack and Deco who are very experienced in these situations," he said. </p>
              <p>"We need to make sure we avoid making any mistakes and try to create as many opportunities as possible. </p>
              <p>"I am certain that, man for man, Inter are not inferior to Chelsea and over the course of 180 minutes it is possible for us to secure a passage into the next round."</p>

              <p>Chelsea are likely to be without Petr Cech as they try to overturn a narrow Champions League defeat to Inter Milan.</p>
              <p>The Czech goalkeeper was carried off with a torn calf muscle in the San Siro last night as Carlo Ancelotti's team were knocked out of their stride by Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan in the first leg of their last-16 Champions League tie.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/24/article-0-0873F612000005DC-512_468x315.jpg" alt="chelsea Petr Cech" width="468" height="315">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Losing streak: Things get worse for a flagging Chelsea side against Inter as goalkeeper Petr Cech is carried off midway through the second half</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em></em></p>
              <p>On a night when Mourinho outwitted Ancelotti by nullifying the threat of Didier Drogba through sheer force, Inter took the initiative with goals from Diego Milito and Esteban Cambiasso.</p>
              <p>Salomon Kalou gave Chelsea hope of turning the tie round at Stamford Bridge with a second half goal and he was unlucky not to be given a penalty in the first half when he was bundled over by Walter Samuel.</p>
              <p>Cech was injured landing heavily after collecting a cross and fell in a crumpled heap. Chelsea's medical staff immediately called for a stretcher and substitute keeper Hilario replaced him on the hour.</p>

              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/24/article-0-0873DAAA000005DC-345_468x286.jpg" alt="Diego Milito" width="468" height="286">

              <p>Cech must be doubtful for the return leg in three weeks after leaving the field in obvious pain.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti said: 'Cech had an injury on his calf, we have to control his condition over the next few days.'</p>
              <p>Inter took the lead through Milito inside three minutes before Kalou's side-foot strike got Chelsea back on terms soon after the break. But the visitors were behind again less than five minutes later when Cambiasso's drive from the edge of the box flew into the bottom corner.</p>

              <p>Ancelotti said of Kalou's penalty claim: 'I think it was a penalty but a penalty is when the referee blows the whistle. We can say that we were unlucky this evening and we hope it will be better in the future. Manuel Mejuto Gonzalez is a very good referee with a lot of experience.'</p>
              <p>Inter manager Jose Mourinho admitted the tie remains very in the balance ahead of his return to Stamford Bridge in three weeks time.</p>
              <p>'Of course I'm happy inside,' said Mourinho. 'I don't think the game was a question of tactics. It was a high level game, no surprise for me, with the quality they have.</p>

              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/24/article-0-0873A64C000005DC-855_468x286.jpg" alt="Jose Mourinho" width="468" height="286">

              <p>'It's the kind of result that keeps it in the balance. I told the players they are not better than us. Chelsea can play better - Inter can play better. Now it will be down to the team with the greatest ambition.'</p>
              <p>Frank Lampard felt Chelsea had done enough to at least come away from the San Siro with a draw. He said: 'Maybe we deserved better. On the balance of play we felt we were the stronger team.'</p>

              <h3>JOSE MOURINHO is the sort of guy who was always going to take centre stage at the San Siro, no matter what happened.</h3>
              <p>The charismatic Inter Milan boss spent the second half shuffling his pack and changing his tactics to such a degree that it must have sent his nemesis Carlo Ancelotti's head into a spin.</p>
              <p>Mourinho may still have enormous affection for Chelsea but he wants to knock them out with a passion.</p>
              <p>Derided in some quarters for his failure to bring the Blues the ultimate prize, despite his incredible domestic success, and an under-achiever with Inter in Europe, this was his big chance to show his side are capable of going all the way to Madrid.</p>
              <p>The Italians, like city rivals AC Milan against Manchester United in the same venue, scored with virtually their first attack as Diego Milito cracked in the opener.</p>
              <p>Salomon Kalou equalised but Esteben Cambiasso soon restored Inter's lead to turn up the volume inside the stadium.</p>
              <p>A serious-looking knee injury to Petr Cech only added to Chelsea's problems as they trail going into the second leg at Stamford Bridge.</p>

              <p>Chelsea are still in with a good chance in the return leg...</p>
              <p>To be honest, this Inter team don't look very good. They don't pass as well as Barce or even close to them. But one thing they match Chelsea was their physical play... You don't normally see that from Italian teams...</p>
              <p>Anyway, given that Inter are not a team on form recently, picking up only 3 points from a total of 9, and having seen their lead in Serie A from 10 cut to 4, the win can be seen as a good result for them... Whether they can hold on at the Bridge will depend on Mourinho rather than the Inter players... Can he motivate them enough to survive at the Bridge.</p>

              <p>Eto'o had the best chance in the first half... The set up was very nice only for him to miss his swing on the ball inside the 6 yard box... Or it would have been 2 - 0 to them by the end of the first half.</p>
              <p>And Terry is getting worse... His problems off the field is effecting him... Inter's first goal was down to his fault... But I have never thought of him as a very good defender anyway... lol.</p>

              <p>for maybe the 3rd time this season, i agree with you.</p>
              <p>john seem very much affected by his off-field problem.</p>
              <p>this tie is still very much open imo, away goals will decide which team go thru to the next round.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>inter fail to make use of the chances when cech was sub out due to injury. And they didnt make full use of left flank as malouda is play as LB. And 1 more thing to worry abt chelsea is their left back they dun have any decent replacement. Maybe switching terry or alex to left back. two big worrys for next game againist city. While city adebayor was sent off during the game with stoke in fa cup. City will attack left side of chelsea this coming game. adam johnson will lead the attack and they might win this game.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>chelsea got the crucial away goal. I think for the second leg, Mourinho will tell his team to park a bus in front of their goal and look for counter attack. chelsea will attack inter from the outset and may leave gap for inter to exploit. if inter score an early goal, advantage to inter, as chelsea need to score 2 goals to tie the match into extra time.</p></div>

              <p>Really boring game to be honest. Full of diving espicially from Lucio.</p>
              <p>Everytime he gets contacted, he drops to the floor and clutch his face. Really disgraceful. Maybe he admits to the fact that his face is really ugly, hence he has to cover it from the cameras when they close in on him.</p>
              <p>Initially I was supporting inter to whoop chelsea, but thanks to lucio and his disgraceful time wasting, I hope chelsea kicks inters butt at stamford bridge.</p>
              <p>Inter is full of dirty players. Can't believe W.samuel went away unpunished when he put drogba in a choke hold.</p>
              <p>And Diego Milito, worst diver ever. So glad he got yellow carded for that HAHAHA.</p>
