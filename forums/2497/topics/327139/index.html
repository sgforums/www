              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">PEOPLE often say there is no room for sentiment in football. Well, the biggest test of that will come in the next few days when we find out whether Thierry Henry really would be interested in joining Manchester United.</h2>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The former Arsenal hero has said in the past he would only ever return to England to play for his old club again. But if you ask me, I wouldn’t blame him if he went to play under Alex Ferguson, especially if Barcelona want to get rid of him.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Most Arsenal fans would love the French idol back at the Emirates one day. But it’s fairly obvious Arsene Wenger doesn’t want him. So what right has anyone to stand in his way if there is a move to Old Trafford on offer? After all, he’s no David Beckham.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">When Becks left England for Real Madrid he said he’d never play for another Premier League club other than his beloved United — and he was as good as his word. After his Spanish adventure, even with the likes of Newcastle and Arsenal sniffing around, he joined a side halfway across the world no one had even heard of rather than come back here. It proved just how much he loves United.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">There’s no doubt Henry loves the Gunners. The club and Wenger made him what he is today. But I just don’t know if he has the same affection for the club as Becks has for United. We’ll soon see. Of course, Arsenal fans would be devastated if Henry joined their biggest rivals. In their book, there is no worse crime.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">But look at this sensibly. Thierry, who turns 31 on Sunday, still has bags to offer and only a few years left to show it. For one reason or another, he hasn’t had the kind of success at Barcelona he’d have probably hoped for. If he is out for one last move, then he will want to come back to England where everyone loves him and he can be the main man again.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Other than Arsenal, there’s only one team for a player of that calibre — and that’s United. Part of me wonders whether this is all just a big smokescreen, though.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Ferguson has made no secret of the fact that Dimitar Berbatov is still his No 1 target. But Fergie is the master of mind games and I wouldn’t put it past him if all this speculation is just a way of putting more pressure on Berba to move.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Berba’s people will be jumping through hoops to get his transfer from Tottenham back on the go. And what’s the worst that can happen for Fergie? Miss out on Berba only to sign Henry? That’s hardly a booby prize, is it?</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">I still think Berba would be the better signing. The Bulgarian is a central striker and would fit perfectly into United’s system. And, at 27, he is clearly a more long-term option too.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The only other attacking player United would probably be interested in is Lionel Messi — although I don’t think Barca would sell. That’s what I love about Alex Ferguson, though. All these trophies and he still wants to sign the best in the world.</p>
