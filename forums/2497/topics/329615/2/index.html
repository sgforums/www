              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold">Theo Walcott came of
              age in an England shirt on Wednesday as he inspired a 4-1 victory over
              Croatia in their latest 2010 World Cup qualifier.</p>
              <p>The Arsenal man grabbed a hat-trick, while Wayne Rooney got the other, as Croatia's fine home record suffered a crushing blow.</p>
              <p>England began the game as if revenge for their Euro 2008 failings against Slaven Bilic's men was clearly occupying their mind.</p>
              <p>Their
              early endeavours yielded no reward, but they finally took the lead on
              26 minutes when some comical Croatian defending presented Walcott with
              the opportunity to fire a low drive past Stipe Pletikosa.</p>
              <p>Their
              task was then handed another timely boost eight minutes after the
              interval when Robert Kovac was dismissed for clattering Joe Cole with a
              stray elbow.</p>
              <p>The ten-men were unable to keep the Three Lions out
              for long, and Walcott grabbed his second of the game on 59 minutes when
              Rooney provided him with the chance to score an exact replica of his
              opening strike.</p>
              <p>Four minutes later the points were secured when
              Rooney got his own name on the scoresheet as he profited from some lax
              marking and a fine break from substitute Jermaine Jenas.</p>
              <p>With
              England threatening to run riot, Frank Lampard thought he had bagged a
              fourth on 75 minutes, only to see his fine strike ruled out for an
              earlier foul by Emile Heskey.</p>
              <p>Mario Mandzukic then added some
              credibility to the scoreline three minutes later when he broke clear to
              slot a calm finish under the advancing David James.</p>
              <p>On 81 minutes
              Walcott's remarkable night was completed as he raced on to Rooney's
              through-ball and kept his composure brilliantly to complete his treble
              with a nerveless finish.</p>
              <h4>Pressure</h4>
              <p>A question mark will
              inevitably hang over whether 33-year-old David Beckham will start
              another game for his country after this Walcott show.</p>
              <p>Capello
              opted not to man-mark midfield playmaker Luka Modric and the Tottenham
              player saw plenty of the ball during the early stages as the focal
              point of his side's attacks.</p>
              <p>James needed two attempts to grasp a
              shot drilled straight at him by Danijel Pranjic and then failed to hold
              on to a deep corner from Darijo Srna and would have been relieved to
              see Vedran Corluka drill the loose ball into the side-netting.</p>
              <p>The pressure steadily mounted on England although resolute defending denied the home side any clear-cut opportunities.</p>
              <p>The visitors went ahead through Walcott in the 26th minute - but they were given a helping hand by the Croatian defence.</p>
              <p>Pranjic's
              clearance rebounded off Josip Simunic into the path of Walcott but the
              teenager made the most of his fortune as he drilled a fierce low shot
              across Pletikosa into the corner of the net.</p>
              <p>Walcott could have
              added a second from a similar position soon afterwards but this time
              the Croatian keeper was able to tip his effort around the post.</p>
              <p>Mladen Petric had a fierce low drive blocked, but the Croatians failed to cause any major problems in the opening 45 minutes.</p>
              <p>And
              they became increasingly wary of the pace of Walcott who was cynically
              sent crashing to the ground off the ball by Josip Simunic after one
              lightning run - a challenge which earned him a 38th minute yellow card.</p>
              <h5>Composed</h5>
              <p>England looked composed and Pletikosa did well to get his body behind a low, skimming free-kick from Lampard.</p>
              <p>Then
              after 53 minutes Croatia were reduced to 10 men when Kovac was sent off
              for an aerial challenge which left Joe Cole bloodied - and replaced by
              Jenas.</p>
              <p>England almost instantly made their numerical advantage count, with Walcott striking for the second time.</p>
              <p>Emile
              Heskey and Rooney were involved in the build-up before the overlapping
              Walcott had time to pick his spot and send a low shot across Pletikosa,
              mirroring his effort for the first goal.</p>
              <p>England were now rampant and in the 63rd minute Rooney ended his 11-month international scoring drought.</p>
              <p>Ashley
              Cole won the ball off Srna, picked out the run of Jenas and his low
              cross from the left flank was clinically despatched by the Manchester
              United star.</p>
              <p>Lampard had an effort ruled out for offside before Mandzukic beat James from close range with 12 minutes remaining.</p>
              <p>But
              Walcott ended any hopes of a late Croatian revival as he collected a
              Rooney pass and clipped the ball wide of Pletikosa for his hat-trick.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>i guess i have to agree that both of them can't play well together too. When both of them are in the engine room, Gerrard often have to sit back more to allow Lampard to get into the box more frequently, and thus inhibiting his offensive strengths and the threats that he could actually pose to the defence if he's playing further up ahead. However, what is disappointing is that even though both are trully international class players, they never shown the kind of form they have when they are playing for their clubs. Gerrard's has always insisted that his best performances are delivered through the centre of the park. But unfortunately for him, that does not seem to be the case. In recent matches, all his best performances seem to be down the flank and then cutting in from there.</p>
              <p>In the game against Croatia, i think England played a very similar game to what Manchester United of the last season did. The centre midfield sitting back more often and relying more on the wings to attack which has proved effective. With the quality that England has, i'm glad that they have finally stop underperforming.</p>

              <p>i guess i have to agree that both of them can't play well
              together too. When both of them are in the engine room, Gerrard
              often have to sit back more to allow Lampard to get into the box
              more frequently, and thus inhibiting his offensive strengths and
              the threats that he could actually pose to the defence if he's
              playing further up ahead. However, what is disappointing is that
              even though both are trully international class players, they never
              shown the kind of form they have when they are playing for their
              clubs. Gerrard's has always insisted that his best performances are
              delivered through the centre of the park. But unfortunately for
              him, that does not seem to be the case. In recent matches, all his
              best performances seem to be down the flank and then cutting in
              from there.</p>
              <p>In the game against Croatia, i think England played a very
              similar game to what Manchester United of the last season did. The
              centre midfield sitting back more often and relying more on the
              wings to attack which has proved effective. With the quality that
              England has, i'm glad that they have finally stop
              underperforming.</p>

              <p>well, let's see the next game, currently, england is moving from lousy to good so if capello can maintain, it would be good.</p>
              <p>let's give them credit when it is due and not just squeeze the lemon everytime.</p>
              <p>else it will be like carragher "england lose never mind as long as it is not Liverpool" type of mentality..</p>
              <p>btw, this is England la, don't bring in the club rivarly.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>lampard and gerrard are actually different types of player who occupy the same space....gerrard is more forceful and perhaps carry more flair than the former, lampard runs like a ballerina and looks awkward with little style....but lampard is more technical of a player, accurate passes and a better reader of the game....while gerrard relies more on inspiration to rally his team mates....which on occassion causes pool to become a one man team when he isn't at his best....</p></div>

              <p>aiya england cant perform under pressure. This match is of no significance compared to the one which will get them to euro 2008. Croatia already got in and participated in euro 2008.</p>
              <p>Still got many more games to go for WC 2010 qualifier.</p>
