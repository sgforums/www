              <p><span><strong>Arsene Wenger has revealed that captain Robin van Persie and key defender Thomas Vermaelen are both doubtful for Arsenal's lunchtime kick-off against Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Van Persie played for Holland in their win over England at Wembley on Wednesday while Vermaelen played in Belgium's 1-1 draw in Greece.</span> </p>
              <p><span>And Wenger revealed that both players were carrying knocks into the midweek fixtures, and their conditions have worsened since.</span></p>
              <p><span>'We have a problem with Vermaelen that we have to assess today. Van Persie has a little groin problem that we have to assess,' he said.</span></p>
              <p><span>Wenger took the opportunity</span><span> to criticise the scheduling of international friendlies during the season.</span></p>
              <p><span>'It's difficult to understand that our players had to go injured [to international duty]... it's disrespectful to the players,' he said.</span></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><span>'Any football player knows it's impossible to play four games at top level [in nine days].</span></p>
              <p><span>'Personally I think international friendlies are becoming more difficult to accept.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Aaron Ramsey is out injured but on the bright side for Arsenal, Wenger revealed that Abou Diaby is set to make his long-awaited comeback to the first-team, and Tomas Rosicky is likely to shake off a knock. </span></p>
              <p><span>'Ramsey is out for Saturday and out for Tuesday. But Diaby is available again,' he said.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Rosicky has a groin problem... I think he will play.'</span></p>
              <p><span>With the news emerging that England are considering candidates other than Harry Redknapp for the manager's post, Wenger's name had been touted as a possibility for the job, but the Frenchman ruled it out.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Leave me out of the England job,' he said. 'I have one that is difficult enough. I hope England does well at the Euros.' </span></p>
              <p><span>Meanwhile, Wenger refused to write off the Arsenal career of forward Andrey Arshavin, despite the Russian international joining Zenit St Petersburg on loan earlier this week.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Arshavin is still our player,' he said. 'I just felt he needed to play at that age.'</span><span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></p>

              Liverpool ah Liverpool, what to say about you sia.
              
              First half you owned so much, created so many chance and only scored once and its an own goal somemore. Missed a penalty and a couple of sure in chance. Again Suarez hit the frame....
              
              Robin is imba i doubt any team this season has successfully shut him down by marking him. Jamie is good but not close enough to match Robin.
              
              Kenny how to make you learn that sub a player with less than 10min remaining will not make any impact to the game.
              
              Gerrard dun get yourself injured please.

              <p><span>Robin van Persie proved his worth to Arsenal as one of the deadliest strikers in world football scored two goals to snatch victory at Anfield.</span></p>
              <p><span>Despite being second-best for most of the game the Gunners strengthened their grip on fourth place - and lessened the chances of Liverpool catching them - thanks to the prolific Holland international. </span></p>
              <p><span>The Arsenal captain had two shots on target and scored both as he took his record to 25 goals in as many league matches. Reds manager Kenny Dalglish must wish he had a striker in such form after watching his side squander a number of opportunities.</span></p>
              <p><span>A missed penalty and two shots rebounding off the post - taking the number of times they have hit the woodwork this season to 21 - only half the story as another familiar tale unfolded at Anfield. </span></p>
              <p><span>Arsenal were lucky to go in level at half-time and so to come away with a victory will delight Arsene Wenger and infuriate Dalglish, who suffered his first home defeat of the campaign. </span></p>
              <p><span>The Gunners had two chances in the first 45 minutes, with Theo Walcott testing Jose Reina and Van Persie scoring. </span></p>
              <p><span>By contrast Liverpool, without injured captain Steven Gerrard, created enough openings at the other end to have been out of sight at the interval.</span></p>

              <p><span>After the visitors' first chance, when Jose Reina denied Walcott with a good low save after former Everton midfielder Mikel Arteta's long diagonal ball over the top of left-back Jose Enrique had put the England winger through, the visitors appeared in danger of being swamped. </span></p>
              <p><span>Stewart Downing, so impressive in last weekend's Carling Cup win at Wembley, fluffed his shot with Wojciech Szczesny caught 10 yards out of his penalty area before Luis Suarez won a penalty when he was tripped by the goalkeeper. </span></p>

              <p><span>The Arsenal goalkeeper was powerless to prevent the opening goal, however, when Laurent Koscielny, under little pressure, turned Jordan Henderson's cross into his own net. </span></p>
              <p><span>Liverpool should have made it 2-0 moments later when Henderson's shot was parried by Szczesny to Suarez to drilled the rebound against the post. </span></p>

              <p><span>But just when it looked as if Arsenal were on the brink of cracking they equalised with a goal of breathtaking simplicity on the half-hour. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Bacary Sagna's right-wing cross perfectly picked out Van Persie who had got in front of Jamie Carragher and the striker made no mistake with his header.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>More Suarez trickery, taking him past the quartet of Alex Song, Sagna, Koscielny and Vermaelen, saw his low shot brilliantly turned behind by Szczesny before Kuyt hit the post in added time. </span></p>
              <p><span>Early in the second half there was a lengthy stoppage when Henderson collided with Arteta, who eventually left the field heavily concussed on a stretcher to be replaced by Abou Diaby.</span></p>

              <p><span>Thomas Vermaelen was booked for clattering into the back of Suarez as Liverpool continued to enjoy the upper hand without really threatening.</span></p>
              <p><span>When they did create a chance in the 69th minute it fell to Martin Kelly close in at the far post but he went with his right foot instead of his left and bundled Kuyt's cross wide. Arsenal remained a danger on the break and Reina had to be alert to brilliantly block a Walcott shot with his legs after being wrong-footed.</span></p>

              <p><span>And the Reds were made to pay for their profligacy as in the second of eight minutes of added time Van Persie snatched victory for the Gunners by expertly volleying home Song's cross from a narrow angle.</span></p>
