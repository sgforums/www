              </div>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/23/article-0-08D7F132000005DC-881_233x423.jpg" alt="Gianfranco Zola" width="233" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Shell-shocked: Gianfranco Zola looks devastated 
              as his team slump to defeat</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>West Ham’s Carlton Cole had to be pulled away by police after an 
              altercation with a fan in the tunnel after his side’s humiliating 3-1 
              defeat by Wolves.</p>
              <p>A fifth consecutive defeat leaves Gianfranco
               Zola’s Hammers just three points above the relegation zone and piles 
              the pressure on the Italian manager.</p>
              <p>‘You’re getting sacked in
               the morning,’ shouted West Ham fans after Matthew Jarvis scored Wolves’
               third goal.</p>
              <p>‘I’ve got a long night in front of me to think 
              about it,’ admitted Zola, who looked shattered after the final whistle.</p>
              <p>‘The
               owners (David Sullivan and David Gold) can do whatever they feel is the
               right thing to do. I try to my work as best as I can every single day. 
              If that’s not considered good enough, there you go.</p>
              <p>‘I didn’t
               see the incident but Carlton Cole represents West Ham and, although he 
              might not be playing his best at the moment, he’s trying.</p>
              <p>‘The
               players are working for West Ham and are committed to West Ham. That’s 
              what the fans have to realise. I’ve no problem if the fans have a go at 
              me. The lucky thing is I don’t understand any words.’</p>

              <p>But for Wolves boss Mick McCarthy, the win topped a magnificent 10 
              days that has seen his side take seven points from three away matches 
              and move ever closer to safety.</p>
              <p>McCarthy said: ‘We’ve not 
              shored anything up, yet, but tonight’s gone a long way to achieving 
              that. The score didn’t flatter us.’</p>

              <p>I fancied heskey than cole. heskey got the physical strength and pace, but he lack the scoring touch. cole lack both and also scoring touch, dunno why the hell capello called him up for? its a sad state for england to call up ordinary and mediocre players like carlton cole. is he going to improve in future, yes probably, but still he lack the class to succeed in the top level.</p>

              <p>The <abbr><span class="glossary-term">West
               Ham</span></abbr> supporters chanted "you're not fit to wear the shirt" at
               the team - but Zola urged them to direct any anger and frustration 
              towards him.</p>
              <p>"I think that chant is a little unfair because the players they tried 
              everything," said Zola.</p>
              <p>"The players did their best but in a disjointed way and it made it very 
              difficult for us. They played as individuals.</p>
              <p>"That is very, very painful for me because it is my duty to correct it. 
              The team is not playing very well and I take responsibility for that.</p>
              <p>"If (the fans) want to pick up on somebody they must pick up on me 
              because I am responsible.</p>
              <p>"If they want to chant something they must chant about me. They have to 
              leave the players because they belong to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">West
               Ham</span></abbr>, they are working for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">West

              <p>"If they want to pick up on somebody they must pick up on me.</p>
              <p>"Last year when we were playing well, I was getting compliments. I took 
              the compliments, I can take the criticism as well. But they should leave
               the players.</p>
