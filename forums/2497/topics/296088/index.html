            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://goal.com/images/678_news.jpg"><br><br>Arsene Wenger reportedly met FA chief executive Brian Barwick this week to offer his opinion on who should succeed Steve McLaren as England boss.<br><br>Details of the meeting are sketchy, but the Emirates gaffer has since made it perfectly clear that foreign frontrunners Jose Mourinho and Fabio Cappello are unsuitable in his view.<br><br>"You are very nationalistic; you want the English national team to do well. I believe that you have to choose an Englishman who represents the country," the 58-year-old told the Guardian.<br><br>"I do not understand your logic because you want people to represent the national qualities. Why do you go for a foreign guy?<br><br>"It is like you go to war and you say 'now we choose a general from Portugal or a general from Italy to lead our army'. Would that idea cross your mind? Never."<br><br>Wenger and Mourinho enjoyed a healthy rivalry during the latterÂ’s spell in charge of London rivals Chelsea. Wenger insisted, though, that there is a wealth of homegrown managers who can lead England to the World Cup in 2010.<br><br>"You have [Harry] Redknapp, [Alan] Curbishley, [Steve] Coppell, [Gareth] Southgate, [Stuart] Pearce, [Sam] Allardyce - you have plenty, but you do not rate them enough. Give them a chance.<br><br>"The national team does not play with a Portuguese player or an Italian player so why should suddenly the leader just be foreign? The club is open to the world and the national team is representing the country."<br><br>Wenger has been repeatedly criticised for snubbing English players in favour of expensive imports. Sir Alex Ferguson is the latest football figure to call for a foreign quota in the Premiership. Wenger has only two Englishmen Â– Theo Walcott and Justin Hoyte Â– in his first team squad.<br><br>However, the wily Frenchman reiterated his belief that the decline of English football is not a result of the global nature of the Premier League.<br><br>"I have said many times that from 1966 to 1996 we had no foreigners [in England] and you didn't win any more or any less,<br><br>"You cannot want the best league in the world and only play English players. It is not my responsibility that the English national team does well. I am happy if they do well but it is not my first priority or responsibility. "</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>its quite ironic for me actually. he is the one that is getting more foreign players than english into his team, its like saying foreign players can suit his style of football more than englishmen, but on the otherhand he insists that england should be managed by an english</div>

Not asking, who is the best Englishman.</div></blockquote>I beg to differ here, those countries you mentioned are not so-called powerhouses in world soccer, so they needed foreign expertise to guide them, while for the big guns like brazil, argentina, italy, france, germany and even england, they should opt for local manager to guide them. One good reason is that why should they need foreign expertise since they already have a style of playing which is there for decades and will not change overnight....it will be a laughing stock to ask a italian to coach brazil, will the brazilians change their style, nope rite....somemore the italians are so defensive-minded, it sure will do more damage than help. So same thing here, will england change, i dont think so.<br><br>Haha, Sven Goran i would say was a flop during his tenure as england manager. Well, frankly speaking bringing england to the major tournaments is a must and its a formalilty, there is nothing to shout about, furthermore i would say any manager from england can do that. So, i dont understand what has he achieved for england. Maybe you would argue, reaching the quarterfinals of WC2002, EURO 2004 and WC2006? Well, were they considered big achievements, i doubt so....apart from beating argentina in WC2002, i am sorry to say they always flopped at the biggest stage.<br><br>Bobby Robson did good with england, bringing the best out of Linekar, Waddle, Beardsley and Gascoigne during WCItalia90, when they reached the semis. Same goes to Terry Venables, both managers came so close to reaching the finals, but unfortunately both times they were foiled by Germany, their bitter rivals on penalties. So, think again.....if england wanna win another major tournament, they should go for local manager, though mourinho would be exciting manager, capello is such a master tactician, well i doubt they can change england style of playing overnight. If i were the FA, i would push hard for Sam Allardyce or Harry Redknapp.<br><br></div>

Here the answers for you, first frankly speaking in my opinion Engalnd is not a big gun in world football, the reason i wrote them as one of the big guns coz they think so, simple......hahaha.......if not hor, they would have changed their style of playing long time ago, it has been proven again and again that their style is not suitable for today's football, but they never listen, so what to do. You think its easy meh to to ask a master tactician like capello or hiddink or even mourinho to change the whole mindset of england players. Might as well choose a local manager lah. Never mind if they play like s.h.i.t., as long they play the best out their s.h.i.t., who cares rite? And the best people to do that is a local manager, easy simple as that......its like you teach a crab how to walk, even the fastest walking creature also cannot teach the crab how to walk lah coz they are born like that....!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Second answer, lagi simple those managers are just sheer GONGKIA. I can bet with anyone of you that a manager who has never managed a premier league club can bring England to major tournaments. No joke, you or me also can.....no offence lah.....i know managerial duties are not as simple as what we thought they are, but when it comes to just selecting players, haha, even ah pek in kopitiam also can do lah.....dio boh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can't quite agree with Wegner regarding the 'Englishman for England' job, but I would have my doubts had Mourinho been confirmed as manager for England.<br><br>I'm not saying Mourinho is a bad manager, if he were manager, there's no doubt the players would have been playing with more passion and commitment than they have under Macgoreng. Moreover, tactically Mourinho is by no means a pushover, deemed boring by some but efficient football in itself is good football too. Besides, having been the high profile manager of Chelsea, he can definitely handle the english press.<br><br>The reason why I think him being England's manager might not be a good idea is because he might have burned too many bridges. See how many managers he has ticked off as Chelsea manager, the same managers who might be less willing to co-operate and release players for international duty. Even internally within FA, there are people who not only are less willing to help Mourinho but might even make things harder for him. I'm not saying Kelong or what, but as England manager, Mourinho is supposed to work together with the FA but there might already be bad blod there.<br><br>Mourinho as manager for England? Probably not now. Let things die down first.</div>
