              <h1>Top Gunners! Arsenal hit the front in title race but Bolton boss Owen Coyle rages at William Gallas 'assault'<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Arsenal went top of the Premier League after a stunning comeback
              against Bolton Wanderers - but their controversial equaliser drew
              criticism from Bolton boss Owen Coyle.</p>
              <p>Arsene Wenger’s side came
              from 2-0 down to thump four goals past Coyle’s men. They now lead the
              title race on goals scored from Chelsea, while Liverpool are up to
              sixth thanks to Dirk Kuyt’s double in a 2-0 win over Tottenham.</p>
              <p>The
              Gunners had referee Alan Wiley to thank for their 52nd-minute equaliser
              after the official waved play on despite a dreadful challenge by
              William Gallas on Mark Davies.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/01/20/article-0-07F1E9F9000005DC-13_468x417.jpg" alt="Coyle" width="468" height="417">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Fury: Coyle confronts referee Wiley at the end</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Coyle raged: ‘It was akin to assault and it changed the game.’</p>
              <p>With
              the Bolton player clutching his right ankle on the floor, Arsenal
              continued. Andrey Arshavin slipped a pass to Cesc Fabregas, who danced
              through the Bolton defence and hit a right-foot finish from a tight
              angle through Jussi Jaaskelainen’s legs.</p>
              <p>Davies left the field on a stretcher and had an X-ray last night to determine the extent of the damage.</p>
              <p>Bolton
              boss Coyle said: ‘It was not just a foul - probably closer to a red
              card. Arsenal, being full of fair play as we keep hearing, have carried
              on and scored on the break.</p>
              <p>‘It was a bad tackle. Gallas has
              touched absolutely none of that ball and he’s caught the boy. It was
              clear, the lad was clearly in agony.</p>
              <p>‘You know when you’ve caught
              somebody, but the only man who knows that is William Gallas. The
              referee said he never saw it. I was 40 yards away and I saw it. Maybe
              he was at a bad angle.’</p>
              <p>Arsenal boss Wenger condemned the home
              fans who jeered Davies as he was taken off the field and added: ‘I’m
              sorry if the tackle was not good and I apologise.</p>

              <p>‘But the players didn’t even know what was happening behind them.
              That’s why I don’t believe you can kick the ball out every time a
              player is down when you win the ball.</p>
              <p>That’s why they changed the rule. We got some big tackles, but we had to cope with it.<br>‘If it’s a foul, it’s a foul. It didn’t look dirty from the outside.’</p>
              <p>Conceding
              such a controversial equaliser affected Bolton, who had taken the lead
              after just seven minutes when Kevin Davies beat Thomas Vermaelen to a
              poor Gael Clichy clearance and Gary Cahill blasted the visitors ahead.</p>
              <p>Coyle’s
              side doubled their advantage after 28 minutes when a clumsy challenge
              by Denilson on Chung-Yong Lee gifted Bolton a penalty. Matthew Taylor
              duly converted the spot kick.</p>
              <p>But Tomas Rosicky started the
              Arsenal fightback just before half-time after Fabregas had escaped the
              shackles of his marker Fabrice Muamba to feed the right winger.</p>
              <p>Vermaelen then fired Arsenal ahead with a left-foot finish before Arshavin completed the win with five minutes left.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Arsenal defender Sol Campbell is suing Portsmouth for £1.7million in alleged unpaid image rights fees and bonuses.</p>

              <p>Pompey’s former captain, 35, claims the cash-strapped club owe him £1.67m, plus more than £60,000 in interest.</p>
              <p>Campbell’s
              writ was lodged with the High Court earlier this month. It claims
              Portsmouth agreed to pay him £20,000 a week for the first year, and
              £30,000 for the last two years of his contract, to use his image in
              commercial and sponsorship deals.</p>
              <p>In addition, Campbell
              should allegedly have received a £500,000 bonus for making 25
              appearances in Premier League and FA Cup games in 2008-09.</p>
              <p>Portsmouth confirmed receipt of the writ and a club spokesman said: ‘The matter is being dealt with by our lawyers.’</p>
