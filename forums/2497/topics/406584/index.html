              <p>Diego Maradona has left his post as Argentina boss after a unanimous vote from the Argentine Football Association.</p>
              <p>Maradona had been offered a new four-year contract but said he would
              only continue on condition that his backroom staff remained. He met
              with AFA president Julio Grondona on Monday, but the differences
              between the parties could not be resolved.</p>
              <p>Grondona revealed
              details of the talks to the board on Tuesday and AFA spokesman Ernesto
              Cherquis Bialo has now confirmed Maradona's deal will not be renewed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There was a big chasm that made it impossible to find an agreement,"
              he said. "We will not renew the contract. For the match against Spain,
              scheduled for September 7, we may already have the new coach.</p>
              <p>"It
              is difficult to agree. The hardest difference to agree on
              was changing some of Diego's staff. Nobody has been sacked. A contract
              has not been extended because the conditions were not the suitable.
              When you cannot agree with somebody you love, you are not happy at all.
              I always want to talk to him, but sometimes it is difficult because
              this is not the best moment.''</p>
              <p>Other
              AFA board members appeared less saddened by the situation, however.
              General secretary Jose Luis Meiszner told cable channel C5N: "I would
              be hypocrite if I didn't admit there was a general disliking of several
              aspects of the cycle that ended with the World Cup. We did not see any
              intention to show humility, to say things should have been done better.
              There was no evaluation, no review, no conclusions. These are the
              things you have to think about in order to think about the future.''</p>
              <p>Luis
              Segura, a member of the executive committee and former secretary of
              national teams, added: "He made it too difficult for us. He rejected
              all changes. Diego said he did not want any changes. That's unfair.''</p>
              <p>A
              statement on the AFA website added: "The president of the Argentinean
              Football Association, Mr Julio Grondona, made the members of the
              executive committee aware of the conversation with Mr Diego Maradona,
              setting out the points which had come out from the meeting.</p>
              <p>"The
              executive committee unanimously resolved not to renew the contract with
              Mr Diego Maradona as coach of the Argentina national football team."</p>
              <p>Maradona
              faced heavy criticism during his time in charge of the national side,
              with the team struggling during qualification for this summer's World
              Cup before exiting at the quarter-final stage with a 4-0 defeat to
              Germany.</p>
              <p>Grondona, though, had defended Maradona's performance in South Africa and suggested last week that he <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=809795&amp;sec=global&amp;cc=4716">expected him to remain in charge</a>.</p>
              <p>Estudiantes
              boss Alejandro Sabella, Racing Club's Miguel Angel Russo and Sergio
              Batista - currently in charge of the country's Under-20 side - are
              believed to be in the running for the position. Batista, who took
              Argentina's under-23 side to gold at the 2008 Olympics, will manage the
              team for the international friendly against the Republic of Ireland on
              August 11.</p>
              <p>Grondona suggested Batista might remain in charge for
              some time as no candidates were yet in the frame for the full-time
              position.</p>
              <p>"We have time to choose the technical staff,'' he said.
              "We have not thought about anybody yet. Batista is a member of the
              staff of this body so he will obviously fill the place as long as is
              needed.''</p>

              <h1>I was betrayed! Sacked Argentina boss Diego Maradona accuses former bosses of lying to him</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p143/zococl/Maradona.jpg"><img src="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p143/zococl/Maradona.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Diego Maradona has accused Argentinian Football Association president Julio Grondona and director of national teams Carlos Bilardo of forcing him out of his job as coach.</strong>  </p>
              <p>Maradona, whose side suffered a humiliating defeat by Germany in the quarter-finals of the World Cup this summer, met with Grondona on Monday to discuss his future and a possible renewal of his contract. </p>
              <p>He was told at the meeting the board were only prepared to keep him in if he changed substantial numbers of his backroom team, something Maradona was unprepared to do.  </p>
              <p>And the World Cup winner claims they knew full well it was a stipulation he would never agree to - and tantamount to sacking him.  </p>
              <p>Maradona read out a statement to reporters, saying: 'Grondona lied to me. Bilardo betrayed me.  'Having recovered from the sadness of the elimination, we were all ready to go on, knowing that we would have much more time to work.</p>
              <p>'After the elimination, Grondona told me in dressing room that he was very happy with my work and wanted me to continue. There were witnesses and players there.  'When we were back in Argentina, things became darker.</p>
              <p>'On Monday, I met Grondona and after five minutes he told me he wanted me to continue, but seven of my staff should not go on.</p>
              <p>'If he told me that, it meant he did not want me to keep working. 'He knows that it would be impossible for me to continue if my assistants didn't continue too. I defend all of them.</p>
              <p>'Maybe some of the people who made this decision thought I would betray them. Maybe it was because they would betray their assistants if they were me. But I will not do that.'</p>
