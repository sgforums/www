Klinsmann is keen on returning to Europe from California, where he now lives. And, though he turned down Chelsea, the chance to boss the Reds holds huge appeal for the former Tottenham striker and ex-Germany coach.</strong><br><br>SunSport understands Kop owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks like the wholesome profile Klinsmann has. And, though Klinsmann is very much his own man, he would be easier to keep in line than Benitez.<br><br>The SpaniardÂ’s relations with the American pair remain fragile Â— the manager wants to establish transfer targets in the January window but feels Gillett and Hicks have been dragging their heels. But Liverpool are feeling the squeeze and it is more likely Benitez will lose players rather than gain any.<br><br>They may not be able to turn Javier MascheranoÂ’s complicated loan deal into a permanent transfer. And Peter Crouch could also have to be sold without a replacement coming in. This is a critical week for Benitez. Having been beaten 3-1 at Reading on Saturday, Liverpool face a make-or-break Champions League game away to Marseille tomorrow which could see them knocked out of the competition.<br><br>The Merseysiders also host Manchester United on Sunday and Benitez is poised to have crunch talks with his bosses over the direction of the club. Though both sides have tried to play down the rift between them, relations remain on a knife-edge. Klinsmann has also been touted as a candidate for the England post Â— a job which interests him.<br><br>Over in the States, there is a belief he is preparing to move back to Europe and give up the Californian sunshine. Klinsmann wanted a break after taking Germany to the World Cup semi-finals on home soil last year. But he is now fully refreshed. A source close to Klinsmann said: Â“Jurgen is ready to get involved in football again. Â“He loves it in California but, when you are such a big figure in the game, you cannot stay away from it for ever.Â”<br><br>Kop striker Crouch insists his team-mates have the character to hit back against Marseille after losing to Reading. He said:: Â“The belief is still there. It was a blip against Reading. Â“If you look at the last few games weÂ’ve played some great football, scored a lot of goals and won games convincingly.<br><br>Â“We have enough characters in the dressing room that can bounce back from this and get a great result against Marseille.Â” The French side warmed up for tomorrowÂ’s Euro clash with a 2-0 win over Monaco. And midfielder Mathieu Valbuena, who scored the only goal when the teams met at Anfield in October, admitted: Â“We have to beware of Liverpool. Â“We caught them cold last time. We will be vigilant.Â”<br><br>Klinsmann looks like he is having constipation in that picture.  Only thing lacking is a toilet bowl behind him... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Both the fans and the players are behind him.Â”<br><br>SunSport revealed yesterday that Jurgen Klinsmann is ready to fill BenitezÂ’s boots if he gets the chop.<br><br>But the Spaniard said: Â“I donÂ’t think about losing. I only think about winning and I know how the team is. IÂ’ve never lost confidence we will get through.<br><br>Â“I always said we had to win our last three group games to get through.<br><br>Â“I am confident that the teamÂ’s make-up is right and I am confident we will go there and win the match.<br><br>Â“Watching these players looking happy and confident Â— that gives me confidence. Everything was wrong when we lost to Marseille at home.<br><br>Â“We were in a very bad situation and everyone said Â‘Forget it, itÂ’s a disasterÂ’. But now they say Â‘OK, maybe Liverpool can do itÂ’.<br><br>Â“We have the confidence we can. We can beat Marseille and go through.<br><br>Â“And for me the sporting achievement of that is more important than the money in the Champions League. Liverpool must always think to win Â— and if you win trophies the money comes afterwards.<br><br>Â“WeÂ’ve won other cups as well as the Champions League so we know how to play under pressure. If you want to win trophies you must play in finals Â— and for us this is a final.<br><br>Â“IÂ’ve said 100 times that we have enough experience of these kind of games. And I think we will play many more important ones this season because we will go through.Â”</div>
