              <p>He has done a great job at Chelsea... Unfortunately, not many chelsea fans can see this and still won't support him despite what he has done for the club... Many of these are actually more of a Mourinho fan than a chelsea fan... And its so silly that they are still comparing him with Mourinho...</p>
              <p>To be honest, mourinho's time wasn't too difficult to manage which explain why chelsea won the titles by mid Feb and Apr... Both Arsenal and Man Utd were going through a renewal process... Players like Fabregas, Flamini, Ronaldo, Rooney... were all still too young during those times... Today they have come of age.</p>
              <p>Grant's job is made much harder as present day, Drogba is already 30 yrs old and he is no longer the epl top scorer he was 2,3,4 yrs ago... There are also a few 30 or coming to 30s players at Chelsea now as well...</p>
              <p>During Mourinho's time... Only chelsea had the money to spend... the rest just make do with what little they had... But these days... Almost every club can afford a few million dollar player... Even Sunderland a newly promoted club could spend something like $20 to $30 million pounds in the transfer market... So you see how the premiership has changed...</p>
              <p>Chelsea fans should give Grant credit for what he has done... This season he has proved that he can do the job just as well if not better... The injury to key players and the ACN problems he had to take... He has done well.</p>
              <p>Last season when Mourinho had a few injury problems... He didn't know what to do except asking the owner to spend more despite already spending more than $80 million in June before the season started... And when the owner didn't oblige, he went around comparing egg prices in reference to the owner not willing to spend more... Grant didn't need to do that, he just got other players in to do the job... He is a good manager. Maybe Mourinho couldn't have done any better than him if he was still at Chelsea.</p>
              <p>And to those Chelsea fans who sang "you don't know what you are doing" during their match against gunners... Well, it seems they are the ones who don't know what they are saying...</p>

              <p>indeed, he really did a good job.....unlike JM, spend so much money to bring in so many player, but actually dunno how to use them! &amp; still keep complaining buying nt enough player....</p>
              <p>think he's plan to buy all the player to chelsea, so there's nt enough player for other teams to compete with Chelsea, then sure win de.... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Soo many stupid "tactical changes he made". Drawing 4-4 twice already this season, even conceding 4 goals at Stamford Bridge. Conceding goals to set pieces, not leaving defenders to guard the post during corners, wtf? that his version of attractive football? and the great run of 9 wins in a row, was that his style of playing? it was mostly 1-0s which was the old Mourinho team, and how did they beat Arsenal? again by playing long balls to Drogba something which was all so familiar.</p>
              <p>losing to spurs and barnsley. not being able to command the respect of the players. i don't need to say anymore. i still hope roman will hire a manager like hiddink or scolari in the summer.</p>

              <p><br>Shouldn't be a problem... Their second goal was a super shot... won't be able to do it again... And at Stamford Bridge... Surely Chelsea can win. Don't say 1 - 0, maybe even 4 - 0 possible.</p>

              <p>The second goal was a brilliant strike..and at a tight angle like that, it'll be rare for keepers who are out of position to be able to make a save... blame the defenders for not closing down on him sooner :P</p>
              <p>I just think Chelsea might be able to nick through in the return fixture.. but i think Fernabache is gonna defend like mad and probably go for a 4-5-1 and cross their fingers on a counter attack..</p>
