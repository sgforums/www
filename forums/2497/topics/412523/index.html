              <p><strong>Manchester City owner Sheikh Mansour has returned to the top of football's rich list, according to the latest figures from <em>FourFourTwo</em> magazine.</strong></p>
              <p> The 40-year-old's vast fortune is estimated to have risen by £3 billion, moving him back in front of QPR shareholder Lakshmi Mittal, whose fortune has dipped to £17 billion.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, whose wealth once dwarfed all other fortunes on the list, has now dropped as far as fourth - displaced by Arsenal shareholder Alisher Usmanov, whose estate has exploded to rise from £1.3 billion to £8 billion.</p>
              <p>"It's tempting to say that those who live by the rouble, die by the rouble," said <em>FourFourTwo</em> editor Hugh Sleight. "For so many years, Roman Abramovich was the top dog, but now he faces challenges wherever he looks.</p>
              <p>"It isn't that Abramovich has got poorer, but more and more billionaires are coming into English football. When we first published this list in 2003, there were two. Now there are 15."</p>
              <p>Usmanov's fellow Arsenal shareholder Stanley Kroenke is eighth on the list with a fortune of £1.85 billion, while Mittal's partner at QPR, Bernie Ecclestone, also makes it into the top 10 with his £1.4 billion estate.</p>
              <p>The controversial owners of Manchester United, the Glazer family, are ranked ninth with an estimated fortune of £1.53 billion.</p>
              <p>Others figuring in the top 10 are Southampton owners the Liebherr family, fifth with a fortune of £3 billion, Tottenham owner Joe Lewis, sixth at £2.7 billion, and Celtic's Denis O'Brien, seventh with a fortune of £1.87 billion.</p>
              <p>Tom Hicks and George Gillett, whose ownership of Liverpool could come to an end if the club's other directors are able to force through a sale, do not feature on this year's list at all.</p>
              <p>Having been listed joint 16th last year with an estimated £500 million each, analysts said it was now impossible to verify their worth as the turmoil continues at Anfield.</p>
              <p>Among players, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8880/David-Beckham"><span style="color: #000000;">David Beckham</span></a> still tops the list by a huge margin, but his worth is said to have dropped from £125 million to £100 million, pushing him from 38th overall to 49th. <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/21046/Wayne-Rooney"><span style="color: #000000;">Wayne Rooney</span></a>, meanwhile, has dropped from third to sixth.</p>
              <p>"For Beckham, missing the World Cup and approaching retirement have had an effect and we've cut his value by a fifth to £100million," Sleight said. As you'd expect, Brand Beckham have a cunning business plan to ensure their financial power continues even after Becks hangs up his boots, but that's still in its early stages and has yet to bear fruit. So for now, it's down to number 49 for Becks."</p>
              <p>Rooney has dropped beneath <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/7825/Rio-Ferdinand"><span style="color: #000000;">Rio Ferdinand</span></a>, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8049/Sol-Campbell"><span style="color: #000000;">Sol Campbell</span></a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8853/Ryan-Giggs"><span style="color: #000000;">Ryan Giggs</span></a>.</p>
              <p>"Wayne Rooney's flirtations with the front pages have clearly affected his value to sponsors and we correspondingly cut his value by a third," Sleight said. He's young and he has time to bounce back, on and off the pitch, but for the time being, his reputation has been seriously tarnished."</p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/7930/Michael-Owen"><span style="color: #000000;">Michael Owen</span></a> is second on the players' list with a fortune of £40 million, £6 million more than Manchester United team-mate Ferdinand.</p>
              <p>England boss <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=53"><span style="color: #000000;">Fabio Capello</span></a> tops the managers' list with a fortune of £36 million, ahead of Ipswich boss Roy Keane, whose £28 million fortune was largely accumulated as a player at Manchester United. He sits one place above his old boss, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=30"><span style="color: #000000;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></a>, third, with a fortune of £26 million.</p>
              <p>New Leicester boss Sven-Goran Eriksson is sixth with a £15 million fortune, level with Manchester City's <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=150"><span style="color: #000000;">Roberto Mancini</span></a>.</p>
              <p>That puts him £5 million ahead of his predecessor at Eastlands, Fulham manager <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=20"><span style="color: #000000;">Mark Hughes</span></a>, who is joint eighth with Tottenham boss <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=16"><span style="color: #000000;">Harry Redknapp</span></a> and Manchester United reserve-team boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>
              <p>The list once again demonstrates football's ability to ignore the recession as the overall value has risen to £77 billion, £8 billion higher than a year ago.</p>

It's not his fault that Newcastle didn't include a relegation clause automatically lowering the £70,000 weekly wage on a five-year deal with two seasons left to run when the Toon went down. Some might call his move to Fulham a desertion but considering he appears to have taken a £25,000 a week hit to sign at Craven Cottage, when many might have been tempted to count the coins up at Newcastle.</div>
              <div class="listitemtext w440"><br>Instead he moved back to the capital, putting his £3m Newcastle home up for sale. It didn't find a buyer so Duff has put it up for rent, to add to a property portfolio also including homes in London, the Caribbean and particularly heavy investment in Ireland. Duff also has an endorsement contract with Lucozade and his company Lightzest showed £1.1m net assets in 2008-09. But despite his share of £22m transfers (including a £17m move from Blackburn to Chelsea in 2003 and the £5m move to Newcastle in 2006) we only raise Duff slightly this year to £13m.<br><a href="http://fourfourtwo.com/clubs/fulham/news.aspx"><em><span style="color: #003366;">FourFourTwo.com's Fulham news page</span></em></a></div>

The Frenchman broke Liverpool's transfer record to sign Heskey from Leicester in 2000 for £11m, and when Heskey moved to Birmingham in summer 2004 the deal was structured so the initial £3.5m fee could have risen to £6.25m – another club record, although Blues escaped the final £1.5m payment by the simple method of getting relegated. Heskey stayed in the top flight by moving to Wigan for £5.5m – another club record – and in January 2009, with only six months left on his contract, he was sold to Villa for a further £3.5m.</div>
              <div class="listitemtext w440"><br>Heskey had earned £8.2m at Liverpool and Birmingham gave him a five-year contract worth £30,000 a week. Wigan raisd this to £40,000 a week and his Villa wage is thought to be closer to £35,000 a week. His company Emile Heskey Promotions had £379,000 net assets in 2008-09. In all Heskey's share of the transfer fees, his nine years at the top and a boot deal with Nike take him to £13m. Not bad for someone alleged to be a donkey.<br><a href="http://fourfourtwo.com/clubs/astonvilla/news.aspx"><em><span style="color: #003366;">FourFourTwo.com's Aston Villa news page</span></em></a></div>

John Terry has gone through tabloid scandal, widespread public condemnation, the loss of his England captaincy and the subsequent poor World Cup. Perhaps he's glad he stayed loyal to Chelsea by turning down the £250,000 weekly wage Manchester City offered; the club seems to be his home and he's hardly penniless on £160,000 a week with the right to a testimonial worth around £2.5m. <br></div>
              <div class="listitemtext w440">Endorsements, headed by Umbro, supplement his wages. But as with Rooney we are cautious about further promotional earnings due to the rough ride he has had in the tabloids.

He owns 60% of the White Chalk recording company which he hopes will help him realise his ambition to become a music mogul.

              <div class="listitemtext w440"> <br>His Owen Promotions company showed £6.8m net assets in 2008-09. He also has a string of racehorses trained by the up and coming Tom Dascombe. But with his lower income this year from his new Manchester United deal, we keep Owen at £40m.<br><a href="http://fourfourtwo.com/clubs/manchesterunited/news.aspx"><em><span style="color: #003366;">FourFourTwo.com's Manchester United news page</span></em></a></div>

              <h4 class="listitemtext w440">1. David &amp; Victoria Beckham £100m</h4>
              <div class="listitemtext w440"><em>Age 35 &amp; 36 (Last year £125m, 38th)<br></em>Tough times for the Beckhams – relatively speaking, of course. Reports that they are downsizing their large domestic retinue by 14 come after accountants have trawled over their finances. Their Hertfordshire mansion is on the market for £18m. And the Heat era's golden couple are finding that as Becks' football career draws to a close, sponsorship and other deals are becoming rarer and less lucrative. None of this will matter to Beckham half as much as Fabio Capello's brusque termination of his 117-cap England career.</div>
              <div class="listitemtext w440"> <br>Where did it all go wrong for the handsome multimillionaire global fashion icon with the cupboard full of medals? Beckham's four-year Real Madrid contract earned him £6m annually and was followed by a transatlantic move which made global news, even if the headline figure of £128m was partly misleading: a large part of it would flow from sponsorship deals and his ability to raise attendance at games.</div>
              <div class="listitemtext w440"> <br>With Victoria, Beckham is now clearly preparing for his life after football, launching fashion and cosmetics lines. In 2007, the Beckhams were reportedly paid $13.7m to launch his fragrance line in the US. They have their own company, Beckham Brand Limited, to exploit the family name. In 2008 its profits soared to £5.6m on £9.8m sales. In 2008, Beckham's own company, Footwork Productions paid him nearly £10.8m against £5.2m the year previously. The good news for David as his playing career winds down is that a quarter of his earnings come from Asia, driven more by his iconic status than his football performance: Forbes magazine's celebrity 100 list last year put Beckham's worldwide earnings at £28m. But while he has a £10m a year from adidas, some deals have ended and the very lucrative ones depend on his continuing as a top-class player.</div>
              <div class="listitemtext w440"> <br>For her part, Victoria has made £10m from her Spice Girl days and is making more from musicals and a TV career, but her real future earnings will come from her fashion range. Her fourth collection has won global praise and been sold out at top stores. The business “funds itself” but is not yet a real moneyspinner. With annual living costs of £5m a year, the Beckham family wealth and asset wealth is around £80m. In the past their wealth figure has been boosted by their value as a brand, but until we see how that pans out, we cautiously cut the value of the pair to £100m for now.<br></div>
