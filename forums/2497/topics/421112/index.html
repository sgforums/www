              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span><span style="color: #000000;"> are confident of completing the transfer of David Luiz from </span><span style="color: #000000;">Benfica</span><span style="color: #000000;"> within the next 48 hours, with the fee of around £21.5m their biggest outlay on a player since Andriy Shevchenko's £30m arrival from Milan five years ago.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The centre-half's signing is part of an attempt by </span><span style="color: #000000;">Carlo Ancelotti</span><span style="color: #000000;"> to salvage Chelsea's season after the manager admitted before tonight's game at </span><span style="color: #000000;">Bolton Wanderers</span><span style="color: #000000;"> that</span> his team have failed to marry a positive performance and result for almost four months. The champions have not won away in seven matches but Ancelotti goes back even further, to the game at home to Arsenal on 3 October, to pinpoint a good display that yielded victory.</p>
              <p>That win had moved Chelsea clear at the top of the Premier League but their worst run of form in 15 years has left them trailing the leaders, Manchester United, by 10 points and effectively forced them into the transfer market. Talks will resume today with Benfica's president, Luís Filipe Vieira, aimed at securing Luiz, with the possibility remaining that a young player could move in the opposite direction, most likely on loan, as part of the deal.</p>
              <p>The defenders Jeffrey Bruma or Patrick van Aanholt have been mentioned and Chelsea could explore involving as a makeweight the Serbia defender Slobodan Rajkovic, who is on loan at Vitesse Arnhem but does not qualify for a work permit in England. An agreement with Benfica is edging closer after Vieira spent the weekend in London, along with Luiz's agent, Giuliano Bertolucci.</p>
              <p>Luiz was omitted from the Benfica squad for the 4-2 victory over Nacional on Saturday, a clear indication that his club are resigned to losing his services. Chelsea had drawn up a list of alternative targets, believed to include Wolfsburg's Denmark international Simon Kjaer, but are confident they will be able to announce Luiz's eye-catching purchase this week.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti will be anxious that the 23-year-old Brazil international, who will be cup-tied in the Champions League, is joining a club who can still realistically retain the Premier League title. Given that the Italian envisages 80 points will be needed to secure the championship – which would mean Chelsea could drop only six more from their final 16 games – a win tonight is imperative.</p>
              <p>Asked to identify the last time he had been satisfied with his team's display and the result, Ancelotti said: "Against Arsenal at home, when we played well. I was happy with the way we played at Birmingham last month but not with the result [a 1-0 defeat]. Three and a half months is too long. Too long."</p>
              <p>Chelsea, who will be without Frank Lampard with the midfielder's minor calf complaint not to be risked, can take some solace in the fact that they are still to play United twice, as well as Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur at home.</p>
              <p>"We play them and Liverpool at home, and those five games will be key," Ancelotti said. "We have to win them. But the fact that there are five teams going for the title is good for those of us chasing. There is more competition, and therefore more possibility for the teams at the top to drop points. We will try everything to do win the three competitions we are still in."</p>
              <p>Ancelotti, who has given the go-ahead for the talks to continue with Fulham over Gaël Kakuta moving there on loan for the rest of the season, admitted he had "made some mistakes" that had contributed to the side's dip in form over the last few months, though he believes the points deficit from United can be clawed back if his team achieve consistency over the second half of the season. He has experience of chasing down a leader as Roma's captain in 1986, albeit that campaign had a sting in its tail.</p>
              <p>"I remember that year we needed to close a gap of eight points, with two points for a win, to Juventus over the last two months of the season and we achieved it," said Ancelotti.</p>
              <p>"We arrived at the last game level with Juve and had to play Lecce, the team at the bottom, at home. The Lecce manager, Eugenio Fascetti, said before the match that he hated Juventus and was a Roma fan, and there was almost a celebration before the match as if everything would be OK. We ended up losing 3-2 and Juventus went on to win the title. Everything went dark. Such is life."</p>

              <p>The Blues made an improved £23million offer and included Serbian midfielder Nemanja Matic, 22, in the deal.</p>
              <p>But once again the Portuguese club rebuffed Chelsea's interest in their Brazilian defender.</p>
              <p>Benfica are asking for £30m but Chelsea will not go that far so fear the deal is dead.</p>
              <p>A Chelsea insider said: "The club made an improved offer and included Matic in the hope they could finally clinch a deal.</p>
              <p>"But Benfica said again that they weren't interested, wanted much more, so it looks pretty bleak."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Udinese bigwig Fabrizio Larini claims Chelsea and Manchester United are eyeing Chile winger Alexis Sanchez, 22.</p>
              <p>Sporting director Larini said: "Sanchez is a versatile player, with much room for improvement.</p>
              <p>"Chelsea and United? They are two clubs that have followed him and want him but there are also others."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Benfica have issued a statement saying that defender David Luiz will not be moving to Chelsea.</p>

              <p>Luiz,
               a Brazilian international, has been linked with a move to Stamford 
              Bridge for weeks, with the latest rumours suggesting that only £1 
              million stood between the two clubs agreeing a deal.</p>
              <p>Luiz had been
               valued at £25 million by Benfica, but Chelsea's highest bid reached 
              just £21.3 million and, with only three days left before the end of the 
              January transfer window, the talks have now been ended.</p>
              <p>A 
              statement on the Benfica website read: "Negotiations between Benfica and
               Chelsea over the possible transfer of David Luiz reached a conclusion 
              today without the parties having reached an agreement.</p>
              <p>"Contrary to reports in recent days, David Luiz never tried to force his way out of the club and is a model professional."</p>
              <p>The Portuguese club added that they would be happy to keep the defender for the foreseeable future.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chelsea </span>are on the brink of completing a deal for defender David Luiz after Benfica revealed only the finer points of the deal are being haggled over.</strong></p>
              <p>A statement from the Portuguese side revealed they had received an offer from the Blues, suggesting it was only a matter of time before the deal was concluded.</p>
              <p>The statement said: 'A negotiation process is currently ongoing and the market will be informed when it is completed.'</p>
              <p>Following the release, local media claimed a fee, believed to be around £26million, had been agreed during a meeting in London on Saturday. Only differences over payment installments remained to be sorted.</p>
              <p>Benfica's hard stance had threatened to derail a transfer that has been rumbling on since the summer. The Lisbon club were unhappy at Chelsea's attempts to include fringe players such as Paulo Ferreira and Nemanja Matic in a part-exchange deal.</p>
              <p>The 23-year old centre-back played a full part in training near the team hotel on Wednesday and featured throughout a 2-0 cup win last night against Rio Ave.</p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>Luiz has a contract with Benfica that runs until 2015 and is one of the most promising defenders in Europe.</strong></p>
              <p>He arrived in Lisbon from Brazil in 2007 and was a key member of the Benfica side that last season clinched the Portuguese Premier League title for the first time in five years, missing only one of 30 league matches.</p>
              <p>His performances earned him a call-up to the Brazil squad for a friendly against the United States in August. He also played against Iran and Ukraine in October and is in the squad for the Feb. 9 friendly in France.</p>
              <p>Former Everton and Liverpool defender Abel Xavier is in no doubt he would prove value for money, after catching the attention of several leading clubs in the Barclays Premier League over the past two seasons.</p>
              <p>'I had a great time in English football,' he said. 'I know what it is all about and what the demands are, and I have no doubt that David would be a great success at Chelsea.</p>
              <p>'First of all, he is a very good defender, but he is also comfortable on the ball and would contribute a lot, in terms of turning defence into attack.</p>
              <p>'He is still young, too, and will carry on improving and developing, as he gains more experience. I think he will prove a great asset for Chelsea. He is just what they need.'</p>

              Benfica have issued a statement to the Portuguese stock exchange saying they have called off talks with Chelsea over David Luiz. 
                      
                      
                      
                      The two clubs have been locked in negotiations for the past week, and they had looked very close to striking a deal. It is understood the main stumbling block has been how any transfer would be paid for, and now Benfica have seemingly decided to end the talks.
              Benfica issued the following statement: The negotiations between Benfica and Chelsea F.C with regard to the potential transfer of David Luiz, were concluded today without the parties reaching an agreement.
                  
              Benfica are happy to be able to keep in their ranks a player with the sporting quality and moral shown by David Luiz. Unlike some news that had come up these last few days, David Luiz never tried to force his exit, he is an exemplary professional, worthy of the shirt he wears.

              <p><br>Liverpool has done just that on Suarez...offered 12.5million and negotiate from there. Ajax was asking for 30milion.</p>
              <p>But people say the owner no sense of urgency, cheapskate but I really think that is the way of running a football club (like a business). Wenger will agree with me for sure.</p>
