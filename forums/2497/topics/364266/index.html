              *Internazionale set for Ricardo Carvalho and Deco bids*
              .
              
              â€¢ Inter president says negotiations with Chelsea are under way
              â€¢ Chances of reunion with Jose Mourinho in Milan are likely
              .
              .
              
              *The Internazionale president, Massimo Moratti, has confirmed the club is in negotiations with Chelsea over Deco and Ricardo Carvalho.*
              
              The Portugal internationals both played for Jose Mourinho at Porto in the Champions League-winning side of 2004 and Carvalho was an important part of Mourinho's Chelsea side that won successive Premier League titles in 2005 and 2006. After a difficult season at Stamford Bridge, they have indicated that they would welcome the chance for a reunion at Inter.
              
              "[Jose] Mourinho has asked us for Deco and Carvalho and we are working towards making him happy," Moratti told Gazzetta dello Sport. "Our wish is to sign both players and I have seen that the players' intention is to join us. We still haven't reached an agreement with Chelsea but I think we will do in a short time.
              
              "We are interested in Carvalho primarily for the Champions League. He has the right experience, he is calm under pressure and brings experience in the defensive line. Our coach has guaranteed quality and I have every intention to make him happy. Deco will have two tasks: to do well immediately and to help [Brazilian player Philippe] Coutinho mature as a player. Coutinho will arrive next season [from Vasco de Gama] and plays in the same role as Deco."
              
              Moratti, meanwhile, has also placed a â‚¬90m price tag on the Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who has been linked with a move away from the San Siro, with Barcelona, Chelsea and Real Madrid among the clubs reportedly keen.
              
              "If it is true that Bayern Munich have placed a â‚¬70m tag on [Franck RibÃ©ry], then I will need to ask a minimum of â‚¬90m [for Ibrahimovic]," added Moratti, who admitted holding meetings last week with his Barcelona counterpart Joan Laporta, although no agreement was reached between both parties. "If we are talking about Barcelona I think Laporta is far away from the mega-investment policy that Real Madrid have made so far," he said. "I reiterate that I would gladly keep Ibrahimovic. Ibrahimovic is at Inter and Ibrahimovic is the best, in my opinion."

              <p>There like: Alex, Ivanovic, Mancienne that can cover the position....</p>

              Deco won't be a loss but Carvalho will... I rate him a better defender than even Alex or Terry... He reads the game really well. He is like what Rio is to United... Chelsea will miss his calming influence if he leave... Cos I don't see another in their team of defenders who possess this quality... Guus seem to like Alex as I guess they know each other since their PSV days... And Carvalho besides being injured for like half of Guus 4 months in charge also probably felt Scolari's departure more than the rest... 
              
              Inter is getting not just a very good defender, a calming influence that every good defence need if they manage to get him...

              But talented central defenders careers usually last longer than most as they don't need to run too much... Carvalho is like one of those defenders who doesn't need to have lots of speed, his reading of the game makes up the speed part not that he is currently slow... Rio is also about the same age and is still going very well... Tony Adams played till he was 36 yrs old for Arsenal... Laurent Blanc joint United at 36 yrs old and played 2 full years till he was 38... Paolo Maldini is only retiring now that he is 40...  
              
              So I belief Carvalho still have about 3 more years at the top level...

              *Chelsea to hold out for Â£12m for Deco and Carvalho*
              .
              .
              
              *Chelsea will demand at least Â£12million before they consider selling Portuguese duo Deco and Ricardo Carvalho to former Blues boss Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan.*
              
              Incoming Stamford Bridge chief Carlo Ancelotti is prepared to sacrifice the pair if the right money is offered, despite his animosity towards Inter coach Mourinho.
              
              Ancelotti will also listen to offers for fellow Portuguese full-back Paulo Ferreira and possibly Dutch striker Salomon Kalou, while Andriy Shevchenko's unwelcome return to the club complicates financial matters.
              
              But there will be no fire sale with Chelsea determined to recoup as much as they can in advance of the summer spending spree which owner Roman Abramovich has promised Ancelotti.
              
              Inter president Massimo Moratti confirmed the San Siro outfit's interest in Deco and Carvalho - as well as Mourinho's desire to add Didier Drogba to his squad.
              
              Moratti said: "The coach has asked for Deco and Carvalho and we have moved to satisfy him.
              
              "We would like to sign them both and I have seen that the players' desire is to come here, too. We have yet to reach an agreement, but we will find it soon.
              
              "Mourinho and I also like Didier Drogba. At the end of the transfer market we will be on the same level as Barcelona and Real Madrid. Our four consecutive titles have increased the feelings of revenge in our rivals.
              
              "We have the chance to make history now, but it's better not to talk about it."

              *Inter Target Ricardo Carvalho Critical Of Chelsea's Medical Care*
              .
              
              The Portuguese could be attempting to pave his way toward a transfer to Internazionale...
              .
              .
              
              *Ricardo Carvalho has slammed the medical care at Chelsea, and has revealed that he is "disappointed" with the attitude shown toward him while he was injured. Such a declaration could be an attempt to help seal a switch to Internazionale, as Carvalho claims his time at Stamford Bridge "has come to an end."*
              
              He told the Daily Star, "I believe my time at Chelsea has come to an end and I'm very happy a big club like Inter are interested in me. It's a new challenge and I'd like to play in Italy."
              
              "I've been at Chelsea for five years, and four of them were very good, but this last season I spent a lot of time out injured. I wasn't happy and Chelsea can't have been happy with my contribution.
              
              "Furthermore, when I was injured the club should have given me more support. They should have helped me more, especially given my past four years at Chelsea. Their attitude disappointed me a little." 
              
              Regarding his former mentor Jose Mourinho, whom he believed to be a father figure in the footballing world, Carvalho said, "Mourinho's a coach who knows me better than anybody. Together we won big trophies. He's an ambitious coach and a perfectionist.
              
              "Let's see if the clubs can reach an agreement. I'd love to work with Jose Mourinho again."
              
              Inter are also interested in Deco, and the Portuguese pair could leave Chelsea for a combined fee as low as Â£12 million.
