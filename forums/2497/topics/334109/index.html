              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">SEEING Wayne Rooney destroying Belarus the other night was just like watching Paul Gascoigne all over again. But there is one crucial difference between these working-class geniuses... Rooney can cope with all the hype and expectations created by his talent. </h2>
              <p class="article">I didn’t really get to know Wayne that well during my recent time as England coach but I always found him to be a polite, respectful young man. He’s not the sort of bloke who seeks the limelight. You’ll never see him courting publicity or willingly volunteering to talk to the media. Yet he’s relaxed and confident when he’s with his pals and can be the joker in that group. </p>
              <p class="article">Gazza was very similar in many ways, but much more of an extrovert. He hogged the whole show ... on and off the pitch. He wanted to make everyone laugh and be loved by everyone. Rooney is happy just being accepted by his colleagues. He has handled his fame very well and, though he is more than capable of expressing himself in the papers and on TV, that’s not what he’s about. </p>
              <p class="article">Anyway, his performances on the pitch are worth a million words. That’s why he is so popular among his England pals. Players don’t like big-heads and Rooney gives far more back to the group than he takes from it. </p>
              <p class="article">A lot of really special talents believe they don’t have to put in a shift for the team because they are supplying the magic. Wayne’s work ethic is not just impressive, it’s startling. In fact, some people believe he works <strong>TOO</strong> hard, particularly in areas of the pitch where he’s not supposed to be. </p>
              <p class="article">But the fact is he can handle that workload and it doesn’t detract from his effectiveness. He’s not happy unless he feels he’s pulling his weight. Like Gazza, he has that schoolboy’s enthusiasm for the game. Watch him in training and he’s like a little boy in the playground. </p>
              <p class="article">His current form for England is the best we’ve seen since Euro 2004. The reason for his resurgence is because he’s fit, healthy and enjoying a regular run of games. Because he’s built like a boxer — short and stocky — it’s more important for him to be the right weight and have proper fitness. Taller, leaner players tend to come back from injury quicker. </p>
              <p class="article">Some talented players, especially forwards, can be kicked out of a game by defenders. But this lad is no shrinking violet — he’ll come back every time. Yes, he does have a short fuse and he does flare up at times. But he’s not a nasty person. It’s all very well telling him to calm down but that’s like saying you shouldn’t go ‘Ouch’ when you hit your thumb with a hammer. </p>
              <p class="article">So it’s down to referees to spot what is going on and protect these special talents. In any case, you can live with the occasional red mist because it’s the only flaw in an otherwise magnificent player. </p>
              <p class="article">His partnership with Emile Heskey is really blossoming and that’s because they’re not selfish. They are both just as happy to set up a team-mate as they are to stick the ball in the net themselves. With the players Fabio Capello has in his squad, England have seven or eight potential scorers. </p>
              <p class="article">We’ve already scored 14 goals in four qualifiers. Heskey hasn’t got any of them but it doesn’t affect him because he knows his contribution is appreciated by his colleagues. </p>
              <p class="article">Right now, Rooney is banging them in like there is no tomorrow. But he would honestly be just as happy not to score as long as the team is winning. And that is what makes him so special. </p>
