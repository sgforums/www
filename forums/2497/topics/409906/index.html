              <p><strong>Defender Jamie Carragher accepts Liverpool's best chance of silverware this season will come in cup competitions as they have too much ground to make up on the likes of title-contenders Chelsea and Manchester United.</strong></p>
              <p>The Reds slipped to their lowest Barclays Premier League finish - seventh - for a decade last season.</p>
              <p>With increased pressure from big-spending Manchester City this campaign their priority has to be securing a place in the top four to get them back into the Champions League.</p>
              <p>A championship title, which Carragher has never won in his 14-year professional career at Anfield, will probably have to wait.</p>

              <p>"People have said 'You've done this and that for Liverpool' but we've not won a trophy for four years and that is annoying me a little bit," said the 32-year-old.</p>
              <p>"I certainly don't want to go on another couple of years not winning one before I finish at Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"I don't see any reason why we can't win a trophy this season or the next couple.</p>
              <p>"The one I haven't won is the league but I suppose that will be very difficult this season going from seventh last season.</p>
              <p>"But I see no reason why we can't have a good go and have a trip to Wembley."</p>

Gerrard probably more so as he was seen as one of the best at his time during his illustrious career.

              <p>The former England defender, 32, had cause to fret over his Liverpool future towards the end of last season as he approached the final 12 months of his four-year Anfield deal without any hint of a new offer from manager Rafa Benitez.</p>
              <p>But a change of manager this summer signalled a change of fortune for Carragher.</p>
              <p>As he prepared for his testimonial against Everton on Saturday, Carragher said: 'We'll come up with something on the contract situation in the next week or two.'</p>

              <p><br>How so better? They are probably further away then Owen in their current state than at anytime of their careers.</p>
              <p>At least even if it all ends today, Owen still have an individual title of being crowned European Footballer of the year in his own right to his name... Something which will always be in the record books and can never be taken away from him for the rest of his life... He will always be mentioned together with the likes of <span style="color: #000000;">Platini</span><span style="color: #000000;">, V</span><span style="color: #000000;">an Basten</span><span style="color: #000000;">, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Jean-Pierre Papin</span><span style="color: #000000;">, Rummenigge, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Ruud Gullit</span><span style="color: #000000;">, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Roberto Baggio, Ronaldo, Zidane, Figo, Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi etc...</span></p>
              <p>And I guess it's even more greater than a winner's medal by itself when you think about it... There are about 30 medals handed out each year to the winners, and there are about 5 major leagues and a lot more lesser ones. But their is only one European Footballer of the year being honoured each year.</p>
              <p>And also, he is the only English player to be honoured for it in the last 30 yrs... That must be worth something is't it? Or a great deal more?</p>
