              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Rafael Benítez" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/rafael-benitez"><span style="color: #005689;">Rafael Benítez</span></a> forced a smile afterwards but his customary touchline pantomime – the dissatisfied grimaces, the dismissive shrugs, the odd little shapes he makes with his hands – had carried an extra edge of exasperation and frustration during Saturday's match. A man accustomed to scrutiny during his five years on Merseyside is now seriously on trial.</p>
              <p>If it is indeed true, as a few newspapers reported yesterday, that Tom Hicks Sr and George Gillett have finally managed to identify a Middle Eastern investor willing to fork out £100m in exchange for a 25% holding in <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Liverpool" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><span style="color: #005689;">Liverpool</span></a> FC, then the US owners' undeserved stroke of luck would enable them to prioritise the removal of what is coming to appear the biggest obstruction to the club's progress. With a proportion of that new money – perhaps £20m, but almost certainly rather less after the lawyers had done their talking – they would be able to pay up the 4½ years remaining on Benítez's contract and send their manager on his way.</p>
              <p>Liverpool's travelling fans cheered Benítez off the field on Saturday, at the end of a game in which Stoke City snatched a draw with a late equaliser. This was not a genuine salute as much as a sign of defiance aimed partly against the Potters' supporters, who had consistently managed to drown the noise coming from the away end, but mostly at an outside world which is looking at the club and seeing only the signs of a sudden decline with serious long-term implications.</p>
              <p>There can be little doubt that the wrong people are in charge at Anfield, which makes it hard to be optimistic that the right decisions will be taken. Somebody, however, has to do something about what is going on in the name of the club of Shankly, Paisley and Dalglish, where Benítez's haphazard recruitment policy and cut-and-paste method of selection seem inadequate to meet the challenge presented by the prospect of a barren season.</p>
              <p>The unease was underlined by the debut of the winger Maximiliano Rodríguez, a useful Argentina international in his time but now, at 29, seemingly fallen far from the highest standards of his seven years in La Liga and apparently picked up by Benítez at no cost, with no guarantee that he will do any better than the dismal parade of wingers who have trooped in and out of Anfield during the last five years. The failure of so many of Benítez's mid-level acquisitions to leave a mark on the club reinforces the suspicion that, unlike several Premier League managers with more limited resources at their disposal, he takes moderately gifted players and makes them worse.</p>
              <p>In Benítez's opinion the Britannia Stadium is not the place for a Premier League debut, so Rodríguez was left on the bench until the 78th minute. His first contribution was to barge into Salif Diao in the centre circle, his second to overhit a through ball for Dirk Kuyt, his third and last to make such a cumbersome job of controlling a fine pass from Alberto Aquilani that he was easily dispossessed.</p>
              <p>Aquilani himself had not appeared until the 88th minute, omitted from the starting line-up because Benítez feared the effects of playing 120 minutes against Reading in midweek. The £20m Italian began the season with an injury, but this was another example of Benítez's sometimes bizarre attitude to his players. Given the chronic absence of creativity caused by the departure of Xabi Alonso, the Italian should be starting games at every possible opportunity, even if he cannot complete them. In his few minutes against Stoke, a couple of measured passes on the counter-attack gave a glimpse of what his team-mates had been missing.</p>
              <p>Should half a season of poor performances be enough to invalidate Liverpool's second place in the Premier League last season, not to mention the previous successes under his aegis in the European and FA Cups, and to override patience? The case for the prosecution is hard to dispute when Benítez's side play with so little coherence, and attempts to defuse the sense of crisis by pointing to the absences of Steven Gerrard, Fernando Torres and Yossi Benayoun are not persuasive.</p>
              <p>For several weeks earlier this season Manchester United lost not one but two complete defences. Arsenal have been coping without Robin van Persie, Nicklas Bendtner, Gaël Clichy and sometimes their key player, Cesc Fábregas. Chelsea are currently without four big performers, including Didier Drogba and Michael Essien, all temporarily lost to the Africa Cup of Nations. These things happen at the top level of modern football, and it is part of the manager's job to ensure that life goes on undisturbed.</p>
              <p>A deeper, darker problem, however, may be an erosion of whatever warmth and empathy may have existed between Benítez and his squad. Great coaches are seldom interested in being best friends with their players, but most of them cultivate the quantum of warmth that generates and sustains mutual loyalty. For Benítez, however, that loyalty may be stronger on the terraces than in the dressing room. If Liverpool fail to secure a place in next season's Champions League, the rumours currently swirling around Gerrard may prove to have substance, and the captain would surely be followed out of the club by Torres and Javier Mascherano. By then any attempt to rebuild Liverpool, at least on the current foundations, would be too late.</p>
