              <p class="excerpt">Emmanuel Adebayor will miss the Manchester derby after not appealing the violent conduct charge lodged against him by the FA.</p>
              <p>Adebayor had until 6pm to respond to the charge and in accepting it, has effectively condemned himself to a three-match ban.</p>
              <p>The FA's disciplinary panel will formally sit in judgement tomorrow. But the punishment for such offences is automatic and it seems unlikely there will be any change in that stance.</p>
              <p>City knew there was little point in contesting the case once referee Mark Clattenburg confirmed he would have sent Adebayor off if he had seen the Manchester City forward's challenge on Robin van Persie.</p>
              <p>The Dutchman sustained a cut to the head and launched a fierce attack on his former team-mate, who he claimed had acted in a "malicious" manner.</p>
              <p>Arsene Wenger weighed into the debate as well yesterday, and with wider opinion lined up against him, it was futile for Adebayor to take the matter further.</p>
              <p>City have another few days before they decide whether to contest the improper conduct charge brought against Adebayor for his ill-advised goal celebration in front of the Gunners' supporters at Eastlands.</p>
              <p>Although Manchester United's Gary Neville was fined £5,000 for a similar offence in a match against Liverpool at Old Trafford in 2003, the FA do have the power to suspend players for such behaviour.</p>
              <p>And, as both Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore and FA counterpart Ian Watmore have both spoken out against the reaction, which left the Greater Manchester Police fuming, leniency cannot be guaranteed.</p>
              <p>Providing the FA confirm a three-match ban tomorrow, Adebayor will miss the encounter with United on Sunday, the Carling Cup tie with Fulham next Wednesday and a Premier League meeting with West Ham on September 28.</p>
              <p>Any additional suspension would start with the trip to Aston Villa, which would rule Adebayor out of domestic action until October 18, when City travel to local rivals Wigan.</p>
              <p>It leaves City boss Mark Hughes facing a striker crisis this weekend, with only Craig Bellamy of his front-line forwards likely to be available.</p>
              <p>Robinho, Roque Santa Cruz and Benjani have already been consigned to the injured list and Carlos Tevez is rated extremely doubtful to face his old club.</p>
              <p>In addition, City had a scare over Micah Richards earlier this week when the young defender was forced to miss two days' training after going down with a bout of tonsillitis.</p>
              <p>Thankfully, Richards' symptoms have now eased, which should allow him to face Sir Alex Ferguson's men, along with Stephen Ireland, who is optimistic about his recovery from an ankle injury that forced him to be replaced at half-time in Saturday's win against Arsenal.</p>

              <p>neville got a fine and wasn't banned when he did something similar to the 'pool fans some time ago.. so i think just a fine unless the FA wants to make an example of him..</p>
              <p>i still think one incident in one game, you can give a warning and maybe some light punishment..</p>
              <p>two.. you get the guy badly..</p>
              <p>but THREE incidents?? throw the book and then some.. because there is a premeditation of malice in there..</p>
              <p>you can't say there's a 'red haze' because it's throughout the match..</p>
              <p>i'm not really a fan of any club but shit like what ade did, deserves the most severe of punishment.. it's bloody like some kind of pro-wrestling battle royale going on</p>

              <p>i think Mark has all the right to protect his player before any trial, it is not wrong, imagine if he said in public, ya ade is wrong and he is not professional enuf, you think the next time Ade plays, he will be at his best...?? So public relationship is critical for a team manager, he must know where he stands, as for the trial, it is not his one man show, the whole Man city management accepted it, they dun want to mess up with FA and prolong this inquiries that will affect their games, so 3 matches ban, so be it. But Man city still is not convince about it.</p>

              <p>so why drag when the FA is against you, the ref is against you and the public is very much against you. Just take the ban and move on as a professional club do, no apologise given</p>

              <p class="article">Speaking for the first time about Adebayor's antics during last weekend's defeat at Manchester City, the Arsenal skipper lifted his tracksuit bottom to reveal a nasty three-inch gash across his right calf.</p>
              <p class="article">That was the result of an X-rated Adebayor tackle and, pointing to the wound just above the ankle, Fabregas said: "I think this is a red card here. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that was from Adebayor."</p>
              <p class="article">The £25million City striker's shameful kick in Robin van Persie's face marred the match and earned him a three-game ban.</p>

              <p class="article"><strong>But his tackle on Fabregas could have left the midfielder with a broken ankle and Fabregas, 22, was keen to make the point. He added: "I was lucky my foot was in the air when it happened. You know this is football and it can happen. Well... it's not football but it can happen."</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Gunners boss Arsene Wenger blasted Adebayor's behaviour but Fabregas' gesture revealed the level of resentment towards their one-time team-mate.</p>
              <p class="article">Fabregas added: "All I tried to do when he was at Arsenal was to create opportunities for him to score.</p>
              <p class="article">"So I think I didn't do too badly for him. I don't know. It is a bit strange. We don't think about him any more. He doesn't play for Arsenal so we just have to concentrate on our game and our players."</p>
              <p class="article">Adebayor, who quit the Emirates in bitter fashion this summer, is also facing a further ban from the FA after running the full length of the pitch to celebrate his goal - City's third in the 4-2 win - in front of the angry Arsenal fans.</p>
              <p class="article">It sparked a furious reaction from the away supporters and was heavily criticised in many quarters.</p>
              <p class="article">Fabregas said: "No, there's never been another player who left and behaved like this. "I have no idea why he did this. We always respected him, you know. It is difficult. He will have his own opinions. You have to ask him that. I don't really know."</p>
              <p class="article">The Arsenal star also refused to be drawn on speculation Adebayor, 25, had become isolated in the Arsenal dressing room. And he insisted: "Let's just move forward. If this is true or not it just stays in the dressing room."</p>
              <p class="article">Even Emmanuel Eboue, a close pal of Adebayor, rounded on his fellow African star. Last season, Togo striker Adebayor put a consoling arm around the shoulder of a tearful Eboue when the Ivory Coast ace was subbed against Wigan after a section of disgruntled Arsenal fans booed the defender.</p>
              <p class="article">Now, in the week when Wigan visit the Emirates again, Eboue did not mince his words about his pal. He said: "Adebayor didn't do well and that is no good for football because you have a lot of young people who watch the game.</p>
              <p class="article">"But I am happy because the FA gave him a three-game ban. I know him and he will think about what has happened and will take it on.I am very disappointed about it, very disappointed."</p>
              <p class="article">Eboue has not spoken to Adebayor since last Saturday and may never speak to him again unless the City man calls to offer his apologies.</p>
              <p class="article">Former Gunner Kolo Toure, who followed Adebayor to Eastlands, felt compelled to go to the Arsenal dressing room and apologise.</p>
              <p class="article">Eboue added: "I haven't spoken to him since Saturday because I am very disappointed in him, it was a bad thing to do.</p>
              <p class="article">"In the dressing room, we were very disappointed because we don't know what happened to Adebayor.</p>
              <p class="article">"When he was in our team, we were together, we did everything together and so we don't know what happened.</p>
              <p class="article">"Kolo came into our dressing room and he said sorry to everyone and that was very nice. "If Adebayor calls me, I'll speak with him. If he calls me, I'll say, 'Thank you, God.'</p>
              <p class="article">"If he doesn't call me, that's his problem. I think about my team."</p>

              <p>mark hughes initially stated there is nothing malicious about

              <p>in that case, mark hughes can just cool the matter and say,

              <p>now he accepted the banned meaning he is contridicting his

              eduardo, trusted him, go all the way with him to UEFA, the banned
              was lifted. innocent by forensic judgement. that will just shut

              <p>i can understand what arsenal fans are frustrated.</p>
              <p>1. arsenal fans pay the highest tickets fees.</p>
