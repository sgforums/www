The Sun says Mourinho had become increasingly frustrated by Terry's recent performances. And he had even raised the issue with the club's medical department to see if they had an explanation.</strong><br><br>But when centre-back Terry heard what Mourinho had done he reacted furiously. And the England star had heated exchanges with the Blues boss before and after Tuesday's dire 1-1 Champions League draw at home to minnows Rosenborg.<br><br>A club source revealed: "News of their row reached the club's directors, who were concerned it was proof that Jose was losing the dressing room."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>CHELSEA have released a letter to their fans concerning the exit of boss Jose Mourinho. In it, the club deny that Mourinho was sacked but also insist he did not resign. Instead, Chelsea announced it was a 'mutual agreement' that lead to Mourinho's exit. The Blues also paid tribute to the work Mourinho did during his time at the club and insisted he would always be welcome at Stamford Bridge.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><blockquote><strong>Chelsea's letter in full:<br><br>"The Chelsea FC plc board and everyone at the club has appreciated your patience and understanding during what has been a difficult time. "It is only right that we explain the reasons behind Jose Mourinho leaving Chelsea and also recognise the immense contribution he has made to the club and to English football. </strong><br><br>"Early this morning we announced that Chelsea and Jose Mourinho had agreed to part company by mutual consent. "The key phrase here is that there was mutual agreement. Jose did not resign and he was not sacked. "What is clear, though, is we had all reached a point where the relationship between the club and Jose had broken down. "This was despite genuine attempts over several months by all parties to resolve certain differences.<br><br>"The reason the decision has been taken is that we believed the breakdown started to impact on the performance of the team and recent results supported this view. "We did not want this to continue or affect the club further.<br><br>"Chelsea's long-term football objectives and ambitions remain unchanged and the appointment of Avram Grant and Steve Clarke is aimed at continuing to achieve those goals. "We also must pay tribute to the great job Jose did for Chelsea. He has been the most successful manager the club has known and he rightly deserves that place in our history.<br><br>"Jose has been instrumental in putting Chelsea where it is today, among the leading clubs in European and world football. "He will always be welcome at Stamford Bridge, whether as the guest of Chelsea or as the manager of another club, and he will be given the reception and respect his position in our history deserves."</blockquote></span><br><br>So contradictory... "the club deny that Mourinho was sacked but also insist he did not resign." ... Can still trust the chelsea board meh... The letter release is so business like... Say nice things about you, give you a pat on your back then send you away...</div>
