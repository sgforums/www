The festival proper begins on the first day of the first lunar month in the Chinese calendar and ends on the 15th, in which this day is called Lantern Festival or Shi Wu Wan in Mandarin or Chap Goh Mei in Hokkien.<br><br>Chinese New Year's Eve is known as Chuxi. Chu literally means "change" and xi means "eve".<br><br>Celebrated internationally in areas with large populations of ethnic Chinese, Chinese New Year is considered a major holiday for the Chinese, and has had a strong influence on the new year celebrations of its neighbours. These include Japanese, Koreans, Miao (Chinese Hmong), Mongolians, Vietnamese, Tibetans, the Nepalese and the Bhutanese (see Losar).<br><br>Chinese New Year is also the time of the the largest human migration, when overseas Chinese all around the world travel home to have reunion dinners with their families on Chinese New Year's eve.<br><br><strong>Public Holiday</strong><br>Chinese New Year is observed as a public holiday in a number of countries and territories where a sizeable Chinese population resides. Since Chinese New Year falls on different dates on the Gregorian calendar every year on different days of the week, some of these governments opt to shift working days in order to accommodate a longer public holiday. Also like many other countries in the world, a statutory holiday is added on the following work day when the New Year falls on a weekend.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">China<br>The first seven days.<br><br>Taiwan<br>The first five days<br><br>Hong Kong and Macau<br>The first three days<br><br>Malaysia and Singapore<br>The first two days<br><br>Brunei and Indonesia<br>The first day </span><br><br><strong>Days before the new year</strong><br>On the days before the New Year celebration, Chinese families give their home a thorough cleaning, known as 'spring cleaning'. It is believed the cleaning sweeps away bad luck of the preceding year and makes their homes ready for good luck. Brooms and dust pans are put away on New Year's Eve and the first day so that luck cannot be swept away. Some people give their homes, doors and window-panes a new coat of red paint. Homes are decorated with paper cutouts of Chinese auspicious phrases and couplets.<br><br><strong>Reunion dinner</strong><br>A reunion dinner is held on New Year's Eve where members of the family, near and far, get together for celebration. The venue will usually be in the home of the most senior member of the family. The New Year's Eve dinner is very sumptuous and traditionally includes chicken and fish. Fish (yu) is included, but not eaten up completely (and the remainder is stored overnight), as the Chinese phrase (niÃ¡n niÃ¡n you yÃº), which means "may there be surpluses every year", sounds the same as "may there be fish every year."<br><br><strong>Red Packets</strong><br>Traditionally, red packets (Mandarin: 'hÃ³ng bao) Hokkien: 'ang pow', Hakka: 'fung bao'; Cantonese: 'leih sÃ­h' are passed out during the Chinese New Year's celebrations, from married couples or the elderly to unmarried juniors. It is common for adults to give red packets to children. The amount of money in the red packets should be of even numbers, as odd numbers are associated with cash given during funerals (Bai Jin).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><span class="large"><strong>The Chinese Zodiac</strong></span></span><br><br>The Chinese zodiac has twelve signs. Originally, these signs did not have animals associated with them but were signs used to record dates. They were called the 12 Earthly Branches and 10 Celestial Stems and their use went back to the Shang dynasty. Later, each of the 12 earthly branches came to be designated by an animal sign: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog, and boar.<br><br>There is a folk story that describes how the animals were assigned to the cycle of years. A long long time ago, the Lord Buddha summoned all the animals together to assign each of them a year. When the cat heard the news, he let his friend the rat know about it and the two animals decided to go together the next day. However, the next day the rat did not wake the cat who, being a cat and loving to nap, slept through the morning. Therefore, the cat did not make it to the assembly on time and did not get a year. This is why there is no year of the cat and this is why cats hate rats.<br><br>The rat, on the other hand, made it first there and received the first year. He did not achieve this without trickery either. He knew that a small animal like him would not be able to compete with the others, so he begged the ox to let him ride on its head. The ox consented and they went together. Just when they were about to arrive, the rat jumped off the ox's head and got through the finish line first. This is why the year of the rat is the first year in the cycle and the year of the ox is the second.<br><br><img src="http://www.edsitement.neh.gov/lesson_images/lesson344/chinese_astrology.gif"><br><br>The Chinese lunar calendar dates back to the second millennium BC. Unlike our calendar, which numbers the years progressively from a given time (the birth of Christ), the Chinese calendar is cyclical. Each cycle is made up of 12 years; after the 12th year, the cycle is repeated. The Chinese associate each year of a 12-year cycle with an animal, and they refer to the years as "the year of the dragon," "the year of the ox," and so forth. The 12 animals and the years associated with them are often represented on a circular chart, and for this reason they are known as animals of the zodiac.<br><br>The use of the animal names in the calendar led to the development of Chinese astrology. Astrology can be defined as a pseudo-science linking human destinies to charts associated with heavenly bodies or the recording of time. The Chinese believed the characteristics of a given zodiac animal influenced the personality of every person born in that year. They used this information to create horoscopes, daily predictions based upon the year of one's birth. Although the reading of horoscopes is popular in modern Chinese culture, few people take the predictions seriously.<br><br><strong>Find out whats your Chinese zodiac sign if you are unfamliar...</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.logoi.com/zodiac/zodiac.html" rel="nofollow">Check out which twelve Chinese animal zodiac signs do you belong to here</a><br><br></div>

He could be forthright and honest but in such a disarming manner that you find yourself at a disadvantage.<br><br>Remarkably easy to get along with, hard working and thrifty, he will be generous only to those he is inordinately fond of, so if you get an expensive gift from him, you should certainly rate yourself high in his esteem. However, in spite of his penny-pinching ways, he will never be found wanting for admirers as he emits such fantastic appeal.<br><br><strong>The Five Types of Rats<br><br>Metal Rat - 1840, 1900, 1960</strong><br>This type of Rat is most likely to be idealistic in thought, vivid in speech and actions and intensely emotional. He may cover up his feelings by presenting himself as a happy and charming personality. In reality, he is easily moved to jealousy, anger, selfishness and possessiveness.<br><br>His outlook will be based on what his senses can appreciate. He loves money but will not hoard it and won't mind spending if he can get good value and quality. He knows how to invest wisely, He will not be as romantic as the Rats of the other elements but could be sensual and moralistic at the same time.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Water Rat - 1852, 1912, 1972 </strong><br>This type of Rat is more concerned with mental exercise, the intricacies of the thinking process. His insight is excellent and he relates well to people of all levels. He will be respected and able to promote his talents because of his accommodating and understanding nature.

He loves travel and fashionable clothes and is open and aggressive by nature. This could also be a more generous type of Rat.<br><br>Although he is energetic and idealistic, he lacks a sense of diplomacy and may be too blunt at times to win the support he requires.

As much as he is devoted to his home and family, he may still take off whenever he feels too hemmed in and head for the open country.<br><br>He is independent and very, very competitive. But since he will not be content to maintain a simple middle-of-the-road existence, his fortunes may change often and sometimes quite drastically if he is too impatient.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Earth Rat - 1888, 1948, 2008</strong><br>This type of rat will mature early; for him happiness and contentment is found in order, discipline and security.

Although he is generally fair-minded and a good listener, it is difficult to make him change his views as he is stubborn and often has strong prejudices.<br><br>Still, because of his steady and trustworthy character, the Ox person will be entrusted with positions of authority and responsibility. He will not fall short where duty calls. As a matter of fact, he should be careful not to get carried away.<br><br><strong>The Five Types of Oxen</strong><br><br><strong>Metal Ox - 1901, 1961, 2021 </strong><br>This type of Ox will have strong clashes of will with people, even his superiors, who do not agree with his views. He expresses himself clearly, intensely and resolutely and can never be accused of being vague about what he wants. He will stick to his guns at all cost; when necessary he can be quite eloquent -- and he will use all his abilities to the full when he wants to forge head.<br><br>He is not very affectionate by nature but could have scholarly inclinations and be a lover of classical music and art.

Patient, practical and unrelentingly ambitious, he possesses a shrewd mind and a keen sense of values. He puts things to their proper use and has many notable contributions to make because he knows how to bide his time and organize his activities.<br><br>This Ox will be more reasonable and flexible and is open to suggestions, although he may still not approve of change or unconventional methods being introduced into his life. But he is not as stern as other Oxen and will not be too unhappy if asked to bend to the wind. He is primarily concerned about improving his status and security and will uphold law and order in everything he undertakes.<br><br>He will make his mark by working well with others and can steer his own course without any difficulty, provided he does not get too rigid or demand too much from others. He can concentrate on more than one goal at a time and can wear out and wait out the opposition by this methodical calmness, patience and determination.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Wood Ox - 1865, 1925, 1985 </strong><br>This type of Ox is less rigid and at least conscious if not considerate of other people's emotions. He reacts more quickly than others of his sign and is likely to be more graceful socially. He will be admired for his integrity and ethics. He is fair and impartial although his lunar animal sign draws him toward conservatism. He understands and operates within a fixed social system and will be a much better showman than the Oxen of wealth elements.<br><br>Given the chance and motivation, he will embrace new and progressive views; he is less stubborn and able to concede to majority rule.<br><br>He could climb to great heights, amassing welath and achieving prominence, if he can succeed in founding and developing sizable industrial outfits. He has strong drive and will exploit his potentials to the maximum. He understands the importance of coexistence and will link his ambitions to a larger order of things. He is capable of teamwork and is likely to be corporate-minded.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Fire Ox - 1877, 1937, 1997</strong><br>This Ox is a combustible performer and the type most drawn to power and importance. His native sense of contcontrolreinforced but so is his strong temper. As a result, he can be more forceful and proud than the other Oxen, with the exception of the quiet Metal Ox. He is materialistic and may have a superiority complex. Consequently, he tends to eliminate persons or things he considers useless or inapinappropriatehout attempting to assess their true worth. He is objective and outspoken and can be too harsh to those who dare oppose him.<br><br>The Fire element here could turn his hard-working tendencies toward the military -- or even all-out war against his opponents. He tends to overestimate his abilities and may show little patience or consideration for the feelings of others. Otherwise, he is basically honest and a fair person who does not like to take advantage of others if he can avoid it. His family will benefit most from his labors as he is apt to be very protective to his loved ones and will see to it that they are always well provided for.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Earth Ox - 1889, 1949, 2009</strong><br>This is an enduring although less creative type of Ox who is always fiatfaithfulhis duties.

Possibly restless especially if born at night. Rebellious and dynamic. A warrior and center of attention. Quick tempered but considerate. Affectionate but careless.

Still, he is rated as less temperamental than the other Tigers, as he can control his emotional urges and concentrate on his endeavors.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Wood Tiger - 1914, 1974, 2034 </strong><br>This is a tolerant type of Tiger who evaluates situations in a practical and impartial light. He is democratic in his views and understands the importance of enlisting others' cooperation in order to advance more rapidly. He will attract a lot of friends and supporters, as he can mingle with people from all walks of life.<br><br>The Wood element gives him a more even and affable disposition, and his charming, innovative personality is very conducive to group efforts. He is sought after in polite society and has the knack of bringing incongruous people together. But mostly his loyalty is to himself. No one is indispensable to him. If you quit the club, well, he will wish you good luck and waste no time replacing you.<br><br>The Wood Tiger is also inclined to be the least penetrating of the Tigers. He may prefer to scan the surface of things and maintain only the semblance of order. Actually, he lacks depth and permanent control. Adept at delegating chores and skillful at commanding and manipulating people into performing for him, he will take on a minimum amount of responsibility. As his lunar sign is not blessed with any great ability for self-discipline, he should not embark on more than he can handle. But it will be hard for him to admit his limitations, and Tigers of all colors do not take readily to criticism, no matter how contructive or kindly given.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Fire Tiger - 1866, 1926, 1986 </strong><br>This type of Tiger finds it difficult to contain his enthusiasm and boundless energy. He is always ready for action and for going from one place to another. Transient by nature, he is most concerned with the present. He is independent and unconventional, and his moves are hard to predict. The only thing one can be sure of is that when he acts, he will be dramatic and uninfluential. Fire makes him even more expressive than he already is. This Tiger never fails to impress anyone he is after or to transmit his electric vitality to any project he decides to undertake.<br><br>He seeks constantly to convert his nervous energy and inspirations into forceful action. At times, he is downright theatrical. Generous to the hilt, he will also display more leadership qualities than tigers of the other elements. To him, everything he does is worthwhile and imperative, so don't try to tell him otherwise. He is thoroughly optimistic soul and has no use for doomsday prophets.<br><br>Brilliantly commanding, imposing and open, the Fire Tiger is sensual and finds it hard ever to be impersonal about anything in his or her life.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Earth Tiger - 1878, 1938, 1998 </strong><br>This type of Tiger will possess a quieter and more responsible personality. He will look for feasibility in what he does; he will not jump to hasty conclusions and upholds equality and justice. Concerned about others and given to uncovering the truth himself, he is mature and sensible in outlook.<br><br>This Tiger will be steadier than other Tigers as the Earth element gives him a longer attention span; this enables him to work diligently and objectively on important matters without getting restless. Although he may not be as brilliant and decisive as other Tigers, he is generally clear-headed and reasonable. He sees issues in their true light and rarely allows his emotions to cloud his vision.<br><br>He is also the type of Tiger most apt to form relationships on the basis of usefulness rather than personal or sexual attraction He is an intellectual and more of a worrier than daredevil. He applies his knowledge and capabilities to areas with which he is familiar and which will reap the largest harvest.<br><br>Sometimes he can become too proud, insensitive and callous, especially when he is so wrapped up with his own concerns that he cannot identify with anything outside the scope of his objectives.<br><br>The Earth Tiger is the least likely to go for the bohemian life, no matter what he may like others to believe. First, he will make it to the top. Then, when he has proven to society and the world that he has the ability and the genius, he may act in a radical, scandalous or unconventional way, just to be different or to be noticed, as all Tigers love to be. Nonetheless, he will always be serious about his work, as his native element makes him desirous of status and recognition through stability and labor.<br></div>

The Rabbit, or Hare as he is referred to in Chinese mythology, is the emblem of longevity and is said to derive his essence from the Moon.<br><br>The rabbit symbolizes graciousness, good manners, sound counsel, kindness and sensitivity to beauty. His soft speech and graceful nimble ways embody all the desirable traits of a successful diplomat or seasoned politician.<br><br>Likewise, a person born under this sign will lead a tranquil life, enjoying peace, quiet and congenial environment. He is reserved and artistic and possesses good judgment. His thoroughness will also make him a good scholar. He will shine in the fields of law, politics and government.<br><br><strong>The Five Types of Rabbits<br><br>Metal Rabbit - 1891, 1951, 2011 </strong><br>This type of Rabbit could be sturdier physically and mentally than Rabbits belonging to other elements. He will not be as compromising either. He has unshakable faith in his own powers of observation and deduction and more often than not he is convinced he has the right answer and solutions to this problems. He can assume responsibility admirably well and will displays a good deal of initiative in his work.<br><br>Metal matched with his animal sign will make him more preoccupied with his desires, goals and creative urges. He will be more cunning, but his ambitiousness will be carefully concealed with cool logic and intelligence.<br><br>A connoisseur par excellence, he will know how to live and will savor the good things life has to offer in a refined way. While he may be indifferent to the opinions of others, he is emotionally and physically moved by good art, music and other forms of beauty. His basic self-assurance and discerning eye will make him an excellent judge of any kind of creative art forms; he may become a collector of great distinction, if he has the means, because of his impeccable taste. Whatever career he chooses he will make his mark early as he is naturally a thorough and devoted worker.<br><br>But like all true romantic spirits, this type of Rabbit could be inclined to dark moods, and works well only when he is sufficiently inspired. Ardent in love and with great depth and foresight, still he will allow only a handful of people into the inner sanctum of his life because of his many hidden inhibitions.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Water Rabbit - 1903, 1963, 2023</strong><br>This is a meditative type of Rabbit with a fragile and emotional nature. He cannot bear harassment or any other unpleasantness, such as dissent and bickering. Perhaps this is due to the fact that he is too empathic and can pick up the thoughts and feelings of others with uncanny accuracy.<br><br>He will possess an excellent memory and may have the kind of mental power that, without his knowing it, transmits his ideas to others. Consequently, he attracts the people he wants, and he may be surprised by the many supporters who really to his defense when he least expects it.<br><br>However, he is a subjective soul and his perspective gets distorted by the emotional barriers he sets up. He is not very decisive and in many cases could easily fall in with the dictates of others.<br><br>His delicate sensitivity makes him dwell too much on the past and hence he is often reminiscing on long past injuries and indulging in self-pity. In his negative moods, he suspects other's motives, is uncommunicative and over imaginative. In his positive state, he could call upon all the cosmic powers to come to his aid. He is never without friends and influence if he does not carry his neutrality to extremes.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Wood Rabbit - 1915, 1975, 2035</strong><br>When Wood is exalted in this lunar sign already governed by Wood, it could produce a generous and especially understanding Rabbit who will be too charitable at times for his own good. No doubt he has real and solid ambitions, but often he is intimidated by authority and may choose to ignore mistakes made in his presence in order to maintain the status quo. As a result, others are tempted to take advantage of his sympathetic and permissive attitude.<br><br>However, this type of Rabbit usually works out well. He thrives in large corporations or other institutions where he can slowly and diplomatically climb the ladder of success, one rung at a time. Group effort and togetherness appeal to him and give him the kind of security and reassurance he needs. But because of his innate desire to feel part of the group, he may become a but too bureaucratic and hedge when he has to make a decision that might offend people or set a precedent for a controversial case. In his refusal to meddle or take sides, he may end up hurting everyone, including himself. He should be more discriminating and decisive and take the necessary steps to insulate himself against those who prey on his generous nature. As he is one who is able to bend gracefully without ever breaking, this Rabbit will have no trouble fitting in anywhere he chooses.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Fire Rabbit - 1927, 1987, 2047</strong><br>Definitely a demonstrative, fun loving and affectionate type of Rabbit. He has more strength of character than the other Rabbits. In spite of Fire making him more temperamental, he is still able to mask his emotions with charm and diplomacy.<br><br>His personality is easy and natural. People respond positively to his ideas because he expresses them so well.<br><br>Fire may take him prone to emotion and outspoken in expressing his wants. His more capable of leadership than other Rabbits and his rule is tempered with discretion and moderation. Despite his outgoing and progressive ways, he will never approve of outright confrontation with his enemies and will prefer to use subtle plots or deal with go-betweens as natives of his sign are so adept at doing.<br><br>This type of Rabbit will have a high level of intuition and even psychic ability. He is intensely aware of changes in his surroundings and easily moved to anger, hurt or disappointment. He could also become terribly neurotic when negative. He requires approval, whole-hearted support and inspiration in order to sparkle.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Earth Rabbit - 1879, 1939, 1999</strong><br>A serious and steadfast type of Rabbit, he has definite patterns of thought an dis capable of well-calculated moves. he deliberates before giving in to his emotional inclinations. His balanced and rational personality wins him favor in the eyes of his superiors, as does his realistic approach to his goals.<br><br>The Earth element makes him more constant and less indulgent, although his constancy will be of a passive sort. His introverted nature causes him to turn inward when beset with problems and he must be in accord with his inner self before he acts. He never hesitates to appropriate whatever resources are available and will use them wisely.<br><br>He is materialistic sort of person, and his well-being is his prime concern, making him indifferent to the needs of others when they are not in accordance with his plans. Still, he possesses the humility to acknowledge his shortcomings and will strive to overcome them if he can.<br></div>

Alternately, can be stubborn, irritable and impulsive. Can also be rather worldly and hard to get close to. Full of vitality,self assured, bright and master of success. Somewhat proud and quick-tempered, the Dragon personality is always attractive.<br><br>The mighty and magnificent Dragon of mythical folklore never ceases to enchant or stir the imagination. The Dragon person is magnanimous and full of vitality and strength. To him life is a blaze of colors and he is constantly on the go. Egotistical, eccentric, dogmatic, whimsical or terribly demanding and unreasonable, he is still never without a band of admirers. Proud, aristocratic and very direct, the Dragon-born establishes his ideals early in life and demands the same high standards and perfection from others that he has for himself.<br><br>The powerful Dragon is difficult to contest, at times even impossible. He tends to intimidate those who dare challenge him. An angry , spurned Dragon could be like the big bad wolf at your door. He'll huff and he'll puff until he blows your house down. In spite of his volcano of emotions, the Dragon cannot be said to be sentimental, sensitive or very romantic. He takes love and adulation for granted: they are his just due. But while he maybe stubborn, irrational and overbearing when irked, the Dragon can forgive you the moment he gets over his outbursts. And since things are supposed to work both ways, he expects your forgiveness for his errors , too.<br><br><strong>The Five Types of Dragons<br><br>Metal Dragon - 1880, 1940, 2000</strong><br>This type could well be the most strong-willed of the Dragons. Honesty and integrity are paramount virtues to him and although he may be bright, open and expressive, he is also unbending and critical.<br><br>Action-oriented and combative, he will seek out and motivate those on his own level of intelligence or social standing. He has little patience with the lazy and foolish. Unpliable Metal combined with his natural lunar sign, Wood, will also enable him to intimidate weaker beings into submitting to his will. Otherwise, he is the magnificent warrior at his best.<br><br>He is tremendously intense and will stake his life on his convictions. It is futile to try to convince him that certain things just cannot be done. This type of Dragon will try to exorcise whatever evil he sees in life and could be fanatical regarding his convictions and moral beliefs.<br><br>When he is negative, he will have exaggerated views of his own importance. He is a bit short on diplomacy and has the habit of going it alone if others disagree with him or refuse to accept his leadership.<br><br>The strong Metal Dragon will rush in where angels fear to tread. He will succeed because he will give himself no other recourse. He burns his bridges behind him so that he cannot turn back once he attacks.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Water Dragon - 1892, 1952, 2012 </strong><br>A less imperious type of Dragon who favors optimum growth and expansion. He can put aside his ego for the good of all and is less selfish and opinionated. An inhibited but progressive person, he tries hard not to be as conspicuous as other power-hungry Dragons. Neither is he going to be labeled as the conciliatory one. He can assume a wait-and-see attitude and his wits are as formidable as his strength of will.<br><br>The Water Dragon lives by the to-thine-own-self-be-true philosophy and will not seek revenge on those who choose to go the opposite way. Democratic and liberal minded, he can accept defeat or rejection without bitterness.<br><br>Water is calming and beneficial to this lunar sign and he will know how to act wisely and do what is essential for his progress. He is quick and reliable and is capable of marketing his ideas with untiring devotion. He is likely to be successful as a negotiator, as he knows when, where and how to apply force.<br><br>His main drawback is that he may be like an overoptimistic builder who forgets to reinforce the foundation. By trying to hold on to too much he may lose everything. He must learn to make difficult choices and to relinquish whatever is unfeasible or unnecessary. This way, he will be able to devote his energies to fewer but more rewarding endeavors.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Wood Dragon - 1904, 1964, 2024</strong><br>A creative and magnanimous type of Dragon capable of developing bright, new revolutionary concepts. Wood combined with his sign makes him good at formulating and implementing his ideas and working cooperatively with others, even if he may be a bit condescending on occasion.<br><br>Gifted with an exploratory nature, the Wood Dragon loves to look into cause and effect theories; his every action will be guided by sound logic. However, he also has tendency to over investigate subjects or to submit people to endless debate when he is faced with opposition.<br><br>Nonetheless, here is a generous Dragon who is amenable to taking the middle road; who tries to offend as few people as possible; who subtly conceals his domineering ways. The Wood element produces a less fierce and unreasonable variety of Dragon who will compromise when he sees it to his advantage. Still, as a Dragon, he will ultimately have to relate everything to his oversize ego and will condescend to change only when he is sure of the benefits to himself.<br><br>Not as vindictive or self-centered as Dragons of the other elements, he will still be outspoken, proud and fearless when challenged.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Fire Dragon - 1916, 1976, 2036</strong><br>The most righteous, outgoing and competitive of all dragons, the Fire Dragon will expect a lot from everyone. But while he may be demanding and aggressive, he is also blessed with enormous energy and has a lot to offer in return. The Trouble is that he may go around with an air of superiority plus authority and make people fear or shy away from him. His leadership qualities are often marred by his desire to be treated like Messiah. Fire matched with his forceful lunar sign will give him overzealous and dictatorial inclinations. He pushes too hard even where there is little resistance.<br><br>In reality, he is an open and humane person given to impartiality and uncovering the truth at all costs. his criticisms are objective and he has the power to arouse the masses with his vibrant personality. A natural empire builder, he will look toward the supreme order of things, with himself at the helm, of course.<br><br>Because the Fire Dragon is often enveloped by insatiable personal ambition, he is short-tempered, inconsiderate and unable to put up with anything less than perfection. He also over generalizes or jumps to conclusions, frequently lumping people into categories without allowing for or even perceiving their individual differences.<br><br>Nonetheless, here is a performer of the highest degree who could easily be a source of inspiration to his fellowman and a public who will catch the public eye -- when he learns to master his negative traits and communicate more humbly with others.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Earth Dragon - 1868, 1928, 1988 </strong><br>This sociable, executive-type Dragon will have a compulsive drive to control his environment and the people who surround him. As a Dragon, he is bound to be autocratic and it would be a folly to expect less. However, he will be fair and appreciative of other people's opinions, even if he doesn't agree with them. EArth makes him realistic, stable and oftentimes, even a bit impersonal.<br><br>Although not as severe as the other Dragons, he will still have the basic urge to subjugate others. But he will approach problems with reason nd his leadership is less dictatorial. He works incessantly to develop his talents and exploit his resources.<br><br>The Earth Dragon's self-control does not mean that he is lacking in initiative. It's just that the Earth element influences him to be unhurried and his aspirations are more liable to be solid and uncluttered.<br><br>Straight as a rod, this aristocratic Dragon is quiet, strong and brave. Given to reflection and organization, his outbursts of temper will be few, nor will he demean himself by arguing with those beneath him when he is angered. However, he will retaliate quickly once his dignity is offended.<br><br></div>

Elegant to the point of being ostentatious. Can behave selfishly if crossed. A Snake lady is also charming in personality and elegant in dress. She is receptive and a deep thinker and likes to judge by intuition. She is fortunate in wealth through her life.<br><br>Philosopher, theologian, political wizard, wily financier - the Snake person is the deepest thinker and enigma of the Chinese cycle. He is endowed with an inborn wisdom of his very own; a mystic in his own right. Graceful and soft-spoken, he loves good books, food, music, the theater; he will gravitate toward all the finer things in life. The most beautiful women and powerful men tend to be born under this sign. So if you are one of the Snake people, you are in good company.<br><br>A person of this sign generally relies on his own judgment and does not communicate well with others. He can deeply religious or psychic, or on the other hand, totally hedonistic. Either way, he trusts his own vibrations rather than outside advice. More often than not...he will be right.<br><br><strong>The Five Types of Snakes<br><br>Metal Snake - 1881, 1941, 2001</strong><br>This type of Snake will be gifted with a calculating, intelligent mind and forceful willpower. Armed with discriminating tastes and a keen eye for locating opportunity, this Snake person can be a scheming loner. He likes to move quickly and quietly. He will establish himself in a solid position before you have a chance to stop him.<br><br>Metal combined with his native sign will make him crave luxury and easy living. Thus, he will devote himself to the pursuit of wealth and power. His vision is clear and farsighted and he will aspire to the best of everything.<br><br>The Metal Snake is also by far the most secretive, evasive and overconfident. Consequently, he often suspects others of hidden motives -- sometimes to the point of paranoia.<br><br>In spite of his ability to wield power and influence, this Snake will have an envious streak in him and will try constantly to outdo the opposition, either by fair means or foul. He finds it hard to ever accept defeat or failure.<br><br>Possessive, domineering and, at times, strangely uncommunicative, he will mark out his path early in life and stick to it with dedication. He can be generous and cooperative with others, but always in a guarded sort of way.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Water Snake - 1893, 1953, 2013 </strong><br>Just as water seeps through practically any barrier, so will a Snake born in its year wield encompassing influence through his profound insight.<br><br>This unassailable Snake is gifted with strong charisma and an inquisitive nature. Shrewd, business-minded and materialistic, the Water Snake possesses great mental abilities and powers of concentration. He can block out distraction, and brush aside unimportant issues for effective overall planning. He never loses sight of his goals or gets out of touch with reality.<br><br>Artistic and well-read, the intellectual Water Snake is also practical. He is adept at managing people as well as finances. While he may assume an unperturbed appearance, in actuality this particular Snake person has a long memory and harbors lifetime grudges. He could have the patience of Job combined with the bite of a King Cobra.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Wood Snake - 1905, 1965, 2025 </strong><br>An earnest Snake with kindly wisdom and a prophetic understanding of what is going to prevail in the course of events, especially in history.<br><br>He has a need for complete intellectual freedom but in his affections he will be constant and enduring. He seeks emotional stability as well as financial security. This type of Snake will express himself well and could be an eloquent speaker.<br><br>The Wood element in conjunction with his fixed element of positive Fire will make him very interesting. He will shine like a beacon light, attracting instead of pursuing the objects and people he desires.<br><br>He will have expensive habits and could be vain about his personal appearance. Because he craves admiration and public approval, he will do his utmost to achieve lasting and large-scale success.<br><br>The Wood Snake is well-informed but he gathers knowledge not for its own sake but to put such information to everyday use. Good judgment, discretion and a sharp sense of values will make him a superb investor and appreciator of the fine things in life. Here is an amenable Snake who will be very close to art, music, the theater and the beauty of the Earth.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Fire Snake - 1857, 1917, 1977</strong><br>An intense and masterful snake. Active in mind and body, he performs energetically. Fire added to the already imposing Snake personality can give him great public appeal and charisma. He exudes confidence and the ability to lead. People will vote for this type of person if he chooses to go into politics.<br><br>Although he may hold open forums to solicit or assess the views of the majority, the Fire Snake is terribly suspicious by nature and has total faith only in himself. He is too quick to censure and to condemn. Sometimes he insulates himself with a close circle of friends and advisors, thereby isolating himself without knowing it. His strong, almost maniacal desire for fame, money and power will make him insist on concrete results. Persevering and uncompromising, he sets his sights on the highest goals and once he gets to the top, he will cling to power indefinitely.<br><br>The Fire Snake is the most sensual, fervent and jealous kind of Snake. He will display excessive love or hate and be very preoccupied with himself.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Earth Snake - 1869, 1929, 1989</strong><br>The warm and spontaneous variety of Snake who will form slow but correct opinions of people. More principled, persistent and reliable, the Earth Snake will be able to communicate with the public and function effectively in group activities.<br><br>Armed with a peripheral vision and basic Snake ambition, he can take control and bridge gaps during times of confusion and panic. He or she will not be easy to intimidate and may refuse to be influenced by the crow. This snake reserves the right to pass his own judgment.<br><br>By and large, this will be the most graceful and enchanting of all the Snakes. Cool, collected and immensely charming, he will be loyal to friends and have an army of supporters.<br><br>Conservative and frugal with money, the hard-working and systematic Earth Snake will succeed in banking, insurance and real estate investments and can reconcile his needs with his resources. Here is a Snake who knows his limits and who will be careful not to overextend himself.<br></div>

His changeable nature may lead him to be hot-tempered, rash and headstrong at times.

His mind works at remarkable speed and whatever he may lack in stability and perseverance, he will certainly make up for by being open-minded and flexible. Basically, he is a nonconformist.<br><br><strong>The Five Types of  Horses<br><br>Metal Horse - 1870, 1930, 1990</strong><br>A popular but peripatetic and unruly type of Horse. Demonstrative, impetuous and bold, he will be a most engaging personality.

It will be difficult trying to keep up with him as he seems to be everywhere at the same time.<br><br>Blessed with strong recuperative powers, the Metal Horse is never out of action for long. He is constantly seeking excitement and climbing to breathtaking heights.<br><br>Metal will make this Horse more stubborn and self-centered than other types of Horses. He may be a proverbial bubbling stream filled with brilliant ideas but he is not a consistent administrator. If his work gives him no satisfaction, no fun, no rewarding stimulation, he will become irresolute and irresponsible. He cannot exists on a diet of daily routine. Nor can he function with someone glancing over his shoulder. He thirsts constantly for new experiences and challenges. When he is negative, he will have an irrational need for liberty and be unable to establish deep personal involvements for fear they may curtail his freedom or make demands on his time.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Water Horse - 1882, 1942, 2002</strong><br>A cheerful, dapper Horse with excellent business acumen, but inordinately concerned with his own well-being, status and comfort.

A travel bug and sports enthusiast, he won't let any grass grow under his feet.<br><br>He could also have the habit of changing his mind frequently and may take up an entirely different course of action without bothering to give any explanation.

A smart and colorful dresser, he can discourse on any subject with anyone.<br><br>When he is negative, he is pretentious and inconsistent and can exhibit a deplorable lack of consideration for others. The Water Horse must develop long-range planning and dedication.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Wood Horse - 1894, 1954, 2014</strong><br>Friendly, cooperative and less impatient, this type of Horse could be the most reasonable of the lot. But he will still resist being dominated. The Wood element enables him to discipline his mind better and he will be capable of clear and systematic thinking. The Wood Horse will have a happy disposition and be very active in social affairs. Amusing and a good conversationalist, he is not overly egoistical and will not constantly vie for the headlines.<br><br>But, as he is progressive, modern and unsentimental, he will throw out the old and welcome in the new. Charges and new inventions capture his imagination and he will not shrink from trying the unconventional. He will like to explore many other fields but will try hard to fulfill his responsibilities first. The strong, high-spirited and sanguine Wood Horse does not have a lazy bone in his body, but he would do well to learn to be more cautious and discerning.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Fire Horse - 1906, 1966, 2026 </strong><br>A flamboyant and itinerant Horse with a superb intellect and great personal magnetism. He tries to bring about the changes he desires through force and sheer willpower.<br><br>This is a double Fire sign (Fire also being the Horse's fixed element), and it will produce a native who is highly excitable and hot blooded.<br><br>The Fire Horse is easily distracted and is too inconsistent to stick to repetitious tasks.

He rarely accepts supervision from others, even his superiors.<br><br>The Fire Horse is a thrill-seeker. He can sort out and deal with all kinds of people and situations within a minute's notice. He is skillful at resolving sticky affairs but is not above being argumentative.<br><br>This type of Horse will have the gifts of ingenuity and resourcefulness but not perseverance.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Earth Horse - 1918, 1978, 2038 </strong><br>A happy, congenial Horse; more precise and slow moving. He is apt to be more logical but less decisive. He likes to consider all sides of a question before acting.<br><br>With Earth as his element, he will be less abrupt. He can settle down and learn to toe the line when necessary. He offers less resistance to authority. Still, he is a finely tuned animal with an ability to sniff out feasible investments. He can bring shaky business back to life and give impetus to lagging industries.<br><br>Although he is the look-before-you-leap type, he is, nonetheless, very capricious about little things and will not make up his mind easily. He may hedge on one occasion and then take on more than he can handle on another.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><span class="large"><strong>Year of the DOG</strong></span></span><br><br><img src="http://member.newsguy.com/~twilight/ch/jpg/dog-pic.jpg"><br><br><strong>Year: 1910, 1922, 1934, 1946, 1958, 1970, 1982, 1994, 2006, 2018, 2030<br>Greatest Affinity : Tiger , Horse<br>Greatest Enmity : Dragon</strong><br><br>Honest , faithful and possessing deep loyalty and responsibility. Can be magnanimous and prosperous, yet also guarded and defensive, never really relaxed despite outer calm. She has a glib tongue, practical and realistic. The Dog is also trustworthy and generous to people and has a deep sens of justice..<br><br>This maybe the most likable sign of all in the Chinese cycle. A person born in the year of the Dog is honest, intelligent and straightforward. He has a deep sense of loyalty and a passion for justice and fair play. A dog native is usually animated and attractive and will exude sex appeal. Generally amiable and unpretentious, he will know how to get along with others as he is not too demanding. The egalitarian dog likes to meet others halfway, is always willing to listen to reason and can be counted on to do his share.<br><br>For a friend, you must know that whenever you are in trouble, all you have to do is dial D-O-G. For no matter how much he or she complains, scolds, feign indifference, the Dog person cannot ignore a real call for help. At times, the dog protects the interests of others more avidly than his own. The Dog often sticks to his object of affection no matter how unworthy the person is. You don't find a dog leaving home just because he discovers that his master has the proverbial feet of clay. He makes allowances for such frailties and will probably stick it out thick or thin.<br><br><strong>The Five Types of Dogs<br><br>Metal Dog - 1910, 1970, 2030</strong><br>This type of Dog can be unwavering in his convictions and highly critical of every infraction of the law according to his own interpretation. However, his principles are of the highest kind and fundamentally he is noble and charitable. He will give himself to a lifetime of selfless dedication if he finds an object of cause or worthy of his devotion. Yet he can be ruthless when aroused and will pursue his enemies until they are annihilated.<br><br>The metal element combined with his lunar sign, which is also governed by Metal, produces a double Metal sign, which is extremely formidable. Tibetans call this combination the "Iron Dog" and look upon its year with much apprehension as it could be either very good or very bad, depending on whether it takes on negative or positive course.<br><br>Likewise, the stern and principled Metal Dog will exhibit the same traits and will exercise strong mental discipline over himself and take things very seriously--especially when they concern the affairs of his heart or his country.<br><br>His loyalty is unquestionable and he has strong political views. Never indecisive, he will pick a side and never desert his affiliations. Consequently, even though he hates injustice and foul play, this type of Dog can resort to extreme measures when he insists that others subscribe to his views.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Water Dog - 1922, 1982, 2042</strong><br>An intuitive type of Dog, who will be difficult to lead astray. He could be very attractive and a striking beauty if a female.<br><br>Water gives him more reflective qualities and he will be sympathetic to the views of the opposite side. However, despite his pleasant personality and democratic stance, he does not establish very strong personal bonds to those close to him and is often too liberal where he should be more firm.<br><br>More easygoing than other Dogs, he will tend to be lenient with himself as well as with others, often indulging in self-gratification and adventurous sprees. But because his strong temperament will be toned down by the Water element, this Dog is able to contain his emotions to an admirable degree and will present a calm and charming exterior.<br><br>A good counselor, fair judge and legal-minded operator, the Water Dog will be fluid in expressing himself, using psychological approaches that are hard to refuse or refute. He is fated also to have a large circle of friends and his company will be much sough after.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Wood Dog - 1874, 1934, 1994</strong><br>An enchanting, warm-hearted and even-tempered sort of Dog, who in spite of his candor and wariness of strangers will form close and lasting relationships with those he chooses to befriend and love. Honest, considerate and well-liked, this Dog person seeks intellectual stimulation and will work hard to develop himself.<br><br>Wood gives him a more stable and generous nature and he will seek growth, balance and beauty in his environment. He will also be attracted to money and success but will preserve himself from too much materialism. With an aptitude for dealing with vast numbers of people from all walks of life, he or she will act with maturity and common sense.<br><br>The Wood Dog will be popular and will gravitate toward refinement and social graces despite his hidden assertive qualities. Energetic and cooperative, he will like to deal in partnerships or ally himself with powerful affiliations.<br><br>Hie is basically group-oriented and will be eager to please as many of his associates as possible. Thus, this type of Dog can sometimes be held back because he refuses to move without the sanction and backing of others. He must learn independent even if it means rocking the boat on occasion.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Fire Dog - 1886, 1946, 2006</strong><br>A highly dramatic and attractive type of Dog who will be thrown into the limelight by his alluring yet friendly personality. He will be defiant and rebellious when forced to do something against his will, but he will be very popular with the opposite sex. Although he may be the life of the party type, he is still careful to practice what he preaches and will not be spoiled by success and fortune. Fire makes him very fierce when attacked; nor will he make threats he cannot carry out. His bite is just as strong as his bark.<br><br>The buoyant and self-assured Fire Dog has greater magnetic charm and can convince others to follow his lead. His independent spirit and courage will see to it that he is never afraid of getting involved with others. He will constantly thrill to new experiences and adventures. But he needs a strong shining example to pattern himself after. He will relate better to people older than himself, those from whom he can learn a great deal or whom he can depend on to bring stability into his life.<br><br>Fire makes him or her more creative and pure in expression. He will be charged with super willpower and a natural honesty that people find hard to resist. His outgoing character combined with the Dog's basic faith and idealism will help him to succeed in ambitious endeavors and to overcome great barriers.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Earth Dog - 1898, 1958, 2018 </strong><br>This Dog will be an impartial dispenser of sound advice and justice. An efficient and constructive thinker, he moves slowly and with good purpose. He is faithful to his beliefs but will bow to the majority rule. Vigilant and careful, he will appreciate the proper use of money and power and have a fixed scale of values from which he seldom deviates.<br><br>Quiet, kind-hearted but secretive, he will understand how to inspire others and instruct them wisely. Yet because of his high moral standards and unfailing idealism, he tends to overperform and may demand excessive dedication and loyalty from others.<br><br>A good fighter and an equally good survivor, this Dog is practical and less sentimental. The realistic Earth Dog will value his individualism and self-respect and will speak without reserve straight from his heart. He will not abuse powers bestowed on him and will delegate duties with a keep insight into other people's potentials. He is never totally suppressed by defeat nor overconfident in victory.<br></div>

Intense and more dominating than others, this type of Boar often has excessive appetites and could lack refinement or tact.<br><br>He exerts less control over his personal life and is very sociable and extroverted. Openly demonstrative with his affections and pure-minded, he underestimates his enemies and overestimates his friends.

He will stick scrupulously to the rules of the game, showing his goodwill by meeting others more than halfway.<br><br>Still true to his Boar nature, he will have his basic passions and outpourings of love. When he is negative, he can be preoccupied with sex, enjoyment of rich foods, excessive drinking or indulging in other expensive luxuries at the expense of others.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Wood Boar - 1875, 1935, 1995</strong><br>The Wood Boar can manipulate others with expertise. Although he is interested in his personal gains, he will also be inclined to devote a lot of his time to charitable organizations and is excellent at running social functions and club activities. He loves to help all those who come in touch with him and will try his best to get along with everyone. He is a splendid promoter; thus he will be good at getting financing for his business deals.<br><br>Extremely good-hearted, he will recommend clemency even for the most unworthy and is often not choosy about whom he associates with. Consequently, his unworthy friends could dupe him or drag him down into the mud with them if he is too much in their company.<br><br>Yet he will also be rewarded for the confidence he places in people and he will assume important positions because of his gift in bringing people together.<br><br>Wood makes him expansive but still scrupulous enough to operate by accepted modes. He will seek to be connected with the right people and will undertake ambitious corporate ventures.<br><br>A persuasive talker, the Wood Boar will love to entertain and set up a congenial atmosphere wherever he goes. His positive and bright ways will encourage people to support both his vices and virtues.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Fire Boar - 1887, 1947, 2007</strong><br>Fire will conduct powerful and intense emotions to this courageous Boar. He will display stouthearted heroism in all his endeavors and could follow his plans through with pigheaded determination.<br><br>He could reach the highest level of achievement or fall to the lowest depths of degradation, depending on which path he chooses and how tight a rein he has over his immense energy and sensuality.<br><br>The Fire Boar will never fear the unknown; intrepid, optimistic and trusting in his own innate ability, he will try his luck at anything and succeed against all odds. He is motivated by love and will try to accumulate wealth in order to provide a gracious lifestyle for his all-important family. He doesn't mind doing favors for anyone, even strangers, and will be famous for his generous handouts to friends.<br><br>When he is in negative state, this Boar can be willful, bullying and guilt-ridden, but generally he is characterized by largesse and lack of prejudice. He will favor manufacturing or labor-oriented enterprises because he will enjoy employing a large number of people if given the opportunity.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Earth Boar - 1899, 1959, 2019</strong><br>A peaceful, sensible and happy type of Boar who may have enough sense to benefit himself. The Earth element makes him productive and he will like to take on financial responsibilities or related activities and plan for his own future.<br><br>Renowned for his steadiness and patience, he will tie himself mercilessly to an objective until he attains it. His willpower will enable him to endure stress and carry burdens well beyond the capacity of others.<br><br>Devoted both to work and family, the Earth Boar will show a diligence and drive that will be hard to surpass. He will not be authoritarian; he will push himself but not others.<br><br>Although this person may be portly because of his fondness for food and drink, he has an ability for not worrying himself too much over his problems. His ambitions are reasonable and not above his reach. Therefore, he will find the security and material success he craves.<br><br>A kind, thoughtful friend, reliable associate and helpful employer, the Earth Boar will steer clear of troubled areas and look for tranquility and domestic harmony in his life.<br><br></div>
