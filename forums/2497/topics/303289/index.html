After the Ivory Coast striker publicly declared a desire to move in the wake of Jose Mourinho's departure, he agreed privately with members of the Chelsea hierarchy to stop talking to the media about his future until the end of the season.</strong><br><br>But Drogba has broken his silence, expressing a desire to link up with Samuel Eto'o at Barcelona, which has left his employers fuming. While sources at Stamford Bridge say they have no desire to lose their best player, they are prepared to open discussions with Barcelona or AC Milan if those clubs will give them a top player in return.<br><br>Chelsea would tell Barcelona they want Lionel Messi rather than a fee in excess of Â£30million for Drogba while they would ask Milan for Kaka. That, understandably, is not something either club would be happy to agree to and Drogba will be made aware of the fact, as well as being reminded that he has three years left on his contract beyond the end of this season.<br><br>But no one, however talented, will be tolerated at Chelsea if they continue to cause problems. Mourinho probably considered himself untouchable but a breakdown in his relationship with club owner Roman Abramovich led to his sudden departure earlier this season.<br><br>Drogba, according to the same sources at Chelsea, promised the club he would keep his counsel on his future. But in an interview with a French newspaper this week, he said: "If any striker in the world were offered the chance to play next to Samuel Eto'o, he'd tell you that would be inspirational. I love his style, he's unbelievably quick and has a killer instinct in front of goal."<br><br>Having broken his promise and flirted so outrageously with Barca, Drogba's days at Chelsea would now appear to be numbered.<br><br></div>

Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba, who is currently away on international duty at the African Nations Cup, has been linked with a move to Barcelona. But the Blues new Â£15million man Anelka hopes his arrival from Bolton will convince Drogba to stay.</strong><br><br>It is not very difficult to play with Didier. He can do everything and he is clever and can play with his back to the goal," said Anelka. "I like this kind of striker. I can turn around him and give him some good balls to score."<br><br>Anelka was also quick to insist his reputation as 'Le Sulk' is unjustified. The forward has often been branded 'a loner' and 'a sulker' during a career representing Arsenal, Real Madrid, Paris St Germain, Liverpool, Manchester City and Fenerbahce.<br><br>But Anelka says that such a moniker is unfounded and his team-mates would never accuse him of being moody. "I never said or did something wrong in my career so what people say is wrong," said the France international.<br><br>"People say that because they don't know me and if you ask a player I played with at Arsenal, Liverpool, Man City and Bolton, they won't say anything wrong about me. Nothing has changed but I am not younger any more.<br><br></div>
