              <p>Rafael Benitez has signed a new deal with Liverpool, ending months of speculation over his future.</p>
              <p>The five-year contract will see the Spaniard remain at Anfield until
              2014 despite a fractured relationship outgoing chief executive Rick
              Parry.</p>
              <p>"My heart is with Liverpool Football Club, so I'm delighted to sign this new deal," Benitez told Liverpool's <em>official website</em>.</p>
              <p>"I love the club, the fans and the city and with a club like
              this and supporters like this, I could never say no to staying. I
              always made clear I wanted to be here for a long time and when I
              complete my new contract it will mean I have spent over a decade in
              Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"The club is greatly respected around the world due to its
              incredible history and tremendous heritage. It is my aim to uphold
              those values and help create a new chapter in our history.</p>
              <p>"Throughout this process, I would like to thank the owners for
              their hard work in finalising the deal. All of us at the club want the
              same thing, which is to be successful by winning major trophies."</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool manager Rafa
              Benitez ended speculation about his future by signing a contract
              extension on Wednesday that will keep him at the Premier League club
              until at least 2014.</strong></p>
              <p>"My heart is with Liverpool so I'm delighted to sign this new deal," the 48-year-old Spaniard told the club's website.</p>
              <p>"I love the club, the fans and
              the city and with a club like this and supporters like this, I could
              never say no to staying. I always made clear I wanted to be here for a
              long time."</p>
              <p>Benitez arrived from Valencia
              in 2004 and despite failing to end their wait for the top-flight title
              stretching back to 1990 he has re-established Liverpool as a European
              powerhouse, winning the Champions League in 2005 and reaching the final
              two years later.</p>
              <p>Last week Liverpool reached the
              quarter-finals of the Champions League with a 5-0 aggregate rout of
              Real Madrid and on Saturday, Benitez's men thrashed Premier League
              leaders Manchester United 4-1 at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>"It is wonderful news Rafa has
              made a long-term commitment to the club," American co-owner Tom Hicks
              told Liverpool's website. "Since he became manager he has been
              responsible for the great progress we have made.</p>
              <p><strong>MORE SUCCESS</strong></p>
              <p>"I know he will continue to
              build on his achievements as he has a tremendous hunger and desire to
              bring more success to the club, success our fans and everyone connected
              with the club deserves."</p>
              <p>As well as winning the
              Champions League, Benitez also lifted the FA Cup with Liverpool in
              2006, but his time at Anfield has not always run smoothly.</p>
              <p>In 2007 he fell out with Hicks and co-owner George Gillett after publicly criticising transfer policy.</p>
              <p>Liverpool's failure to challenge United and Chelsea for the title until this season has also frustrated the fans.</p>
              <p>In addition, his failure to sign a new contract fuelled speculation Benitez would leave for hometown club Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>This season Liverpool surged
              clear at the top of the table before Christmas. But their title push
              has faded over the past three months and despite league doubles over
              Chelsea and United they are again rated outsiders.</p>
              <p>Benitez was also criticised for
              his treatment of Robbie Keane before selling the Ireland striker back
              to Tottenham Hotspur in January.</p>
              <p>A verbal attack on United
              manager Alex Ferguson in January backfired badly as the Old Trafford
              club surged back to the top of the league.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>Rafa Benitez's new five-year deal at Liverpool is worth a cool £20 million.</p>
              <p><em>The Sun</em> says the Spaniard had stalled on the offer for nearly two months, raising doubts over his long-term future.</p>
              <p>He had knocked back earlier drafts as he wanted a greater control in transfers and a bigger hand in the academy.</p>
              <p>But now he and the Reds’ US owners have agreed to compromise slightly,
              with Benitez able to move for transfers within a budget as well as
              being given assurances over the club’s future.</p>
              <p>Benitez, who will pick up around £85,000 a week, had only one more season left on his current contract.</p>
              <p>But he always insisted he wanted to stay and create another Anfield dynasty — and now he has decided to prove it.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool 's American co-owner Tom Hicks says he never doubted
              that, manager, Rafa Benitez would agree a new contract with the club.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Spaniard finally ended months of speculation on Wednesday by
              signing a contract extension with the Merseysiders until 2014, with
              rumours having continually circulated suggesting the former Valencia
              boss was set to quit over disagreements over how much control he could
              have over the club's transfer dealings.<br> <br> But Hicks says he never feared that Rafa would walk away from Anfield.</p>
              <p>"I have never been worried about whether he was going to sign
              because I know that Rafa has such a passion for Liverpool," Hicks told <em>Sky Sports News</em>.<br> <br> "I have looked him in the eye and I know that. But these things are
              complicated. A five-year contract is complicated and I am relieved we
              have finally got it done.<br> <br> "I sat down with Rafa a couple of months ago and he knows the manager can't have control over the transfer budget.<br> <br> "He has had his frustrations over the past five years, but he will make
              the recommendations about which players we sign, and the new chief
              executive and the owners and the board will make the final financial
              commitment.<br> <br> "That is the way it needs to be and will be in English football. We
              really haven't had to make promises to Rafa. He knows we want to win.</p>
