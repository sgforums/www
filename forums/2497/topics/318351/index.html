              <div><span id="intelliTXT"> 
              <p><strong>Chelsea first-team coach Henk ten Cate has confirmed that John Terry would not have taken a penalty during the shoot-out at the end of the Champions League but for Didier Drogba's petulant dismissal.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With Chelsea just one successful spot-kick away from winning the cup, Terry slipped in the act of taking his effort, screwing the ball wide of goal. With that, Chelsea's momentum was lost; moments later, so was the shoot-out as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              </span></div>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Drogba was a bystander to proceedings, sent to the dressing room after slapping Nemanja Vidic with just four minutes of extra-time remaining. It was very possibly his last action in a Chelsea shirt, and also arguably the pivotal moment of the night. Had a centre-forward rather than a centre-half been Chelsea's fifth penalty-taker during the shoot-out then they would surely be Champions of Europe this morning.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"John was not in the first five to take a kick but things changed during the game," confirmed Ten Cate. "The sending-off of Drogba made us change it [the order]. It's unbelievable that it should happen to him, though.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"He slipped. We practised penalties so much all last week and he was very confident. We were all very confident. He was not supposed to be in the first five. John stepped up when he wasn't supposed to. But he will be back."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Easier said than done, however. A tearful Terry was inconsolable in the aftermath of defeat. According to his partner in defence, Ricardo Carvalho, the Chelsea skipper "couldn't stop crying" in the dressing-room as the Manchester United team celebrated across the corridor.</p>

              <p>I think he deserve it really... He has been a rather bad guy these past few years since be became England's captain... Too arrogant, parking his expensive car in a lot for the disable just because he can easily afford the fine and party all the time when he already has a wife and child... Looks like his karma...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, watch the video of the penalties here...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyone notice how Vds played with Anelka's mind by telling him shoot to his left, his left, like taunting him to dare go for that side like that... Then he jumped to the right... lol... </p>
              <p>I guess this is what they called experience... Lehmenn also rather good with this... They know how to wind-up an opponent at a critical moment...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>There was a spare seat on the flight back from Moscow yesterday. You know what is coming. Chelsea captain John Terry and the European Cup, side by side. That was the way it was meant to be after a bleary-eyed Terry surfaced in his suite at the Ritz Hotel, just off Moscow's Red Square yesterday morning. Instead, he was haunted by The Miss of Misses.</p>
              <p>Steven Gerrard had beaten him to it in 2005, waking up next to the trophy the day after Liverpool's memorable comeback in Istanbul. "Morning gorgeous," he whispered as he rolled over and kissed The Cup of Cups.</p>
              <p>No wonder Gerrard's stunning wife Alex had something to say about it, but surely nothing beats the feeling of lifting the European Cup. Terry was choking as he walked off the field at the Luzhniki Stadium and who wouldn't be? A penalty kick away from becoming a European Cup-winning captain.</p>
              <p>Has that sunk in? A European Cup-winning captain. Sir Bobby Charlton, Johan Cruyff, Franz Beckenbauer and Paolo Maldini - the list of legends goes on. Terry can name them all, familiarising himself with the rollcall on the way to the Luzhniki Stadium on Wednesday in the same way as he has a bizarre habit of counting the number of lamp posts on the way to training each day.</p>
              <p>He spoke to Ted, his father, on the bus back to the Ritz on Wednesday night. 'They've cancelled the party because of me,' he told him, tears streaming down his cheeks and telling his father that he was unable to cope with seeing him.</p>
              <p>Instead, he went to his hotel room with his wife, Toni. She knew this was the one he wanted, the moment when the Chelsea captain would corner his own bit of history. He does not quite know how he slipped on the rain-soaked turf.</p>
              <p>All he can remember is walking to the penalty spot, padding down the turf where he would place his left foot and concentrating on the moment he would hammer the ball beyond Edwin van der Sar.</p>
              <p>Then the real celebrations would begin. Boom! Terry would have been leading the charge, saluting the supporters and sharing turns to kiss the Cup with Frank Lampard and Joe Cole.</p>
              <p>"It was in our grasp and then John slips,' said Lampard. 'Take nothing away from him because he had the balls to step up and take it. Not many centre halves would take the last penalty. I would have put my house on John. He is a character and taking penalties in those situations needs character.</p>
              <p>"He is Mr Chelsea and I'd like to see someone care like he does. I went through it at the World Cup and I know how much it hurts."</p>

              <p>hopefully he can be a stronger person with the amount of criticism the world irritating people, including myself , is blaming on him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually, to be truthful, just as much as i hate to see manure win.</p>
              <p>I think terry should be more logical about his miss.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Which is more serious? Missing a penalty and losing a cup final or being killed by earthquake?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To terry: Fcuked care about those pathetic people and newspaper who blame you and just move on with your life as happy. As a famous advice goes.. "its not what happen to you that matters... its how you responds to it"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hopefully, someone can send this thread to terry for me.</p>

              <p>I think he deserve it really... He has been a rather bad guy these past few years since be became England's captain... Too arrogant, parking his expensive car in a lot for the disable just because he can easily afford the fine and party all the time when he already has a wife and child... Looks like his karma...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, watch the video of the penalties here...</p>

              <p>Anyone notice how Vds played with Anelka's mind by telling him shoot to his left, his left, like taunting him to dare go for that side like that... Then he jumped to the right... lol... </p>
              <p>I guess this is what they called experience... Lehmenn also rather good with this... They know how to wind-up an opponent at a critical moment...</p>

              <p><br>agreed with u...... haha... maybe now he will give back England captain place to DB and tell him... i understand u now.. it's never easy to be the captain.... cannot be NATO one... alot of pressure one...</p>
