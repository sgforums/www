              <p> </p>
              <p><span><strong>Manchester United have been approached with a sensational offer to buy Carlos Tevez back from their neighbours City.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Contact was made this week by a party closely connected with striker Tevez, who quit Old Trafford in May 2009, with a view to finding out whether United manager Sir Alex Ferguson would be interested in re-signing him.</span></p>
              <div class="artSplitter">
              <p class="imageCaption"><span>Ferguson was made aware of the approach, which was neither at City's behest nor with their knowledge, but sources close to Old Trafford indicate there is absolutely no chance of the player returning, even if City did decide to sell.</span></p>
              </div>
              <p><span>With Tevez ready to return to play against Everton in a game which could take City to the top of the table, the club show no signs of buckling under the pressure of the player's publicly-stated desire to leave. And they continue to point the finger of blame for the turmoil at the player's advisor Kia Joorabchian.</span></p>
              <p><span>Victory over Everton on Monday would mean Mancini's men would be top on Christmas Day for the first time in 81 years.</span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span>City announced last week that they had rejected a written transfer request and are adamant that the player will be staying until at least the end of the season.</span></p>
              <p><span>The suitability of Tevez continuing as captain is under consideration by City manager Roberto Mancini, with defender Vincent Kompany poised to take over if he takes a hard line over the saga.</span></p>
              <p><span>Suggestions that Tevez wants to return permanently to South America because he is homesick and missing his daughters Florencia and Katie - and that he has considered quitting the game - are viewed with suspicion by the City hierarchy two of whom he claims that his relationship with has broken down irretrievably, chief executive Garry Cook and administrator Brian Marwood.</span></p>
              <p><span>It is, however, believed that Tevez, 26, has told those close to him that he plans to retire from the sport at the age of 30 anyway.</span></p>
              <p><span>Given permission by the club last weekend to have a short overseas holiday, Tevez chose to go to Tenerife rather than Buenos Aires, where his daughters live.</span></p>
              <p><span>And last week he was seen in the arms of his new girlfriend, the 18-year-old actress Brenda Asnicar, in London.</span></p>
              <p><span>City contend that Tevez himself has no problems with the club or the people who run it and that the current situation is an extravagant attempt to improve his current contract which, according to informed sources, already stipulates that no other player can be paid more than he is.</span></p>
              <p><span>It puts him alongside Yaya Toure on £200,000 a week, also meaning that, if he did leave, only a few clubs could afford to have him on their books.</span></p>
              <p><span>A City insider said: 'Carlos has been back training with his usual enthusiasm. He will not only return to the side against Everton on Monday, but he is determined to play a part in the team's push for as high a Premier League finish as they can achieve.</span></p>
              <p><span>'The club have demonstrated where they stand. Carlos is going nowhere. Now all we want is to concentrate on winning as many matches as we can between now and the end of the season.' <br></span></p>

              <p>but he comes with a baggage.</p>
              <p>he said he will retire by aged 30, so thats 4 more years to go with no resell value or the option of playing for united when he reaches 30.</p>
              <p>if he misses his daugthers so much, why not bring them here to live in england. if his former partner refuses, pay her so that he can have his daugthers all by himself.</p>
              <p>fergie likes to rotate or bench his strikers, so will Tevez accept this and no kp to the media when he was benched or rotated?</p>

              <p><span><strong>Roberto Mancini has urged Manchester City fans not to derail the club’s attempts to go top of the Barclays Premier League by venting their anger at Carlos Tevez on Monday night. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Tevez is expected to be replaced by Kolo Toure as skipper at Eastlands - a match that has been given the go-ahead despite the freezing weather - as City try to take advantage of a weekend of postponements by beating Everton and spending Christmas as leaders for the first time since 1929. </span></p>
              <div class="artSplitter"><span style="font-size: small;">Mancini wants the fuss about the 26-year-old’s future put to one side and said last night: ‘The fans should continue to support a team like they have in other times.</span></div>
              <div class="artSplitter"><span style="font-size: small;">'It’s important that we are focused on Everton and the supporters are focused on Everton. We should forget this situation.’ <br></span></div>
              <div class="artSplitter">
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Mancini spoke to Argentina forward Tevez, 26, at the club’s training ground last Friday but it is understood the meeting lasted only 10 minutes and Tevez has no intention of withdrawing his transfer request. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Tonight’s game will be watched by City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak, who arrived in Manchester last night. He has no plan to meet Tevez but it is possible he may decide to take matters in to his own hands. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">City lost twice to Everton last season and Mancini desperately wants a win on the day that marks his first anniversary at Eastlands. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">‘We can play very well and strong like we did in the last game against West Ham,’ added Mancini. </span><span style="font-size: small;">‘We can only beat them if we play like this. Carlos will be OK. He is a football player. He loves football and he plays like when we were young and in the garden. It’s the same in training or in a match.’ </span></p>

              <p>Yup:</p>
              <p><strong>According to UEFA Champions League 10/11 Regulation:</strong></p>
              <p>18.07 As a rule, a player may not play in a UEFA club competition (i.e. UEFA<br>Champions League and UEFA Europa League, but not UEFA Super Cup) for<br>more than one club in the course of the same season. Exceptionally,<br>however, a player who has been fielded in the first, second or third qualifying<br>round of the UEFA Champions League or UEFA Europa League is entitled to<br>play in the UEFA Champions League or UEFA Europa League for another<br>club as from the group stage, provided that his former club did not qualify for<br>the group phase of either the UEFA Champions League or the UEFA Europa<br>League; moreover, as from the start of the round of 16 (round of 32 for UEFA<br>Europa League), a player can be registered in accordance with paragraphs<br>18.17 to 18.20 below. For the avoidance of doubt, a substitute player who<br>has not been fielded is entitled to play for another club competing in the<br>UEFA Champions League or UEFA Europa League in the course of the<br>same season, provided that he is registered with the UEFA administration in<br>accordance with the present regulations.</p>

              <p>The Argentina striker threatened to quit Eastlands after claiming the club had broken a series of promises made to him at the start of the season, but denied he was hankering for a wage increase.</p>
              <p>However, he performed a dramatic U-turn following a crunch meeting with City chiefs and stayed as skipper in tonight's shock 2-1 home loss to Everton.</p>
              <p>A statement on the team's official website read: "Manchester City can confirm to its fans that "clear the air" talks have been held with Carlos Tevez.</p>
              <p>"During the meeting Carlos expressed his absolute commitment to the club and formally withdrew his transfer request.</p>
              <p>"Carlos's contract remains unchanged and both Carlos and the football club are keen to focus on the opportunities that lie ahead."</p>
              <p>City boss Roberto Mancini added: "Carlos is a world-class player whose contribution since he joined the club has been invaluable.</p>
              <p>"I am pleased that we are now able to focus on pure football matters and to be able to look forward to Carlos continuing to play a significant role in the club's progress."</p>
