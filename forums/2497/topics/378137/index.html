              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">QPR shareholder Lakshmi Mittal is the richest man in British football, according to new research.</h2>
              <p class="article">The London-based Indian steel magnate, who owns a 20% stake in the Loftus Road club, is worth an estimated £18.4billion, according to the 2009 <span style="color: #000000;">FourFourTwo.com</span> Rich List.</p>
              <p class="article">The annual list ranks Mittal above last year's leader, Manchester City owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan, who has a fortune of £17billion.</p>
              <p class="article">Mittal has largely taken a back seat to owners Flavio Briatore and Bernie Ecclestone since investing in QPR in December 2007 but he would appear the real financial power at the club.</p>
              <p class="article">Formula One supremo Ecclestone is ranked eighth in the list with £1.466billion.</p>
              <p class="article">Third is Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich with £7.8billion — an increase of £800million on his position last year.</p>
              <p class="article">That rise is more than the Russian's total outlay at Stamford Bridge since his takeover in 2003.</p>
              <p class="article">Arsenal shareholders Stan Kroenke (£2.709billion) and Alisher Usmanov (£1.3billion) are fifth and ninth respectively. The Glazer family, owners of Manchester United, are seventh with £1.75billion.</p>

He went on to lead Brazilian club Santos to the title in 2002, its first since Pelé himself played for the same club. In July 2005, Spanish giants Real Madrid signed Robinho for around £20m. He was whisked from under the noses of Chelsea by Manchester City on 1 September 2008, the final day of the Premier League summer transfer window. <br>The fee was £32.5m, with wages in the region of £160,000 per week, trebling his Real salary. It took place on the same day the club was bought out by the Arab investment company Abu Dhabi United Group. He has sporadically struggled since to justify his wages, but with a Nike sponsorship deal and share of transfers, Robinho should be worth £10m right now.</p>

He had joined Spurs for £10.9m from the German club Bayer Leverkusen in 2006. <br>The Bulgarian’s languid style has not endeared him to the Stretford End but he is gaining confidence and should justify his fee. But with property prices down and as Berbatov is a strong supporter of charity in Bulgaria, we cut him back to £11m this year.</p>

Since suffering cruciate ligament damage, Cole was sidelined for eight months and watched Fabio Capello's England continue their 100% qualifying record on their way to the World Cup while Chelsea start the Premier League in domineering fashion. He has now returned from injury and taken his place in the Chelsea squad. <br>His 2003 move from West Ham to Chelsea meant his weekly salary rose from £25,000 to £30,000. He moved for a £6.6m fee which will have meant a hefty cut for him. He signed an improved £80,000-a-week contract in June 2006 and has endorsement deals with Samsung and Adidas. He enjoys the usual footballer trappings of property in Dubai and fast cars. There is little in his company, Joe Cole Promotions, with just £10,000 net assets in 2007-08. With property prices down we value him at £11m.</p>

After all, he was only three years into a five-year, £70,000-a-week contract with Newcastle United – who, infamously, hadn't thought to include relegation clauses in their players' contracts. Oops. <br>Duff could have sat tight for the £7m remaining on his contract but he opted to stay in the top flight with Fulham. You get the impression football is more important to him than money; he stayed remarkably calm in 2003 when Chelsea, emboldened and empowered by the newfound wealth provided by Roman Abramovich, gradually increased their offer for the then Blackburn winger until they reached £17m and triggered a release clause in his contract. The Irishman simply shrugged his shoulders, moved clubs and set about impressing his new employers. <br>Duff has invested heavily in property in Ireland, with homes also in London, Newcastle and the Caribbean. He has an endorsement contract with Lucozade and his company Lightzest showed £916,621 net assets in 2007. But Irish property prices have crashed and despite his share of transfer fees we cut Duff back to £12m this year.</p>

Neville is idolised at Old Trafford as he is a United man through and through. A talented cricketer in his youth, Neville was one of the famous youth team at United called Fergie's Fledglings and signed for the club in 1991. He made his debut in 1994. A year later he made his debut for England and is now England's most capped right-back with 85 caps. <br>Neville has won eight Premier League titles, three FA Cups, two European Cups and one League Cup, the last of which was his first trophy as captain. He signed an £11m deal with the club in 2001. Since then his club wages have risen to around £2.6m annually. With past endorsements including a Diadora boot deal, a role in a Pepsi ad and a column for <em>The Times</em>, we reckon he now earns over £3m a year. He has two homes near Manchester including a £1.5m Manchester penthouse plus a £700,000 villa on Malta. Even with property prices down he should still be worth £12m after-tax.</p>

Coming on top of his club wage at Chelsea of £90,000 a week, also signed in 2008, Cech is now making at least £10m a year. <br>With five years in the Premier League behind him, Cech should easily be worth £12m at the very least. There's a joke in there about saving, but we'll leave it to you while we try to shoe-horn in something about Czech Cech's checked cheques.</p>

He's also earned plenty of money. <br>The £3.5m that Villa spent to bring him from Wigan in January 2009 makes it £26.5m spent on him since 2000. He was Liverpool's record signing in 2000 when Gerard Houllier spent £11m for the burly Leicester centre-forward. Four years later he moved to Birmingham for £6.25m. <br>He had earned £8.2m at Liverpool but at St Andrews, he had a five-year contract worth £30,000 a week. After his unsuccessful battle against relegation with the Blues, Heskey moved to Wigan for £5.5m in the summer of 2006. His Wigan contract was worth £40,000 a week. In all Heskey's share of the transfer fees, his nine years at the top and a boot deal with Nike take him to £13m.</p>

Thankfully, the offer on the table didn't cause enough outrage to make him swerve off the road. <br>The four-year deal, said to be worth £120,000 a week – a clear improvement on his previous annual salary of £4m (that's £80,000 per week, give or take the odd thousand). His Chelsea wage has been beefed up with a lucrative Adidas boot deal. His company, Kenzie Promotions, is also very valuable showing an £881,000 profit on £1.4m sales in 2007 and £474,000 net assets in 2008.</p>

The Spain striker had agreed to the new deal in May but departed for the Confederations Cup in South Africa without having signed it. <br>Torres was already contracted to the club until 2013 after signing a six-year deal in 2007, but the new agreement improves his salary from £90,000 a week to £120,000 a week and includes an option to extend his stay for another year. That Torres will earn close to £6m annually confirms his position as the club's superstar. <br>Torres played for six years at Atletico Madrid before his £20m move to Anfield. With advertising endorsements ranging from Nike, Pepsi and Pringles to a Spanish hair salon and dog training school, Torres should now easily be worth £14m even with property prices falling.</p>

In November 2006 he doubled them again with a four-year deal worth £90,000 a week. Eight months later that was tidied up to a nice round £100,000 a week. Two summers further on, it was extended by a couple of years to 2012 (by which time Drogba will be 34). His £4.7m annual basic can be significantly augmented with bonuses triggered when he wins trophies or tops 15 goals in a season. And let's face it, he usually does.</span></p>

Endorsements, headed by Umbro, supplement his wages. Terry's company Sports Market &amp; Promotions is surprisingly light in net assets with just £315,000 in 2007. <br>Terry is among those to have invested heavily in property developments, some of them overseas, so this year we add just £1m to Terry’s valuation, taking him to £18m. </span></p>

Beckham has manfully tried to juggle those balls while making plain his desire to have a fourth World Cup finals appearance with England - which means regular football far closer to the watchful eye of Fabio Capello, hence the loan spell at AC Milan. <br>Beckham is clearly doing what he loves most – playing football – while he still can. It's been a handsome living: he was on £116,000 a week in Spain, where high-earning foreign nationals are given generous tax breaks. A quarter of his earnings come from Asia, and his company Footwork Productions made £10.5m profit in 2007. But in time, the widely-derided "missus" might come to be the main breadwinner: Victoria Beckham's dvb label is carving out a niche in the high-end fashion market.</span></p>

But like Sir Alex Ferguson, he celebrates every goal likes it's his first – or last. And he's been around a while: O'Neill was at an underachieving Nottingham Forest when a certain Brian Clough arrived to turn the club around with two European Cup wins – one of which was watched from the bench by O'Neill, perhaps forging the Ulsterman's steely will to win.   <br>O'Neill served his managerial apprenticeship with Wycombe (whom he took into the Football League) and made a name for himself at Leicester, with whom he won two League Cups, before leading Celtic to three league titles in five years plus a UEFA Cup final. Before leaving Celtic he was given a £700,000 a year contract as a consultant. <br>O'Neill has outside interests, like commentating for the BBC during the World Cup finals and in August 2006 he joined Aston Villa on a 12-month rolling contract worth up to £2.5m a year.

In return, the contract effectively ended any hopes that Real Madrid had of luring the Spaniard back home. <br>Benitez was on Madrid's books as a player and junior coach before making his name at Valencia. He took the Spanish side to a league title and enjoyed extended runs in the Champions League. In June 2004 he joined Liverpool as manager on a five-year £10m contract – since, of course, updated and improved.

By July 2007, after a year out, he was down to a £3m annual salary at Manchester City – on a three-year contract, of which he survived 10 months. After an 11-month spell as Mexico manager he's now back in English football as director of football at Notts County, on a five-year contract reportedly worth an annual £2m. <br>No wonder Martin Samuel described him as a man who "does not appear the sort of guy who has to hide in a doorway if he sees his bank manager walking down the street".</span></p>

Carlo Ancelotti spent eight years as manager of AC Milan, collecting two more Champions League wins to add to the two he won in his five years there as a player. That pedigree prompted Chelsea to offer him a three-year deal worth £6.5m a year – with bonuses including £1m if the team wins the Champions League and another £1m for the Premier League. <br>In total, he could earn a tidy £10m a year – or £200,000 a week, enough to make even the most well-heeled player take note. With his past earnings at Milan and his Chelsea contract, Ancelotti should already be worth £17m. If he brings success to the Bridge, he could find himself rapidly rising up the Rich List.</span></p>

He later earned £35,000 a week for a farewell six-month spell with Celtic, before moving into management with a three-year £6m package at Sunderland. After that bitter experience, Ipswich will be paying him well too.  </span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Take it as red: Keane's estimated fortune of £27million has been built largely on a playing career</em></p>
              <p><br></p>
              <p><strong>Roy Keane, fighting to keep his job with Ipswich Town bottom of the Championship, is still the second-richest manager in British football - ahead of Sir Alex Ferguson, Arsene Wenger and Carlo Ancelotti.</strong></p>
              <p>The Irishman's estimated fortune of £27million has been built largely on a playing career that saw Manchester United break the £100,000-aweek barrier to keep him, although he has significantly boosted his earnings while in charge at both Sunderland and Ipswich, as well as seeing his outspoken autobiography become a bestseller.</p>
              <p>Keane's wealth puts him £3m behind England manager Fabio Capello and £5m ahead of his old Manchester United boss Ferguson who, according to the FourFourTwo.com Rich List, is paid £3.6m a year.</p>
              <p>That is barely half Carlo Ancelotti's £6.5m salary at Chelsea, with owner Roman Abramovich promising to pay his new coach a £1m bonus if he delivers the Barclays Premier League title and the same again for the Champions League.</p>
              <p>Fellow Italian Capello is also paid £6.5m. Capello's modern art collection containing works by Kandinsky, Chagall, Twombly and his friend Piero Pizzi Cannella, a leading Italian artist, is believed to be worth £17m.</p>
              <p>He was already a wealthy man before accepting the England job, having twice been in charge of AC Milan and Real Madrid, as well as Juventus and Roma.</p>
