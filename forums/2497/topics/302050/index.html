Several players on the team are being investigated for similar offences.<br><br>Singapore's anti-corruption body, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB), said that Wang Xin will appear in court next week on match-fixing charges.<br><br>Meanwhile, the CPIB are also investigating eight players from the club for match-fixing offences.<br><br>Officials and players from the all-Chinese team were called up by investigators last year.<br><br>It is believed that Wang allegedly offered bribes to players - in an attempt to influence matches played in Singapore's domestic league. Four-figure sums were reportedly offered to them.<br><br>Liaoning finished 10th out of 12 teams last season in the S-League, after losing 20 out of 33 matches played. Other non-Singaporean teams in the S-League include Albirex Niigata from Japan, and the Super Reds from Korea.<br><br>It is not the first time the S-League have been plagued with match-fixing scandals. In 2000, Geylang United goalkeeper Lutz Pfannenstiel and Sembawang Rangers defender Mirko Jurilj were jailed five months and recieved a global ban for the offence.<br><br>Last year, ex-Paya Lebar Punggol coach, Chow Kwai Lam was found guilty of attempting to influence the outcome on an S-League match in 2005. The Malaysian national was fined S$50,000 for ordering his team's goalkeeper to let in goals during a game.<br><br>If Wang is found guilty, he will be banned from participating and managing football in Singapore.<br><br>Saic S-League CEO Winston Lee: Â“We take a serious view of any form of corruption in the game. Match-fixing is a serious threat to the credibility of the game.<br><br>Â“The manager has been suspended from all forms of football activities with immediate effect and he will be permanently banned from participating and managing football in Singapore if he is found guilty.<br><br>Â“The FAS will also be recommending to the AFC and FIFA to extend his life ban worldwide should that be the case.<br><br>Â“We will remain alert to any match-fixing in the S-League. This prosecution shows that the collective vigilant approach adopted in Singapore is working.Â”</div>
