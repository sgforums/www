              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Chelsea left-back Ashley Cole
              collected a record-breaking fifth FA Cup winning medal and insisted the
              season has been his best ever.</span></strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/09/05/330/Cole_2312671.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Cole, named man of the match in
              the victory over Everton on Saturday, struggled to find his best form
              when he arrived at Stamford Bridge from London rivals Arsenal in 2006. </span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>A niggling ankle injury
              affected his form and the ability to make the kind of attacking runs on
              which he built his reputation at Arsenal.</p>
              <p>Cole played through the World Cup in 2006 with the injury but he is delighted to be back to full fitness once again.</p>
              <p>Surgery cured the ankle problem and a pain-free Cole has been in devastating form all season as a result.</p>
              <p>He produced a stunning performance on the left flank against
              Everton, linking up superbly with Florent Malouda, to cause the Toffees
              all kinds of problems.</p>
              <p>"I can run again because I have no pain in my ankle," said Cole
              "I had an operation and they took a piece of my bone away that was
              floating in my ankle.</p>
              <p>"I did it at Arsenal but I didn't want to come to Chelsea and
              have the operation straight away. It did affect me and I shouldn't have
              done it. There were times when I didn't enjoy it.</p>
              <p>"But I knew that once my ankle was better, I would be able to
              run. The manager (Jose Mourinho) wanted me to attack, but I couldn't do
              it. I played in the World Cup with it and I just wanted the injury
              finished. Now I feel really fit.</p>
              <p>"This season though has been the best I've had in the Premier
              League. Now I am playing with a smile on my face and as a player I
              think I've improved."</p>
