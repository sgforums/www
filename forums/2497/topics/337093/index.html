              <h1>Ban Drogba: FA will throw book at Chelsea striker after referee missed coin incident</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/11/13/article-0-0274BA29000005DC-79_468x319.jpg" alt="Didier Drogba" width="468" height="319"></p>
              <p><em>Caught in the act: Didier Drogba is pictured throwing a coin (circled) at the Burnley fans.</em> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1085537" rel="1085537_3" href="/sport/football/article-1085537/Ban-Drogba-FA-throw-book-Chelsea-striker-referee-missed-coin-incident.html"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Didier Drogba is facing a minimum three-match ban after it emerged that referee Keith Stroud did not see the Chelsea striker sling a coin at Burnley supporters or flip his middle finger at them.</strong></p>
              <p>The FA have delayed the announcement but Drogba can expect to be hit with a 'violent conduct' charge today for the coin-throwing. That carries an automatic three-game ban, but the FA's disciplinary commission may consider the finger gesture as a separate incident.</p>
              <p>Stroud's report from Wednesday's Carling Cup tie landed at Soho Square yesterday, confirming Drogba's yellow card was for an inflammatory goal celebration in a game Chelsea went on to lose on penalties.</p>
              <p>He celebrated aggressively in front of some 6,000 visiting Burnley fans, flipping his middle finger at them. Then he picked up a coin thrown at him and flung it back. </p>
              <p>Referee Stroud has told the FA that he would have shown Drogba a red card had he seen him throw the coin, so they can still act.</p>
              <p>Liverpool's Jamie Carragher was sent off in 2002 for throwing a coin into the Highbury crowd and was banned for three games. Alan Smith was banned for two games when he threw a plastic bottle back into the crowd when playing for Leeds and was cautioned by the police. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/11/13/article-0-02737618000005DC-917_306x423.jpg" alt="Didier Drogba" width="306" height="423"></p>
              <p><em>Who, me ref?: Drogba is booked for over-celebrating by referee Keith Stroud, who insists he would have sent the striker off had he seen him throw the coin.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><strong>Drogba, however, may receive extra punishment for his middle-finger salute. The incident is also being investigated by police after a formal complaint was made by a member of the public.</strong> </p>
              <p>It is the latest example of footballers behaving badly this week. David Norris of Ipswich apologised for a 'handcuffs' celebration of a goal, interpreted as support for former team-mate Luke McCormick, serving seven years in jail for killing two brothers in a drink-drive crash.</p>
              <p>Hull strikers Dean Windass and Marlon King reportedly brawled in a Scarborough club, while Sheffield United's Chris Morgan is under scrutiny for the challenge which broke the skull of Barnsley's Iain Hume.</p>
              <p>Coins were thrown at other Chelsea players on Wednesday. One just missed Frank Lampard, which security staff reported to Stroud. Chelsea boss Luiz Felipe Scolari said: 'After the game, Didier realised what he had done and apologised sincerely. The police and the FA will investigate what happened. Whatever they decide, we will agree to.'</p>
              <p>A lengthy ban for Drogba will be a blow to Chelsea who have limited options at centre forward. Their next three games are at West Bromwich tomorrow, at home to Newcastle and the crucial London derby against Arsenal at Stamford Bridge on November 30.</p>

              <h1>FA charge Didier Drogba with violent conduct after Chelsea striker threw coin at fans<br></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00650/drog_682x400_650601a.jpg" alt="CONTROVERSY ... Chelsea's Didier Drogba appears to throw a coin towards Burnley fans" width="682" height="400"></p>
              <p class="small bold"><em>CONTROVERSY ... Chelsea's Didier Drogba appears to throw a coin towards Burnley fans</em></p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">DIDIER DROGBA has been charged with violent conduct by the Football Association.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Chelsea striker has been hit with the rap after allegedly throwing a coin at Burnley fans during his side's Carling Cup fourth-round tie on Wednesday. The Blues lost the tie 5-4 on penalties and the 30-year-old issued an apology for his actions after the game.</p>
              <p class="article">But the FA and the Metropolitan Police yesterday confirmed they were investigating the incident. He now faces at least a three-match ban - the punishment handed out to Liverpool’s Jamie Carragher for a similar offence he committed in 2002.</p>
              <p class="article">The FA have also written to Burnley to request information on missiles thrown at Chelsea players from the Clarets' section at Stamford Bridge. An FA statement said: “Chelsea striker Didier Drogba has been charged with violent conduct.</p>
              <p class="article">"Drogba is alleged to have thrown a missile into the away section of the crowd after scoring during the League Cup match at Stamford Bridge.” The incident occurred after the Blues marksman scored the opening goal, with Burnley later equalising and going on to claim a famous penalty shootout victory.</p>
              <p class="article">Drogba has until 6pm on Monday to appeal the charge and a regulatory commission will hear the case on Tuesday.</p>
              <p class="article">Referee Keith Stroud told the FA he booked the Ivorian for going towards the Burnley fans to celebrate his goal but had not seen the missile incident. Drogba also appeared to make a gesture towards the Burnley fans after reacting to their taunts during the game.</p>
              <p class="article">An FA spokesman added: "Players should be able to play football without fearing for their personal safety. It is totally unacceptable for players to be put in danger by supporters throwing missiles onto the pitch.</p>
              <p class="article">"The priority now is to work with the clubs and the police to identify the individuals involved. "The FA wants anyone found guilty of throwing missiles to face the strongest possible action. That includes life bans from attending football matches."</p>
