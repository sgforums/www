              <p><br></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>MANCHESTER CITY are ready to unleash a concerted Abu Dhabi-backed effort to land Roberto Mancini’s top summer target Cesc Fabregas.</strong></p>
              <p>They will offer a ­staggering ­£58million for the Arsenal star – ­valued at £60m by Arsene Wenger.</p>
              <p>That demolishes the British record £50m transfer fee Chelsea paid for Fernando Torres in January.</p>
              <p>And it could be just the start, with Mancini also looking at Tottenham midfield maestro Luka Modric – who is on Sir Alex Ferguson’s wishlist at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Seeing City poach Modric would be ­galling enough, but the noisy neighbours also want to hijack Manchester United’s moves for England and Aston Villa star Ashley Young, and Dutch wizard Wesley Sneijder.</p>
              <p>People Sport exclusively revealed in March that Mancini would push for more big signings this summer.</p>
              <p>The ambitious Italian is determined to press the Middle Eastlands moneymen for the A-list players he believes will continue City’s development into a team capable of winning the big prizes.</p>
              <p>City chairman Khaldoon al-­Mubarak confirmed last week that the club will pursue “quality not quantity” as Mancini fine-tunes a squad for the demands of Champions League and Premier League combat.</p>
              <p>Targets</p>
              <p>And that means Fabregas and £40m-rated Modric – and Inter Milan’s £35m Sneijder – are all viable targets.</p>
              <p>Mancini accepts City need a ­technically supreme central midfield star to call the shots and dictate the pattern of play.</p>
              <p>He no longer sees England star Gareth Barry as the man to run City’s midfield in the big games, and the former Villa star looks set to assume a lesser role next season.</p>
              <p>Fabregas is Mancini’s first choice, with the 24-year-old star disillusioned with life as an Arsenal also-ran.</p>
              <p>Barcelona is the preferred destination for the Spanish World Cup winner, but the Catalan giants already have two of the best ­midfielders in the world in Xavi and Andres Iniesta.</p>
              <p>United boss Ferguson has promised one stellar signing this summer and he would break the bank to sign Fabregas if he could, with Paul Scholes heading for retirement.</p>
              <p>But City have the financial power to out-muscle the 19-time league champions – and now they can offer Champions League football, too.</p>
              <p>Wenger has tried to out-price suitors with a £60m price tag, but that’s peanuts to City owner Sheikh Mansour.</p>
              <p>It is City’s sudden interest in Villa winger Young that will cause most consternation at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Talks between the player and United are thought to be so advanced that contracts are already being drawn up.</p>
              <p>But that has not put off City, who met with Young’s representatives last week in an ­attempt to change the 25-year-old’s mind. United remain favourites to land the England ­international, who is said by friends to have set his heart on a move to the Premier League champions after being told he will become Ryan Giggs’ long-term ­successor on the left wing.</p>
              <p>City know that in capturing Young they would not only add a major talent to their squad but also achieve the double whammy of denying United his services.</p>
              <p>The tactic of ­weakening other sides by signing their best players was ­introduced by Mark Hughes during his reign at Eastlands, and is a policy the club will clearly maintain.</p>
              <p>The fact City believe they can tempt Young to choose them is also further proof of the lofty ­ambitions within the ­corridors of power at the club.</p>
              <p>United, however, will believe that winning this battle will be a reminder to City, ­particularly timely given last weekend’s FA Cup victory for the Blue Moonies, that they are still top dogs in Manchester and, indeed, the Premier League.</p>
              <p>Mancini has been a fan of Croatian Modric since he arrived in this country.</p>
              <p>Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is ­notoriously hard-nosed in ­transfer dealings, but with the club no longer involved in C­hampions League football next ­season, Modric could push to leave.</p>
              <p>Intruigingly, City director of football Brian Marwood was also seen engaging Football Writers’ Footballer of the Year Scott Parker at his award presentation in London recently, ­although Spurs seem ­favourites to grab the West Ham man for £9m.</p>
              <p>Everton left-back Leighton Baines and Udinese’s £26m Chilean attacker Alexis Sanchez also look to be on their way to Eastlands.</p>
              <p>And if Carlos Tevez heads for Italy or Spain this summer then Mancini will need another striker to back up Edin Dzeko and ­youngster Mario Balotelli.</p>
              <p>They have made a £22m bid for Valencia’s Spain international wideman Juan Mata, as Hotline revealed last week, as they try to land a left-sided player.</p>
              <p>Roberto Mancini is also in talks with Ajax defender Jan Vertonghen about a move to Eastlands. The Belgian plays in central defence for his country alongside City’s Vincent Kompany.</p>
              <p>Leaving</p>
              <p>Farmed-out stars Craig Bellamy and Emmanuel Adebayor – on loan at Cardiff and Real Madrid respectively – are due back at City next week, but Mancini is not keen on either forward coming back ­permanently after spats with both players.</p>
              <p>They will join left-back Wayne Bridge, due back from his loan at West Ham, and back-up keeper Shay Given as a quartet leaving Eastlands once the season is over.</p>
              <p>It all adds up to a busy summer for jaded boss Mancini, who is going back to Italy for a break to recharge his batteries after a ­hectic year.</p>
