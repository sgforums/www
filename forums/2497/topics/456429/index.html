              <p><strong>New Holland boss Van Gaal also ­revealed how close he came to joining Liverpool this summer before the Reds opted to appoint Brendan Rodgers.</strong></p>
              <p>Van Gaal said: “I decided to go and talk to Liverpool, after they had approached me.</p>
              <p>"I had serious talks with them and for me it was a good option because I considered Liverpool as a fantastic club.”</p>
              <p>But the vastly experienced Dutchman could not agree with Liverpool's American owners about his role.</p>
              <p>He demanded his own staff and a special role for former Holland international Danny Blind.</p>
              <p>Also, Van Gaal refused to work with a British boss under him, as he wanted to restructure the club the way he had done at Bayern ­Munich and Ajax.</p>
              <p>Van Gaal claims he had more than 30 job offers over the past year.</p>
              <p>“But I only talked to Liverpool and the Dutch federation,” he said. “To all the others I said no.’’</p>

              <p class="body "><strong>"That has been the ethos of the club - talent aligned with hard work takes you a long way.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">"I just want to maintain that spirit within the club. I like to think I practice it myself in the club. I find it difficult to work with players who don't share and match that."</p>
              <p class="body ">In a hard-hitting interview, Rodgers offered a damning insight into the parlous state of Premier League football, which he believes is heading for disaster unless clubs get their houses in order financially.</p>
              <p class="body ">Liverpool MD <span style="color: #000000;">Ian Ayre has admitted Liverpool were just days away from insolvency</span> before the current owners took over.</p>
              <p class="body ">Rodgers said: "It's incredible this club came close to bankruptcy.</p>
              <p class="body ">"This is Liverpool Football Club.</p>
              <p class="body ">"You may think it will never happen to your club, but who would have ever thought that could happen to a team like Glasgow Rangers?</p>
              <p class="body ">"But listen, if football continues to pay the wages that some clubs do, then you will be asking for it. That is the way football is right now.</p>
              <p class="body ">"Who would have thought that a club like Glasgow Rangers would fall apart?</p>
              <p class="body ">"If you believe that it can't happen... well, it can. It might not be now but it could be later on. You can never say that it will never happen.</p>
              <p class="body ">"Look at that club's [Rangers] history and where they have been in the game. That is a warning for everyone."</p>
              <p class="body ">In recent years, Liverpool have been one of the clubs adding to the massive problem by paying mind-blowing wages to players such as Maxi Rodriguez, Alberto Aquilani, Joe Cole and Milan Jovanovic.</p>
              <p class="body "><span style="color: #000000;">Aquilani's signing</span> left the Reds with a liability of almost £50million in transfer fee and wages, yet he played just 28 games before being shipped out on a succession of loans. </p>
              <p class="body "> </p>
              <p class="body ">For Rodgers, one of the biggest problems is players arriving at big clubs and immediately expecting the superstar wages and lifestyle without ever earning it.</p>
              <p class="body ">That though, will not happen at the new Liverpool - as Rodgers' stance in talks with Gylfi Sigurdsson proved.</p>
              <p class="body ">The Icelandic midfielder was a major target for the Reds' new manager, having starred for him at Swansea last season, but Rodgers refused to spend silly money on salary and <span style="color: #000000;">Sigurdsson eventually chose to join Tottenham instead</span>.</p>
              <p class="body ">Rodgers then returned to previous employers Swansea and <span style="color: #000000;">bought midfielder Joe Allen</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></p>
              <p class="body ">When asked if that proved players can't now come to Anfield just to earn a quick buck, Rodgers replied emphatically.</p>
              <p class="body ">"No chance. Certainly not with me," he said. "In professional and social life, I like to get value. That is just my nature and just my upbringing.</p>
              <p class="body ">I won't pay 'anything at all costs' - absolutely not.</p>
              <p class="body ">"If there is a player out there who can make a difference, we will do all that we possibly can to bring him to the football club.</p>
              <p class="body ">"What I won't be prepared to do is waste time, money and effort to bring in a player who won't add value to the club.</p>
              <p class="body ">"There have to be certain factors to make a player want to come and play for you. Unfortunately for people, money distorts the reality.</p>
              <p class="body ">"I prefer the hungry player - those that want to succeed. Of course they will earn good money, and they will get their value and worth if they perform. I would rather work that way."</p>
              <p class="body "> </p>

              <div class="body "> </div>
              <p class="body "> </p>
              <p class="body "><strong>Rodgers knows it will take time for his pragmatic philosophy to pay dividends, especially given he still has plenty of supporting-cast players at Anfield who will prove difficult to shift because they are on superstar wages.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">And life in the Premier League is complicated further by the insistence of clubs such as Manchester City and Chelsea on paying huge money for even average players, massively distorting the market.</p>

              <p><br>After the dust have all settled, Fulham announced Pool only made a $3m offer with a possibility of going to $4m with add-ons maybe after Dempsey rejected a move to Villa who made a $5m bid with a $2m add ons taking it to $7m which was accepted by Fulham earlier.</p>
              <p>I think someone at Pool thought dempsey was so desperate to join them that they can take advantage of the situation and offer lesser. However in the last min, Spurs came in with a $6m offer and Dempsey was fed-up with Pool's negotiating tactics and accepted Spurs offer as time was running out for him to complete his medical.</p>
