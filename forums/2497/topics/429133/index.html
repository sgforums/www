              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Andy Townsend has told how he was threatened in a Madrid restaurant after irate Real fans mistook him for Champions League referee Wolfgang Stark. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>columnist said he feared an attack from fans ‘baying for blood’ while enjoying a post-match meal in the city with Adrian Chiles and ITV bosses. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The ex-Chelsea and Aston Villa player put the blame for such behaviour firmly at the feet of Jose Mourinho, who he says had whipped the Real fans into a frenzy with his vitriolic press conference after the game. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Townsend said: ‘I went into a restaurant and was eating when I noticed people looking at me. Some of them started taking pictures and then someone came and gave me a pot plant, saying, “This is for you” with a funny look on his face. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘There were 10 of us around the table thinking, ‘‘What is going on here?’’ When I stood up I got booed and when I went to the loo I got followed there and back. A waiter escorted me to my seat... I didn’t know why! </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">
              </span></p><p> </p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>‘Then people came up to me, talking aggressively in Spanish and there was a man shouting at me from the other side of the restaurant. It was all getting out of control.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘Then it dawned on me. Because I still had my UEFA accreditation around my neck they thought I was the referee. To them I was Wolfgang Stark! So I had to turn around and tell them I was from English television.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The incident brought laughter from ITV anchor Chiles but for Townsend there is a serious lesson. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘Adrian’s started calling me Wolfie,’ he said. ‘But actually there’s a sinister edge to it. The crowd were baying for the referee’s blood. </span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Much as everybody hated to admit it, for once Jose Mourinho had a point. Naturally, it was buried under the obligatory narcissism and masked by the stench of countless red herrings, but it was still in there somewhere. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He said: ‘I don’t know if it is the publicity they give UNICEF, I don’t know if it’s their friends at UEFA, but Barca have managed to get all this power - and no-one else has a chance.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Seriously, how do Barcelona get away with quite so much? Is everybody browbeaten into a polite acquiescence to their antics because they have a children’s charity on their shirts? Surely if it were that easy, the Catalans would stick a dog collar on their new kit and have done with it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But there is no escaping the fact Barcelona have a ‘holier than thou’ attitude that conveys to the rest of football it really should genuflect when in their presence. Oddly, UEFA seem happy to oblige.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Anything that drops from the lips of Mourinho must automatically be treated with a degree of suspicion, since he has cast too many stones at too many people on too many occasions for his views to be accepted at face value.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But he was trying, in his own scattergun fashion, to point out how the game appears to have bought into Barca’s own boast that they are ‘more than a football club’ - and that the authorities seem loath to tackle their excesses because of this.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Few would argue with the assertion that Barca are the most talented team in the world, but dare to point out they also rank among the game’s most accomplished cheats and that is endorsed with considerably less enthusiasm.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">After the midweek Champions League debacle, Mourinho neatly slotted into his customary role of pouting pantomime villain bearing the brunt of worldwide criticism as his counterpart, Pep Guardiola, polished his halo nearby.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But Barcelona are not some angelic collection of pure football aesthetes innocently tiptoeing their way around the ‘enemy of football’.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">They dive and feign injury more than most, not just in overheated handbag-waving battles against their Madrid rivals either, but in any game where their rhythm is upset and their supremacy challenged.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">At the Bernabeu, Pedro fell over more often than a drunk stepping off a spinning merry-go-round with an inner ear infection. Dani Alves spent so long rolling on the turf he became the first player to be stretchered away with third-degree grass burns.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Yes, the Madrid histrionics were bad, but Barcelona’s were worse. I have never seen a team pressure a referee as they do, not even Manchester United in their confrontation with Andy D’Urso. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Barca attack the official mob-handed, waving imaginary cards in his face and surrounding him in an obvious attempt to intimidate again and again. Skipper Carles Puyol is the arch proponent of this repulsive tactic, leading his team-mates in a strategy that is as co-ordinated and rehearsed as any set-piece.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Madrid soon had Pepe sent off, a decision that tipped the balance of the game. Barcelona’s substitute goalkeeper was also shown a red card for his part in a mob brawl at half-time, yet that was lost in the pre-ordained narrative for this encounter that had cast Barcelona as angels and Madrid as evil trolls.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Or is it just that the wondrous skill of Lionel Messi is supposed to excuse everything else they do? It seems to be enough for most people, but it shouldn’t be.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>The ex-England striker Michael Owen, a former Madrid player himself, said on Twitter during the game: ‘You are watching modern-day football here. Two teams so closely matched. Huge advantage to get an opponent sent off. Pure gamesmanship.’ </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">That’s how many regard it, they say it is ‘gamesmanship’. Players such as Owen add the top flight is about ‘pushing boundaries’. But the rest of us ignore the euphemisms and call it what it really is — cheating.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Football is nothing if it continues down this road. It will be reduced to the level of pretend pillow fights. Contests have as little credibility as those bogus American wrestling competitions where steroid-fed lumps of mahogany pretend to grapple with one another.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>The prevailing cynicism right now is actually quite abhorrent. I expect it from Mourinho, but when the best collection of players on the planet routinely fake, deceive and think nothing of the embarrassing spectacle they are making of themselves and the sport, that ‘modern-day football’ Owen refers to has a serious problem.</strong></span></p>
