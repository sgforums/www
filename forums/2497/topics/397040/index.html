              <h1>Alan Hansen: Gifting title No 19 to Manchester United is Liverpool fans' nightmare</h1>
              <h2>Tottenham's successive victories against Arsenal and Chelsea ensure that they will be anything but an easy game for Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="slideshow">
              <div class="ssImg" style="display: block;"><img src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01618/chelsea_1618613c.jpg" alt="Chelsea-Gifting title No 19 to United would be nightmare for Liverpool fans" width="460" height="288">
              <div class="imageExtras"><span class="caption"><em>Frustration: Chelsea, who lost at Tottenham, face a tough visit to Liverpool in their title run-in</em></span></div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">But there is an inescapable sense that the big game and decisive fixture in the title run-in will be when </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> travel to </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> on May 2. If </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">United</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> beat </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Spurs</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">, then Chelsea really cannot afford to drop any points in their final three games, but the trip to Anfield poses a nightmare scenario for Carlo Ancelotti’s team.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Make no mistake, despite all of the rivalry and hostility created by all those Champions League clashes between Liverpool and Chelsea, United will always be viewed as public enemy No 1 by any Liverpool supporter.</p>
              <p>But there is absolutely no chance whatsoever that Liverpool will be handing out any favours to Chelsea at Anfield, even it means that they ultimately play a pivotal role in handing United their 19th league title.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson knows this only too well and anybody who might doubt Liverpool’s integrity and resolve will be seriously mistaken.</p>
              <p>In 1995, Liverpool almost handed the title to United by beating Kenny Dalglish’s Blackburn on the final day of the season, but United’s failure to win at West Ham proved their downfall.</p>
              <p>Liverpool will be approaching the Chelsea game in exactly the same manner. They will be 100 per cent professional and they would expect the same from United.</p>
              <p>The fact that they could help make it 19-18 to United in terms of titles won will not come into it, even though it is the last thing that Liverpool or their supporters will want to see.</p>
              <p>That is why Chelsea face such a difficult game at Anfield. Liverpool will already be hugely motivated because it is their last home game of the season, and, with the world watching, it is not in the club’s nature to do anything other than go for the win.</p>
              <p>No matter who wins the title this season, though, it will be the first time that an average team will have claimed the Premier League crown.</p>
              <p>Jose Mourinho changed the face of English football when he was at Chelsea because his team raised the bar so high that you had to be a great side to win the league during his time at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>But neither United nor Chelsea can lay claim to being a great side this season. If United win the title, it will be down to their perseverance and ability to do what champions do in terms of never giving up.</p>
              <p>They also have the figure of Sir Alex in the dressing room, warning players that they might not have a future at United and hammering home the message that they never give up.</p>
              <p>As for Chelsea, they will be guilty of the biggest slip-up in the history of the Premier League if they fail to win the title because they have had so many opportunities to put it beyond their rivals’ reach and been unable to do it.</p>
              <p>If they finish without the title this season, it could be the end of Chelsea as we know them. It is such a crucial time for the club.</p>
              <p>Win the league, and Roman Abramovich might be energised by the experience, throw more money at it and go for the big prizes all over again. But with the team needing new blood, he might decide that, although he has had a great time, the party is over.</p>
              <p>Chelsea can at least look to Spurs possibly getting a result at Old Trafford this weekend because Harry Redknapp’s team have shown just what they are capable of in the past week.</p>
              <p>Redknapp has changed the mentality at White Hart Lane and Spurs are now a coming force. Sixth is no longer enough for them and Harry will want to get to the point where even fourth is not enough.</p>
              <p>But to do that, Spurs have to show that beating the likes of Arsenal and Chelsea can be followed up by winning at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>In the past, Spurs could beat Chelsea and then lose to Hull. That is not what great teams do, but they are beginning to realise that at White Hart Lane.</p>

              <p>well, finally one ref dare to give a penalty against Terry when he seemingly seems to "escape" whenever he blocks incoming shots with his out-stretch hands. as per football focus, the key is his pace. in the past, he is able to get closer and balls seems to hit his torso, now, it seems to go away from him torso, and hit his arms or etc. but as per many many cases, it was never called until last weekend.</p>
