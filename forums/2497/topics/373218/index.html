              <p>Liverpool slumped to their second Premier League defeat in nine days as they lost 3-1 to Aston Villa to put their title credentials firmly on the line.</p>
              <p>Villa produced a defiant, organised display and deserved their first win at Anfield since 2001.</p>
              <p>The result also ended Liverpool's 31-match unbeaten home league record stretching back to December 2007, when Manchester United were the last winners at Anfield.</p>
              <p>But the spotlight will now be on Liverpool, who only lost twice in the league last season and still did not win the title.</p>
              <p>The margin for error is now very fine. You rarely win the crown by losing more than five games in a season, and Liverpool's hopes could already have suffered a mortal blow.</p>
              <p>A Lucas own goal and a Curtis Davies header saw Villa 2-0 up at the break. Fernando Torres pulled one back but an Ashley Young penalty settled the points.</p>
              <p>Martin Skrtel returned to Liverpool's defence in place of teenager Daniel Ayala, having recovered sufficiently from a jaw injury to be risked.</p>
              <p>This was the only change in the Liverpool side from the one that beat Stoke at home last week, with new Greek defender Sotirios Kyrgiakos not included in the squad.</p>
              <p>Villa included Curtis Davies, who had recovered from a shoulder injury. Brad Friedel, Gabriel Agbonlahor and Stiliyan Petrov all returned to the side after being rested in the Europa League defeat away to Rapid Vienna last week.</p>
              <p>Liverpool produced a vibrant start, but found themselves frustrated by the quick-tackling, quick-thinking Villa midfield.</p>
              <p>The hosts could have been ahead in the first minute when Yossi Benayoun's back-header from Torres' chip into the area, beat Friedel but dropped inches wide.</p>
              <p>A taste of what was to follow came from Villa's first chance came when Davies met a Nicky Shorey cross with a strong header, but it went straight at Jose Reina.</p>
              <p>Torres and Steven Gerrard both saw shots blocked in the six-yard box, before Young was booked after 12 minutes for halting a Dirk Kuyt run.</p>
              <p>Then Gerrard struck a first-timer from 20-yards just over from Kuyt's touched pass.</p>
              <p>But Liverpool's problems were beginning to mount in a midfield that they were unable to dominate.</p>
              <p>Javier Mascherano and Lucas were both fortunate not to be cautioned for fouls on Petrov and Agbonlahor in quick succession.</p>
              <p>Torres was also coming in for some rough treatment from Carlos Cuellar, two tackles from behind going unpunished by referee Martin Atkinson.</p>
              <p>By now Nigel Reo-Coker and Steve Sidwell were successfully breaking up Gerrard's flow in midfield, and Villa were soon to take the lead.</p>
              <p>It came after 33 minutes when Lucas gave away a needless free-kick in midfield. Young swung the set-piece towards the near post, and it was the unfortunate Lucas who rose to head the ball past Reina for an own-goal.</p>
              <p>Liverpool's play was sloppy and far too much possession was being conceded with ill-directed passes.</p>
              <p>Further calamity came after Reina was booked in first half injury time for kicking the ball away in annoyance when referee Atkinson awarded a disputed corner, Sidwell's shot looking to have clipped a defender.</p>
              <p>And from that disputed corner Villa found themselves two up. Shorey's corner swung into the near post and was headed home by Davies.</p>
              <p>The hosts have staged some amazing comebacks in this stadium over the years, and they were going to need another massive performance to salvage anything from this situation.</p>
              <p>Villa defended with organisation and desire. Roe-Coker was booked for kicking the ball away, and Friedel produced a fine save from a Kuyt header.</p>
              <p>Kuyt then saw another header hit a post from a Gerrard corner from the left.</p>
              <p>But Villa were still showing great resilience, and breaking quickly to cause Liverpool all sorts of problems at the back, Reo-Coker being only inches away from a third with one sliding attempt.</p>
              <p>Liverpool sent on Andriy Voronin for Lucas after 66 minutes, with Friedel producing another fine stop from a Gerrard drive soon after.</p>
              <p>But after 72 minutes Liverpool finally gave themselves some hope when Emiliano Insua got down the left and rolled the ball into the six-yard box for Torres to score.</p>
              <p>Two minutes later Liverpool were back in despair and Villa celebrating. Shorey's pass into the path of Reo-Coker saw the midfielder surge into the box only to be felled by Gerrard's desperate tackle.</p>
              <p>It was a clear penalty and Young stepped up to restore Villa's two-goal lead.</p>
              <p>Liverpool's frustration was obvious. Torres was booked for dissent when Young went down injured and asked for treatment. He was eventually replaced by Heskey.</p>
              <p>Ryan Babel came on for Benayoun, Liverpool still coming forward. Friedel again made a fine save from a Torres flick, before Kuyt sent a close range effort wide of the far post.</p>
              <p>The outstanding Friedel, against his former club, saved from Torres and Glen Johnson, with Skrtel booked in the dying minutes, but Villa held on for a famous victory.</p>

              <p>Lets not pick on any individual here regardless of what they might have done, I hope we can just keep to the match discussion between the teams...</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">RAFA BENITEZ blasted Steven Gerrard and Co after Liverpool's latest flop. </h2>
              <p class="article">The Reds suffered their second league defeat in three games - having lost only twice last season. </p>
              <p class="article">Boss Benitez said: "Lucas scored an own goal but Gerrard gave away a penalty - and each player will have to analyse a lot of things.</p>
              <p class="article">"I took Lucas off but not because he was playing worse than the other players - I just wanted to change things and bring on other attackers. </p>
              <p class="article">"We made too many mistakes at crucial moments and we have to do more to win these games. </p>
              <p class="article">"The senior players have to take responsibility and use their experience." </p>
              <p class="article">After Lucas headed into his own net, Curtis Davies rose to power home No 2. </p>
              <p class="article">It came from a corner the Liverpool players angrily disputed, even though Steve Sidwell's shot clearly cannoned off Martin Skrtel. </p>
              <p class="article">Benitez said: "It doesn't matter whether it was a corner - we can't change the situation. We have lost and we have to improve." </p>
              <p class="article">Fernando Torres gave the Reds a lifeline but, two minutes later, Gerrard fouled Nigel Reo-Coker in the box and Ashley Young sealed Villa's win from the spot.</p>

              <p>It is clearly Rafa's fault. You can't have the same system without Alonso...No one in the midfield who can deliver assist to the front two...Lucas doing the job???? Damn!!</p>

              <p>hope this is a wake up call for liverpool.</p>
              <p>another way it when aquilani is ready, play him n gerrard as supporting to torres, mascherano as lone defensive MF.</p>
              <p>oh well no point looking back at whats lost n lets look forward to the next match!</p>
