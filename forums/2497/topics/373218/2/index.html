                      Where is POOLMAN and CHRIS now? Haha.
                      <br>
                  <br>
                      I remember them saying in the previous Man U vs Burnley Thread
                      <br>
                  <br>
                      Poolman : " Man U forgot to create thread so I create for them".  an in fact he was making such a big hoo haa about why Man U mods had not created the thread earlier. mmmm. If he is so free I wonder what was stopping him from creating this thread earlier than Totti?
                      <br><br>
                      Chris: "lose already talk in their forum". hahaha. Lose already go into hiding
                      <br><br>
                      <br><br>
                      And for the two of you please dont start flaming me for commenting about the team you support because innosaint was saying that Man U fans are bullshit as we "lose already cannot let people comment." Surely you are not like that right, Poolman and Chris. You are not bullshit people. You are high and honorable because unlike Man U fans you will allow people(me) to take stabs at you two without reacting.    :)

              <p>It is clearly Rafa's fault. You can't have the same system

              <p>Gerrard needs to move back to the midfield and plays 4-4-2</p>

              <p>well, we all know Pool plays their best when gerrard is behind torres.</p>
              <p>seems teams are picking up on that, and they will try to stop that linkup.</p>
              <p>If U play a 442, Gerrard has to pedal back and will negate his attacking.</p>
              <p>in the past with the two xabi and mascherano, a strong defensive MF to stuffs all attacks, now, one big hole there.</p>
              <p>Plus the replacement for xabi is still having his "orientation" of Pool's treatment room, and the fact Pool already 6pts behind leaders, it is not a good sign.</p>
              <p>One more loss and maybe, just maybe, Rafa can start planning for next season? a bit premature?</p>

              <p>anw, i do not find this result shocking at all. this is a very good result actually to showcase what kind of football we had been playing all along. lacking of insight, creativity and pace are what killed us real hard. i din watch the game last night, but i reckon the way we play is be same.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>we got lucky in the 2nd half of last season. which makes us a title contender. to be on the realistic side, i do not expect the same thing to happen again this season. our wings does not posess the needed quality. however, as a liverpool fan myself, of course i do hope that somehow, we'll get things going right again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to pose dangerous threat to man utd, chelsea or arsenal, we seriously need to change the way we play.</p>
              <p>the linkage between gerrard and torres will not work as many times as last season, because defenders understand more abt them alr and does know how to handle the situation better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in rafa we trust? fellow fans, decide for yourself.</p>

              <p>Yah, the problem is no one in the midfield who can have the authority like Alonso, who can control the pace of the game, who can supply balls to Torres and Gerrard...have to do something while waiting for Aquilani...Anyway, Liverpool has always been relying too much on Gerrard and Torres.

              <p>Although I believe Liverpool will finish 3rd this season, but as a fan...i still do hope that we can win it. 2 loses in 3 games is not very convincing though... I think last season ManU got 5 points in 9 games if I am not mistaken...</p>
              <p>2 loses in 3 games is like 3 games, 3 draws...nothing to worry about yet at this stage although if Rafa fails to win nothing this season, I think he has to go...but again, no other good managers will come to Anfield considering the club's current situation.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe ask Kenny Dalglish to be the manager?? that would be exciting... </p>

            <div class='col-md body'>For all those writing off Liverpool's chances, its still way too early to judge. Liverpool is strong defensively and offensively. Plus they are exceptionally good against out and out teams like Arsenal and Man Utd who defend very high up. What they lack is a solid play maker</div>

              <p>In this match you clearly can see liverpool weakness, as long as they are one goal down and u play fast football against them, they are going to struggle and make alot of stupid fouls like the penalty.</p>

              <p>i think this is a very good wake up call for us, a very timely one.</p>

              <p>we need to learn to stop to think that we're really good always, and will have no troubles against lower quality teams.</p>
