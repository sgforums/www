THEN RISKS Â£1M BY SECRETLY MEETING BIG SAM</span><br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWx5RK1G9c0&amp;mode=related&amp;search=" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWx5RK1G9c0&amp;mode=related&amp;search=</a><br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvNjI5zFqJg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvNjI5zFqJg</a><br><br>FREDDY Shepherd was caught on camera TWICE yesterday - lining up Sam Allardyce to be Newcastle boss next week... and offering to "carry Michael Owen back to Liverpool" in an amazing outburst to fans. The Geordie boss was snapped leaving his top secret meeting with Big Sam at Claridges Hotel in London, having completed a deal to land his new boss. The picture is set to cost Newcastle dear in extra compensation to Bolton, because the deal's been done before the end of the season, and just a fortnight after he quit the Reebok.</strong><br><br>Off-guard Shepherd gave a revealing insight into the friction Owen is causing behind the scenes at St James's Park. Asked by the Liverpool fans: "Can we have him back, Fred?" Shepherd replied, cupping his hand to his mouth: "Listen, I'll f***ing carry him back for yous..." Asked: "Really? For nine million?" Shepherd replied: "Nine million." Before stressing that Owen was a "decent lad, he's OK."<br><br>The England striker is available for a bargain Â£9m this summer because of a release clause in his contract. Shepherd has spent the week fighting a losing battle to get Owen to publicly pledge his future to the Geordies. But one battle he has won is to appoint Allardyce, who could be unveiled on Monday. Shepherd and Big Sam held a top secret meeting in posh Claridges Hotel but were spotted by staff.... with former Toon boss Graeme Souness also checking out at the time.<br><br>Allardyce is set to take over from Glenn Roeder and sign a three-year deal after thrashing out contract details and a transfer budget. Shepherd has been fighting resistance to the appointment within the club and had meetings with the dissenters in the camp before making his decisive move.<br><br>Newcastle played down Shepherd's chat with Liverpool fans despite risking a rift with Owen's agents, the powerful SFX Group, by blaming them for this week's uncertainty over Owen's summer plans and using the f-word to describe them.<br><br>A club spokesman said last night: "Anyone who has seen the video clip will immediately regard it for exactly what it is. It is nothing more than tongue-in-cheek banter in the most light-hearted fashion that no-one should take remotely seriously or try to misinterpret."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>SAM TO CASH IN<br><br>SAM ALLARDYCE will be given around Â£40million to rebuild Newcastle yet his first signing is likely to cost nothing. The ex-Bolton chief will be unveiled as Toon boss within the next few days. He has agreed to replace Glenn Roeder and been promised a war chest to launch the Geordies into the top five. </strong><br><br>Allardyce will get Â£15m up front and can re-invest cash generated by sales. I understand Toon will listen to offers for Kieron Dyer, Scott Parker, Emre and Oba Martins Â— and that could generate a further Â£25m to invest.<br><br>Yet Big Sam's first signing is likely to be striker Mark Viduka. The Aussie star is out of contract and has so far rejected a new deal at Middlesbrough, so would cost nothing. Allardyce told Toon chairman Freddy Shepherd at a meeting on Friday in London that he will take the reins.<br><br>Yet the club refuse to comment publicly until the deal is finally complete. Shepherd is acutely aware his attempts at landing his previous top managerial targets backfired spectacularly at the last minute when he was rejected by both Steve Bruce and Martin O'Neill.<br><br>But Newcastle are hoping to officially unveil Allardyce as their new manager by Wednesday.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Newcastle set to offer Allardyce Â£3m a year<br><br>Sam Allardyce is expected to be offered a four-year deal with a Â£3million annual salary by Newcastle in the next few days. Reports last night stated that the board will meet tomorrow to finalise an offer that would make Allardyce the third-best paid manager in the country, behind only Jose Mourinho and Sir Alex Ferguson.</strong><br><br>The proposed salary dwarfs that of Glenn Roeder, who resigned the St James' Park job last week, and such a move would also commit Newcastle to compensating Bolton. Allardyce quit his post at the Reebok two weeks ago but had two years left on his contract. Any agreement would probably limit Allardyce's ability to recruit staff from his former club.<br><br>[/img]</div>
