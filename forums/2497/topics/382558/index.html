              <p>With the Ballon d'Or award for Footballer of the Year fast approaching, the time has come to ask just who should be the worthy recipient.<br><br>Will last year's winner Cristiano Ronaldo regain the Golden Ball, or will it fall to hot favourite Lionel Messi?<br><br>We asked<strong> Goal.com</strong>'s worldwide editors who they think should be awarded with the grand prize...<br><br> ~~~<br><br> "<strong>Lionel Messi.</strong> Finally the little Argentine
              has overcome both injuries and high expectations to excel for Barcelona
              and score in the Champions League final. On his day he's the world's
              best, and a true difference-maker. His Argentina form is mixed, but
              they're still the luckiest country on earth to have him."<br><em>--Ewan Macdonald, Goal.com International</em><br><br>"<strong>Lionel Messi. </strong>At
              this time, no player is as strong as Messi. He won the Champions
              League, has helped Argentina to go to the World Cup and is the soul of
              Barcelona. Messi is the best player and it would be a scandal if he
              didn't win the trophy ... There are no alternatives ...This is his
              year!!!<br><em>--Fabrizio Ponciroli, Goal.com Italy</em><br></p>

              <p>"<strong>Lionel Messi</strong>.
              Incredible player, had a fantastic year with Barcelona, winning the
              treble and scoring a goal in the Champions League final, need we say
              more?"<br><em>--Tommy van Eldik, Goal.com Netherlands</em><br><br>"<strong>Xavi</strong>.
              I back the midfielder, although I think that Lionel Messi will be the
              winner because all of these prizes are championship and reputation
              based. For me, I see Xavi as the main reason for Barcelona's success,
              not Messi. So if it was down to me, I would select the best passer in
              the world: Xavi."<br><em>--Mohammed Awaad, Goal.com Arabic</em><br><br>"<strong>Lionel Messi. </strong>He
              maintained his fitness, scored a boat-load of goals (including many
              with his right foot), saved games under pressure and was central in his
              side winning everything on offer - all the things he had failed to do
              before, in addition to his already mesmeric natural talent.Â  And so not
              even a shambolic, underachieving national team can deny him the honour
              of being the year's greatest player. Topping this will be the problem."<br><em>--Sulmaan Ahmad, Goal.com UK</em><br><br>"<strong>Xavi</strong>.
              There's no chance that someone from outside Baracelona deserves this
              title more. The Catalans won every single competition they played in
              and did that with an impressive display of attacking football. The big
              question, though, is who deserves the top honours for this success? The
              'brain' of the team, Lionel Messi, or the 'lungs', Xavi Hernandez? I'd
              go for the latter, <strong>Xavi</strong>, because he also lead Spain to finally
              win a major competition the previous summer and I don't think he can
              repeat such a grandiose season, while I'm sure that Messi will be among
              the serious competitors for the Ballon d'Or for many years to come."<br><em>--Michael Paterakis, Goal.com Greece</em><br><br>"<strong>Lionel Messi</strong>.
              He has delivered in the big games, especially against Madrid, Bayern
              and Manchester United. When Ronaldo won the award, he had 42 goals with
              eight assists to his name in the 2007-08 season. Last season, Messi
              scored 42 and had 18 assists. That says it all, doesn't it?"</p>

              <p><br><em>--Rahul Bali, Goal.com India</em><br><br>"<strong>Andres Iniesta</strong>.
              Even if Messi is the favourite of the bookmakers, he did not show the
              consistency of Andre Iniesta. The man is the true leader of Barca, he
              is the engine of the team, the man who makes the team play better.
              Without him, Barcelona are not the same team. He is capable of scoring
              in big matches (like he did against Chelsea) and he showed tremendous
              leadership, something that is not the main characteristic of Messi. I
              would like Iniesta to lift the Ballon d'Or, as he is the perfect mix of
              beauty and efficiency."<br><em>--Alexandre Walraevens, Goal.com France</em><br><br>"<strong>Lionel Messi</strong>.
              The humble, yet supremely talented Barcelona star has done all that he
              can to ensure this year's award and he genuinely deserves to have the
              trophy on his mantle piece after a truly exceptional year. Quite
              simply, he put his hand up as one of the leaders of a squad full of
              incredibly good players. He has scored loads of goals and the titles he
              won with Barca last season are an indication that he has a great hunger
              to succeed. We may see him on the podium for many years to come."<br><em>--Peter Pedroncelli, Goal.com Africa</em><br><br>"<strong>Andres Iniesta</strong>.
              These kind of prizes are without memory. They are always given to
              goalscorer, but Messi only scores because there is a midfield behind
              him that allows him to do so. And in that midfield, there is a
              phenomenon called Iniesta, the most undervalued player on the planet. I
              need to remind everybody that without Iniesta's golden goal against
              Chelsea,</p>

              <p>Barcelona would not be European Champions..."<br><em>--Sergio Stanco, Goal.com Italy</em><br><br>"<strong>Lionel Messi</strong>.
              I want to think of a more deserving candidate but Messi is the best. I
              think that Xavi and Iniesta represent the wonderful football Barcelona
              play. But the whole world will vote for Messi..."<br><em>--Takashi Sugiyama, Goal.com Japan</em><br><br>"<strong>Lionel Messi</strong>.
              He deserves this award. It is true that Xavi and Iniesta have also
              played key roles in Barcelona's success but both need Messi to win the
              big matches. The Argentinean scored big goals in big games and, of
              course, set up a great number too. And even when he didn't score or
              create, he entertained football fans around the world with his
              unrivalled individual abilities. This year could be the first of many
              Ballon d' Ors for him."<br><em>--Amoy Ghoshal, Goal.com India</em><br><br><strong>"Lionel Messi.</strong> He played as the key role in Barcelona 'new dream team' and helped the
              Catalan club to lift the treble. The whole of 2009 was a fight between
              Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, and we got the final answer as to
              who was the best at the Champions League final in Rome. Although he
              suffered a lot of pressure with Albicelestes, they booked their ticket
              to WC 2010 finally and now we can look forward to him lighting up the
              tournament."<br><em>--Tony Mutong, Goal.com Hong Kong</em><br><br>"<strong>Lionel Messi</strong>.
              As hard as it is to look beyond the Barcelona poster-boy, Messi, for
              the top spot in the running, it would be a travesty if Xavi and Andres
              Iniesta failed to garner the second and third spots. The duo were
              integral to Barcelona's fortunes throughout 2009, and provided many a
              goal for Messrs Henry, Eto'o, Ibrahimovic and indeed, Messi himself. I
              am not expecting the judges to select anyone else besides Messi but it
              would be a victory for artistry, subtlety and craft if the Spanish
              midfield duo were recognised for their efforts in a poll that usually
              favours forwards."<br><em>--Peter Staunton, Goal.com International</em></p>
