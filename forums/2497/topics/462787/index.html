              <p><span><strong>Manchester United have joined the race for Arsenal rebel Theo Walcott in a move similar to Robin van Persie's controversial switch to Old Trafford in August. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Sir Alex Ferguson is keen to land the England winger, whose deal expires at the end of the season. </span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>understands that should Walcott leave Arsenal, his first choice would be United. <br></span></p>
              <div class="moduleHalf"> 
              <div class="sport item"><span>Walcott is declining to sign a five-year deal worth £75,000 a week, while formal talks over fresh terms have not taken place since August 28. <br></span></div>
              </div>
              <p><span>He is said to be keen to stay but wants a deal closer to £100,000 a week. </span></p>
              <p><span>Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea are all interested, but United's keenness, along with Walcott's desire to join the Barclays Premier League leaders looks, looks to have put United in the driving seat.</span></p>
              <p><span>At the same time, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is exploring a January swoop for United misfit Nani, raising the chance of a swap deal with Walcott. </span></p>
              <p><span>Arsenal will look to sell Walcott next month if a new deal is not agreed by December 31, but the ex-Southampton man will not be forced out and will only move to a club that suits him. <br></span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers will bid for the forward in January, but United's interest has changed the landscape of Walcott's future. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Likewise, Chelsea and City are keen but would prefer to sign him on a free transfer next summer. </span></p>
              <p><span>Walcott could be available for as little as £8million given he has just six months left to run on his deal. <br></span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson will not be buying Theo Walcott - or anybody else in January. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The Manchester United manager, who saw his team maintain their six-point lead over neighbours Manchester City with a 3-1 win over Sunderland on Saturday, is adamant he will not be doing any business in the transfer window unless it is to allow several of his reserve-team players to go out on loan.</span></p>
              <p><span>Ferguson, who rarely takes advantage of the mid-season opportunity to augment his first-team squad, believes he has enough resources to cope with challenging for the Premier League title and the European and FA Cups.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I will not be bringing anybody in, in January - definitely not,' he confirmed.</span></p>
              <p><span>It means that while title rivals City are targeting Atletic Bilbao's Fernano Llorente; Chelsea are ready to splash on Atletico Madrid's Radamel Falcao and Walcott and Liverpool want Chelsea's Daniel Sturridge and Tom Ince from Blackpool, the United boss will stick with what he has as the club chase a 20th league title.</span></p>
              <div class="artSplitter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/12/15/article-2248826-1688793D000005DC-41_634x426.jpg" alt="Boost: Vidic returned against Sunderland" width="634" height="426">

              <p> </p>
              <p><span><strong>Walcott's future at Arsenal is in doubt with the club refusing to agree to his contract demands. But if the Gunners decide to cash in on the winger in January, he is now more likely to end up at Stamford Bridge than Old Trafford.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Ferguson's confidence comes from now having a fully fit squad at his disposal after skipper Nemanja Vidic returned to the team as a second-half substitute against Sunderland.</span></p>
              <p><span>'It will take him a bit of time but that is a start,' Ferguson said. 'He is a warrior and he is our captain. He always battles for you and sticks his head on that ball in the penalty area. That is what he is great at.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Goals from Robin van Persie, Tom Cleverley and Wayne Rooney were enough to claim all three points and Ferguson added: 'People keep saying we are weak in midfield but these guys are very good players.'</span></p>
