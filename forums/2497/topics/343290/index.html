              <p><strong><span class="main-content">Zenit St Petersburg have told <em>Sky Sports News </em>that talks are taking place with Arsenal regarding a deal for Andrei Arshavin. </span></strong></p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p>Reports suggest Zenit are demanding a £20million fee for Arshavin, but the Gunners value the 27-year-old at considerably less.</p>
              <p>Zenit, though, have told <em>Sky Sports News </em>that they are confident of agreeing a deal to sell the playmaker to Arsenal this month.</p>
              <p>Gunners
              boss Arsene Wenger has been looking to reinforce his squad after losing
              captain Cesc Fabregas for several months due to a knee injury.</p>
              <p>Wenger
              has previously been coy on any interest in Arshavin, but admitted over
              the weekend that he was aiming to sign a player of 'special class'.</p>
              <p>He
              also confirmed that availability for the knockout phase of the UEFA
              Champions League would not be an issue, with Arshavin unable to feature
              against Roma after appearing in the group stage for Zenit.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">ANDREI ARSHAVIN is on standby for a £12million move to Arsenal. The Gunners, who have eyed the Russian striker for months, hope to seal a cut-price deal after his club Zenit St Petersberg dropped their £20m asking price. </h2>
              <p class="article">Agent Dennis Lachter said: “Maybe somebody will call me tomorrow to say there is an agreement. “Whenever that is concluded I will come over to represent my client.” </p>
              <p class="article">Zenit tried to hold out for £20m after Arshavin starred at last summer’s European Championships. But club bosses now admit they will drop their price due to the credit crunch and, according to Russian sources, the two clubs officially opened talks yesterday. </p>
              <p class="article">General director Maxim Mitrofanov revealed: “It’s very difficult to discuss the Arshavin value. “We want to get an adequate payment. “It will depend upon the particular offer from the particular club. We also need to see what player will be coming to us to replace Andrei.” </p>
              <p class="article">Arsenal refused to comment on the deal last night but boss Arsene Wenger has been tracking the 27-year-old for months. </p>
              <p class="article">Arshavin would not be available for the Champions League last-16 tie against Roma as he has already played against the Italians for Zenit already this term. But Wenger insists that would not be a problem. </p>
              <p class="article">The striker has previously been linked with Tottenham and Real Madrid but Arsenal remains his first choice. Zenit boss Dick Advocaat admits he is resigned to losing his star man. </p>
              <p class="article">Advocaat added: “I am aware that Arsenal are interested but I don’t know any more than that. However, I am expecting Arshavin to leave. “He is a top player and he could play for any team and any of the top teams in England. “He was voted player of the year by the sports writers last season — and they know everything! </p>
              <p class="article">“Arshavin played well for us last season but he didn’t play as well as he can. “There is still more to come from him and people will see that.”</p>

              <p>At 1.72m, arshavin will add to arsenal's team of shortys. But i personally think he will still be a good buy (no long term injury of course)</p>
              <p>He has proven himself in russia, helping zenit win the title for the first time in 20+ years, helping them win the uefa cup. And also, he did well in the euro 2008. Of course he also has his ups and downs and did not play well for some games but who can play well in all games? It is not football/championship manager after all.</p>
