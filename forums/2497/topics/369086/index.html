              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> can see Federico Macheda becoming a big fans favourite.</p>
              <p>"Macheda is top drawer, a hero in the making, just as Cristiano was," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"It is hard to believe he is just 17. We probably need to check his birth certificate because I reckon he is at least 28."</p>
              <p>Macheda's public introduction to the United first team also included an FA Cup semi-final appearance against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Everton</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Little wonder there has been no sense of awe from the Italian as he
              mingles with the senior stars on the Red Devils' current Far East tour,
              and no sign of inferiority either in training, where his eye for goal
              is even sharper than that of legendary predator Michael Owen.</p>
              <p>"Federico has plenty of confidence," admitted Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"When he came on the other night he dropped into midfield and ran down their left-side.</p>
              <p>"He is a player all right - and tough as old boots. He can look after himself.</p>
              <p>"He does not have the lightning reactions of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Ronaldo</span></abbr> but he is quick around the box and he has an eye for goal.</p>
              <p>"He was way in front of everyone with his finishing the other day - and I mean everyone. It was magnificent to see."</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> has questioned how Mark Hughes is going to manage <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr>'s all-star dressing room.</p>
              <p>"It won't be easy for them to win anything, even with all the players
              they have bought," said Ferguson, moving onto the whole City project.</p>
              <p>"They have bought a lot of high profile players but they have 10 strikers. That is a hell of a lot.</p>
              <p>"I have not spoken to all the managers but the one or two I have are saying 'Who are they going to leave out'?"</p>
              <p>"How do you tell players they are not even going to be travelling to London? How does he pick a team? We are all interested."</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> admits he considered signing Petr Cech before he moved to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>He told the <em>Daily Mail</em>: "I think <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> probably had a better nucleus. They bought well under Claudio Ranieri
              with Frank Lampard, Joe Cole, Arjen Robben and so on. John Terry came
              through from the youth system, and they bought Petr Cech, very cheaply
              as it turned out, at 21.</p>
              <p>"We actually watched Cech, I watched him myself twice, and I
              thought, ‘nineteen years old, he’s a bit young’. But he was in the
              national team by the time he was 20. Looking back now, he’s maybe made
              about 10 mistakes in six years."</p>
              <p>So he’s one that got away?</p>
              <p>'Yeah, but at the time I was looking for someone to replace Peter Schmeichel."</p>

              <p>"I see <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> as the main threats because they have the experience and they are consistent," he said.</p>
              <p>"They are hard to beat. That won't change. But I can't make up my mind
              about who is the better team. There is not much between them.</p>
              <p>"<abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> have the biggest job to do because they have sold Adebayor and don't seem to have the money the rest have got.</p>
              <p>"How Arsene develops his team will be his biggest test.</p>
              <p>"The one thing we know about <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> is that they will play some of the best football you will see and they
              will create chances. They could easily re-establish themselves and
