            <div class='col-md body'>David Villa's agent has denied holding negotiations with Chelsea, but has sent out a warning to Valencia that he could be tempted to move unless a lucrative new contract is put on the table.<br><br>Chelsea have been linked with a move for Villa for some time, with Roman Abramovich rumoured to be ready to pay Â€60million (Â£40milllion) for his services this summer.<br><br>Jose Luis Tamargo has dismissed reports that The Blues are keen to sign the Spanish international, but admits the player's name has come up in casual conversation.<br><br>"Talk is logical, but I have never negotiated with them," Tamargo stated on Spanish television show Rondo.<br><br>"To start with, at no time have I ever had a meeting with Chelsea.<br><br>"I have never had a meeting with anyone about anything to do with Villa's contract or him leaving Valencia.<br><br>"I have received no offer for Villa. The day that an offer is received I will go straight to Valencia.<br><br>"I am not negotiating with anyone, but these are the things that everyone is talking about."<br><br>A number of other clubs have been linked with Villa and Tamargo believes Valencia should offer an improved contract in a bid to keep him at the Mestalla.<br><br>The agent has challenged Valencia to decide whether they want to make an assault on the Spanish league or whether they want to be a selling club.<br><br>"Villa wants to stay with Valencia because he is very, very happy there," Tamargo said.<br><br>"But, like every professional, things can be improved. His buy-out clause is Â€150million. For Â€60million he would go nowhere, but for Â€70million maybe.<br><br>"He would hope for a better deal. It is possible that in England he could earn Â€6million a year.<br><br>"Juventus could also afford to pay around Â€5million. David could be persuaded to stay for around Â€6million or Â€7million net.<br><br>"Valencia is a club with economic limitations. It is not a Madrid, Barca or Chelsea, or even Inter.<br><br>"Valencia are lucky to have a player like Villa. At the end of the season they will have to decide if they want a team of stars or whether they consider selling some for big money."<br><br></div>
