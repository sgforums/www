              i just dont see the current owners injecting more money to make liverpool into title challengers.
              
              i wont be surprised if they are looking for buyers or or are they actually hoping to achieve what newcastle just did with minimum spending with martinez?

              <p>Rumours in twitter are saying that KK refused £9m compensation and asked the owner to spend it on players instead..not sure on the authenticity of the tweet though. As for Rafa, he did not receive the full amount..he donated it to the Hillsborough fund...cant remember the amount but he indeed donated a substantial amount...</p>

              <p>Torres, Arbeloa, Agger, Skrtel, Mascherano, Benayoun, Alonso, Luis Garcia, Riera, Kyrgiakos (less than a million), Johnson, Lucas...all are good players for less than 20m...</p>
              <p>No manager will not have perfect signings..look at Alex Ferguson...he did have a good eye for talent but he did sign wrong player as well...</p>
              <p>the most important thing for Liverpool is to hire high profile manager to attract world class player...Martinez and Rodgers wont be able to do that unfortunately...someone has to advise the owner that he is managing a football team, not baseball..</p>

              <p><span>The 24-year-old Senegal international claims he held talks with the Scot prior to his dismissal by owners Fenway Sports Group.</span></p>
              <p><span>There could be an outside chance of a deal being resurrected should Latics boss Roberto Martinez be appointed to succeed Dalglish, but Diame is currently looking elsewhere, although his preference is to remain in the Barclays Premier League.</span></p>
