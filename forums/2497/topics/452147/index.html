              <p>The Kop chief spent £108million on just six players, including Andy Carroll, Luis Suarez, Stewart Downing and Jordan Henderson, in 2011.</p>
              <p>But it has been made clear to him that those days are over and he has now started to seek bargain signings instead - including free agents.</p>
              <p>Dalglish delivered the Carling Cup in February and got to the FA Cup Final but failed to qualify for the Champions League, despite that huge outlay.</p>
              <p>The club's American owners, Fenway Sports Group, have decided to rein in the huge spending - a move which could actually benefit Dalglish, who is now more likely to give some of last year’s big-name signings a second crack at proving themselves rather than sign replacements.     </p>

              <p><strong><span>Kenny Dalglish </span><span>has travelled to Boston for crunch talks with John W Henry to determine whether he remains Liverpool manager. </span></strong></p>
              <p><span>The Scot flew to the United States after Liverpool's final Barclays Premier League game, a defeat at Swansea on Sunday, for a crucial debrief with Henry, the club's principal owner. </span></p>
              <p><span>Speculation has been mounting about Dalglish since Liverpool's quest to qualify for the Champions League unravelled. </span></p>
              <p><span>Wigan manager Roberto Martinez has been touted as a possible replacement. </span></p>
              <p><span>Fenway Sports Group have given no indication Dalglish retains their support. Henry declined all interview requests after Liverpool were beaten in the FA Cup final by Chelsea 10 days ago. </span></p>
              <p><span>Though FSG credit Dalglish with reviving Liverpool's spirit since they took him back to Anfield in January 2011, they have been unhappy with performances after investing £113million in the playing staff. </span></p>
              <p><span>Director of football Damien Comolli was sacked after negotiating a string of expensive signings that failed to provide value for money. FSG also axed Peter Brukner, the club's head of sports science and sports medicine, and director of communications Ian Cotton. </span></p>
              <p><span>It has been a turbulent season at Anfield. While winning the Carling Cup was viewed as a bonus, FSG wanted a push for the top four and the riches of the Champions League. </span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Dalglish will have to explain why Liverpool finished eighth, their lowest position since 1994, with just 52 points. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Before the trip to Swansea, Dalglish launched a staunch defence of what Liverpool have achieved in the past 12 months, given he has guided them to their first silverware since 2006 and secured a return to Europe.</span></p>
              <p><span>It was always the plan for him to meet Henry once the campaign had ended. Rather than the Americans going over to Merseyside, Dalglish has crossed the Atlantic to accelerate the situation being resolved. </span></p>
              <p><span>He is eager to press on with transfer window plans and does not believe Liverpool, who are looking into the possibility of taking back former goalkeeper coach Xavi Valero, will lose any of their prized assets. </span></p>
              <p><span>'I don't know what the Champions League clubs are going to do but we are looking to bring people in,' Dalglish said. 'Our intention is to add to what we have got. We don't want anyone to go.' </span></p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool have declined to comment on the future of manager Kenny Dalglish on Tuesday, amid rumours the Scot could be set to part company with the club.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dalglish's future has been the subject of conjecture following a disappointing Premier League, with Liverpool finishing eighth after a series of poor results at Anfield.</p>
              <p>They did, though, lift the Carling Cup trophy, courtesy of a penalty shoot-out win over Cardiff, while they reached the FA Cup final, only to be beaten 2-1 by Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Dalglish, accompanied by assistant Steve Clarke, travelled to Boston this week for talks with the club's owner, and speculation has subsequently intensified over whether he will be remaining as Liverpool manager.</p>
              <p>ESPN sought to obtain clarity amid the rumours over Dalglish's future, but no comment was given - although an official statement is anticipated within the next 24 hours.</p>
              <p>The Scot has come in for criticism after spending over £100 million on new players but failing to oversee a convincing challenge for a top-four finish in the Premier League.</p>

              <p><span><strong>Kenny Dalglish was dramatically sacked after Liverpool’s owners held him responsible for the club’s dismal Barclays Premier League campaign.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Just 34 days after Liverpool chairman Tom Werner had said the Scot retained the ‘full support’ of Fenway Sports Group, Dalglish became the highest-profile victim of their ruthless cull.</span></p>
              <p><span>'He did more than anyone else to stabilise Liverpool over the past year-and-a-half. We owe him a great debt of gratitude. However, results in the Premier League have been disappointing and we believe to build on the progress that has already been made, we need to make a change.</span></p>
              <p><span>'We are committed to delivering success for our supporters and our ambition remains resolute to return this great club to the elite of England and Europe, where it belongs.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Anfield icon Dalglish was informed on Wednesday lunchtime of the decision by principal owner John W Henry that his contract, which had two years left to run, was being terminated. It was a tacit acceptance that he lacked the ability to deliver Champions League football. </span></p>

              <p><span>Dalglish, who left the country on Wednesday afternoon for a family holiday, follows director of football Damien Comolli, director of communications Ian Cotton and head of sports science Peter Brukner in being axed by FSG in the last five weeks.

              <p><span>Whoever comes in will need to bring success without spending swathes of cash, and part of the reason Dalglish has gone is because FSG were not convinced he would utilise their funds wisely this summer.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Kenny Dalglish</span> tried to offload Andy Carroll to Manchester City in a straight swap for <span style="color: #000000;">Carlos Tevez</span>, according to a new book to be published next week titled "Mancini: Diary of a Champion".</strong></p>
              <p>Dalglish's poor return from the £100 million spent on signings, notably Carroll, has been cited as one of the key reasons behind his downfall in his second spell as Liverpool manager.</p>
              <p>It appears that the Scottish coach began to lose patience with Carroll's prolonged struggle for form following his record-breaking £35 million move from Newcastle - until the final few games which pushed him unexpectedly into <span style="color: #000000;">Roy Hodgson</span><span style="color: #000000;">'s</span> squad for Euro 2012.</p>
              <p>The book chronicles the day-to-day happenings on and off the field in City's impressive 2011-12 season , details the move by Liverpool to swap Carroll for Tevez.</p>
              <p>Perhaps had Dalglish pulled off the swap deal it might have reinvigorated Liverpool's season and saved him from the sack, with his departure was confirmed on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>There were rumours of the proposed move at the time of the January transfer window, yet no confirmation came to the fore. The book, however, cites a City insider substantiating that "tentative enquires" were made from Anfield.</p>
              <p>Liverpool were willing, according to the book, to take a £10 million "hit" on Carroll and drop the valuation to £25 million, precisely the valuation being placed on Tevez to take him from City, who had insisted that a loan deal to either Milan club was out of the question.</p>
              <p>Carroll has recently regained his form to help the Reds to the Carling Cup, but defeat in the FA Cup fFinal coupled with a disastrous league campaign put Dalglish's return to management at Anfield into the spotlight.</p>
              <p>Dalglish's signings, with Carroll the most expensive, have particularly been under scrutiny. At the time of Liverpool's audacious move, <span style="color: #000000;">Roberto Mancini</span>, who had been an admirer of Carroll when he plied his trade at Newcastle, was unimpressed by his dramatic slip in form since joining Liverpool.</p>
              <p>As it turned out, Mancini and Tevez patched up their differences, with the latter backing down with an apology for the incident on the bench in Munich in the Champions League, and returned to help the team to their first title in 44 years.</p>

              <div class="ingCaptionCredit"><span class="caption">Up in arms: Kenny Dalglish presided over a number of disappointing results during his second spell as Liverpool manager</span></div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The search for his replacement has begun. FSG will pursue a young, dynamic manager in tune with the demands of the European game, with Borussia Dortmund manager Jürgen Klopp an early front-runner. </strong></p>
              <p>The club insists no approaches were made to any candidate prior to Dalglish’s exit, but it is understood Dutch national coach Bert van Marwijk and German boss Joachim Löw will also be considered for the role as Liverpool look for the highest calibre managers. Despite his interest in a return to Anfield, former manager Rafael Benítez will not be considered.</p>
              <p>“Our job now is to identify and recruit the right person to take this club forward and build on the strong foundations put in place during the last 18 months,” said Werner.</p>
              <p>Given Henry made his fortune analysing statistical data, it is no surprise Dalglish’s departure ultimately came down to a numbers game. Liverpool spent £120 million on seven new players and finished eighth.</p>
              <p>They were 37 points behind the title winners and 17 points adrift of fourth placed Spurs. Dalglish’s team scored fewer goals than relegated Blackburn and won the same number of home games. Their Anfield record was the worst since relegation in 1953-54.</p>
              <p>Dalglish’s latter days were dominated by pleas to look at the bigger picture and he hoped the Carling Cup win and occasional flashes of brilliance would save him. Dalglish’s cause was hindered by the fact he was never FSG’s man.</p>
              <p>Henry candidly admitted he’d turned to Dalglish during a period of volatility after his takeover. Henry wanted a young coach such as Didier Deschamps or Andre Villas Boas (both also back in the reckoning for the job) to replace the beleaguered Roy Hodgson. At the time, neither were available and the FSG vision was immediately compromised.</p>
              <p>So they turned to the ultimate Kop icon and Dalglish was asked to resume where he had left off in 1991, initially in a caretaker capacity while the search for a full-time appointment continued.</p>
              <p>In his six months in temporary charge, Dalglish was an instant catalyst for improvement.</p>
              <p>The arrival of Luis Suárez two weeks after his appointment helped, but other fundamental changes convinced the Americans to offer a three year deal. More varied training, assisted by Clarke’s arrival, a more attractive brand of football and personable management of players who adored their boss even if, privately, many of them wondered if the tactical nous would match the off-field charisma.</p>
              <p>In his first six months, Dalglish won as many points as the top four. The numbers began to add up for Henry. Dalglish, he decided, could be trusted with the huge summer outlay that was so critical to restoring Liverpool’s position among the European elite. Jordan Henderson, Stewart Downing, Charlie Adam, José Enrique and Sebastián Coates arrived at a cost of more than £60 million, building on the £58 million already invested in a new strike force.</p>
              <p>“We’ll be disappointed if we’re not in the top four,” said Henry, setting heightened expectations.</p>

              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>But the shape of the team was altered. Raul Meireles, voted the second best player of the 2010-11 season, was sold. Maxi Rodriguez and Dirk Kuyt, two of the best players in Dalglish’s first six months, were increasingly marginalised for the new arrivals. </strong></p>
              <p>Returning to the Champions League after one season was a target rather than a job condition. Had Liverpool still been in a fight for a top four place at Easter, Dalglish’s position would not have been subject to a review, but the league position was a growing concern after a sequence of home draws.</p>
              <p>Then there was Suárez-gate. Dalglish influenced every miscalculation from the moment an inflammatory word was aimed at Patrice Evra.</p>
              <p>It seemed the Director of Football, Managing Director and, initially, even the owners, bowed down to the conspiratorial accusations against the Football Association and Manchester United. Wearing a 'Suárez’ T-shirt played out beautifully to those Liverpool supporters who relished a scrap but poorly to everyone else. Eventually, the saga ended with apologies and FSG intervening to take control of their own club.</p>
              <p>When Comolli was dismissed before the FA Cup semi-final, the implications for Dalglish were clear. Although Comolli took the blame, Dalglish could not escape culpability. He won the Carling Cup and reached the FA Cup Final, but the league form deteriorated. Weekly hard luck stories made no impression on Henry and Werner.</p>
              <p>When Dalglish was appointed the permanent Liverpool manager a year ago it was described by the Anfield board as 'a no-brainer’.</p>
              <p>Despite the tributes, with Liverpool nearer the bottom three than top four despite a £120 million investment in the squad, Liverpool’s owners evidently feel his departure was a no-brainer too.</p>

              Aiya.. why so kan chiong to sack him? give him a bit more time, at least half a season more lah. 
              
              
              Stability very important for a club one.
              
              
              If the FSG want to have immediate success that would be very unlikely non matter which guy come take over kenny.

              <p>Liverpool still have a winning team but the local talent need to shape up or ship out.</p>
              <p>As for the new manager, Ah Ben would fit right into the role as he bought most of the players.</p>
              <p>But, due to his past record clash with the owners, Henry may not want him.</p>

              Football: Liverpool in approach for Wigan coach Martinez
              LONDON: Liverpool were given permission by Wigan Athletic on Thursday to talk to coach Roberto Martinez about becoming the next manager at Anfield, a day after Kenny Dalglish was sacked.
              
              "He's going there with an open mind," Wigan chairman Dave Whelan told Sky Sports News.
              
              "We would love to keep Roberto, he's a great manager. But there are two or three clubs looking for a new manager and Roberto is on the list for all of them. If Liverpool are serious, then we may lose him."
              
              The 38-year-old Martinez left Swansea City to take over at Wigan in 2009 and has been widely praised for keeping the modest Lancashire club in the Premier League.
              
              Wigan stayed in the top flight this season after wins over Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle United in their final eight games helped them to a respectable 15th in the league -- seven points clear of relegation.
              
              "When Liverpool phoned me I was actually with Roberto having a meeting on what we are doing next season," added Whelan.
              
              "I did promise Roberto and I have always said when a big club comes he would have permission to talk to them and they don't come any bigger than Liverpool.
              
              "I gave him permission and he will be talking to them soon - I don't know when, but quite soon. When Liverpool sacked Kenny I have to say I thought Liverpool would be knocking on the door and sure enough they are."
              
              Dalglish, who had returned for a second stint as manager at Anfield in January last year, paid the price for a dismal season that saw Liverpool finish 37 points behind champions Manchester City.
              
              The Merseyside club's American owners the Fenway Sports Group (FSG) had given Dalglish more than Â£100 million ($159m) to spend in the transfer market since he took over from the sacked Roy Hodgson in 2011.
              
              But expensive signings such as Andy Carroll, Stewart Downing and Jordan Henderson largely flopped and Liverpool's eighth-place finish was their worst season-ending position for nearly two decades, with their lowest points tally since 1954.
              
              They defeated second-tier Cardiff City on penalties in the League Cup final but lost 2-1 to Chelsea in the FA Cup final earlier this month.
              
              Dalglish voiced his gratitude to fans for their show of support following his dismissal.
              
              In a message on Twitter, he wrote: "Overwhelmed by the support of the fans. Always been special but even more so now. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. YNWA (You'll Never Walk Alone) and I never have."
              
              Earlier on Thursday, the 61-year-old told the Liverpool Echo that fans needed to show support to the club's American owners.
              
              "I would hope nobody would prejudge things now," Dalglish told the Echo. "The owners have their own reasons for doing what they have done.
              
              "They came in to help the club at a time when it wasn't in a great condition. They have improved it, taken it forward and are doing the best they can.
              
              "Liverpool is still a great football club, still a club that should believe in whoever is going to come in after myself.
              
              "The supporters, not just for myself but for everyone else, have always been fantastically supportive of the team and that should not change."
              
              -AFP/ac 
              ===========
              
              i wonder how liverpool fans feel now.  go one big round and end up with martinez?  they should have just stick with roy hodgson.
