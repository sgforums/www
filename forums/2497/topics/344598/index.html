After previously refusing Chelsea and Real Madrid permission to speak with the Brazilian former world player of the year, Milan have finally buckled after being presented with a staggering £108million offer from City.</strong> </span></div>

              <div id="articlebody">
              <p>Angry Milan fans are preparing a mass protest at tonight's Serie A encounter with Fiorentina at the San Siro, when Kaka will play alongside David Beckham for the Rossoneiri against Fiorentina. But Ancelotti admits he is powerless to resist the move, if Milan's senior officials give the green light.</p>
              <p>"It is not like the days of Franco Baresi or Paolo Maldini when we just used to say 'They are not for sale'," admitted Ancelotti. "I have said that Kaka should not leave. He is the central part of the future. But I am just the trainer. I train the team. I do not choose the players.</p>
              <p>"If Kaka leaves then it is something I will have to accept. The question now is down to Kaka. It's up to him if he stays or goes." The statement is hardly going to ease tensions among a militant support who have only been able to look upon in complete bewilderment as City put together possibly the most astonishing transfer of all time.</p>
              <p>Yet Ancelloti also tried to adopt a calming approach. "We cannot be too alarmed," he cautioned. "I know what the fans are thinking but they have to be brave. "The aims for the team remain the same, with or without Kaka."</p>
              <p>The idea of life without Kaka is one Milan may have to get used to. Indeed, a part of owner Silvio Berlusconi might privately hope the transfer goes through, given the staggering fee, more than double the current £47million world record Real Madrid paid for Zinedine Zidane in 2001, Milan stand to pocket.</p>
              <p>However, there is still plenty of work to do. Chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak and executive chairman Garry Cook need to convince Kaka's father Bosco Leite of their grandiose plans.</p>
              <p>Such is the trust between father and son, if City are successful in that aim, Kaka could well be making his debut against Newcastle on January 28 as planned.</p>
              <p>With a clause almost certainly going to be inserted into any contract Kaka signs allowing the player to leave should City not reach a certain level - probably Champions League qualification - within a set time-frame - 18 months has been mentioned - the Blues hierarchy cannot afford to remain static in other areas over the next fortnight as they close in on their number one target.</p>
              <p>Hamburg have confirmed a bid has been received from the Eastlands outfit for their highly-rated Dutch midfield star Nigel de Jong. "Manchester City have signalled their interest in the player and made us an offer," said Hamburg spokesman Jorn Wolf. "We now have to sit down and decide if it is worth considering."</p>
              <p>The feeling at City is that De Jong will make the move, which would at least mean Kaka is not settling in on his own should he decide to accept an estimated £500,000 weekly salary.</p>

              <h1>Kaka's Manchester City deal to spark AC Milan raid on Premier League</h1>
              <h2>AC Milan will use the £103 million they expect to receive from Manchester City for Kaka to make a series of raids on the Premier League and thoroughly restructure their ageing squad.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01241/kaka-milan_1241236c.jpg" alt="Kaka move could spark Premier League raid from AC Milan" width="460" height="287"></p>
              <p><span class="caption"><em>Cash flow: Kaka move could spark Premier League raid from AC Milan</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Top of their list of targets are the Arsenal pair Emmanuel Adebayor and Gael Clichy, with Milan prepared to part with close to £40 million to bring them to the San Siro. Inadvertently, City will turn the Milan club into a powerful Premier League predator.</strong></p>
              <p>Arsene Wenger, the Arsenal manager, lost Mathieu Flamini to Milan in the summer and the Italian club have been keen on bringing Adebayor and Clichy to the San Siro after Arsenal so impressively eliminated them from the Champions League last season.</p>
              <p>But City manager Mark Hughes said last night there was still some way to go to complete the proposed world-record deal for Kaka. “There’s plans to speak to his father because he is his main adviser so at some point that meeting has to take place,” Hughes said.</p>
              <p>“It’s not a simple transfer. It’s not a case of talking to the club, then talking to the boy and getting the deal done in 24 or 48 hours. If it is to be completed it will be very complex because there are so many elements to it.”</p>
              <p>Crucially Silvio Berlusconi, the Milan owner, has made it clear it will be “very difficult” to keep the Brazilian at the club and compared his situation with that of Andrei Shevchenko before he moved to Chelsea in the summer of 2006. “Nothing is decided yet but it is very difficult to ask someone to stay and respect his contract when he has been offered such a huge amount of money,” Berlusconi said.</p>
              <p>While losing Kaka will hurt Milan, it will allow the club to revitalise an ageing squad. The cash from the projected deal would be used to secure the £8.5 million signing of Liverpool’s Daniel Agger and, if sources close to the club are to be believed, Chelsea’s unsettled centre-back Alex.</p>
              <p>The deal will also be good news for David Beckham, who is on loan at Milan, as should the Kaka deal go through, the club will increase their efforts to secure the former captain, whose global profile will help limit the impact of losing a sponsors’ favourite.</p>
              <p>Sources in Milan suggested the club will also use the cash to move for Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon of Juventus — a long-standing City target himself — as well as doing some refurbishing work on their San Siro stadium.</p>
              <p>The pursuit of Kaka has not prevented City making moves for other targets. They are favourites to sign Craig Bellamy from West Ham and Steve Bruce hinted yesterday that they are also interested in signing his Wigan player Wilson Palacios.</p>

              <h1>Milan To Buy Adebayor, Essien, Clichy &amp; Alex With Kaka Cash - Report</h1>
              <h2>The Rossoneri could raid both Arsenal and Chelsea with the money they would make from Kaka's possible sale to City...</h2>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/40005_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="222"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>With Silvio Berlusconi conceding he could be forced to sell Kaka to Manchester City, Milan are already planning to blow the money on four Premier League based players.</strong><br><br><em>La Gazzetta Dello Sport</em> claims that the Rossoneri will raid both Arsenal and Chelsea with the money they receive for Kaka in an attempt to strengthen all areas.<br><br>The €100 million income will be divided between both London clubs in order to strip them of some of their most valuable assets. The big rumble involves Arsenal, as the Rossoneri will offer €35m for Emmanuel Adebayor and a further €15m for Gael Clichy. Both players have been long-time targets of coach Carlo Ancelotti and €50m for the pair could be enough to convince Arsene Wenger to let them leave. <br><br>Milan have a good relationship with the Gunners after last year's business involving Mathieu Flamini and Philippe Senderos.<br><br>The other €50m will go to Chelsea, with €35m being slapped in front of Roman Abramovich for Michael Essien. The Ghana international is on the way back from injury and could be heading straight for the San Siro, rather than a return to Stamford Bridge. Alex, unconvincing for the Blues thus far, will also be a €15m target.<br><br>Before Milan raid, of course, Milan will need to ensure that the money from Eastlands for Kaka comes though. The very latest reports suggest that Kaka will sign for City on Monday, but is expected to play for Milan later today when they clash with Fiorentina.</p>
