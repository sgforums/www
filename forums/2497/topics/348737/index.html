              <p><strong>Robin van Persie says his
              form this season has been down to an improvement in his fitness as well
              as an increased awareness of his responsibilities. </strong></p>
              <p>The Arsenal striker has scored nine goals in the league this season
              and five more in the FA Cup and Champions League and has just been
              voted his club’s player of the month for the third time in a row.</p>
              <p>And the 25-year-old Holland international says the improvements largely come down to improvements in his health and fitness.</p>
              <p>“The biggest step forward I have taken has been in terms of my fitness,” he told Voetbal International.</p>
              <p>“I had enjoyed good times before, but that only ever lasted four months or so before I suffered an injury.</p>
              <p>“I’ve learned that it is better to communicate with the coaches and the medical staff.</p>
              <p>“In the past, I would have muscle pain and, even if it was
              recommended that I take it easy, I would nag them to let me play. Now,
              I realise it is better to trust in their opinions.</p>
              <p>“In the summer, I set myself a goal: to keep fit all season. I must say that I’m on track.”</p>
              <p>He added: “People underestimate the importance of a good diet.</p>
              <p>“I was a huge carnivore, but someone at Arsenal said that having a lot of meat can have a negative effect on your muscles.</p>
              <p>“Now, I only eat meat once a week and never on the day before a game."</p>
              <p>Van Persie also revealed that he has developed the mental aspect of his game this season.</p>
              <p>“Technically, I am not doing anything all that different to what I did before,” he said.</p>
              <p>“The biggest difference is that I have learned, in various ways, how to be more effective for the team.</p>
              <p>“I don’t always have to score goals. It can be helpful just to keep your opponents under pressure.”</p>
