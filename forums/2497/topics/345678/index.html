              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p>Arsenal's bid to land Andrei Arshavin remains ongoing, despite Zenit St
              Petersburg announcing a fee had been agreed for the Russian
              international.</p>
              <p>While Zenit released a statement claiming personal terms were
              now the only obstacle in the way of completing the protracted transfer
              saga, it is understood a deal between the clubs has yet to be
              officially reached.</p>
              <p>Although the Russians have softened their stance over the
              original £20million demanded for the 27-year-old playmaker, Arsenal
              remain resolute in their offer of £12million plus add ons and, as yet,
              no further improved bid has been tabled.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, Gunners manager Arsene Wenger remains keen to
              land his number one transfer target before the transfer window closes
              on February.</p>
              <p>Wenger is set to speak to the media at a press conference ahead
              of the Barclays Premier League trip to Everton, when he will again face
              questions for an update on what has now become a protracted saga.</p>
              <p>Zenit's statement, released late on Monday night, had hinted at an imminent conclusion.</p>
              <p>"The fundamental understanding over the transfer of the player is achieved between the clubs," read the statement.</p>
              <p>"At the moment the basic obstacle in realisation of the transaction is Andrei Arshavin's personal requirements."</p>
              <p>Arshavin, reportedly also attracting interest from Spain, is waiting for the "final decision" over his move.</p>
              <p>He told Russian newspaper Sport Express: "The talks don't depend
              on me. I haven't been in touch with the club management, so I haven't
              heard a clear 'yes' or 'no' yet.</p>

              <h1>Arshavin's Arsenal move held up by wage demands.</h1>

              <p>Sports news in brief from around the
              world on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Soccer - Zenit St Petersburg have agreed an outline deal to
              sell Andrei Arshavin to London side Arsenal but the playmaker's
              demands are holding up a final agreement, the Russian club
              said.</p>
              <p>"An agreement in principle has been reached between the
              clubs on the player's transfer on terms that suit both sides
              and which are in line with the footballer's true market value,"
              Zenit said in a statement late on Monday.</p>
              <p>"At the moment Andrei Arsharvin's personal demands are the
              main obstacle to implementing the deal."</p>
              <p>NFL - The Baltimore Ravens and Carolina Panthers hired new
              defensive coordinators on Monday, the clubs said.</p>
              <p>The Ravens promoted linebackers coach Greg Mattison and the
              Panthers hired former Indianapolis Colts coordinator Ron Meeks.</p>
              <p>Soccer - Glasgow Rangers midfielder Brahim Hemdani has been
              dropped from Algeria's squad for their World Cup warm-up
              against Benin next month.</p>
              <p>Hemdani, who has not played for his Scottish club this
              season, was left out of the squad named by the Algerian
              Football Federation for the match in Blida on Feb. 11.</p>
              <p>The game serves as a warm-up for both countries, who begin
              the final phase of African qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup at
              the end of March.</p>
              <p>Soccer - Paris St Germain have denied newspaper reports
              that 21-year-old midfielder Youssouf Mulumbu was on trial at
              Premier League side West Bromwich Albion.</p>
              <p>"The midfielder is still part of Paris St Germain's
              professional squad," the Ligue 1 club said in a statement
              posted on its website (www.psg.fr) on Tuesday.
