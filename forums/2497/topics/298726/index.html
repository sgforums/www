"You'll never beat me while you're wearing those," he said.<br><br>The event was organised by someone who used to wear Chelsea shorts, too.<br><br>William Gallas, once of Stamford Bridge but now Arsenal's captain, organised the game when he heard that the team existed as part of the club's community programme.<br><br>"It was my idea," said Gallas. "It was something I did with the French national team at Clairefontaine a couple of years ago and I found it a really good experience.<br><br>"Sometimes we forget how lucky we are, how fantastic a job we have. Sometimes we forget how lucky we are to have something as simple as our eyesight. When you see those kids play with such skill and precision, it's amazing."</div>
