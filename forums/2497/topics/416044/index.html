              <h1>Is Chelsea coach Michael Emenalo any good? Better ask the girls...</h1>
              <h2>Michael Emenalo's rapid promotion to the post of Carlo Ancelotti's assistant at Chelsea came as a surprise but the Nigerian's limited coaching experience may be ideally suited to the Premier League's diva-studded world of tantrums and tiaras.</h2>

              <p><strong>After all, the last time he took to the training field Emenalo was in charge of a group of 11-year-old girls. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>Emenalo, 45, was taken to Stamford Bridge as chief scout in 2007 by the then-manager, Avram Grant, straight from the Tucson Soccer Academy in Arizona, where he had been in charge of the '96 Girls side – the school's under-12s – for little more than a year.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>Even that seemed a strange appointment for a man who had enjoyed a successful, if hardly glittering, professional playing career, which peaked with his inclusion in Nigeria's squad for the 1994 World Cup. If his club employers were rather less distinguished – he had spells in the United States, Belgium and Germany, as well as a brief stint at Notts County, before retiring in 2000 after two years at Maccabi Tel Aviv, then coached by Grant – his coaching CV was even less impressive.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>Though the current West Ham manager offered him a post in Tel Aviv after retiring, Emenalo's only previous bib-and-cone based experience was a year as a volunteer coach at Virginia Tech university in Blacksburg.</p>
              <p>"Michael arrived in Tucson because it was his wife's [Erin Fahey, also a coach] home own," said Charlie Kendrick, a colleague at Tucson academy. "As soon as we heard people of their experience at such high levels were around, we took the opportunity to have them work with our kids. We could not miss that chance."</p>
              <p>It was clearly a task Emenalo relished. In a statement published on the Tucson academy website after his appointment as director of player development, he indicated that he saw his responsibility as "pre-formation training".</p>
              <p>"It ensures that the player, at a formative age, is presented with the right soccer information and training before bad habits, and inexperienced coaching set in," he said. "It is our collective experience that a young player cannot excel in soccer unless he/she can completely master and dominate the ball.</p>
              <p>"To gain that mastery, it is crucial to start early. It is also our intention to recreate the 'street soccer' credential by providing a safe, fun and culturally relevant environment that encourages more spontaneity and freedom of expression with the ball."</p>
              <p>Such a philosophy may come too late to turn John Terry into Ronaldinho, though the former England captain and his team-mates would do well to note that Emenalo's methods bear fruit, as proved by the Tucson academy side who came under his wing.</p>
              <p>That under-12s side finished the 2007-08 campaign – under the guidance of Emenalo's replacement, Charlie MacCabe – as runners-up in the Arizona State Cup. Little wonder Emenalo is remembered as fondly in Tucson as he is at Boston University, where he played as a student and is included in the Hall of Fame.</p>
              <p>"We do not really have a soccer culture in America," said Kendrick. "So maybe people at the time did not realise how lucky they were to have someone of his calibre working with their children.</p>
              <p>"Maybe now they see that he has got such a big job, they will. Those of us who worked with him are all rooting for him. If anyone deserves success, it's Michael."</p>
