              <h1 class="titlestory">Tottenham to rip up transfer policy with Petrov bid</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> are ready to rip up their transfer policy to land <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> winger Martin Petrov.</p>
              <p><em>The Times</em> says Harry Redknapp stepped up his interest in Petrov last night after Luka Modric broke a leg during <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> Hotspur’s 2-1 victory over Birmingham City.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> have had a longstanding interest in the Bulgaria winger, but have
              pulled out of previous moves because of concerns about his knee injury
              and age.</p>
              <p>Petrov has been an unused substitute for City’s three league
              matches this season and his chances of starting have been adversely
              affected by the high-profile arrivals.</p>
              <p>At 30, his signing would highlight Tottenham’s change in
              transfer strategy under Redknapp, who is less concerned about buying
              players with a sell-on value than Daniel Levy, his chairman.</p>

              <p class="article">The Croatian midfield schemer will join Tottenham in a £2.5million move.</p>
              <p class="article">Spurs boss Redknapp said: "I'm really delighted. I signed him for Portsmouth and he's a fantastic player and a great lad.</p>
              <p class="article">"I've already got two fantastic Croatian players - Luka Modric and Vedran Corluka - who can help him settle in."</p>
              <p class="article">Kranjcar, 25, who will sign a four-year deal, was allowed to leave Croatia's World Cup training camp last night. He is expected to have a medical today.</p>
              <p class="article">Redknapp is poised to bolster his squad further with deadline-day moves for Manchester City's out-of-favour winger Martin Petrov and Pompey's England goalkeeper David James.</p>
              <p class="article">Bulgarian Petrov, 30, will be allowed to leave City for free - and national team-mate Dimitar Berbatov has told him joining Spurs would be a great move.</p>
              <p class="article">Berba, who quit Tottenham for Manchester United last year, said: "I wish a lot that Martin will join Tottenham. The behaviour of City to him is not good.</p>
              <p class="article">"Tottenham is a bigger club than City. I know from sure sources that Martin will have a chance to play at Tottenham."</p>

              <p class="article">Veteran keeper James, 39, another Redknapp signing during his Pompey days, would also add strength to a squad that is missing first-choice keeper Heurelho Gomes with a thigh injury.</p>
              <p class="article">Spurs are also thought to be close to taking Crystal Palace starlet Victor Moses, 18, on loan after beating off interest from Wigan.</p>

              <p>Omg i can't believe this... as a tottenham fan i'm pleased that they're going to sign 2 great signings in Kranjar and Petrov... at reasonable prices too!</p>
              <p>We need competition down the middle, right now Huddlestone has not been entirely convincing that he deserve a first team place. Kranjar is a gifted player with wonderful technique, just need to beef up on his consistency.</p>
              <p>As for Petrov, he has been kept quiet on the bench for quite a while, so might need some time to rediscover his excellent early man city career form.</p>
              <p>Still dont see the need to sign a 39 yr old keeper...</p>

              <p>The <em><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Portsmouth</span></abbr> News</em> says Kranjcar was poised to be reunited with Harry Redknapp at Spurs today in a deal believed to be in the region of £3m.</p>
              <p>He was set to be followed out of Fratton Park by James, who has been pursued by both <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sunderland</span></abbr> and Spurs.</p>

              <p><strong>Martin Petrov's agent has revealed his client's disappointment at failing to secure a move to Tottenham.</strong></p>
              <p>Spurs were reported to be keen on striking a deal for the Manchester City winger as they look to counter the loss of Luka Modric to a broken leg.</p>
              <p>Reports suggested Petrov would move to White Hart Lane in a deal which would see David Bentley moving in the opposite direction.</p>
              <p>However, the proposed move broke down, with Petrov's representative Luchezar Taney claiming "Manchester City rejected the deal mainly due to manager Mark Hughes' unwillingness".</p>
              <p>The failure to put an agreement in place has come as a disappointment to the players concerned, as both have struggled for regular football of late.</p>
              <p>Tanev told Bulgarian radio station <em>Darik</em>: "I can say that Martin wanted to join Tottenham. You see that he has some problems at City and that's why he decided to look elsewhere and Spurs made an offer for him.</p>
              <p>"But it's not the end of the world. He has one year of his contract left and we'll see after that."</p>
              <p>Petrov will now focus his attention on forcing his way back into the fold at Manchester City, after a serious knee injury blighted his 2008/09 campaign.</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> signing Niko Kranjcar says he hasn't arrived as a replacement for Luka Modric.</p>
              <p>Kranjcar, 25, said: "I don't feel like a sub for Modric. I came to play
              alongside him in the first team. We've proved we can play together in
              the Croatia team."</p>
              <p>Spurs boss Redknapp signed the playmaker while in charge of Pompey three years ago.</p>
              <p>He becomes the sixth big name to quit the South Coast club this summer.</p>
              <p>Kranjcar added: "I'm not sorry to leave. They've sold almost everyone due to the financial situation."</p>
