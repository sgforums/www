              <h1>PREMIER LEAGUE NEW KIT SPECIAL: The strips your team will be wearing

              It's the moment fans have been waiting for all Spring - their club 
                      revealing the new home, away and third strips for the following season.</div>
              <p>Some
                       fans are delighted with the new kit, some deflated. And before the 
                      official release there is always some dodgy fakes doing the rounds on 
                      the internet.</p>
              <p>So with a whole host of new strips hitting the 
                      stores in the coming weeks - <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail  </span>brings you the best - and worst - of what's on offer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 style="background-color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">ARSENAL </span></h2>
              <p>Not officially revealed or 
                      launched yet but you can clearly see some detail of the Gunners new 
                      jersey in this picture.</p>
              <p>The only question must be why they 
                      have asked Mikael Silvestre to wear it? This is the first of a number of
                       retro outfits we will see next season.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><span class="lightboxPopupLink"> <img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/18/article-1269501-09A2470C000005DC-983_468x335.jpg" alt="70s chic: Mikael Silvestre models the Gunners' new kit" width="468" height="335"> </span>

              </div>
              <p>The kit Arsenal will be wearing was inspired by uniforms they wore 
                      during the Double winning season of 1970-71.</p>
              <p>Well, they've 
                      tried everything else over the last five years - maybe te new shirts can
                       inspire them to silverware.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">SPORTSMAIL
                       VERDICT: </span>Well, we can only see a shoulder but it looks smart. We
                       also like taking inspiration from the Double-wining kit. <span style="font-weight: bold;">7/10</span></p>

              </div>
              <p>Here’s a unique way of choosing your new kit – let the fans do it.</p>
              <p>Birmingham
                       offered their supporters four options for their new strip and the 
                      winner was chosen via an online poll.</p>
              <p>And here's the winner. 
                      With 33 per cent of the vote, this will be the Blues' new home jersey, 
                      shorts and socks when the season restarts in August.</p>
              <p>The 
                      innovative solution to kit selection came after the club signed a 
                      ground-breaking agreement with Chinese sportswear firm Xtep to supply 
                      their kit for the next five years.</p>
              <p>The deal, worth £7.8 million, 
                      has been completed on the back of Carson Yeung’s arrival.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">SPORTSMAIL RATING:</span> Nice V on the neck,
                       but not <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> different to this

              <p>This snazzy number will adorn Trotters’ players and fans next season 
                      and it a marked improvement on the current effort.</p>
              <p>Designed and 
                      manufactured by Reebok, the new home shirt features a raft of features 
                      which no one really understands.</p>
              <p>It has a moisture management 
                      system called ‘Play Dry’ which aids the players’ performance. 
                      Apparently. Very smart - and doesn’t Kevin Davies look proud?</p>
              <p>But 
                      if you squint a bit, it looks exactly the same as the current kit. No?</p>
              <p>All
                       they've done is take the grey stripes away from the bottom and put some
                       Reebok branding on the arms.</p>
              <p>On sale now.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">SPORTSMAIL RATING: </span>Erm, it's white and
                       there's blue and a bit of red it in. Far from inspiring. <span style="font-weight: bold;">5/10</span></p>

              <h2 style="background-color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">CHELSEA<br> </span></h2>
              <p>Calm down dear, it’s just a bit of red on the Chelsea blue kit. The 
                      bright trim is homage to the club’s historical association with the 
                      Chelsea Pensioners.</p>
              <p>A move which will suit the likes of Michael 
                      Ballack, Juliano Belletti, Deco and the rest of the pensioners who are 
                      still turning out for the Blues down to a tee.</p>
              <p>Gone are those 
                      breast plates which adorn the current kit in favour of a simpler style, 
                      or ‘retro’ look which is de rigeur at the moment.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">SPORTSMAIL RATING:</span> It's Chelsea blue 
                      and the red is a nice nod in the direction of the club's history. But 
                      Lampard and Terry look very angry in this picture. Are they trying to 
                      sell shirts or start a fight? <span style="font-weight: bold;">8/10.</span></p>

              <p>New kit, new sponsor, new players… 
                      new manager? This new Liverpool shirt has been designed to match the kit
                       the club wore when they last won the league back in 1990.</p>
              <p>A fine 
                      idea seeing as they have exhausted every other avenue trying to 
                      recapture bygone glory days. They may as well try and design a lucky 
                      shirt.</p>
              <p>The question is if Rafa Benitez will be around to watch the
                       Red’s gallop around in it next season?</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">SPORTSMAIL RATING: </span>The round neck looks smart but putting 
                      Steven Gerrard's name on the back of the shirt? A little presumptuous, 
                      don't you think? <span style="font-weight: bold;">7/10.</span></p>

              <p>We

                      ones United will be striding out in next season. </p>
              <p>What we do know

                      unveiling a new white away kit.</p>
              <p>Supporters will discover whether 
                      these really are the new designs when the club plays on their pre-season
                       tour to the United States in July.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">SPORTSMAIL RATING:</span> Fake or not - we like these shirts. No 
                      great tracks of black across the home kit - a retro design which harps

              <p>Calm down dear, it’s just a bit of red on the Chelsea blue kit. The

              <p>The 
                      shirt front is currently blank as the club's deal with online gambling 
                      company Mansion expires in June and a new sponsor is yet to be secured. </p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">SPORTSMAIL RATING: </span>On first sight, 
                      this looks really good. The only problem could be a sponsors logo 
                      spoiling the smart retro feel. <span style="font-weight: bold;">8/10</span></p>

                      by Adlene Guedioura</p>
              </div>
              <p>It's the pretty gold shirt with black 
                      collar we expect from a Wolves kit - but they've incorporated some of 
                      that fancy technology which helps players so much.</p>
              <p>The club's 
                      website tells us that this new kit is 'made from a textured performance 
                      fabric incorporating innovative Cool Dry technology that absorbs 
                      moisture away from the skin to ensure an improved comfort and fit.'</p>
              <p>Nice.</p>
              <p>Unveiled
                       for the last game of the season - the 2-1 win over Sunderland - the 
                      supporters are already big fans.</p>
              <p>And in a move many clubs have 
                      taken recently - this jersey has been designed with a retro feel to it</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">SPORTSMAIL RATING: </span>Tidy and already 
                      very popular with the fans. Who are we to argue? <span style="font-weight: bold;">6/10</span></p>
