              <h1>England star Jermain Defoe wrongly arrested and held in cells for five hours<br></h1>
              <p>Footballer Jermain Defoe was 'unlawfully' arrested last night on
              suspicion of driving while disqualified, his lawyer has revealed.</p>
              <p>Defoe's
              solicitor said the Tottenham and England striker was not disqualified
              but had been held for more than five hours at a police station in
              Harlow, Essex.</p>
              <p>Essex Police said the arrest had been based on 'inaccurate' information held on a computer.</p>

              <p>A spokesman said the player was released as soon as the error came to light.</p>
              <p>Defoe,
              26, of Cuffley, Hertfordshire, was convicted of speeding earlier this
              month by a district judge sitting in Chelmsford, Essex.</p>
              <p>He was disqualified from driving but the disqualification was suspended pending an appeal - Defoe denied any offence.</p>

              <p>The Tottenham striker (pictured) was stopped in his car at
              2.30am on Monday in Loughton, Essex and accused of driving while
              disqualified.</p>
              <p>Defoe was taken to Harlow police station, but
              despite explaining that a six-month ban had been suspended pending an
              appeal, the 26-year-old was taken to a cell.</p>
              <p>Essex police
              subsequently released Defoe without charge at 7.30am and later admitted
              the arrest was based on "inaccurate information" in their computer
              records.</p>
              <p>Upon release Defoe was refused access to his car or a
              set of keys that included his front-door key. As a result he missed a
              flight to China with his Tottenham team-mates.</p>
              <p>The footballer's lawyer, Nick Freeman, said his client is considering legal action.</p>
              <p>"I have advised him he has got a strong case for wrongful arrest and false imprisonment," Freeman said.</p>
              <p>"How would any respectable member of society feel about that treatment? They would be upset.</p>
              <p>"These things shouldn't happen."</p>
