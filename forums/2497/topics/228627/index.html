            <div class='col-md body'>Mourinho hits out at Chelsea form<br><br>Mourinho was furious after his side's home draw against Fulham<br>Boss Jose Mourinho has made a scathing assessment of Chelsea after the draw with Fulham left them six points behind Premiership leaders Manchester United.<br><br>On Saturday the Blues were held to a second 2-2 draw at home in a week after a Boxing Day point against Reading and Mourinho said: "This is not asurprise.<br><br>"In this moment Chelsea cannot defend. I am the first to know that.<br><br>"Maybe we are not as good as we think, maybe I am not such a good boss, maybe the players are not such good players."<br><br>The result meant Chelsea slipped further behind United in the race for the title and Mourinho publicly named several players as his side's weak links in recent weeks.<br><br>I need the best goalkeeper and the best central defender in the world back<br><br>"What can you do with Michael Ballack, with Paulo Ferreira, with Geremi? Nothing," he said. "The players have no qualities adapting to the game opponents are playing against us.<br><br>"Furthermore, Andriy Shevchenko, Shaun Wright-Phillips and Solomon Kalou are just not performing. Didier Drogba is the only one doing his best at the moment.<br><br>"When the opponent sees one mistake and another mistake they smell the chance. It's exactly the opposite of previous periods with us."<br><br>And Mourinho admitted he may ask owner Roman Abramovich to spend more money in the January transfer window in a bid to catch up with United, although he would prefer to have number one keeper Petr Cech and skipper John Terry back from injury.<br><br>"If the club ask for my opinion I would say yes to new players but at the same time, when I see the eyes of some clubs and they want incredible money for very ordinary players, I would say no," he said.<br><br>"In fact I need to spend nothing. It is difficult but I hope that John Terry and Petr Cech are back soon. I don't need millions next month, I need the best goalkeeper and the best central defender in the world back."<br><br>Terry hopes to return to action in January following a back operation, while Cech is also on course for a comeback early in 2007 after fracturing his skull in a collision with Reading's Stephen Hunt in mid-October.<br><br></div>

More like they are feeling the pressure of chasing at the moment and get nervous towards the end of a game when they are only leading by 1 goal. There were signs earlier already with Wigan and Everton. I think they are going through a bad run like most teams experience. But they should be back very soon after the 2 weeks break from the EPL.<br><br>But then again, with the knid of money that they have spent... Not winning should be consider a failure for mour.<br><br><span style="color: olive;">2003 HernÃ¡n Crespo - $16.8m, can't remember who else...<br><br>2004 Drogba - $24m, Tiago Mendes $10m - JaroÂšÃ­k $7m - Ricardo Carvalho $19.85m - Paulo Ferreira $ 13.2m Total = $74.05m<br><br>2005 Essien - $24.4m, Asier del Horno $8m - SWP $21m, Lassana Diarra $3m Total = $56.4m<br><br>2006 Shevchenko - $30.8m, Mikel John Obi $16m - Salomon Kalou $8-10m - Khalid Boulahrouz $8.5m, A Cole $20m (-$15 from Gallas sale)  Total = $83.3m</span><br><br>In the last 3 years alone, they have spent an average of more than $70m a season where others have probably only manager $10 to $20m.<br><br>The current back four alone already cost more than $60m so no excuse... Carvalho $19.85m - Paulo Ferreira $ - $13.2m  Boulahrouz $8.5m, A Cole $20m. They should be more than able with each being a member of their national team and Cole consider the best left-back in the world at the moment.<br><br>If you look at Arsenal, isn't it worst? No Gallas, no Lauren and no proper left-back... yet they can still do a decent job even without the funds to buy and buy... its more down to confidence at the moment. But they should be back i guess.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Jose told to sort out Blues mess</strong></span><br><br>JOSE MOURINHO has been given a stark warning by the Chelsea board: Sort out this mess Â— now! MourinhoÂ’s Blues have fallen six points behind Premiership leaders Manchester United and there is serious concern around Stamford Bridge that Chelsea will not win the title.<br><br>Owner Roman Abramovich looked on in despair at the sloppy 2-2 home draw against Fulham on Saturday. And other board members were unimpressed by the performance and MourinhoÂ’s post-match comments in which the Portuguese boss said the team could not defend and that only half of the side justified their places.<br><br>Mourinho admitted: Â“On one hand, you can find four or five players who have been performing high since the beginning of the season. Â“And on another hand, you can find four or five players performing nothing for the team and thatÂ’s the situation we live at this time.<br><br>Â“Shevchenko is not performing. Or Kalou. Or Shaun Wright-Phillips. And we cannot defend. What can you do with Geremi? Nothing. Or Paulo Ferreira? Nothing.Â”<br><br>Mourinho has been told to do what it takes to get Chelsea back on track. That involves signing Micah Richards from Manchester City. It is the first time Mourinho has been under any significant pressure since his arrival at Stamford Bridge 2Â½ years ago. And the warnings come just a week after an interview appeared with Abramovich in which the Russian billionaire admitted he and his manager were not close.<br><br>The board have been stunned by ChelseaÂ’s displays in the last four games in which the Blues conceded two goals on each occasion. They still support Mourinho but the love affair with the boss is not as it was.<br><br></div>
