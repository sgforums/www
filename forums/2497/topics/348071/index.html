              <h2>Singapore Armed Forces FC have set their sights on a clean sweep of honours this season.</h2>
              <p><span><span>“The boys are as motivated as ever as they are keen to make
              history. Our intention is to win both league and cup,” was the message
              by head coach Richard Bok as he talked of his side's aspirations for
              2009 during the pre-season press conference.<br><br>Led by skipper Aleksandar Duric, the Warriors achieved an unprecedented double-double in 2008. <br><br>First,
              Singapore's most successful outfit fended off the challengers of
              closest challengers Home United and the rejuvenated Super Reds before
              landing the league title last year.<br><br>Next, the Warriors held off
              spirited resilience from Woodlands Wellington which witnessed their
              triumph in the RHB Singapore Cup Final.<br><br>With a squad brimming with talent and confidence in abundance, little is expected in terms of changes.<br><br>Following
              a few departures, three new players have signed on for SAFFC - Korean
              extraordinaire Park Tae Won, young hotshot Guntur Djafril and Zulfadli
              Zainal Abidin from Young Lions.<br><br>Brought in to provide a new
              dimension and dynamism in the Warriors' attack, Park's move had been
              one of the most celebrated deals in the off-season.<br><br>Having stated his intention to win serious titles, the player is very much elated to be part of the team.<br><br>“I'm delighted to have joined the number one team in Singapore, and my aim is to win the championship.”<br><br>Back
              to their ongoing preparations to the new NTUC Income Yeo's S.League
              season, which begins in a week's time, Bok has reasons to be pleased
              with how proceedings have gone.<br><br>“Our preparations could have
              been better with the presence of national players. Nevertheless, we
              train hard with the core of the squad still very much present.<br><br>“We
              worked immensely hard and emphasised on fitness, as we wanted the
              players to step up to another level so that they would be able to
              thrive on the big stage.<br><br>“In short, we have enhanced training to afford out players the opportunity to perform even better.”<br><br>For
              any team at the top, it is already difficult to be up at the summit let
              alone stay there - the Warriors however have somehow found a way to do
              so.<br><br>Hence, how would Bok assess his side's chances and the potential threats posed by SAFFC's rivals?<br><br>“As expected, the title challenge is tough every year. With our stature we want to challenge for the title annually.”</span></span></p>
