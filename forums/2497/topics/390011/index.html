              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Portsmouth" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/portsmouth"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Portsmouth</strong></span></a><strong>'s troubled season took another dramatic twist last night when Balram Chainrai seized control of the club from Ali al-Faraj, making the Hong Kong businessman the fourth owner at Fratton Park this season, following Sacha Gaydamak, Sulaiman al-Fahim and Faraj.</strong></p>
              <p>Chainrai has taken over the 90% shareholding in Portsmouth that was held by Faraj after becoming frustrated that the club had missed deadlines to repay money he was due for substantial loans he gave to them earlier this season.</p>
              <p>Chainrai had loaned at least £17m to Faraj to keep Portsmouth afloat through Portpin, the company he owns with his Israeli <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Business" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/business"><span style="color: #005689;">business</span></a> partner, Levi Kushnir, and their associates. Those loans were secured against the stadium, the club's future television revenue and Faraj's 90% share.</p>
              <p>Angered by Portsmouth's failure to make repayments on the finance, despite Portpin continually extending the deadlines, Chainrai's patience ran out yesterday, and he instructed his lawyers to act. Under the terms of the loan Faraj's 90% shareholding in Portsmouth was frozen and passes to Chainrai. It is understood Faraj may have to instigate court proceedings if he wishes to challenge the move.</p>
              <p>Chainrai had expected to receive a sizeable repayment when the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Premier League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span></a> paid all of its 20 clubs a £7m instalment of television revenue early last month. Portsmouth's, though, was withheld by the governing body as the club's dire financial predicament meant they had been unable to pay transfer monies due to English and European clubs. A proportion of these were paid by the league using the television money.</p>
              <p>Chainrai travelled to England last month but was unable to secure the repayments. It is thought that he informed Mark Jacob, Portsmouth's executive director, and Daniel Azougy, who oversee Portsmouth in Faraj's continuing absence, of his disquiet then.</p>
              <p>Speaking to the Guardian last night Chainrai said: "Portpin have made substantial loans to Portsmouth to try and ensure the club's future. Portpin will [now] continue to work for the best interests of the club." He hopes to appoint two new members to the Portsmouth board today and is intent on stabilising the finances before looking to attract investors.</p>
              <p>Faraj turned to Chainrai for money after his takeover from Fahim, via his investment vehicle Falcondrone Limited, in early October. The deal bought Faraj 90%, while Fahim retained the remaining shareholding and became Portsmouth's non-­executive chairman. Faraj's takeover, though, hit almost immediate difficulties. Faraj and his associates struggled to source the finance to keep the club a going concern. They turned to Chainrai who, through Portpin, provided the loans.</p>
              <p>It is understood that Chainrai and his associates had continually sought a meeting with Faraj to discuss the issue of ­repayments. But Faraj, a Saudi Arabian businessman, has never visited Portsmouth since he took over and Chainrai was unable to secure face-to-face talks.</p>
              <p>Despite being Faraj's lawyer Jacob has also admitted he has never met his client. Chainrai was yesterday in London, where he held a series of meetings before overseeing the move to freeze Faraj's holding in Portsmouth.</p>
              <p>Portsmouth, who lost 1-0 at Fulham last night, have endured a financially stricken season which has included failing to pay their players on time on four occasions – once under Fahim's ownership and on three occasions after Faraj took control. Yesterday the club confirmed the players had finally received their January salaries, five days after last Friday's due day.</p>
              <p>Portsmouth are also fighting a winding-up petition served on the club by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs before Christmas, which will be heard in the high court on 10 February and could send the club into administration.</p>
              <p>Portsmouth are due in court to appeal against the petition before the hearing next Wednesday. Chainrai appealed to HMRC to understand the club's financial predicament. He said: "To help Portsmouth succeed we need the support and understanding of Her Majesty's Revenue to work out a solution."</p>
              <p>Beyond Chainrai, who is said to share the concern of Portsmouth fans regarding the club's direction, Gaydamak is also owed at least £28m, of which a £9m instalment due at midnight last Sunday was missed by Faraj.</p>
              <p>Gaydamak has described himself as a soft creditor who is currently refusing to demand repayment, as that would almost certainly force Portsmouth into administration. Chainrai, too, wishes to avoid that eventuality.</p>
              <p>Last night Portsmouth declined to comment. It is understood Gaydamak was unaware of Chainrai's intervention.</p>

              The last-minute negotiations between Pompey's lawyers and HMRC came a week after businessman Balram Chainrai became the club's fourth owner this season.
              <p>An agreement has already been reached with the creditors other than HMRC who have been named in the case, which relates to a reported £7.5m Vat bill.</p><p>Pompey's lawyers had been attempting to persuade HMRC to allow the club to pay a substantial part of the money owed, with the rest of the debt being rescheduled.</p><p>Chainrai, a Hong Kong businessman, is looking to sell the club quickly and has no wish to see it go under as he has made substantial loans to Portsmouth.</p><p>Chief executive Peter Storrie said in his programme notes ahead of Tuesday's Premier League 1-1 draw against Sunderland: "I already have more than one interested party and am hopeful that we can finally find owners who have the best interests of everyone at the club at heart in order to move us forward."</p><p>However, Brendon Bone, of supporters' group SOS Pompey, told BBC Sport: "The talk about potential new buyers is all hearsay.</p><p>"We are hearing nothing but noise about selling on the club from the new owner, but if he does sell it on we hope he sells it to a football man.</p><p>"If all else fails at Portsmouth, Fratton Park can only be used for football, and we'd hope the council will take it over as a community club.</p><table class="storycontent " border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

              <p>Bottom-of-the-table Pompey have debts of £60m and are six points from safety.</p>
              <p>Their financial woes have meant their players have been paid late on four occasions this season.</p>
              <p>Portsmouth are also involved in a separate dispute with former owner Sacha Gaydamak over whether they have missed a deadline in paying a £9m chunk of the £28m they owe to him.</p>
              <p>However, it is thought unlikely that Gaydamak will take any action to push the club towards administration because to do so would reduce his chances of getting his money back.</p>
              <p>In addition the Fratton Park team are being sued by former defender Sol Campbell for £1.7m for unpaid image rights.</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Portsmouth</span></abbr> stars would be allowed to leave for free if the club went bust, it has been revealed.</p>
              <p>The <em>Mirror</em> says Pompey stars can find new homes immediately should the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> strugglers be forced into liquidation by the tax man.</p>
              <p>David James and fellow wanted men in Avram Grant's side will be free
              agents when their pay cheques stop - and can move despite the FIFA
              transfer window being shut.</p>
              <p>And that would start a mad scramble by Premier sides to pick on
              the Pompey carcass if they become the first top-flight club to
              disappear.</p>
              <p>One top <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> official said last night: "This means that all of football's artificial laws will be changed.</p>
              <p>"Clubs and players have been protected in the past as 'football
              creditors' were always paid first when they went into administration.

              <p>Premier League chiefs are hoping to push through dramatic emergency measures to ensure Portsmouth
              stay afloat and fulfil their fixtures this season — and their survival
              could depend on the 19 other teams in England’s top division.</p>
              <p>Richard Scudamore, the chief executive, will conduct a ring round of Portsmouth’s<br>Barclays Premier League rivals this weekend. He will ask if they object to the club’s<br>parachute payment, in the region of £11million, being brought forward and paid immediately toward a £12.1m bill from the taxman.</p>
              <p>The Premier League has already taken the drastic step of advancing a payment of<br>roughly £2m to all of its members, so that Portsmouth will be able to at least meet<br>some of the demands of HM Revenue and Customs in the High Court next week.</p>
              <p>The
              initial payment, part of the Premier League’s standardised cash flow
              arrangement that gives some money to the clubs in instalments through
              the season, was not due for another two months. </p>

              <p>But the 20 clubs will receive that payment this week as Scudamore scrambles his<br>resources in an attempt to keep Portsmouth solvent and avoid a humiliating hit for the<br>Premier League brand.</p>
              <p>The issue of the parachute payment is more sensitive, however, as all clubs stand to<br>gain
              or lose materially if Portsmouth cease trading and have to withdraw
              from the league. In that event, their results for the season would be
              wiped out, which would potentially be of benefit to some teams.</p>
              <p>Chelsea, for instance, would lose three points, while Manchester United would lose<br>six, meaning the gap at the top would widen from one point to four.</p>
              <p>Liverpool, who lost at Fratton Park earlier in the season, would not drop a point, while Arsenal and Manchester City, who have already beaten Portsmouth home and away, would lose six each.</p>
              <p>A revised league table without Portsmouth’s results would see City fall to seventh place, behind Tottenham Hotspur and Aston Villa. </p>

              <span class="lightboxPopupLink"> <img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/11/article-1250363-08405C76000005DC-206_468x563.jpg" alt="099.2ND.12.jpg" width="468" height="563"></span></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><br></div>
              <p>This is why Scudamore is anxious to conduct a straw poll of clubs
              before making a decision, although he will impress on the chairmen the
              wider issue of damage to the image of the Premier League should a club
              fail to complete their fixture programme.</p>
              <p>Giving Portsmouth
              the parachute payment made to those relegated to the Championship each
              season does not make the presumption that the club will go down.</p>
              <p>It is merely the guaranteed minimum amount Portsmouth can expect to receive from the Premier League on August 1. </p>

              </div>
              <p>Scudamore
              will argue that if any club were in Portsmouth’s position, even
              Manchester United, this is the most the Premier League could do.</p>
              <p>He
              will make the case that no extra money is being found to fund
              Portsmouth, and that the club are not being favoured in any way.</p>
              <p>They
              are merely receiving in advance money that is already due to be paid
              later in the year, to stave off a unique financial situation.</p>
              <p>He
              will argue that it is of paramount importance that the league season
              continue without disruption. Together, the advance payment made this
              week and the advanced parachute payment would more than meet the total
              bill owed to HMRC, although Portsmouth dispute a percentage of it.</p>
              <p>Yet
              there could be objections, particularly from the small group of clubs
              with least to lose if Portsmouth go under when the High Court deadline
              passes at 4pm on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Liverpool, Wigan Athletic, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Burnley would stay on the same points total if Portsmouth went bust, while Sunderland would lose only two points and Hull City one.</p>
              <p>These
              six, plus Chelsea, could be claimed to have a vested interest in
              Portsmouth’s demise — although all bar Sunderland still have Portsmouth
              to play and may be hopeful of collecting three points. </p>

              <p>Scudamore will ask the
              clubs to put any selfish considerations aside, however, and focus
              instead on the harm to the prestige of the Premier League, particularly
              abroad, if one of their members were to fold mid-season.</p>
              <p>The
              ongoing fiasco at Portsmouth, now on their fourth owner this season —
              Balram Chainrai, whose first act was to announce the club are up for
              sale — is already a source of embarrassment to Scudamore.</p>
              <p>Although the Premier League have never lost a member to liquidation, it is a myth that<br>clubs do not go bust in English football.</p>
              <p>Aldershot
              dropped out of the Football League in March 1992 and all their results
              were declared null and void, and the following season Maidstone United
              failed to start the campaign for financial reasons.</p>
              <p>The demise of these clubs is the reason the top four divisions still number 92 teams, not 94.</p>
