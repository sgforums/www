              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>SOCCER superstar Dwight Yorke was one of the most feared strikers in the game during his glittering career with Aston Villa and Manchester United. And off the pitch, the legendary player continued to score like a champion . . . swapping goals for gorgeous GIRLS galore. </em> </p>
              <p><em>LAST week Dwight, 37, told all about his turbulent relationship with Jordan in our serialisation of his new autobiography Born to Score. Today, in extracts adapted by DOUGLAS WIGHT, he reveals the incredible lengths he went to in bedding a Premiership squad of stunners . . . often with HILARIOUS results. </em> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>EAGLE-EYED Man United boss Alex Ferguson had just spotted the build-up to a scoring opportunity . . . and he knew exactly which player in his side was favourite to hit the net. </strong> </p>
              <p>But this wasn't on the pitch - it was in the lobby of the team's hotel the night before an away game.</p>
              <p>Fergie watched suspiciously as a nervous-looking blonde walked in through the doors and headed towards the lift. </p>
              <p>And the famous features went beetroot as he saw the beauty press the button for the floor where his players were bedding down for the night.</p>
              <p>Dwight Yorke's pre-match nookie plans were in jeopardy. "We were at Coventry and I'd asked an old girlfriend, Zoe, to stay over," says Dwight. </p>
              <p>"It was strictly against the rules - and I knew I'd be for it if Fergie found out. So I hatched a plan". </p>
              <p>It was one of many the Trinidad and Tobago international was to hatch throughout his career as he scored freely on and off the pitch.</p>
              <p>When Dwight wasn't trying to outfox Fergie, he was escaping from a MUM under a BED, hiding a girl under his DUVET, bedding FOUR BEAUTIES in a day and romping in a CAB. </p>
              <p>This time he was sure Fergie would stick to his routine of a talk with team staff at 10pm - so he arranged for Zoe to arrive then. "It was going fine as she stepped into the lift - until a hand forced the doors open and in stepped Fergie," says Dwight.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <h4>Suspect</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"He saw she was heading for the second floor. And he had a prime suspect. Me. </p>
              <p>"I was in bed pretending to be asleep with the door half open for Zoe. Back in the lift, she got out and Fergie followed. She walked past my room and the next thing I heard was that familiar Scottish accent barking from the doorway. </p>
              <p>"'Who's that in there? Whose room is this?' he said. It was time for some acting. 'Who's that? Oh it's you, gaffer. What are you doing here?' I answered. Fergie replied, 'Your door was open, Yorkie - be more careful in future.' And with that, to my relief, he left." </p>
              <p>That would have been that for most young players under Sir Alex's strict command. Door locked. Sleep. No sex. But then Dwight's mobile rang. </p>
              <p>"It was Zoe - she was hiding behind plants at the end of the corridor. She said, 'Your bloody manager was following me! Is it safe?' It was - and all's well that ends well. I scored against Coventry too next day - we beat them 2-1." </p>
              <p>But even Sir Alex didn't get as close as a MUM did to ruining one of Dwight's conquests. At old Villa team mate Mark Bosnich's wedding, he got chatting to a friend who was staying at the same hotel with her parents. "She wanted to be discreet - so we waited until everyone else had gone to bed before sneaking to her room," says Dwight. </p>
              <p>"The next morning there was a knock on the door, followed by a woman's voice, 'Are you in there? Why is your door locked?' It was her mum. </p>
              <p>"There was nothing for it but to grab my clothes and dive under the bed. It was a four-poster and there was barely enough space for a child let alone a grown athlete. </p>
              <p>"I squeezed in, held my breath and then cursed silently as her mum came in, sat on the bed and settled down for a cosy chat about the day before. It was like a scene from a Carry On movie." </p>

              <div id="frontpage-video-container">
              <p>When Man United went on a pre-season tour of Australia in 1999, Sir Alex stayed at home - and Dwight was unstoppable. "There can't be anywhere with so many beautiful women as Australia," he says. "At our Melbourne hotel, we were under curfew with no visitors allowed and security guards in the lifts just to make sure. </p>
              <p>"On my first morning there, I got what would be a regular room call from Albert the kit man - checking up and casting his eye around for signs of revelry.</p>

              <p><em><span style="color: #000000;">Aussie supermodel Gabby Richens - the "Pleasure Machine"</span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"There were none. Or so he thought. After we'd chatted a while he left not realising that all that time there was a girl hiding under the bedsheets!" But Dwight had his eyes on a particular prize - Aussie supermodel Gabby Richens, known as the "Pleasure Machine". The two of them met on a night out and eventually he got her back to his hotel. There was just the small matter of security to get past. Dwight reveals: "That meant I had to get one of Australia's most photographed women past the lift guard. I told him, 'Listen, mate, I've got Gabby coming up. The Pleasure Machine.'</p>
              <p>"His eyes nearly popped out of his head. I gave him 100 US dollars to let her through but would have parted with a year's win bonuses if necessary. We had a spectacular night."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Smitten</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dwight - now dad to son Harvey, seven, with Jordan - also reveals how he celebrated Man United's 1999 Champions League Final victory over Bayern Munich with a late winner hours after the game in Barcelona. After spending all night at a club, he looked at his watch to find it was 7am - and the team coach would be leaving for the airport at 9.</p>
              <p>So the striker grabbed a smitten local beauty and caught a cab back to the team hotel. </p>
              <p>"When we got to my room I just couldn't wait. I fell off the bed three or four times because I was so drunk but we managed to make love three times," he says. "I ended up leaping from the bed, throwing on the same suit, saying 'muchas gracias' and that I had a plane to catch as I rushed out of the room at 9." Even in his early days at Aston Villa, the striker was on top form with the girls. In one 24-hour marathon in 1992 he bedded FOUR women. </p>
              <p>Dwight says: "It began on a night out in Birmingham with my Villa buddies. I took a girl back to my house and next morning she had to dash off to work. But I now had a taste for action and when training finished I phoned a girl I know called Sue. She came to my place and there was time for round two before she hurried off to collect her daughter. </p>
              <p>"Then my phone rang. It was an unhappily married woman I knew and I was more than happy to oblige her. She told her husband she was going to the gym and came round for a workout with me. </p>
              <p>"After she'd gone, a girlfriend from Tamworth called me asking if I fancied dinner? A little wine, some conversation, some food and I could feel my energy levels returning."</p>
              <p>When Villa lifted the League Cup in 1996, Dwight celebrated with a stunning model. It was then that his good fortune hit home. He says: "I woke up at our Wembley hotel after a night celebrating our victory with a beautiful blonde beside me wondering if it was possible life could ever be sweeter." </p>
              <p>Dwight never tired of coming up with unusual ways to fit in a bit of nookie. He recalls: "I had to go up to Glasgow so I contacted a girlfriend who worked there. I stayed the night with her but made sure I booked a taxi for 6.30am to take me south for a 1pm training session. </p>
              <p>"A black cab turned up and, on impulse, I asked the girl if she fancied coming down with me. She said yes. </p>
              <div class="inline-image-right-280">
              <div class="caption">"But it was a long journey and we soon got bored. To pass the time, we started making out in the back of the cab.</div>
              <div class="caption">"There were legs and arms everywhere. But it was great, great fun and what better way to pass the three hours it took us to get back."</div>
              <div class="caption">"That journey cost me £300. As I handed it to the cabby he gave me a cheeky wink. Like all my times with beautiful women, it was great fun."</div>

I remembered he was sold very cheap, 2m pounds only. I suppose fergie would have gotten rid of him for free if he have to.</p></div>
