I guess it had been coming since last season. Jose is a good football coach, if football was the only concern then he is perfect for the job.

From the early 2000 to 2003 or 04, They were nothing anymore... A lot of people lost interest in them, cos Real were playing better and more attractive football. They were considered a "sleeping giant". It was not until Frank Rijkaard's arrival that changed their team around that more started to take an interest on them again. Ronaldinho, Eto'o came and they started playing a kind of football that people and ordinary football fans would pay money to watch... and in this way, increase their fan base further...<br><br>Jose was doing a good job on the field but a terrible one off it... He was dragging Chelsea's good name into the mud so offen with his silly behaviour that it was becoming almost impossible to like the club from a neutral point of view. Of course now that he is gone, and also in such a sudden way... a lot of people feel for him cos many felt that he was entertaining in the epl. My look on this is, yes is was entertaining... he was funny at times and also a total disgust with his taunting and accusation of other club managers and players.<br><br>In short, he was fun to have around if he wasn't the manager of the club you support... But if you were in the Chelsea's owner or directors / management shoes... You can get upset almost every few weeks cos he is dragging their club's name through the mud again and again.<br><br>Is Grant a disaster, well... i am not too sure but time will tell. Anyway, mourinho's last few games wasn't exactly great either... he seem to be losing the plot and have lost some of the players hearts and even had an argument with club captain Terry for going behind his back... My guess is had mourinho stayed on, that result at OT was still likely to be as his last away match at Villa also ended with a 0 - 2 lost and their last 2 home matches against weaker teams ended in a draw. Don't blame Grant for it... the team is going through a bad patch and he also didn't had the services of Drogba and Lampard too.<br><br></div>

Cos Chelsea have a first team of 28 players... Just a Shevchenko alone would make it 3.5% already... How about the Joe Cole, Carlo Cudicini and Ballack... And those who are probably neutral to the sacking like... Pizarro, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Steve Sidwell, Belletti, Ben-Haim, Salomon Kalou, Alex and Makelele... I would only count Drogba, Lampard, Essien, Carvalho, Cech and Ashley Cole as those who didn't want to see him sack. Others like Paulo Ferreira and Terry... well, i think they don't really care... Terry already have his $135,000 a wk pay so why will he be bother with Jose staying or leaving. Therefore i think we can put it at 20 plus percent didn't want to see him go... But a new manager means a new opportunity for the others... so why not? A challenging time for the neutral players to gain a place in the team as well as the pro-mourinho players to keep their places.<br><br></div>

You can get upset almost every few weeks cos he is dragging their club's name through the mud again and again.<br><br>Is Grant a disaster, well... i am not too sure but time will tell. Anyway, mourinho's last few games wasn't exactly great either... he seem to be losing the plot and have lost some of the players hearts and even had an argument with club captain Terry for going behind his back... My guess is had mourinho stayed on, that result at OT was still likely to be as his last away match at Villa also ended with a 0 - 2 lost and their last 2 home matches against weaker teams ended in a draw. Don't blame Grant for it... the team is going through a bad patch and he also didn't had the services of Drogba and Lampard too.<br><br></div></blockquote>letting jose go may not be the wrong thing, but the timing seems wrong.<br><br>should have been done at the break. and not so last min also.<br><br>and it does seem that they don't have a proper replacement. unless grant was taken as the proper replacement, but given the lack of credentials and even certification, thats rather doubtful</div>
