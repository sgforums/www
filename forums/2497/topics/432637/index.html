              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>You'd think Joe Hart and Gareth Barry would be sick to the back teeth of each other after an arduous season with both Manchester City and England. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But based on the evidence of these pictures, you couldn't be further from the truth. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The City duo were spotted on holiday lapping up the Las Vegas rays with Barry gently caressing sunscreen into Hart's back as they lay by the pool. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">And judging from the look of concentration on his face, the City midfielder was certainly paying plenty of attention to ensure his friend didn’t fall foul of the strong rays.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Hart was unable to keep his hands off his England team-mate as they danced the night away in the party capital, where a number of Barclays Premier League stars have flocked to during the close-season. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But one holiday maker told the News Of The World: ‘They looked more like an old married couple than football players.’</span></p>

              <h1>Christine Bleakley and Frank Lampard can't stop smiling as they're pictured for the first time since getting engaged</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Christine Bleakley and Frank Lampard have been pictured for the first time since getting engaged in Los Angeles.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The delighted couple were spotted grinning widely as they shopped at the Century City Mall in Los Angeles on Wednesday morning, shortly after the footballer popped the question.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Looking casual as they strolled through the shops, Miss Bleakley's engagement finger was noticeably bare - suggesting they may have been planning to buy a ring to seal the deal in a nearby jewellery store.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Frank, who has been dating the BBC presenter for a 20 months, got down on one knee while the couple were in L.A. following a romantic break in Las Vegas. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The footballer's agent Steve Kutner today said: 'I am pleased to say that Christine Bleakley has accepted Frank Lampard's surprise engagement proposal here in LA.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He added: 'They are obviously both delighted but there are no immediate wedding plans, and the couple will not be making any further comment on this happy and private occasion.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Leading the congratulations were Bleakley's Daybreak colleague Kate Garraway, who praised Lampard with 'the boy done good', and fellow breakfast show presenter Lorraine Kelly.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Frank's proposal contradicts reports last month that Lampard was planning a romantic proposal on board one of Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich's luxury yachts.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">A source had said: 'Frank intends to propose in the most romantic way possible. He's got it all planned out. He will spend most of June away with Christine and by the time he and Christine are back in London, they will be engaged.</span>'</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Earlier this week Christine,and Frank, were spotted acting extremely affectionate to one another during their holiday in Las Vegas. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The couple were pictured last week kissing and cuddling as they made the most of their romantic holiday as they lazed around the pool. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>Miss Bleakley</span><span> couldn't resist pulling in her beau for a series of kisses as they basked in the sunshine before taking a dip in the water showing off her incredible bikini body. </span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>And the feeling was most definitely mutual, as Lampard cheekily kept grabbing his girlfriend's pert posterior as they relaxed at their hotel.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Christine has made no secret of her wish to start a family and speaking on Daybreak earlier this year she said: ‘For me, I’m 31, I don’t have babies. And for me, having children is the biggest and most important thing I’m ever going to do in my life.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘It’s not about my career, it’s not about your job or anything else, it’s about that.’</span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Speaking to the Daily Mail in May Christine quashed rumours that the Chelsea star might have proposed and said: 'People keep asking when he’s going to ask me to marry him. But I’m the last person who should know that,’ she says. ‘We went to Paris for two days a few weeks ago and suddenly it was, “Look, they’re ring shopping.” No, we weren’t and he certainly hasn’t asked.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘We’ve only been seeing each other a year and a half, which isn’t long enough for me. There are his children to think about, too.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Frank and Christine met at the Pride of Britain Awards in 2009 after being introduced by Piers Morgan and England cricketer Kevin Pietersen.</span></p>
