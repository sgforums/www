              His pace, sharp turn and wicked left foot were all in evidence, and they
               will have to be once more if the Argentine is to help his side into the

              <h1>Liverpool 4 Benfica 1: Dirk Kuyt's flying high for Rafa Benitez as 
              Reds book last four spot<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Liverpool's  players must sometimes wake up and 
              wonder just how a season that began with such promise has reached the 
              home straight with them playing in the Europa League. When all is said 
              and done, it remains Europe’s second-rate competition.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless,
               Rafael Benitez and his improving team have set about their quest for a 
              consolation prize with admirable zeal in recent weeks and last night’s 
              defeat of Benfica has now made them clear favourites to lift the trophy 
              in Hamburg next month.</p>
              <p>For all that they have laboured this 
              season, Benitez’s players have recently shown flashes of the football of
               which they are capable. It has come far too late to rescue their 
              Barclays Premier League hopes, of course. The team will be hard pushed 
              to finish fourth.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/08/article-0-090E736A000005DC-309_468x296.jpg" alt="Liverpool's Fernando Torres celebrates 3-0" width="468" height="296">

              <div class="floatRHS"><br></div>
              <p>But in Europe they have found a little of their true selves and at a 
              capacity Anfield last night they advanced to a semi-final date with 
              Atletico Madrid on the back of some expansive attacking football.</p>
              <p>Victory
               didn’t come without some anxiety, of course. It seems to be the way 
              with English teams in European competition of late.</p>
              <p>Unlike 
              neighbours Manchester United the night before, Liverpool’s 
              carelessness in conceding a goal with 20 minutes left did not lead to 
              the calamity that for a while looked possible as Benfica pressed 
              forwards late in the game.</p>
              <p>A goal from Fernando Torres — his 
              second and  his team’s fourth — with 10 minutes left ensured that didn’t
               happen.</p>
              <p>They were unlucky to lose the first leg in Lisbon to two 
              penalties and a red card a week ago and last night they were, after a 
              slow start, the better side by some distance.</p>
              <p>The highlight 
              was, as is often the case, a Torres goal. His first of the night and 
              Liverpool’s third, it arrived just before the hour and was superb.</p>
              <p>Dirk
               Kuyt — by far the game’s best player — and the Brazilian midfielder 
              Lucas had given Liverpool a half-time lead with two well executed goals 
              but the one that followed the interval revived memories of Terry 
              McDermott’s breakaway effort against Tottenham here in the late 1970s.</p>
              <p>This one 
              wasn’t in that class perhaps, but it was breathtaking all the same.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/08/article-0-090E6969000005DC-567_468x300.jpg" alt="Liverpool's Lucas Leiva (R) puts the ball past Benfica goalkeeper

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Breakaway goal: Lucas glides the ball past 
              Benfica keeper Julio Cesar</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>When a Benfica set piece came to nothing on the edge of the Liverpool
               penalty area, the side broke with remarkable speed.</p>
              <p>Javier 
              Mascherano began the move with a run and pass to Yossi Benayoun. The 
              little Israeli then spotted Kuyt charging down the right flank and when 
              the ball was passed his way the Dutch striker delivered a first time 
              cross for Torres to ram home at the far post.</p>
              <p>It was a goal that 
              effectively won the match and sealed the tie. It will be remembered for a
               long time.This, too, was one of Liverpool’s better attacking 
              performances of the season. They actually began hesitantly and Benfica 
              were the better side for 20 minutes, creating one half chance for David 
              Luiz.</p>
              <p>However, the game turned on a set piece in the 27th 
              minute as once Kuyt headed in Steven Gerrard’s corner, they never really
               looked back. It was an odd goal as Kuyt was initially flagged offside 
              by a linesman. Only when referee Bjorn Kuipers pointed out that the 
              rules do not allow for offside from corners or throw-ins was Kuyt’s 
              effort allowed to stand.</p>
              <p>It was a peculiar, confusing moment 
              and embarrassing for the linesman. Nevertheless, Liverpool were in front
               and as the goal gave them the confidence to express themselves they 
              doubled their lead within two minutes or so.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/08/article-0-090E7475000005DC-415_468x286.jpg" alt="Dirk Kuyt of Liverpool " width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Flying start: Dirk Kuyt (left) puts Liverpool a 
              goal to the good after 26 minutes</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>A totally different goal, this one began with Benayoun’s dart infield
              towards the centre circle from the left touchline. Leaving his marker
              behind, he fed Gerrard and the captain’s smart through pass released
              Lucas in to space.</p>
              <p>The South American is not exactly Liverpool’s 
              most expansive player but he is showing signs of greater ambition these 
              days and the manner in which he shimmied around goalkeeper Julio Cesar 
              to score was a movement worthy of Torres himself.</p>
              <p>With their noses
               now ahead in the tie, Liverpool never really looked as though they 
              would give up on their task. The Benfica central defender Sidnei shot 
              across goal from an angle just before half-time but once Torres 
              converted in such sumptuous<br>fashion with half an hour to go the home 
              team were on their way to a semi-final match up with his old club 
              Atletico.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Only briefly did Liverpool’s nerves jangle and, for once, the blame 
              lay
              with their captain Gerrard.</p>
              <p>The free-kick struck by forward 
              Oscar
              Cardozo in the 70th minute was a poor one and should have hit the base
              of the wall. But when Gerrard jumped unnecessarily the ball passed
              beneath him and Benfica briefly had a lifeline.</p>
              <p>Another goal for 
              the Portuguese would have knocked Liverpool out, of course, and hearts 
              were most certainly in mouths when another Cardoza free-kick six minutes
               after the goal struck the top of the wall and looped just inches wide.</p>
              <p>The
               resulting corner was then headed just wide of the other upright by 
              Ssidnei but that was largely the extent of the late drama as Mascherano 
              released Torres with eight minutes left and the Spaniard converted the 
              fourth goal.</p>
