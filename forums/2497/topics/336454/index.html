              <h2><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/38388_news.jpg" alt=""></h2>
              <h2>Manchester City manager Mark Hughes has spoken of his delight at
              the form of winger Shaun Wright-Phillips after he returned to the club.</h2>
              <p>The winger returned to Eastlands over the summer, after spending
              three years at Chelsea, and has made an instant impact, scoring three
              league goals already.</p>
              <p>His manager hailed his recent displays both on the pitch and off it
              and revealed how he is now regarded as a senior player at Eastlands.</p>
              <p>“I have been pleased with how Shaun has done. He made an immediate
              impact, scoring a number of goals. His general play is fine,” said the
              City boss according to <em>football365.com</em>, “He is a more senior
              player than when he left the club. It is a different coat he has to
              wear. I think he enjoys the standing he has in the dressing room.”</p>
              <p>Yet despite the impressive form of Wright-Phillips, the Sky Blues
              have been producing some inconsistent results which their manager has
              put down to the fact he is still developing his side.</p>
              <p>“We are not going to win every game, and not every game will be
              positive,” he explained before adding, “If we do not win games we have
              to try to take what we can out of them. We are going to be
              inconsistent, because that is where we are at in terms of our
              development.”</p>
              <p>Hughes also pointed to his side’s home form as being problematic
              currently but insisted with players of the calibre of Robinho, Benjani,
              Darius Vassell and Jo in his side he was confident they would always
              score goals.</p>
              <p>"It is a bit of a roller-coaster ride at the moment, because we are
              good at home and not so good away. What we will do is always create
              chances and score goals,” said the Welshmna, “It is pleasing Benjani
              made an impact and that Darius got some time on the pitch. Getting
              experienced players like them helping the younger ones is really
              important.”</p>
              <p>Manchester City welcome a rejuvenated Tottenham Hotspur to Eastlands tomorrow.</p>
