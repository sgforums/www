            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Corluka relishing City challenge<br><br>New Manchester City signing Vedran Corluka believes better things are on the horizon for the Eastlands club.</strong><br><br>The Croatian international joined City for an undisclosed fee from Dinamo Zagreb on Thursday and is one of seven new players manager Sven-Goran Eriksson has brought to the club as he looks to improve on last season's 14th place finish under Stuart Pearce. The 21-year-old admitted the Swede's presence was a factor in his move.<br><br>"He was very important, everyone knows who Sven-Goran Eriksson is and that he is one of the best coaches," said Corluka. "It will be a big challenge for me to come here and be coached by him, but I am looking forward to it. I'm really happy to be working for him and I think I will learn a lot from him.<br><br>"I know last season for City was not so good, but I know that we can do a lot better this year. It's a new start, a new manager and we'll have a better team."<br>Favourite game<br><br>Corluka was part of the Croatia side that defeated England 2-0 in a Euro 2008 qualifier last year and the right-sided defender revealed that the game played an important part in his rise to prominence.<br><br>"That was my favourite game, because it showed to me and to the Croatian fans that I can play against players as good as (Frank) Lampard, (Wayne) Rooney and the rest," he told the club's official website.<br><br>Corluka also admitted that his move to City came as something of a surprise. He added: "It has all happened very quickly. I was preparing to play for Dinamo in the Champions League, but since then things have happened very fast and I'm very happy to be here.<br><br>"Every boy in Croatia dreams of playing in the Premier League and my dream has come true. Dinamo Zagreb are a great club but I have come to a really big club in Manchester City. I think the Premier League is in some ways better than the Champions League at times."<br><br></div>
