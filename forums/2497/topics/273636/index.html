            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sven Goran Eriksson enjoyed a magnificent return to English shores as his hastily assembled new-look Manchester City side beat West Ham 2-0 at Upton Park, while Sam Allardyce returned to haunt former club Bolton, as Newcastle enjoyed a 3-1 away day victory.</strong><br><br>A Michael Chopra goal in injury time saw Sunderland beat Tottenham at The Stadium of Light, Derby fought back to secure a 2-2 against Portsmouth and on Merseyside, David Moyes' Everton were deserved winners over Wigan.<br><br>Mark Hughes takes the managerial accolades, though, as his double substitution helped Blackburn to a 2-1 victory at Middlesbrough.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Late show</strong></span><br><br>In Saturday's late kick-off Liverpool left it to the death against Aston Villa, as Steven Gerrard struck a brilliant free-kick winner with just three minutes remaining.<br><br>Aston Villa thought they had secured a point when Gareth Barry's penalty cancelled out Martin Laursen's own goal, but it was not to be, as Gerrard scored a stunning winner.<br><br>Newcastle chief Allardyce enjoyed a magnificent return to The Reebok Stadium but for Sammy Lee it was the stuff of nightmares, as his Bolton side slumped to a 3-1 defeat.<br><br>Charles N'Zogbia needed just 11 minutes to silence the home crowd when his free-kick evaded Jussi Jaaskelainen and ten minutes later, Bolton's woes were compounded, when Obafemi Martins exposed some dire defending to take the ball on his chest and fire home an acrobatic overhead kick.<br><br>The powerful front man then grabbed his second of a productive afternoon, when his speculative drive deflected off Abdoulaye Faye and beyond Jaaskelainen.<br><br>In the second period Bolton rallied and pulled a goal back when Nicolas Anelka took Kevin Nolan's pass in his stride on the counter-attack, before finding a clinical finish.<br><br>Manchester City enjoyed a bright first half at West Ham and deservedly took the lead when the highly impressive Elano made inroads down the right flank, leaving Rolando Bianchi to steal in at the far post to convert his low cross.<br><br>There was the odd moment of consternation from an unusually impassioned Eriksson but his fears proved ill-founded when Geovanni grabbed his side's second late on with a fine finish.<br><br>Sunderland's last sojourn in the top flight saw them need 21 attempts to collect a maximum haul, but not this time around, as Roy Keane's side secured a dramatic 1-0 victory over a pallid Tottenham.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chopra the hero</strong></span><br><br>In truth the game in its entirety will not live long in the memory but for Sunderland supporters, second-half injury time certainly will, as surprise substitute Chopra took down Ross Wallace's cross with aplomb, before calmly slotting past Paul Robinson from the penalty spot.<br><br>Sunderland's record signing Craig Gordon could not have asked for an easier debut, as for all their attacking riches, Spurs' forward line failed to sparkle throughout.<br><br>Derby's return to the top flight was an eventful affair as they kicked-off with a 2-2 draw against Portsmouth.<br><br>The home side needed just five minutes to open their Premier League account against Portsmouth, with Matt Oakley's fine angled finish beating David James from just inside the box.<br><br>Billy Davies' side were good value for their lead but by half-time found themselves pegged back courtesy of Benjani's stabbed finish which beat Stephen Bywater, who will feel disappointed with his efforts to keep the ball out.<br><br>John Utaka thought he had marked his debut with a winning goal when he side-footed home in the 83rd minute but Andy Todd had other ideas when he scored a bullet of a header just a minute later.<br><br>Everton enjoyed a winning start to their campaign when they beat Wigan 2-1 at Goodison Park.<br><br>Leon Osman broke the deadlock as he sneaked in to expose some poor Wigan defending to loop the ball over Chris Kirkland in the 26th minute, before in the second period, Victor Anichebe doubled his side's advantage.<br><br>A late consolation from Antoine Sibierski caused the odd flutter but at the game's conclusion, Wigan could have few complaints.<br><br>A pair of Blackburn substitutes broke Middlesbrough hearts at The Riverside, as Mark Hughes' side escaped from their trip to the North East with a 2-1 victory.<br><br>Stewart Downing had the home faithful off their feet when his free-kick just past the half-an-hour mark went straight through a poorly assembled Blackburn wall, but in the second period Hughes changed his front-line to great dividends.<br><br>Roque Santa Cruz's brilliant header from David Bentley's cross got Blackburn level, before Matt Derbyshire took possession on the edge of Boro's box with just under ten minutes remaining and bent home a sumptuous curling winner.<br><br>Sunderland 1 Spurs 0<br>Bolton 1 Newcastle 3<br>Derby 2 Portsmouth 2<br>Everton 2 Wigan 1<br>Middlesbrough 1 Blackburn 2<br>West Ham 0 Manchester City 2<br>Aston Villa 1 Liverpool 2</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kinda disappointed by the first match of the season, it's really a dull and boring match from the first minute.<br><br>Keano won his first EPL managerial match. Big Sam and Sven record victories for their new clubs. Derby snatched a point from Pompey while Everton, Liverpool and Blackburn scored unconvincing victories over their opponent.<br><br>Not a bad start to the new season and it can only get better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cheers.<br>CK</div>
