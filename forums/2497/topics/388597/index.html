              <h1>Man City 2 Man United 1: Fired-up Carlos Tevez has final say as United are silenced by their old boy<span class="author"></span></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson must feel those noisy neighbours are really starting to push their luck.</p>
              <p>First they have the temerity to tell Manchester United
              to tone it down. Then they complain that they cannot hear them. And now
              they intend to come round next week and try to stop his boys making
              another visit to Wembley.</p>
              <p>Much to Ferguson’s very obvious
              disappointment, it was Carlos Tevez who did all the talking. Tevez who
              silenced Wayne Rooney, told Gary Neville to belt up and then ran in
              front of the dug-out and made what looked like a gesture to the same
              United directors who allowed him to cross the city to Eastlands.</p>
              <p>‘Fergie, Fergie sign him up,’ United’s supporters used to sing. Last night City’s supporters delivered their very own version.</p>
              <p>It did amount to a wonderful piece of theatre, not least when Tevez
              converted the rather dubious penalty that dragged Roberto Mancini’s
              side back into this most intriguing Carling Cup semi-final.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/01/19/article-0-07EDEC89000005DC-908_468x286.jpg" alt="Tevez" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>On the spot: Tevez fires City level with a thumping penalty</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Furious that it had even been awarded for what looked like a foul
              outside the 18-yard box, United did everything they could to unnerve
              their former colleague. Edwin van der Sar wasted so much time he was
              booked and Rooney appeared to bark abuse at him as he made his run-up,
              but Tevez ignored them before nervelessly blasting the ball into the
              roof of the United net.</p>
              <p>It was a terrific penalty, the perfect riposte, and it gave him the
              opportunity to respond to comments he must have read, or at least heard
              about, yesterday.</p>
              <p>Neville had publicly supported his manager’s decision in refusing to
              pay the money required to keep the diminutive Argentine at Old Trafford
              and Tevez replied by running to the touchline and telling the Old
              Trafford skipper, among the substitutes last night, exactly what he
              thought. ‘You’re all mouth,’ seemed to be the message. Neville appeared
              to flick an angry response.</p>
              <p>Tevez was not finished, though. Not by a long way. Having cancelled
              out a 17th minute opener from Ryan Giggs, he then made United really
              pay. A second goal in the 66th minute, and with it not only the
              advantage but the opportunity to dish out some more. On this occasion
              to his old paymasters.</p>
              <p>A cupping of the hands suggested he still could not hear them, just
              as he couldn’t when he made the exact same gesture after scoring for
              United against City at Old Trafford last season.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/01/20/article-1244549-07EE0D12000005DC-877_468x286.jpg" alt="Manchester City's Carlos Tevez celebrates scoring their second goal" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption">Loud and clear: Tevez turns to the travelling
              United fans with a clear message after scoring his second for City in
              front of an ecstatic Eastlands crowd</p>
              </div>
              <p>It must have been more than a little perplexing for Mancini. It had
              nothing to do with him after all. But what a way to finish what he must
              hope will be the first of many such encounters. ‘Welcome to
              CorrespondentManchester, Roberto.’ It could have been a personal
              message from Tevez.</p>
              <p>The advantage is with City. Not by much when the away goal United
              scored could yet prove decisive if the scores are level at the end of
              extra time next week. But it is an advantage Mancini should be content
              with after rather bullishly declaring that City could soon supersede
              United as the biggest club in Manchester.</p>
              <p>Old Trafford should prepare for another classic contest. A contest
              that could yet rival that seven-goal thriller in September Ferguson
              considers the greatest Manchester derby in history.</p>
              <p>For both sides so much is at stake. For City a real chance to go to
              Wembley and end their 34-year wait for a trophy. For United the
              bragging rights they appear to consider more important than the
              competition itself.</p>
              <p>When United reached the final last season, Ferguson played a mixture of reserves and first-team regulars and so allowed players
              like Ben Foster to taste a bit of success. But last night he selected
              the strongest side he possibly could, albeit a side missing key players
              like Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Dimitar Berbatov.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/01/19/article-0-07EE0D1A000005DC-86_468x286.jpg" alt="Tevez" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Two good: Tevez heads City in front at Eastlands</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Their injury problems did not compare to City’s however, even if
              there were players on the bench Mancini could have chosen ahead of
              Pablo Zabaleta. The full back was asked to occupy a more central role
              that sometimes added strength to City’s midfield and sometimes saw him
              act as a foil to Tevez, and the fact that he was even asked to do it
              revealed how little City’s manager must think of Robinho.</p>
              <p>For Mancini, though, the headaches did not end there. No
              centre-halves meant he had to select a youngster in Dedryck Boyata
              alongside a midfielder in Vincent Kompany and a lack of experience soon
              proved costly.</p>
              <p>If Antonio Valencia did well to muscle his way past Craig Bellamy
              and deliver a low cross in the 17th minute, City’s back four really
              should have done better in dealing with the danger. As it was, Rooney
              met the ball virtually unopposed and, when Shay Given parried, it was
              Giggs who was there to strike from close range.</p>
              <p>Ferguson could not hide his delight, immediately springing to his feet and throwing up his arms in celebration.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/01/19/article-1244549-07EE1BC8000005DC-710_468x331.jpg" alt="Carlos Tevez" width="468" height="331">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Delight: Tevez celebrates after putting City in front in the semi-final first leg</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>But the sense of elation did not last long. Not when City were as
              quick as they were in applying the pressure on a United defence also
              weakened by injury. Tevez probably should have scored when Shaun
              Wright-Phillips sent in a teasing cross, but he drove his header into
              the ground and wide.</p>
              <p>De Jong went closer with a blstering effort in the 37th minute that forced a fine save from Edwin van der
              Sar, but when Mike Dean awarded what appeared to be a rather dubious
              penalty in the 41st minute City drew level.</p>
              <p>Rafael Da Silva certainly looked unlucky. Dean tried to tell
              United’s players that Da Silva had tugged Bellamy’s shirt not once but
              twice but television replays suggested both fouls were committed
              outside the area.</p>
              <p>It mattered not to Tevez, of course. He ignored Van der Sar’s
              unsporting conduct and what seemed to be a few choice words from Rooney
              and hit the ball as hard and as straight as he possibly could. Van der
              Sar dived to his left. Bad call.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/01/19/article-1244549-07EDF9CC000005DC-603_468x286.jpg" alt="Ryan Giggs" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Perfect start: Ryan Giggs put United in front early on</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>It made for a wonderful second half. Micah Richards saw an effort
              cleared off the line by Evra and then Giggs threatened with a header.</p>
              <p>But when Zabaleta seized on United’s failure to clear a corner and
              Kompany met his colleague’s header with a ball into the six-yard box,
              it was Tevez who pounced and then ran to the dug-out.</p>
              <p>Other opportunities followed. For Michael Owen, on as a substitute,
              and Valencia; for Wright-Phillips, too. But this was Tevez’s night and
              a night when he finally had his say.</p>

              Well done tevez. He ran tirelessly during last year's game with Man U and almost scored. This time he scores two. In fact, this season, not only is Man U sorely missing CR7, they are also greatly missing carlos.
              
              A pity...always amazes me how fergie was so wishy washy about this chap.

                          cancelled out a 17th minute opener from Ryan Giggs, he then made
                          United really pay. A second goal in the 66th minute, and with it
                          not only the advantage but the opportunity to dish out some more.
                          On this occasion to his old paymasters.</p>
              <p>A cupping of the hands suggested he still could not hear them,
                          just as he couldn’t when he made the exact same gesture after
                          scoring for United against City at Old Trafford last season.</p>
              <div><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/01/20/article-1244549-07EE0D12000005DC-877_468x286.jpg" alt="Manchester City's Carlos Tevez celebrates scoring their second goal" width="468" height="286">
              <p>Loud and clear: Tevez turns to the travelling United
                          fans with a clear message after scoring his second for City in
                          front of an ecstatic Eastlands crowd</p>
              </div>
              <p>It must have been more than a little perplexing for Mancini. It
                          had nothing to do with him after all. But what a way to finish what
                          he must hope will be the first of many such encounters. ‘Welcome to
                          CorrespondentManchester, Roberto.’ It could have been a personal
                          message from Tevez.</p>
              <p>The advantage is with City. Not by much when the away goal
                          United scored could yet prove decisive if the scores are level at
                          the end of extra time next week. But it is an advantage Mancini
                          should be content with after rather bullishly declaring that City
                          could soon supersede United as the biggest club in Manchester.</p>
              <p>Old Trafford should prepare for another classic contest. A
                          contest that could yet rival that seven-goal thriller in September
                          Ferguson considers the greatest Manchester derby in history.</p>
              <p>For both sides so much is at stake. For City a real chance to go
                          to Wembley and end their 34-year wait for a trophy. For United the
                          bragging rights they appear to consider more important than the
                          competition itself.</p>
              <p>When United reached the final last season, Ferguson played a
                          mixture of reserves and first-team regulars and so allowed players
                          like Ben Foster to taste a bit of success. But last night he
                          selected the strongest side he possibly could, albeit a side
                          missing key players like Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Dimitar
                          Berbatov.</p>
              <div><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/01/19/article-0-07EE0D1A000005DC-86_468x286.jpg" alt="Tevez" width="468" height="286">
              <p><em>Two good: Tevez heads City in front at
                          Eastlands</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Their injury problems did not compare to City’s however, even if
                          there were players on the bench Mancini could have chosen ahead of
                          Pablo Zabaleta. The full back was asked to occupy a more central
                          role that sometimes added strength to City’s midfield and sometimes
                          saw him act as a foil to Tevez, and the fact that he was even asked
                          to do it revealed how little City’s manager must think of
                          Robinho.</p>
              <p>For Mancini, though, the headaches did not end there. No
                          centre-halves meant he had to select a youngster in Dedryck Boyata
                          alongside a midfielder in Vincent Kompany and a lack of experience
                          soon proved costly.</p>
              <p>If Antonio Valencia did well to muscle his way past Craig
                          Bellamy and deliver a low cross in the 17th minute, City’s back
                          four really should have done better in dealing with the danger. As
                          it was, Rooney met the ball virtually unopposed and, when Shay
                          Given parried, it was Giggs who was there to strike from close
                          range.</p>
              <p>Ferguson could not hide his delight, immediately springing to
                          his feet and throwing up his arms in celebration.</p>
              <div><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/01/19/article-1244549-07EE1BC8000005DC-710_468x331.jpg" alt="Carlos Tevez" width="468" height="331">
              <p><em>Delight: Tevez celebrates after putting City in
                          front in the semi-final first leg</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>But the sense of elation did not last long. Not when City were
                          as quick as they were in applying the pressure on a United defence
                          also weakened by injury. Tevez probably should have scored when
                          Shaun Wright-Phillips sent in a teasing cross, but he drove his
                          header into the ground and wide.</p>
              <p>De Jong went closer with a blstering effort in the 37th minute
                          that forced a fine save from Edwin van der Sar, but when Mike Dean
                          awarded what appeared to be a rather dubious penalty in the 41st
                          minute City drew level.</p>
              <p>Rafael Da Silva certainly looked unlucky. Dean tried to tell
                          United’s players that Da Silva had tugged Bellamy’s shirt not once
                          but twice but television replays suggested both fouls were
                          committed outside the area.</p>
              <p>It mattered not to Tevez, of course. He ignored Van der Sar’s
                          unsporting conduct and what seemed to be a few choice words from
                          Rooney and hit the ball as hard and as straight as he possibly
                          could. Van der Sar dived to his left. Bad call.</p>
              <div><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/01/19/article-1244549-07EDF9CC000005DC-603_468x286.jpg" alt="Ryan Giggs" width="468" height="286">
              <p><em>Perfect start: Ryan Giggs put United in front early
                          on</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>It made for a wonderful second half. Micah Richards saw an
                          effort cleared off the line by Evra and then Giggs threatened with
                          a header.</p>
              <p>But when Zabaleta seized on United’s failure to clear a corner
                          and Kompany met his colleague’s header with a ball into the
                          six-yard box, it was Tevez who pounced and then ran to the
                          dug-out.</p>
              <p>Other opportunities followed. For Michael Owen, on as a
                          substitute, and Valencia; for Wright-Phillips, too. But this was
                          Tevez’s night and a night when he finally had his say.</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p>Carlos Tevez dedicated his Carling Cup brace to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr>'s fans after last night's 2-1 win over <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Tevez celebrated his first goal with a gesture that appeared to hit
              back at comments from United skipper Gary Neville, who claimed this
              week that the club had been right to sell Tevez to their rivals.</p>
              <p>Neville, who was warming up on the touchline, flashed back an
              offensive one-fingered response which could land him in trouble with
              the FA.</p>
              <p>After giving City a 2-1 lead to take to Old Trafford in next
              Wednesday night’s second leg, the Argentina forward said: "This was
              special for me. My two goals were for the City fans."</p>
              <p>For the second, Tevez then ran towards the dug-out and cupped
              his ears in a celebration reminiscent of his demonstration towards the
              United board after scoring against City at Old Trafford last season.</p>

              <p>You cant blame him. It's like how Benitez went public with his pursuit of Barry, which ultimately led to Alonso's departure. Similarly, Fergie signed Berba and confined Tevez to the bench unfairly even though Berba was playing crap. What will you do if you were him?</p>

              <p>the best part was fergie telling carlos, 'dont worry, the arrival of bbt wont affect your chance of playing for utd', but then things did not turn out that way.</p>
              <p>on a personal note, tevez was rather a 'victim' throughout his time at utd.</p>
              <p>he started well, as a rival fan, im really impressed with him when he was with the devils.</p>

              <p>Now another goal at Old Trafford on Wednesday will do very nicely.</p>
              <p>Tevez, 25, told <em>The Sun</em>: "That would be a dream in my first season at City.</p>
              <p>"I know how much they love beating United, that was very clear on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>"They had to suffer earlier in the season when we lost in injury-time there and you saw what that meant to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> and the United players in the way they celebrated.</p>
