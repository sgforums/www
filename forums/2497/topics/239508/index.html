            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;"> Jose Mourinho has paid tribute to the swift actions of Arsenal's medical team during Sunday's Carling Cup final.<br><br>Chelsea captain John Terry was accidentally kicked in the face by Abou Diaby and immediately lost consciousness.<br><br>Both sets of players made frantic gestures to the touchline for treatment and Arsenal's medical team, who had been making their way back to the dugout following an earlier injury, were first on the scene.<br><br>Terry received lengthy treatment before being taken off the field on a stretcher and ferried to hospital.<br><br>The England captain was assessed in hospital, but made such a stunning recovery that he was able to join the rest of his team-mates for the bus trip home.<br><br>Mourinho has admitted that he was initially deeply concerned for his defender, but was also quick to praise Arsenal's medical team and absolve Diaby of any blame.<br><br>"John lost consciousness," said Mourinho. "That was a major problem.<br><br>"At that moment, you just want the player to be fine. Sometimes dramatic things happen. You never know when it happens to you. This season we have already had the situations with Petr Cech and Carlo Cudicini and the negative thoughts come directly to your mind.<br><br>"The first point is 'is he safe, is the man fine?' His wife is here and his little babies are here, so the most important thing is that the man is safe and is fine.<br><br>"I was with the fourth official, who was in direct communication with (referee) Howard Webb. He told him what was going to happen, so I knew everything.<br><br>"The Arsenal medical department was already there because they had been treating an injury, so they were close to the situation. Everything was under control.<br><br>"I just know he was heading the ball. It would be normal for an Arsenal player to try to kick it five metres from his own goal. The defensive player has to do that.<br><br>"John risked himself and the Arsenal player was trying to protect his goal. I have no criticism about that.<br><br>"After that, the only thing we know was in that couple of minutes we were worried because he lost consciousness. Once our doctor had arrived half the problem had been solved."</span></div>
