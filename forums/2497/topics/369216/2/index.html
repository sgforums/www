              <p>The organizers are cheating the fans... I believe they knew long ago that Gerrard wasn't coming as his trial date didn't appear suddenly, it was probably fixed months ago and yet they didn't inform the public or fans... They kept quiet all along until the match kicked-off against the Thais... The worst thing was, they even used Gerrard in their promo for the matches... Despicable...</p>
              <p>If I was a Pool fan, I will feel very cheated by this whole episode... You pay a lot to get tickets in advanced only to find out when the match actually kicks-off, you are watching most of their second string or youth players kicking around...</p>
              <p>No Gerrard, No Alonso and only 10 mins of Torres walking around in the last 10 mins of the match !</p>

              <p>I have been a Liverpool Fan ever since my uncle gave me a Liverpool
              jersey when i was 7. Since then i have become a die hard Liverpool
              supporter, and after i read the articles on The Newpaper today, I
              decided that i would like to share my views regarding the online
              petition. <br> <br> Firstly, it has been 8 years since Liverpool has landed on our shores.
              Thanks to Profitable Group, Singapore fans now have a chance to see
              their idols. I've read some comments that some fans have spoken that
              since PG should have known that Stevie G could not make it, they should
              not have used Gerrard's photos on any form of advertisements or
              marketing for this trip. While i am vastly disappointed that Stevie G
              is not coming, we should also understand that Liverpool FC is not about
              one person, its the whole team that matters. If you really support
              Liverpool, i would believe that it is as good to be able to watch the
              rest of the players here as well.<br> <br> Secondly, some have put forward the fact that $88 or $188 is so much
              expensive compared to Manchester United's match in Malaysia, and that
              if Manchester United can play their stars, so can Liverpool. However, i
              hope that fans can understand that we're alreadying comparing in
              different circumstances. Do anyone know what price Man U will charge if
              they are playing in Singapore instead? Comparing to prices across the
              border is totally different, considering the differences in our
              exchange rates as such.  And also, when fans bought the tickets, i
              believe at least half of you knew that Rafa would definitely play his
              youngsters, but you fans decided that love for Liverpool is what
              matters and decided to go ahead with it. In addition, he did not play a
              Full team of youngsters, he gave players like Babel, Kuyt, Carragher a
              run out too. How can you complain when you guys knew that this was
              going to happen? One fan complained in the paper that he could have
              watched a match in England for $70, does the trip there not cost
              anything? Why not let Rafa choose who he wants to play instead? He's
              the manager isn't he? Do you want to see Torres getting injured by
              Precious or Noh Rahman, and end up missing for Liverpool the whole
              season?<br> <br> In conclusion, to Liverpool fans who loves Liverpool and have not
              complained, continue to show Liverpool your unwavering support and
              loyalty. To those who have complained, think rationale and decide if
              you still think that Liverpool should play their 1st XI. Think again,
              and stop complaining.<br> <br> Die Hard Pool Fan<br></p>

              <p>I think you are greatly mistaken here... Pool fans definitely won't be disappointed by their club coming to our island... I believed they will welcome them with open arms. Its the organizers that will lose its credibility in the long run... They made used of Gerrard's picture in their promo and never mentioned at any time he won't be on this tour when they knew long ago he wouldn't be making it... I think the proper way was the organizers shouldn't have mislead the masses...</p>
              <p>The next time this same organizers decided to promote another match here, fans will question if the players on their advertisements will actually come to play... Your loyalty to the club is commendable but I don't think any one would like to be taken for a ride or taken advantage off by anyone or by any entity... be it even a 'die hard fan'... If a club continue to exploit its fans then I think its not a worthy club to support...</p>
              <p>Like you have mentioned it yourself, you are vastly disappointed that Stevie G is not coming... I bet thousands of Pool fans will feel the same way... And had the organizers made known this fact before tickets went on sale, I am afraid the respond might be a whole lot of difference...</p>
              <p>I hardly read the Newpaper so what's the online petition you mentioned about?</p>
              <p>That one fan you mentioned complained that he could have watched a match in England for $70, where all their stars will be playing... Here he is paying more but get reserved players and lesser quality football... Who is talking about making a trip there?</p>
              <p>Indeed, Rafa choose who he wants to play, he is the manager... So being the manager it is alright to short changed the local fans who are paying more than their EPL counterparts? Is this the way to repay the loyal fans? If he is as you mentioned so worried to see Torres getting injured by Precious or Noh Rahman, then why even bother to turn up for the tour? He should kept him at Anfield in cotton wool, no need to do pre-season also what...</p>
              <p>Like I have said, perhaps you are different and may not be one of those young guys who earn very little therefore $88 or $188 isn't much to you... But there are a lot of youth out there or NS boys making very little but saved and fork out to see their idols in the flash only to watch the club parade a bunch of second string and youth players on the pitch... You still think they knew that this was going to happen?</p>
              <p>In conclusion, those Liverpool fans who have complained being cheated are not any lesser a fan than yourself... They just don't wish to be cheated and con by the club they love... Unwavering support and loyalty is a two way thing... Clubs should appreciate their fans just as they want the fans to support them wholeheartly... Blind support will only be used and exploited...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I believed what the Newpaper has done is good... Maybe Rafa might have read it in his hotel room or might be told of the fans sentiment here and start with better quality players rather than second string and youth players again... Here are what I have just read in the Newpaper Online by Pool fans...</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mark Allan, 43, a Liverpool fan of 36 years, sums it up best: 'After watching them struggle against Thailand, it's difficult to justify spending $88 for the ticket, just to watch them experiment with substitutes, go for river cruises, shop at Marina Square or Suntec City, party at the top nightspots in Singapore. And to think we are paying for all these?'</p>
              <p><strong>Mark Allan, 43, a Liverpool fan of 36 years</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I'm just disappointed that I won't see Steven Gerrard. I think it's a poor attempt to lure people into buying the tickets. It's unethical to just use his picture as a gimmick for promotion.</p>
              <p>'The fans have spent their hard-earned money and the least they can do is field a full-strength team to repay their support. A team is nothing without its fans.'</p>
              <p><strong>Robert Ho, 20, NSF</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'The fans would expect the stars to play and parade themselves, because they are the what fans pay to see.</p>
              <p>'I feel a bit hard done. It's disappointing that Gerrard is not here, and if the rest of the stars don't play or only play for a short while, then definitely the fans will be very disappointed.</p>
              <p>'They owe it to the fans. Understandably, they will be a bit cautious to avoid injury, but they should put the majority of the main players in.</p>
              <p>'They don't have to go all out but the fans would be happy enough to see the stars.'</p>
              <p><strong>Jeffrey Chong, 49, IT manager</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'As a long-term Liverpool fan, I would be definitely disappointed. I do expect that they can't play all the players, but there is a commitment to bring them all down.</p>
              <p>'The worst thing is having Steven Gerrard feature as one of the prominent people in the advertising, but the last thing we heard is that he is not coming.</p>
              <p>'I'll be there to support them but at the same time I feel cheated. They definitely owe it to the fans to play their best team.</p>
              <p><strong>Loyal fans</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'Are they really here to repay the loyal fans? When I heard that they were coming down, I booked tickets without a second's consideration.</p>
              <p>'I will still be there to support them, but they still owe an answer to the fans if the commitment is not there when we have the loyalty.'</p>
              <p><strong>Clarence Goh, 48, bank executive</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I'll be disappointed, $88 and if you only get to see the reserves. It's not very fair. The Manchester United game in KL was cheaper and most of the stars were on show, but Liverpool are charging more and the stars must play from the start.'</p>
              <p><strong>Derek Scully, 51, bank officer</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'For the majority of us it will be quite disappointing, because we have paid a huge amount for the chance to catch a glimpse of the big players.'</p>
              <p><strong>Muhammad Haziq Sulaiman, 18, Meridian JC student</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'When you're talking about the Kop coming out to Asia, they're going to put in all the reserve players. Rafa's gonna play all the younger guys rather than risk injury to the main stars.</p>
              <p>'But this is expected. In the case of Steven Gerrard, I don't know. You're looking at advertisements and promotions with Gerrard, and I don't know what to say about the Profitable Group because they must have known.</p>
              <p>'In a way, the fans will be disappointed. If you're paying that kind of money, you'll definitely be a bit disappointed if the quality is not there.</p>
              <p>'If I was in England, I could probably pay £30 ($71) to get a ticket to watch a real game, here you pay $88 and $188 to watch the stars play a couple of minutes?'</p>
              <p><strong>Kevin D'Rozario, 47, sales executive</strong></p>

              <p>I have been a Liverpool Fan ever since my uncle gave me a Liverpool jersey when i was 7. Since then i have become a die hard Liverpool supporter, and after i read the articles on The Newpaper today, I decided that i would like to share my views regarding the online petition.<br><br>Firstly, it has been 8 years since Liverpool has landed on our shores. Thanks to Profitable Group, Singapore fans now have a chance to see their idols. I've read some comments that some fans have spoken that since PG should have known that Stevie G could not make it, they should not have used Gerrard's photos on any form of advertisements or marketing for this trip. While i am vastly disappointed that Stevie G is not coming, we should also understand that Liverpool FC is not about one person, its the whole team that matters. If you really support Liverpool, i would believe that it is as good to be able to watch the rest of the players here as well.<br><br>Secondly, some have put forward the fact that $88 or $188 is so much expensive compared to Manchester United's match in Malaysia, and that if Manchester United can play their stars, so can Liverpool. However, i hope that fans can understand that we're alreadying comparing in different circumstances. Do anyone know what price Man U will charge if they are playing in Singapore instead? Comparing to prices across the border is totally different, considering the differences in our exchange rates as such.  And also, when fans bought the tickets, i believe at least half of you knew that Rafa would definitely play his youngsters, but you fans decided that love for Liverpool is what matters and decided to go ahead with it. In addition, he did not play a Full team of youngsters, he gave players like Babel, Kuyt, Carragher a run out too. How can you complain when you guys knew that this was going to happen? One fan complained in the paper that he could have watched a match in England for $70, does the trip there not cost anything? Why not let Rafa choose who he wants to play instead? He's the manager isn't he? Do you want to see Torres getting injured by Precious or Noh Rahman, and end up missing for Liverpool the whole season?<br><br>In conclusion, to Liverpool fans who loves Liverpool and have not complained, continue to show Liverpool your unwavering support and loyalty. To those who have complained, think rationale and decide if you still think that Liverpool should play their 1st XI. Think again, and stop complaining.<br><br>Die Hard Pool Fan</p>

              <p>I think you are greatly mistaken here... Pool fans definitely won't be disappointed by their club coming to our island... I believed they will welcome them with open arms. Its the organizers that will lose its credibility in the long run... They made used of Gerrard's picture in their promo and never mentioned at any time he won't be on this tour when they knew long ago he wouldn't be making it... I think the proper way was the organizers shouldn't have mislead the masses...</p>
              <p>The next time this same organizers decided to promote another match here, fans will question if the players on their advertisements will actually come to play... Your loyalty to the club is commendable but I don't think any one would like to be taken for a ride or taken advantage off by anyone or by any entity... be it even a 'die hard fan'... If a club continue to exploit its fans then I think its not a worthy club to support...</p>
              <p>Like you have mentioned it yourself, you are vastly disappointed that Stevie G is not coming... I bet thousands of Pool fans will feel the same way... And had the organizers made known this fact before tickets went on sale, I am afraid the respond might be a whole lot of difference...</p>
              <p>I hardly read the Newpaper so what's the online petition you mentioned about?</p>
              <p>That one fan you mentioned complained that he could have watched a match in England for $70, where all their stars will be playing... Here he is paying more but get reserved players and lesser quality football... Who is talking about making a trip there?</p>
              <p>Indeed, Rafa choose who he wants to play, he is the manager... So being the manager it is alright to short changed the local fans who are paying more than their EPL counterparts? Is this the way to repay the loyal fans? If he is as you mentioned so worried to see Torres getting injured by Precious or Noh Rahman, then why even bother to turn up for the tour? He should kept him at Anfield in cotton wool, no need to do pre-season also what...</p>
              <p>Like I have said, perhaps you are different and may not be one of those young guys who earn very little therefore $88 or $188 isn't much to you... But there are a lot of youth out there or NS boys making very little but saved and fork out to see their idols in the flash only to watch the club parade a bunch of second string and youth players on the pitch... You still think they knew that this was going to happen?</p>
              <p>In conclusion, those Liverpool fans who have complained being cheated are not any lesser a fan than yourself... They just don't wish to be cheated and con by the club they love... Unwavering support and loyalty is a two way thing... Clubs should appreciate their fans just as they want the fans to support them wholeheartly... Blind support will only be used and exploited...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I believed what the Newpaper has done is good... Maybe Rafa might have read it in his hotel room or might be told of the fans sentiment here and start with better quality players rather than second string and youth players again... Here are what I have just read in the Newpaper Online by Pool fans...</p>

              <p>Stfu, you are a man yoo fan and have no idea how we feel. We feel good after eating nasi goreng, babi goreng and round off with teh-o. We feel good that Liverpool is even willing to play a match with the crappiest team in the whole goddamn universe, Singapore. Its all good. At the end of the day, it doesnt matter what the score is, 4-0, 2-1, 1-1, its none of your business. It doesnt matter if we put the entire 1st team, or the entire reserves, or the entire youth team, or a mix of kacang puteh, because smart people like me didnt buy a ticket to the kallang stadium. Go and eat your mee siam, man yoo supporter.</p>

              <p>Liverpool fans, be thankful that Liverpool is willing to make the journey here to this goddamn forsaken place and smell the smell of stink-ar-por. For if I cant stand the smell here, what makes you think they can?</p>

              <p>zocoss, im not saying i don understand how those fans feel, but i jus think that there is no need to make a big fuss out of it. Did anyone force them to buy the tickets? and if Stevie G did turn up, we know that he'll the most play 45 mins. So does that means that if the tickets were $18 and $38 dollars den Rafa can choose to play Torres for only 1 min? We need to know that hes the manager, he chooses which team he wants to put out. We CHOSE to buy the tickets, no 1 pointed guns at our heads.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And by the way, $188 and $88 are big sum of money to me too. I understand how people who paid feel. But for some of us, its a one in a lifetime kind of thing to watch liverpool in the flesh. Enjoy it and enjoy the atmosphere, im sure it'll be worth the money.</p>

              <p>Well, the problem you are hearing a fuss I think is because they felt they were mislead in the first place... I am not strictly saying Liverpool only... I am referring to any side who comes here and does not give a minimun standard of performance should not bother to come in the first place...</p>
              <p>The main problem here to me falls on the organizers... Cos not only did they not reveal Gerrard's absence, They even started all the promotions this last few months with Gerrard's name and pictures giving the impression he would be playing when they must have known all along he couldn't make it cos of his trial date... You can't blame the fans here... The anticipation that was billed up over the months suddenly became disappointment... Somehow, there are some who will feel cheated or con... It would have been better had they made known earlier at least the fans wouldn't have got their hopes up in the first place and therefore not get disappointed now.</p>
              <p>Everyone is an individual, you, me and the thousands of Liverpool fans here and in Thailand... Everyone will have their own views or opinions on it, like those Pool fans in the Newpaper... How you choose to take it might be different from the others... We don't need to say $188 is alot, even at $88 its still a lot of money especially to those youngsters... So how they react is really up to them... Perhaps its really a lot of money to them...</p>
              <p>By the way, you are correct. I belief no one force them to buy the tickets... Or as you put it 'no 1 pointed guns at our heads'. But I don't think we should turn this around now and put the blame on the fans for buying when no one forced them...</p>
              <p>To put it bluntly, they were sold one thing and when it arrived,they got something else of inferior quality... Lets say you saved for a while then went out to buy a brand new PC with impressive configurations for gaming purpose, you know... High end processor, high end graphic card and lots of memories... Then when the delivery guys sent it to your place, you are all excited but soon realised its not the same items you were sold when you open that brand new shining casing you saw in the shop... and the performance also isn't what you were promised too...</p>
              <p>So, apart from the shining CPU box that is the same, the internal is of inferior parts... Would you make a fuss or just keep quiet? Definitely you will be upset or disappointed and have every right to make a fuss when you feel you have been cheated don't you agree? And when you go to the shop, the saleman tells you "Its still the same shining box what"... So, you tell me... Is it really the same what you paid for? or would you feel cheated?</p>
              <p>The organizer have already done the fans badly... Now lets hope Rafa won't do the same to them as well... I just hope Rafa play his best side tomorrow... The fans deserved it...</p>

              <p>I thought Singapore played very well in the first half... Cos not only did they not stayed back and defend totally, they actually had a few good chances at the Pool end...</p>
              <p>Alam Shah was impressive... lol He even gave Mascherano an elbow in the stomach...</p>
              <p>Singapore was unfortunate to let in a lucky deflected shot... But if there was one thing Sg team don't have is mental strength... They are not like the Thais, and now that they have gone behind, I think it could end up as a high scoring match for Pool now...</p>
              <p>Anyway, I think the Sg team have done very well...</p>
