              <p>Inter Milan boss Jose Mourinho is
              convinced Manchester United are "afraid" of his players ahead of
              tonight's Champions League tie.</p>
              <p>Mourinho said: "I don’t think they are coming here to play eye to eye, to try to win the game here.</p>
              <p>"I have paid great attention to every match in the previous year
              in the Champions League. Man United changed. They will go to this game
              with a different approach to normal.</p>
              <p>"I know Sir Alex doesn’t like the word — and a team like Man
              United doesn’t like the word — so I’m not saying they are afraid of us.
              But they respect us. They know they can lose."</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Have a word: Jose Mourinho vents his frustration at ref Luis Medina Cantalejo</em></p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1154886" rel="1154886|3| nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1154886/Jose-ref-rage-Hes-moaning-United-vow-kill-Inter-time.html"></a></p>
              <h2>Inter Milan 0 Manchester United 0<br></h2>
              <p>Jose Mourinho accused the referee of being biased against his Inter Milan team after they escaped with a goalless draw, having been outplayed by <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United</span></a>.</p>
              <p>After the Champions League last 16 first leg at the San Siro, the controversial Portuguese coach said of Spanish official Luis Medina Cantalejo: 'Maybe in the second game we will have a referee who is on our side.'</p>
              <p>It was the first bout of mind games with Sir Alex Ferguson, who vowed to finish off the Serie A ders in the second leg at Old Trafford in a fortnight.</p>
              <p>A United team that started without Wayne Rooney dominated Mourinho's team of Italian champions but could not break through.</p>
              <p>Former Chelsea manager Mourinho (pictured) said: 'If we go to Old Trafford and we don't have the same referee - but we have one who will give the away team so much protection - then my team will get to the quarter-final.</p>
              <p>'I don't want to go into details of things like how we didn't have a penalty. Everything was against us, every little detail. You watch how many free-kicks they had and we had. The way we got yellow cards and they did not. I think the tendency was clear.'</p>
              <p>Ferguson, who has now won just one game out of the 13 he has played against Mourinho, immediately rubbished the claims.</p>
              <div class="clear"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/02/25/article-0-03A86226000005DC-868_468x346.jpg" alt="Wayne Rooney" width="468" height="346">

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><strong>The United boss said: 'Is he serious? I saw a marvellous refereeing performance. 'The referee was not intimidated and Jose would have been hoping he was. But he was not intimidated. He was first class.'</strong></p>
              <p>Ferguson employed a 4-5-1 formation and left Rooney on the substitutes' bench until the 83rd minute, with Dimitar Berbatov handed the lone starting role in attack.</p>
              <p>The United manager is traditionally suspicious of 0-0 away draws in Europe but his team recorded that scoreline in Barcelona last season and went on to make it all the way to the Moscow final where they lifted the famous old trophy.</p>
              <p>Ferguson added: 'There's a disappointment that we have not won the game but with our record at Old Trafford, we should have a great chance. I just hope it doesn't come back to bite us.</p>
              <p>'We will be in front of our supporters and I think we have a fantastic chance.'Mourinho seemed to disappear the tunnel at fulltime without shaking hands with his old rival Ferguson.</p>
              <p>But Mourinho insisted: 'I have a special dug-out that has a door that allows me to go straight down the tunnel. But I left a 300 euros bottle of wine in his hotel with a card the day before the game. He is my friend and we are close and I will see him at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>'United do tire you out with their workrate but we can go there with the hope of doing well, scoring and going through. Before the game I would not have said I was happy with a 0-0, but as they had two or three chances to score we can accept it.'</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">JOSE MOURINHO got one thing right — nothing was decided at the San Siro last night. But on everything else, Alex Ferguson proved him totally wrong. </h2>
              <p class="article">Mourinho said Manchester United had not come to Milan for fun, they would not stand eye-to-eye with his team, that they were more interested in survival than settling the tie once and for all in the famous old stadium.</p>
              <p class="article">Well, United have never had greater fun in Europe — and entertained so regally — without scoring a goal. And they did not so much take the game to their hosts, especially in the first half, as run them off the pitch. </p>
              <p class="article">The only thing Ferguson may live to regret was leaving Wayne Rooney on the bench until the 83rd minute. The England striker must have been blinking in disbelief as United let slip one chance after another — with Dimitar Berbatov the main culprit.</p>
              <h4>Indecisive finishing</h4>
              <p class="article">And for that, United will look back on last night as not so much one of great control, authority and style but as the evening when they let Inter off the hook. The San Siro is no longer the great Italian fortress of old. Liverpool eased past Inter 1-0 here last season while Arsenal pulled off an even greater coup by beating AC Milan 2-0. </p>
              <p class="article">Inter, qualifying from the opening group stage with only two wins from six games, had already been beaten 1-0 at home by Panathinaikos. And last night the San Siro should have fallen again as United set a Champions League record of 20 consecutive games unbeaten. </p>
              <p class="article">But a mixture of indecisive finishing and defiant goalkeeping from Julio Cesar means it goes all the way back to Old Trafford on March 11. And yet this tie could so easily have been all over inside the first 45 minutes. </p>
              <p class="article">United, going with a four-man midfield of Cristiano Ronaldo, Darren Fletcher, Michael Carrick and Park Ji Sung — and with Ryan Giggs tucked in behind Berbatov — terrorised the Italian champions with the sort of attacking football that has long been their hallmark. </p>
              <p class="article">Yes, they went on the back foot during the goalless draw in the semi-final against Barcelona at the Nou Camp last season. But on a cold and misty night in Milan, it was the United of old as they so dominated their hosts in the first half that demoralised home fans — gathered under a banner proclaiming ‘The Pride of Milano’ — were reduced to whistling their own players. </p>
              <p class="article">Not having won Europe’s top prize since 1965, they should have been heading out of this season’s tournament as early as the fifth minute when Cesar only kept out a Ronaldo header with an instinctive save to his left. </p>
              <p class="article">Two minutes later the World Player of the Year put a 25-yard free-kick just past an upright as United made a mockery of Mourinho’s assertion they would be coming to close down the game, the San Siro and, no doubt, football itself.</p>
              <p class="article">Inter could only manage a couple of huge mis-hits in the vague direction of the 4,500 United supporters behind Ed van der Sar’s goal while, at the other end, it started to resemble the Alamo. </p>
              <p class="article">United were so infinitely the better team that Mourinho, prowling round his technical area, could scarcely believe what he was seeing. Berbatov then headed past the far post, Ronaldo rattled the other upright from another free-kick while Cesar somehow kept out a Giggs effort from the left of the box with his hip.</p>
              <p class="article">It was a miracle the Inter goal was still intact. It certainly should not have been when Ronaldo, with the whole target to aim at, planted a header from Giggs’ cross wide of the right post. The Inter fans were almost beside themselves, mocking the efforts of their players, one mistake following another as United turned the screw. </p>
              <p class="article">Passions were running so high on the Inter bench that reserve keeper Francesco Toldo was booked for directing a torrent of abuse at Spanish ref Luis Medina Cantalejo from the touchline. </p>
              <p class="article">And yet, incredibly, the two teams trooped off at half-time all square. At the back of your mind was the thought United had so dominated the opposition that, surely, something HAD to go wrong. </p>
              <p class="article">And they almost paid the price just after the break when Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s dummy over Esteban Cambiasso’s low cross wrong-footed the United defence, only for Adriano to screw horrendously wide. It was Inter’s first chance. But, at last, it galvanised them into action. </p>
              <p class="article">United, though, created another great chance in the 67th minute when Ronaldo skipped free down the right only to see his low cross tantalisingly evade both Park and Berbatov. </p>
              <p class="article">Giggs then had another goalbound shot blocked, though Van der Sar was grateful to pluck the ball off the line after a corner struck Cambiasso at the far post. On came Rooney for Park, but it was too late for him to achieve anything other than venting his frustration with a wild lunge at Dejan Stankovic that earned him a booking. </p>
              <p class="article">Finally, with the last kick of the match, Ronaldo saw a free-kick bounce off Cesar’s chest before being hacked away. So where will it all end? With United regretting not finishing it off here and Mourinho charging down the Old Trafford touchline as Inter grab a late goal?</p>
              <p class="article">Just as he did with Porto five years ago. </p>
              <p class="article">He can’t write the scripts as well, surely?</p>

              <p><strong>Jose Mourinho is facing a touchline ban for Inter Milan's crunch trip to </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United </strong></span></a><strong>after his outrage at the referee last night. The Portuguese boss questioned the honesty and integrity of Luis Medina Cantalejo following the goalless Champions League at the San Siro.</strong></p>
              <p>Mourinho accused the Spaniard of bias and UEFA take a hard line when the impartiality of a referee is doubted.</p>
              <p>'We are looking into Mr Mourinho's after-match statements,' said a UEFA spokesman today.</p>
              <p>Mourinho said: "Maybe in the second game we will have a referee who is on our side. 'If we go to Old Trafford and we don't have the same referee - but we have one who will give the away team so much protection - then my team will get to the quarter-final. <br><br>'I don't want to go into details of things like how we didn't have a penalty. Everything was against us, every little detail. You watch how many free-kicks they had and we had.</p>
              <p>'The way we got yellow cards and they did not. I think the tendency was clear."</p>
              <p>If charged and found guilty, Mourinho would not be allowed to play any part in the decisive second-leg tie on March 11.</p>
              <p>UEFA disciplinary regulations demand that a suspended coach cannot visit the dressing-room area upon arriving at the stadium until the game is over. It would be a signiricant blow for Inter, especially if the tie goes to a penalty shootout as Mourinho would have no input in procedings on the pitch.</p>
              <p>Four years ago UEFA branded Mourinho, then Chelsea manager 'an enemy of football' after he falsely accused Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard of visiting the dressing room of referee Anders Frisk at half-time during a Champions League tie at the Nou Camp.</p>
              <p>Mourinho was handed a two-game touchline ban but in the wake of his comments Frisk retired from refereeing after receiving death threats.</p>
              <p>However, it was alleged that to get round the touchline ban during a tie against Bayern Munich at Stamford Bridge, Mourinho communicated with his coaching staff via and earpiece and was smuggled in and out of the dressing-room at half-time in a laundry skip.<br></p>

              <h1>Jose free for Old Trafford touchline</h1>
              <p><strong>Jose Mourinho has escaped disciplinary action from Uefa after what
              seemed like post-match accusations of refereeing bias during Inter's
              0-0 draw with Manchester United on Tuesday.</strong></p>
              <p>Uefa promised to look into the Portuguese's remarks, opening up the
              possibility that he could be banned from the Old Trafford touchline if
              found guilty.</p>
              <p>However, a Uefa spokesman has since told the Press Association that 'no action will be taken'.</p>
