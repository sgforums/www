              <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/realmadrid"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Real Madrid</strong></span></a><strong> are in need of funds to finance more signings but are finding it difficult to sell several players in a tough market, according to their director general.</strong></p>
              <p>"We are constantly working on the sale of players and the door to more signings will remain closed until players leave," Jorge Valdano said today.</p>
              <p>The Spanish club, who have spent more than €200m (£172m) on four players this summer, are still looking for a central midfielder and a defender, but Valdano said they have been hampered by trading conditions.</p>
              <p>"We are in a difficult market and we will work until the very last minute to offload the players that are not in the coach's plans," he said.</p>
              <p>Real's attempt to sell their Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar to the Bundesliga side VfB Stuttgart for a reported fee of around €18m collapsed today. They are also looking to sell Huntelaar's compatriots Ruud van Nistelrooy and Royston Drenthe and the Mali midfielder Mahamadou Diarra, among others.</p>
              <p>"In some cases they [the players] are resisting and in others there are no offers," the Real sporting director Miguel Pardeza said today. "The sale operation may seem simple but it's not. It's not easy convincing them to leave Real Madrid for what is generally a lesser team," he told the Spanish daily Público.</p>

But if Real Madrid can be persuaded to give him a £4.3 million pay-off, he may settle for lower personal terms.<br><br>Real manager Manuel Pellegrini knows the club can only register 25 players for the new La Liga season, so is keen to move Huntelaar on. It has emerged tonight that Italian giants AC Milan have re-entered the chase for Huntelaar, and according to reports in Italy, Spurs are now anxious to move quickly, with more talks planned between Huntelaar's agent and Real Madrid officials this weekend in the hope of breaking the deadlock.<br><br>According to<em><span style="color: #333332;"> The Mail, </span></em>Spurs chairman Daniel Levy would prefer to snare Huntelaar than Portsmouth's Peter Crouch, whose £12 million price tag he regards as excessive.<br><br>Meanwhile, Spurs may need to strengthen their defensive options, with Jonathan Woodgate and Michael Dawson both injured and likely to miss the start of the new season, and captain Ledley King not yet having kicked a ball in the pre-season programme. <em><span style="color: #333332;">The Mail</span></em> reckons Redknapp could make a move for Newcastle United's centre-back Sebastien Bassong.</p>
