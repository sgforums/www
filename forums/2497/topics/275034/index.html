But 'Little Sam' admits he is well aware there is only so much time in the Premier League where relegation can be a financial disaster. </strong><br><br>For the second time in four days, Lee - winner of just one point last season after Allardyce's dramatic walk-out - saw his side spurn an early lead and plunge to their third defeat of the new campaign at Fratton Park. Portsmouth's Nigerian strikers Kanu and John Utaka wiped out Nicolas Anelka's 12th-minute strike to give Pompey the edge just before the half-hour and Matt Taylor clinched the points with a late penalty when Kanu won a penalty following new French defender Gerald Cid's naive challenge.<br><br>Lee said: "Obviously it is a disappointing start with three straight defeats. But there is a long way to go and it is all about staying positive and seeing the progress and development." Liverpool legend Lee admits he has tried to inject more subtlety into Bolton's traditionally muscular approach but his experiment of playing skipper Kevin Nolan as a support striker behind Nicolas Anelka did not work.<br><br>It was abandoned early in the second half when Nolan was taken off and he curtly admitted: "I'm not happy. I don't know where I am supposed to play." Lee admitted: "I've been accused of all kind of things, to be honest. And when you have had three defeats it does lend itself to all kind of things. "But it is all about time. People need time to make changes. They are not radical changes but it as all about basics. "I think we played some attractive football and that is where I have seen progress, although it hasn't manifested itself in results, but I come from a winning culture and it is all about hard work and wanting to improve.<br><br>"Flak and a few jibes come with the territory, but just because I am a novice manager people think I am new to the game. I have been in football a long time, first as a player and then a coach, but people seem to forget that. "I have worked under some very good managers and feel I have learned an awful lot, but a certain amount of patience is needed.<br><br>"Dealing with the flak comes in all kinds of scenarios. There have been a couple of sleepless nights, for sure, but it is my job to try to lift the players, and I don't like getting beaten. "You can't buy experience. It comes with games, and that is why perhaps I need people to be a bit patient."<br><br>In a patchy game the high quality of three goals flattered the rest of the action, and Bolton were entitled to believe their contribution was worth a point. But Portsmouth deserved enormous credit for winning despite a makeshift defence and midfield as Sol Campbell, Noe Pamarot, Nico Kranjcar, Lauren and Pedro Mendes were all ruled out by injuries and new Â£7.2million record signing Sulley Muntari was missing due to suspension.<br><br>Campbell, 32, will now miss his England comeback chance against Germany on Wednesday because of a groin injury, with Redknapp confirming the centre back will not even report to the international camp.<br><br></div>
