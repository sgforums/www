              <p>French
              international Malouda enjoyed arguably his best season at Chelsea in
              2008/09 and he is frustrated at not being first-choice in Ancelotti's
              starting XI.</p>
              <p>Malouda has spoken to Ancelotti about his
              frustration, but he revealed the club will not allow anyone to leave
              before the end of the season.</p>
              <p>Malouda told <em>L'Equipe</em>:
              "Carlo Ancelotti's tactical system is physically very demanding.
              Recently we showed less intensity, the game was less fluid. But that
              system allowed us to be in our current position. All the players
              support it.</p>
              <p>"Before the match against Birmingham, I talked to the coach. I told him about my frustration.</p>
              <p>"I
              believe I have succeeded in my start to the season, but during the key
              matches against Arsenal or Man Utd, I was on the bench.</p>

              <p>"Ancelotti
              is aware of it. But currently I am paying for that system. It is not
              that easy for him either, he has a big group to manage.</p>
              <p>"My
              competition with Lampard as left midfielder? It is his best position.
              He played like that in the England team, and we are in a World Cup
              year.</p>
              <p>"But at a certain point, the status has to be in relationship with the performances.</p>
              <p>"Anyway, I am fine so far. I could still be outstanding when I play.</p>

              </p><h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">FLORENT MALOUDA has launched a blistering attack on 
              Chelsea team-mate Frank Lampard. <span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">The Frenchman claims Lamps is picked by Carlo Ancelotti because 
              of his status — not his form. And Malouda, 29, also believes the England ace is currently 
              playing in HIS position on the left-hand side of Ancelotti's midfield 
              diamond.</span></h2>
              <p class="article">The winger blasted: "It's a problem of status within the club. "Lampard gets to play in the same position he occupies in the 
              England national side — and we are in a World Cup year.</p>
              <p class="article">"But a player's first-team status at any given moment ought to 
              bear a relation to his performances. Things have got to change.</p>
              <p class="article">"Last season, I had the status of one of the leading players. 
              Now I am back in question."</p>
              <p class="article">Lampard has scored eight goals in 26 games for the Blues this 
              season, compared to Malouda's four in 25. But the former Lyon ace, who is contracted until 2013, is upset 
              at being left on the bench for the big games against Manchester United, Arsenal, 
              Liverpool and Manchester City. And he is ready to walk away from Stamford Bridge if his 
              situation does not improve.</p>
              <p class="article">Malouda added: "I would love Chelsea to have the confidence to 
              start me in matches. "The system we use has enabled us to be where we are in the 
              table. "But we can find solutions by using the wings more. Playing 
              through the middle, we can end up in a traffic jam.</p>
              <p class="article">"I think I had a good start to the season but I find myself on 
              the bench for important games. I feel frustrated when it comes to our big games.</p>
              <p class="article">"I have put the problem to the manager. If there is no place 
              for me in the system, I can go and look elsewhere.</p>
              <p class="article">"Finding another club is not a problem."</p>

              <p>Patchy...</p>
              <p>Alex is suay enuff to get injury during start of season, and thats why he is not the fisrt to the XI.</p>
              <p>However I still feel for Chelsea's set piece problem, Alex will be able to dealt it better than Cavalho.</p>

              <p>But Lamps wasn't performing for the past few seasons like what he did during the Mourinho era where he scores goals like nobody's business. Malouda was right about the preferential treatment of Lamps but i'm afraid he will be the loser here and will be sold eventually.</p>

              <p>I think he is just being played out of his best position this season that's all... And also age could be catching up with him and Gerrard... cos I find they both aren't playing to their usual standard this season...</p>
              <p>Lotti's diamond formation is also not to his style of play of box to box, now he seems like he is being push more to the left a bit rather than at the top of the diamond... as Deco is given the attacking midfielder's role...</p>
              <p>Maybe that's why Malouda is not happy... a none left footer playing in his position while he, a natural left footer sits on the bench...</p>

              <p><strong>Florent Malouda insists he didn't say 'anything bad' about team-mate Frank Lampard or manager Carlo Ancelotti. The interview the </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea </strong></span></a><strong>midfielder gave in France was 'badly translated',   apparently. But after falling back on that lame and clichéd get out, key questions about Malouda's future remain.</strong></p>
              <p>The piece that provoked him into a PR campaign last weekend moaned about   Lampard getting preferential treatment and had the Frenchman deciding it was time to leave.</p>
              <p>Even if Malouda thought his sentiments had been far more sensitively and less   categorically put, he really does not have a case. Malouda has been brilliant and awful in his time at Chelsea, but he is at his best when out wide.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti's diamond formation doesn't help much with that so his response should be to knuckle down and adapt.</p>
              <p>Hoping to oust Lampard is misguided. The England midfielder is one of Chelsea' s best players and most consistent scorers.</p>
              <p>It is Malouda's bad luck that Lampard plays on the left for Chelsea and is seldom injured, so he should accept it is a squad game and maybe look  further forward for more playing time.</p>
              <p>The France midfielder's game record for his club this season has not been bad. </p>
              <p>There have been nine starts and six substitute appearances in the Premier League, which is more than Jose Bosingwa, Joe Cole, Deco and Salomon Kalou and only one less than John Mikel Obi.</p>
              <p>Malouda has started 10 games in the other competitions too so the toys are coming out of the pram a little early - even if they are being thrown sensitively and the lobbing is not misinterpreted as hurling. But if he really isn't happy with his lot at Chelsea maybe he should think about reinvention. </p>
              <p>Chelsea have a problem during the Africa Cup of Nations with a lack of convincing strikers and when Malouda joined he claimed to be comfortable as a second forward, somewhere he has played before.</p>
              <p>So why not push for a place alongside Nicolas Anelka up front as well as a midfield berth? It has got to be better than the alternatives.    </p>
