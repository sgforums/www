              <p>Ah Roy was still operating under Hicks budget.</p>
              <p>At lease this poulsen have played some game.</p>
              <p>The milan guy is completely invisible and dun know whether he can play or not.</p>
              <p>Ah Roy have to lan lan and let the spurs guy decide what he can have.</p>
              <p>Hope this Comolli guy have get rid of all the rubbish players that Ah Ben have stock up in Anfield and bring in real promising players to Liverpool.</p>
              <p>As for Ah Roy, if he were to stick to his chicken defensive tactics like last night, he will shipped out in Jan 2011 also.</p>

              <p>Wrong buy for Hodgson. Chinese New Year spring cleaning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Time for some serious shopping during january. Hodgson needs a striker to complement Torres in front and alleviate the pressure on Torres scoring every game. A good buy would be Sergio Aguero from Athletico Madrid.</p>
