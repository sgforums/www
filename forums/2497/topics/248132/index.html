Schuster had an oral agreement with Real president RamÃ³n CalderÃ³n but German news agency DPA report the former Real Madrid player now has a signed deal that states he will take over from 1 July 2007.</strong><br><br>Despite denying initial reports of a deal in Spanish newspaper AS earlier on Thursday, Schuster's representatives later confirmed the details of the pre-contract agreement to Deutsche Presse-Agentur.<br><br>If Real decide not to appoint Schuster as Fabio Capello's successor the former German international will receive Â€1m. Likewise, if Schuster decides not to rejoin the club where he spent some of his most glorious years as a player he will have to shell out Â€1m.<br><br>Schuster, who was a flamboyant playmaker for both Barcelona and Real Madrid, has forged one of the best defences in Spain, at Getafe, and his knowledge of La Liga puts him ahead of other candidates such as Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez and Russia coach Guus Hiddink.<br><br>In March, Schuster boosted his stock with the Madridstas when he lambasted out-of-favour Capello. 'Capello only wants to win, it does not matter how, and with that philosophy you will never succeed at Real Madrid,' he said. 'It is practically certain he won't be coach of Real Madrid next season.'<br><br>Since then Schuster has been involved with planning Madrid's summer transfer campaign - demanding any plans of sell defender Fabio Cannavaro are shelved, approving a move for Germany international Christophe Metzelder and suggesting Â£50m is decent price for Cristiano Ronaldo.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Too bad jose, seems like the Madrid job is taken... Better be nice to Roman now if you still want to stay...</span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Real Madrid is a problem club lah... Whoever go there will get sack within 2 yrs, 3 tops and they will show you the door... Jose going there will be wasting his time only... But he won't want to manage another EPL club right now cos he may not be able to do much without the money and he probably won't be able to take it if a few teams can beat his...<br><br>I think Newcastle is his best choice if he is still in the EPL cos they are quite a big club as well. Actually, come to think of it... they are bigger than chelsea. They got more supporters than chelsea and got money too.<br><br>Maybe he should wait for the England post to be open... maybe in June... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
