              <h1>Robinho Upset With Madrid Over Ronaldo</h1>
              <p><strong>After revealing this week that his client was aware of a bid in the works from Chelsea, Robinho's agent, Vágner Ribeiro, has added that the Brazilian is disappointed at his treatment during 'Ronaldogate'...</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42465000/jpg/_42465404_robinho203.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="152"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Robinho has in recent times been linked not only to Chelsea, but also to Manchester United. With the latter club, though, he has not been mentioned as a transfer target in his own right, but rather as a makeweight in Madrid's attempts to land Cristiano Ronaldo.<br><br>This status as the "player" in a "player-plus-cash" deal does not sit well with the young winger, who still aims to one day be crowned the best player in the world. Ribeiro explained, "Neither he nor I liked that he's being used as a bargaining chip. It devalues him as an athlete.<br><br>"Robinho is better than or equal to Cristiano Ronaldo. Had Real Madrid won the Champions League I have no doubt that he'd have been named as the best in the world."<br><br>This, coupled with rumours of disagreements over a new contract at the Bernabéu, could see Robinho move on, but Ribeiro preferred not to be hasty. "Robinho must be back in Madrid on the 14th (of July)," said the agent. "I'll travel with him, or I'll see him a little earlier. Let's see how things end up."</p>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>CHELSEA have made Robinho their next target after he hinted that he would be willing to leave Real Madrid. The Brazil superstar, 24, feels he is undervalued at the Bernabeu after speculation that he could be used as a makeweight in Real's bid for Manchester United ace Cristiano Ronaldo.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">New Blues boss Luiz Felipe Scolari, who sealed the signing of Deco yesterday, is keen on bringing Robinho to Stamford Bridge. And the striker's agent Wagner Ribiero revealed: "I spoke with Frank Arnesen and two of his associates.</p>
              <p class="article">“They confirmed Chelsea’s intention to contact Robinho.” "Robinho's priority is to stay with Real Madrid but he cannot be in a place where he is not valued. "For the time being he is not and I am not talking about financially.</p>
              <p class="article">"Neither Robinho or myself like that Real Madrid are prepared to use him as part of an exchange in their bid to sign Cristiano Ronaldo. "We do not understand this attitude and we want them to begin to value Robinho because they are not at the moment. "Robinho is as good if not better than Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>

              <p class="article"><strong>Robinho's Brazil team-mate Ronaldinho, who is also a target for Chelsea, admits he is flattered by Scolari's interest in him. The Barcelona star, 28, said: "It is marvellous that Scolari is interested in signing me because he is an excellent coach.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">"I have a lot of respect for him because I have known him since I was very young and he was coach of Gremio. "If the chance came up to work with him again then it would be very good. "We have a history together in the game, we won the World Cup and that is something I will never forget."</p>

              <p><strong>Robinho could be Luiz Felipe Scolari's next recruit after the Real Madrid forward's agent claimed he had met Chelsea sporting director Frank Arnesen to discuss a move to Stamford Bridge.</strong></p>
              <p>Former Brazil coach Scolari made his first move as Chelsea manager on Monday by signing Deco from Barcelona and could return to La Liga for his second, according to Robinho's representative Vagner Ribeiro.</p>
              <p>Ribeiro is determined to get the best move for the Real Madrid winger and claims he is better than Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo, who has been targeted by the Spanish champions.</p>
              <p>'It's true that Chelsea are interested in signing Robinho,' Ribeiro told Spanish sports daily <em>AS</em>. 'They have been after him for a while and there has been much more contact since Scolari became the new Chelsea coach. 'I met with (Frank) Arnesen in London and he confirmed to me that Chelsea wanted my player for next season.'</p>
              <p>Ribeiro believes Real are undervaluing Robinho and not treating him as he well as he deserves. The Spanish league champions are reportedly keen to offload the player to free up some cash to buy Ronaldo, but Ribeiro insists his client is as good as, if not better than, the Portugal international.</p>
              <p>'Neither Robinho nor I like the fact that Real Madrid can use him as part exchange in their bid to sign Cristiano Ronaldo,' he continued. 'We don't like this attitude and we want Madrid to start valuing Robinho because at the moment they're not.</p>
              <p>'Robinho is as good a player as Cristiano Ronaldo or better. The difference is that Cristiano Ronaldo reached the Champions League final and Robinho didn't.</p>
