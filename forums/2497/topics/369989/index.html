              <p><strong>Live grenade outside Dalglish home</strong></p>
              <p>Police are investigating after a live hand grenade was found on a garden wall at the home of football legend Kenny Dalglish.</p>
              <p>The
              explosive device was discovered on Sunday night as police made searches
              in connection with an on-going incident unconnected with the former
              Liverpool manager.</p>
              <p>The Army's bomb disposal team were called to
              the address, in Selworthy Road, Southport, Merseyside, and the area was
              cordoned off for the public's safety.</p>
              <p>A Merseyside Police spokeswoman said: "The device was removed and made safe and is currently undergoing forensic examination.</p>
              <p>"The
              road remains cordoned off at its junction with Sandringham Road and
              high-visibility patrols have been stepped up in the area to reassure
              the public.</p>
              <p>"Detectives believe this incident is linked to a
              series of other recent incidents in this area and not to the owner of
              the property where the device was found."</p>
              <p>It is not known if anybody was at the Dalglish home when the alarm was raised at around 10.15pm.</p>
              <p>A
              member of the public alerted police after seeing two men acting
              suspiciously in the area. The men, aged in their 20s, were arrested a
              short time later on suspicion of witness intimidation.</p>
              <p>Mr Dalglish was returning to the UK after attending the club's tour of the Far East.</p>
              <p>It was announced earlier this month that he had resumed his Anfield career with a senior role at Liverpool's Academy.</p>

              <p>A man and a woman are being questioned in connection with the discovery
              of a live hand grenade found outside the home of football hero Kenny
              Dalglish.</p>
              <p>The grenade was discovered on the garden wall of the former Liverpool manager's
              house in Southport, Merseyside, on July 27.</p>
              <p>Merseyside Police said that they arrested a 21-year-old man and a
              50-year-old woman from the L13 area of Liverpool on suspicion of conspiracy to
              commit murder.</p>
              <p>They are in custody and are being questioned by detectives.</p>
              <p>Two other men have been charged with the same offence and will appear before
              Liverpool Crown Court next month.</p>
              <p>The incident was not thought to be an attack on Mr Dalglish or his family.</p>
              <p>The grenade was found by police searching the local area as part of an
              investigation.</p>
              <p>The army's bomb disposal team were called to the house, in Selworthy Road,
              Birkdale, and the area was cordoned off for the public's safety until the
              grenade was taken away for forensic examination.</p>
              <p>Nobody was injured in the incident.</p>
              <p>Simon Lewis Ignacio, 28, of Lee Park Avenue, Belle Vale, Liverpool, and Carl
              Higgins, 29, of Helston Green, Huyton-with-Roby, Merseyside, are charged with
              conspiracy to commit murder.</p>
              <p>They are in custody and will appear at Liverpool Crown Court on September 2.</p>
