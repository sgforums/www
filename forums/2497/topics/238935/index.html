            <div class='col-md body'>Lille point finger at United<br>By Tom Adams -  Created on 22 Feb 2007<br><br>Lille director general Xavier Thuilot has hinted that Manchester United should be thrown out of the UEFA Champions League following the worrying crowd scenes that accompanied their clash on Tuesday night.<br><br>Uefa has already launched an investigation into the events that saw the United end of the ground apparently suffer from overcrowding in a stormy 1-0 win for the English side.<br><br>French police sprayed tear gas at the away crowd after some supporters attempted to scale perimeter fencing, and it has been reported that 5,000 fans were in a section of terracing designed to hold 3,500.<br><br>Uefa will discuss the issue on 22nd March after investigating 'possible violations of binding Uefa safety and security instructions by the host club, as well as the alleged improper conduct of both sets of supporters'.<br><br>United are planning to submit their own report to Uefa after consulting fans that were present at Stade Felix-Bollaert - some of whom have complained of heavy-handed policing - but Lille have now pointed the finger at their English counterparts.<br><br>Thuilot has claimed that the actions of some United fans were in a similar vein to those Feyenoord supporters who resulted in their team being expelled from the Uefa Cup following trouble in a game against Nancy.<br><br>"Uefa gave the green light to our security measures on the morning of the match so if they punish us they are in effect punishing themselves," Thuilot told a press conference.<br><br>"Manchester United are imposing their own brand of the law to Lille football club, to the Felix-Bollaert stadium and to Uefa.<br><br>"There was a real will on their part to impose their side of the story right from the full-time whistle because the club knows what's at stake following incidents involving their supporters.<br><br>"It's up to Uefa to rule on the issue, but we are clearly in the same category as Feyenoord."<br><br>Thuilot also blamed United's early release of match tickets for a number of forgeries, leading to alleged overcrowding in the away end.<br><br>"We sent their quota of places to Manchester several weeks ago, as is the usual thing to do.<br><br>"But the English club, instead of distributing the tickets to their supporters on their arrival at the stadium (or) on their descent from the bus, sent them out a month ago.<br><br>"The result - some very good forgeries, which have allowed some supporters to enter the stand reserved for them. All the forged tickets on the night were Manchester United tickets."<br><br>United have quickly rejected such accusations, replying: "Tickets were distributed by recorded delivery 11 days before the game or for collection from February 1.<br><br>"We would normally send out tickets for our home games at Old Trafford six weeks before the match and we have no problems with forgeries."</div>

European football's governing body has also charged the French side's players with improper conduct.</strong><br><br>Lille's players threatened to walk off the pitch after Ryan Giggs scored from a quickly-taken free-kick in Lens on Tuesday. The French club had claimed the referee should have blown his whistle beforehand, and asked for the game to be replayed.<br><br>A UEFA statement read: Â“Having examined the official refereeÂ’s report, the television evidence at hand as well as the laws of the game, the UEFA control and disciplinary body decided to reject the protest, as there was no proof of a technical error. Â“As a result, the body declared that the goal was perfectly valid.<br><br>Â“Furthermore, the control and disciplinary body decided to instigate proceedings against Lille for the improper behaviour of their players immediately after the goal.
