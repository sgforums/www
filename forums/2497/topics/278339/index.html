For us this is very serious, we are coming to win.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s a game I still treasure to this day. For the rest of the team and I it was very special and was a great victory on the way to winning the World Cup.<br><br>Â“Everyone talks about the 'Hand of God' from this match, it was a bit of mischief, the goalkeeper had the advantage of grabbing with his hands. It was too high for me and I stuck out my fist.<br><br>Â“After the goal, I was waiting for my team-mates to embrace me and no one came. I told them, come hug me or the referee isnÂ’t going to allow it.Â”<br><br>Argentina went on to win the tournament in Mexico in 1986, with England left wondering what could have been.<br><br>And Peter Reid, who played in that game, sees the upcoming clash as an opportunity for England to get one over their victors.<br><br>He said: Â“ItÂ’s one of those games thatÂ’s talked about so much and meant so much that itÂ’s impossible to forget how devastating it was to lose and to lose to one absolutely amazing goal but also to one which was a little dubious!<br><br>Â“This is our chance to show what we can do and get a little bit of revenge.<br><br>Â“TheyÂ’ve said theyÂ’re coming to play and thatÂ’s fine by us, weÂ’re going out to win - no question.Â”</div>
