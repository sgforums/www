              <h1>Robinho to snub Chelsea for new Madrid deal</h1>
              <h2>Robinho has reportedly told Real Madrid he will turn down Chelsea’s approaches provided the Spanish champions double his annual salary to £4 million.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/00789/robinho_789647c.jpg" alt="Target: Chelsea are keen to bring Robino to Stamford Bridge" width="460" height="288"></p>
              <p><em>Suspicions of Robinho simply using Chelsea’s interest to engineer a bigger contract from Madrid.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Madrid daily AS claims Robinho feels undervalued at the Bernabeu, where his contract does not compare with top earners like Raul, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Fabio Cannavaro.</strong></p>
              <p>Robinho would certainly earn more at Stamford Bridge, where he could expect wages of up to £100,000 a week. But the AS report also claims the Brazilian’s overwhelming preference is to remain at Madrid - with an improved contract.</p>
              <p>The paper says Robinho has no enthusiasm for English football and has admitted his dislike for the British climate. And, if true, that would seem to fuel suspicions Robinho is simply using Chelsea’s interest to engineer a bigger contract from Madrid.</p>
              <p>With Cristiano Ronaldo now staying at United, Madrid will be more keen to keep hold of Robinho, and they will certainly have more funds available to improve the terms of his contract.</p>
              <p>Chelsea made a formal offer for the former Santos player last week, thought to be worth around £25m, but that has been rejected by Madrid.</p>
              <p>Earlier this summer, Robinho’s agent, Wagner Ribeiro, said Luiz Felipe Scolari’s recent appointment at Stamford Bridge would certainly make Chelsea a more exciting prospect.</p>
              <p>“What’s making Robinho seriously consider accepting Chelsea’s offer is that Scolari helped him a lot when he still wasn’t very well known in Europe,” said Ribeiro.</p>
              <p>Should Robinho leave for Chelsea, AS claim Madrid would move for Valencia’s David Villa, who scored four goals during Spain’s victorious Euro 2008 campaign.</p>

              <p>No the reason was at that time, United didn't want to pay PSG $20 over million pounds for Ronaldino... During that time, Ronaldino was a good player but he still wasn't the big star that he would become in 2004 / 2005 onwards... </p>
              <p>United bid much lesser for him but Barce came in after their then new president Laporta promised to bring in Beckham to Barce during his election campaign pledge, fail to get Beckham...</p>
              <p>United were willing to let Beck go to Barce but Beck prefer to go to Real... Having fail in their bid for Beck, Barce then went for Ronaldino and were willing to pay PSG what they were asking...</p>
              <p>I don't think any United fan can blame Ronaldino cos it was the United board lead by Kenyon that didn't want to pay the demanded transfer fee in the first place... Ronaldino wanted to come but United couldn't agree on the fees with PSG for him... It drag on for too long like we are seeing in the Berbatov deal right now... From Barce wasn't keen to they became interested after losing out on Beckham. </p>
              <p>Moreover, United's offer was much lesser and also included Fabien Barthez to PSG which they didn't want... lol</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon is still hopeful of getting Robinho to sign at Stamford Bridge. Real Madrid have turned down an offer from Chelsea for 24-year-old Robinho but Kenyon believes they can still sign him before the end of the transfer window.</strong></p>
              <p>The Brazil forward would bolster the options of boss Luiz Felipe Scolari, who can now be certain of Lampard being in his midfield after 18 months of contract stalemate ended in the England international signing a five-year deal.</p>
              <p>On the possibility of signing Robinho, Kenyon said: "It is continuing. Hopefully not for as long as the speculation about Frank. "We've still got a few days left of the window and hopefully we'll get a result."</p>
              <p>Earlier Real Madrid boss Bernd Schuster insists Robinho will not be sold. Schuster is adamant Robinho, who scored in Tuesday's pre-season draw with Eintracht Frankfurt, is going nowhere and is happy at the club.</p>
              <p>"We are not contemplating his departure - Robi will continue with us," Schuster told <em>Marca. </em>"Robinho is happy as always."</p>
