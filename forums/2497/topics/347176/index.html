              <p class="small bold">TIME'S UP... for Tony Adams</p>
              <p class="small bold"> </p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">TONY ADAMS was last night sacked as Portsmouth boss after just 15 weeks in charge. He was told of the decision in a phone call from chief exec Peter Storrie. </h2>
              <p class="article">Anxious Fratton owner Alexandre Gaydamak called time on Adams’ brief reign — even though he gave assurances just a week ago that the former Arsenal star would be in charge at least until the end of the season.</p>
              <p class="article">Russian Gaydamak, who is currently trying to sell the club, fears he will never find a buyer if Pompey are relegated from the Premier League. And he decided to swing the axe before the team were plunged into the bottom three. </p>
              <p class="article">Adams, 42, was officially appointed on October 28 following Harry Redknapp’s controversial decision to move to Spurs. But the team managed just two wins in 15 league games under his leadership. And they have plunged from seventh place in the table to 16th — just one point above the relegation zone. </p>
              <p class="article">Ironically, his first and last league games in charge were against Liverpool. The Fratton Park outfit lost 1-0 at Anfield and 3-2 at home on Saturday evening. They have not won a league game since November and took just 10 points with the former Arsenal and England defender as their manager.</p>
              <h4>Dumped</h4>
              <p class="article">They also surrendered the FA Cup they won under Redknapp last season to Championship Swansea and were dumped out of the UEFA Cup. A club source said last night: “Tony was told about the decision in a phone call from the chief executive on Sunday afternoon. It came as a complete surprise to him as he had previously been told he was safe until the end of the season. </p>
              <p class="article">“But Saturday’s 3-2 home defeat by Liverpool has left the club too close to the bottom three for comfort and the owner has reluctantly decided something had to change.” </p>
              <p class="article">Adams had a 1½-year contract with a further option for another year after that. He will return to Fratton today to say his farewells to staff. Pompey coaches Paul Hart and Guy Whittingham have been placed in temporary charge of team affairs. But Gaydamak hopes to have a new boss in place before Saturday’s crucial home game against Manchester City.</p>

              <p><strong>Tony Adams has been sacked as Portsmouth manager after just 22 games in charge.</strong></p>
              <p>Adams parted company with the south coast side after owner Alexandre Gaydamak and executive chairman Peter Storrie met for crisis talks following Saturday’s 3-2 defeat at home to Liverpool.</p>
              <p>That loss, in which Pompey conceded two goals in the last five minutes, left the FA Cup holders just one point above the relegation zone. Portsmouth were seventh when former Arsenal and England captain Adams replaced Harry Redknapp in October.</p>
              <p>Gaydamak wanted to fire him after losing 3-1 at Fulham last weekend but decided to give him one more match. Adams presided over only four victories and just two league wins, making him statistically the worst manager in Portsmouth’s history.</p>
              <p>Former Chelsea boss Avram Grant and ex-Charlton chief Alan Curbishley are among the candidates to take over.</p>

              <p>They should have done this one week ago liao then they might not have lost to Pool...</p>
              <p>Adams is a very terrible manager, he should have taken out one of his strikers and add a defender when his side gone back up 2 - 1 but he did nothing and that was punished.</p>
              <p>I honestly don't think any Premiership club would appoint him as their manager for a long time to come cos he just doesn't cut it at the top... He even took a League One side <span style="color: #000000;">Wycombe Wanderers</span> down to League Two... Which numb skull actually thought he could do the job at Portsmouth...</p>

              <h1>Portsmouth sack Tony Adams</h1>
              <h2>Portsmouth have confirmed that manager Tony Adams has left the club "with immediate effect".</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01292/tony-adams_1292179c.jpg" alt="Tony Adams - Portsmouth sack Tony Adams" width="460" height="287"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Adams, who took over as manager following the departure of Harry Redknapp to Tottenham in October, managed just two wins in 16 league games leaving the club within a point of the relegation zone. First-team coach John Metgod was also sacked.</p>
              <p>A club spokesman said: "This has been a very difficult decision and Tony has worked tirelessly to arrest the slump in form.</p>
              <p>"He is rightfully highly-respected within the football world and played a major role in our FA Cup triumph last season.</p>
              <p>"We would like to thank him and John and wish them well in the future."</p>
              <p>Adams came close to losing his job after the 3-1 defeat at Fulham the previous weekend but it was decided to give the manager a chance to hold on to his job.</p>
              <p>Former Chelsea manager Avram Grant, who worked alongside Redknapp at Fratton Park before moving to Stamford Bridge, and ex-Charlton manager Alan Curbishley are among the candidates to replace Adams at Fratton Park.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Portsmouth contenders</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Avram Grant </strong><br>Available and believed to crave a return to the Premier League. He already knows the club after working at Portsmouth as technical director and his reputation was arguably enhanced by his time at Chelsea.</p>
              <p><strong>Alan Curbishley </strong><br>Out of work since standing down as West Ham manager in protest at the club's transfer policy. His record in rescuing West Ham from a seemingly hopeless position two years ago will surely have been noted at Portsmouth.</p>
              <p><strong>Glenn Hoddle </strong><br>Currently working in Spain where he has launched the Glenn Hoddle Academy which is designed to give young players a second chance after they have been released by English clubs. However, he has been out of management since 2006 after failing to guide Wolves into the Premier League.</p>
              <p><strong>Sven-Goran Eriksson</strong> <br>Currently manager of the Mexican national team, but may be tempted by a return to the Premier League. He won admiration for his season at Manchester City and has previously won league titles in Sweden, Portugal and Italy. However, the financial constraints at Portsmouth may make him cautious about the possibility of succeeding Tony Adams.</p>
              <p><strong>Steve McClaren </strong><br>Currently rehabilitating himself in Holland with FC Twente, who are still in the Uefa Cup and second in the Dutch league, above both Ajax and PSV Eindhoven. Also has plenty of Premier League experience following five years managing Middlesbrough.</p>
              <p><strong>Roy Keane </strong><br>Another candidate who is currently out of work and would certainly generate much excitement on the south coast. Guided Sunderland to the Premier League and kept them up last season, though walked out last year and may not yet wish to return to management.</p>
              <p><strong>... and the latest odds</strong></p>
              <p><strong>10/11</strong> Avram Grant <br><strong>5/2</strong> Alan Curbishley <br><strong>8/1</strong> Glenn Hoddle <br><strong>10/1</strong> Sven Goran Eriksson <br><strong>14/1</strong> Paul Hart <br><strong>14/1</strong> Paul Ince <br><strong>14/1</strong> Paul Jewell <br><strong>20/1</strong> Terry Venables <br><strong>20/1</strong> George Graham</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">PORTSMOUTH’S senior players stuck the knife into Tony Adams after the 3-2 home defeat by Liverpool.</h2>
              <p class="article">Owner Sacha Gaydamak had initially been prepared to give Adams more time — despite his despair at Pompey conceding two goals in the last five minutes on Saturday. But SunSport has learned that one senior player, supported by his colleagues, contacted Gaydamak to tell him the dressing room no longer had any confidence in Adams and the manager had to go.</p>
              <p class="article">Gaydamak further canvassed opinion among board members. And by Sunday morning he decided he had no option but to sack Adams, with the club one point above the relegation zone having won only TWO of their last 16 league games.</p>
              <p class="article">It was a brutal end to Adams’ reign but his players no longer had any faith in him. They were shocked during the Liverpool clash that, after going 2-1 ahead, Adams did not seem capable of employing the right tactics to shore the game up and make sure of three points — or one, at the very least.</p>
              <p class="article">And, when the match ended, they were equally surprised to return to the changing room and be praised for their performance rather than get a rollicking. The sight of assistant boss Johnny Metgod laughing and joking with one of the Liverpool goalscorers, fellow Dutchman Dirk Kuyt, did not go down well either.</p>
              <p class="article">The perception was of a rudderless ship heading towards the rocks. For all Adams’ experience as a masterful defender with Arsenal and England, as a manager he was all at sea.</p>
              <p class="article">A week earlier, Gaydamak had sought the opinion of Pompey’s senior stars after the 3-1 defeat at Fulham and was persuaded to give the fledgling boss more time, having been in charge less than four months.</p>
              <p class="article">Adams, 42, had been forced to sell key players like Lassana Diarra and Jermain Defoe which hardly helped his cause, with Gaydamak refusing to bankroll the club any more. But the writing was already on the wall. Once it became known the owner was airing his doubts, there was no way back.</p>
              <p class="article">The players had been given the power to rule on when, or if, Adams should go and over the weekend they sharpened the blade. It was player-power laid bare. Those Adams thought he could trust had done for him. A Fratton Park insider said: “Gaydamak could not keep Adams on once he heard what the players were thinking.</p>
              <p class="article">“The manager had lost the dressing room completely and was made to pay the price. “Although Portsmouth played well for a large part of the Liverpool game, the team needed direction to hold on to the lead and didn’t feel they got that. “And Adams’ attitude in the dressing room afterwards was little more than, ‘Never mind lads, better luck next time’.</p>
              <p class="article">“But that’s not enough. A manager has to show direction and leadership, so the players have a man they can believe in and someone they are prepared to put their body on the line for.</p>
              <p class="article">“Adams might have brought out that spirit as a captain at Arsenal but he couldn’t do it as a manager.”</p>
              <p class="article">Adams said: “I’m a little bit surprised but results haven’t been good. I haven’t had a lot of time and I certainly haven’t had the financial backing. We’ve had a few injuries as well and that’s tough to take.</p>
              <p class="article">“It has not turned me off management. I’ve just got to make sure I get all the parameters right before I walk into the next one. “I can’t wait to get back in and have another bash. But I won’t be impulsive. I’ve got to learn from that and make sure I get things right.”</p>
