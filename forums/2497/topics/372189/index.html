              <p> </p>
              <p>He may currently be exiled from the Premier League, his
              contributions now coming from the comfort of a TV studio, yet Alan
              Shearer is remembered as the greatest goalscorer in its history.</p>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Still
              in limbo as a king-in-waiting at Newcastle United, as his beloved club
              seek new owners who will surely ask the local hero back to St James'
              Park, Shearer cuts a disgruntled dash these days. His familiar beaming
              smile, coupled with a single raised arm, have not been seen in
              combination for some time, with his last playing appearance coming back
              in April 2006. His eight games in charge of the Magpies as manager
              provided little opportunity for jollity.</p>
              <p>Yet from the very
              first weekend of the "whole new ball game" of the Premier League, until
              injury struck in a fateful Tyne-Tees derby to bring forward his
              retirement date, there were few more familiar sights than Shearer
              peeling away in celebration. After all, it occurred 261 times in 15
              seasons, a record that may never be broken. Second-placed and
              now-retired Andy Cole lags far behind on 187.</p>
              <p>He is, of course,
              most closely associated with Newcastle but it was at Blackburn Rovers
              that he was at his devastating goal-plundering best. In three straight
              seasons - 1993-94, 1994-95 and 1995-96 - he scored more than thirty
              goals. The middle of those saw him inspire Rovers to their first - and
              likely last - league title of the modern era. That was to remain his
              sole medal in English football, an awful return for a player of such
              standing.</p>
              <p>A native Geordie, and famously the son of a sheet-metal
              worker, the young Shearer joined the footballing production line of
              Wallsend Boys Club where fellow graduates include Steve Bruce, Michael
              Carrick and Peter Beardsley. Yet, in typically single-minded fashion,
              he chose to sign youth forms for south-coast club Southampton even when
              Newcastle showed interest in him.</p>
              <p>It was the correct decision.
              Then, as now, Newcastle were a club in constant flux, while the Saints
              had a successful youth programme. Shearer followed the Wallace brothers
              and Matthew Le Tissier into the first-team and, at just 17, announced
              himself in spectacular style by smashing in a hat-trick on his very
              first senior appearance. A George Graham-era Arsenal were the victims
              and though he would have to wait a while to become a regular, by the
              summer of 1992 and having made a scoring debut for England against
              France earlier that year, he was the most in-demand player in the
              English game.</p>
              <p>Manchester United had always looked the likeliest
              of destinations until newly-promoted Blackburn, managed by Kenny
              Dalglish and bank-rolled by steel magnate Jack Walker, stepped in to
              pay a record £3.3m fee for him. At Southampton, Shearer's goal record
              (43 in 158 games) had been unremarkable yet he exploded at Rovers,
              scoring two goals in a 3-3 draw at Crystal Palace on the opening day of
              the new league. Rovers then looked headed for glory until Shearer
              suffered a cruciate knee injury against Leeds in December to derail
              their hopes of winning the first Premier League title.</p>

              <p>Season
              1993-94 saw Shearer play a full season and lash in 31 goals as Rovers
              almost reeled in runaway Manchester United to finish second. The next
              season saw him operate in tandem with Chris Sutton in a partnership
              nicknamed "the SAS" by the tabloids. As Blackburn lifted their first
              title since 1914, he was named PFA Player of the Year. Even after
              Dalglish walked away that summer and Rovers set into decline, Shearer
              still grabbed 31 goals in 35 appearances in 1995-96.</p>
              <p>Euro '96
              saw him top-score at the tournament where he became even hotter
              property. Again, Manchester United were favourites to sign him, though
              Shearer, still close to his old boss, is said to have favoured
              Liverpool before Newcastle beat all-comers, including Barcelona and
              Juventus, and paid £15m to return him home.</p>
              <p>Whatever the
              reasons behind his choice, Shearer soon became part of the fabric of
              Tyneside, top-scoring during a troubled 1996-97 in which Kevin Keegan
              walked away from the club to shock Tyneside. Shearer's new boss was
              familiar, Dalglish, but the pair could not repeat their Blackburn
              success. When injury struck again in a pre-season game at Everton in
              July 1997, Newcastle were robbed of their totem for long months of the
              season.</p>
              <p>His early years had been marked by a thrilling
              acceleration, matched by the power to hold off opponents and a venomous
              shot that cracked in many a long-range strike. The knee and ankle
              injuries robbed him of that pace but Shearer, an intelligent player,
              worked on different facets to continue as a top player. He built his
              legs up to tree-trunk proportions and became a far better header of the
              ball, yet there was a troubled mid-period to his career. He was almost
              a different player and it took time for him to get used to his new
              physiology. After Dalglish departed Tyneside, in came Ruud Gullit for
              12 months of quarrels with his leading star. Shearer won the argument
              when Gullit left the striker on the bench in an early-season derby with
              Sunderland and the Wearsiders blew away the Dutchman's team. Gullit
              soon walked away.</p>
              <p>At this point, Shearer bore the demeanour of
              a man out of love with football but the club's next appointment, Bobby
              Robson, restored his passion. When Robson died earlier this month,
              Shearer credited his fellow north-easterner with the saving of his
              career. After Euro 2000 he took the decision to quit the international
              game and concentrate on playing for Newcastle.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Robson
              paired him Craig Bellamy, a player who would do much of the running to
              create space for the older man's still-deadly finishing, and while the
              pair shared no love for each other they were the attacking force behind
              Premier League finishes of 4th, 3rd and 5th before, at the start of
              2004-05, Robson was unforgivably sacked before August had ended.
              Thereafter, he suffered indifferent relations with subsequent bosses
              Graeme Souness and Glenn Roeder before deciding to quit at the end of
              2005-06. He didn't quite make it, as, after scoring and celebrating in
              the usual way at the Stadium of Light, he soon suffered that
              show-stopping knee injury in a collision with Julio Arca.</p>
              <p>Even
              in his dotage, he remained the club's most popular player and his
              loyalty to the area was appreciated. His public persona, guarded and
              cautious, often led to significant proportions of the rest of the
              population not warming to him, yet it is clear that this has masked a
              mischievous sense of humour.</p>
              <p>Whatever feelings on Shearer the
              man are, few could argue about his goalscoring achievements. His
              scoring of 206 goals for Newcastle made him the club's all-time record
              holder. In Premier League terms he is out on his own and will likely
              remain so.</p>
