Mourinho, who left Chelsea in September, said he would be prepared to talk to the Football Association. </strong><br><br>"You will have to speak to the FA to see if they are interested in offering me the job," he told The Sun newspaper. "I cannot say what I think until they say they are interested. Tell the FA to come and get me. We will have to wait and see, but I rule nothing out."<br><br>Mourinho would be a popular choice to replace Steve McClaren at the helm with England because of his hugely impressive record with Chelsea and Porto. He won two Portuguese championships, the Uefa Cup and the Champions League with Porto, before leaving to win two Premier League titles, two League Cups and the FA Cup with the Blues.<br><br>The 44-year-old had been tipped to stay in club management in Europe, having previously suggested that he would only be interested in coaching his native Portugal at international level. FA chief executive Brian Barwick has said that nationality "would not be an issue" when it came to appointing the next England coach.<br><br>England, who have dropped down to the second pot of seeds in qualification for the major tournaments, avoided Portugal in Sunday's draw for the World Cup. Barwick will lead the FA's search for a new coach after they missed out on a place at Euro 2008, alongside the organisation's development director Sir Trevor Brooking.<br><br>The FA has already had to listen to several potential candidates rule themselves out of contention for the position with Aston Villa's Martin O'Neill, West Ham's Alan Curbishley and Newcastle's Sam Allardyce all distancing themselves from speculation.<br><br></div>

Manchester United chief Fergie thinks his former Chelsea rival is the outstanding candidate to succeed Steve McClaren. Mourinho will be the only name Fergie will put forward once the FA consult him.</strong><br><br>Sir Alex told a pal: Â“Jose Mourinho should be the next England manager. "It is the job of club managers to get the most from their players technically. Â“It is the job of the England manager to motivate the players Â— and there is no one better at that than Mourinho. If the FA consult me about it, IÂ’ll give them a shortlist of one Â— and tell them to get Mourinho.Â”<br><br>The FA, desperate to get this appointment right, are ready to consult every Premier League boss about the way forward. Ex-England chief Bobby Robson is also backing Mourinho, who he worked with at Sporting Lisbon, Porto and Barcelona. Robson said: Â“I think Mourinho is a great candidate for England. Â“IÂ’d prefer an English manager. But everything depends on the solutions available and, if thereÂ’s no interesting name from within, Mourinho would be a very good choice.Â”<br></div>

Its what happens after that that will count. I think Capello wouldn't have a problem as well... And unlike McClaren, they are all rather tactically sound. But Mcclaren also had the bad luck of having lots of the first team always injured whenever a international match comes around... Not having the entire first team defence along with the keeper as well as their first choice striker pair against Croatia was also a bit weird... Tough luck thats all...</div>

The Daily Star claims that Mourinho will ask for the same salary that Sven Goran Eriksson was paid to take over from Steve McClaren, who was sacked after the failure to qualify for Euro 2008.</strong><br><br>Mourinho has been coy about his prospects thus far, neither ruling himself in or out of the running. He told Sky Sports News last night that he 'knew nothing' about the job, and had previously told The Sun that the FA would have to 'come and get' him.<br><br>McClaren was paid significantly less than Eriksson, earning in the region of Â£2.5million a year, with the FA seemingly determined never to hand out the sort of astronomical salary that brought such ridicule.<br><br>However, given the failure of the Euro 2008 campaign, The Star claims that the 'cash-rich Soho Square chiefs would be prepared to break the bank for Mourinho'. The FA are set to meet today to discuss the process of appointing the new man, and the Star reports that Brian Barwick will be given more or less sole responsibility for choosing McClaren's successor.<br><br>Martin O'Neill is still reported to be high on the FA's list, despite seeming to rule himself out of the running last week. However, if the FA want Mourinho then they may face competition from Real Madrid and Barcelona, who are both rumoured to be interested.<br></div>

The FA will not be held to ransom and are wary of Mourinho's motives despite sources revealing that they are looking for "world class" coach to take over from Steve McClaren.<br><br>That would appear to rule out Alan Shearer as he has no management experience; Stuart Pearce, who has never led a team in Europe; and Martin O'Neill, as he has not won a trophy on the biggest stage. It suggests that Barwick will have to go foreign as no Englishman fits the bill and Mourinho, along with Italian Fabio Capello and World Cup winners Marcello Lippi and Luiz Felipe Scolari now look to be in the driving seat.<br><br>But Barwick, who has been told by the FA board to canvas senior figures in the football world on their opinions before head hunting his preferred choice and then reporting back to Soho Square, is not due to complete his survey of the great and the good in football until the end of next week.<br><br></div>

Jose Mourinho was the epitome of everything that was wrong with the modern game, that he is arrogant, smug, over-confident and disrespectful. He was booed non-stop and everybody hated him. Chants of 'F*ck off Mourinho' cascaded down from the stands. Opposition fans despised him and told us the reason they hated us was because of him. The press launched hatchet-job after hatchet-job designed to unsettle and disturb him and by the end of his time with us the knives were out in a big way.<br><br>Referees, managers, players and pundits were all united in their dislike for the Portuguese, with an honest few accepting that he was a talented manager, but eventually agreeing with the rest that he was an arrogant pig and that he should not be allowed to get up to the petty mind games and mud-slinging that brings the game into disrepute. Anyone not following Chelsea absolutely hated him. The press greeted Man United's title win with massive glee and cheer not because United had won it but because the hated Mourinho hadn't. In short - he was the walking embodiment of everyone's bitterness and hatred of Chelsea and of people who are the very top of their profession. The people of this fine nation we live in cannot accept success. You just cannot stand him can you? Especially when Jose Mourinho is smarter, better looking, funnier, has women going weak at the knees over him, is already one of the all time great football managers, has won everything going, and is considerably better paid than you. Considerably better paid.<br><br>Fast-forward to the present. Jose has left Chelsea and now he is everyone's favourite, the people's choice no less, for the England job, recently vacated by the haplessly hopeless Steve McLaren. Suddenly everyone forgets all the spittle, bile, abuse, slander, vitriol and mis-reporting. Suddenly everyone forgets that he was the epitome of all that is wrong with football.

Jose Mourinho was the epitome of everything that was wrong with the modern game, that he is arrogant, smug, over-confident and disrespectful. He was booed non-stop and everybody hated him. Chants of 'F*ck off Mourinho' cascaded down from the stands. Opposition fans despised him and told us the reason they hated us was because of him. The press launched hatchet-job after hatchet-job designed to unsettle and disturb him and by the end of his time with us the knives were out in a big way.<br><br>Referees, managers, players and pundits were all united in their dislike for the Portuguese, with an honest few accepting that he was a talented manager, but eventually agreeing with the rest that he was an arrogant pig and that he should not be allowed to get up to the petty mind games and mud-slinging that brings the game into disrepute. Anyone not following Chelsea absolutely hated him. The press greeted Man United's title win with massive glee and cheer not because United had won it but because the hated Mourinho hadn't. In short - he was the walking embodiment of everyone's bitterness and hatred of Chelsea and of people who are the very top of their profession. The people of this fine nation we live in cannot accept success. You just cannot stand him can you? Especially when Jose Mourinho is smarter, better looking, funnier, has women going weak at the knees over him, is already one of the all time great football managers, has won everything going, and is considerably better paid than you. Considerably better paid.<br><br>Fast-forward to the present. Jose has left Chelsea and now he is everyone's favourite, the people's choice no less, for the England job, recently vacated by the haplessly hopeless Steve McLaren. Suddenly everyone forgets all the spittle, bile, abuse, slander, vitriol and mis-reporting. Suddenly everyone forgets that he was the epitome of all that is wrong with football. Suddenly everyone forgets how much they hated him because they want him to be a good manager for England.<br><br>Then you have the Liverpool fans who were certainly the most vocal in their abuse and hatred of Jose, all now desperate to get him in to replace the hopelessly hapless Rafa Benitez.<br><br>The hypocracy of this country never fails to astound me. </div></blockquote>c+p frm where? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
