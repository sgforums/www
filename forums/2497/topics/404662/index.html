              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Tough task: Laurent Blanc inherits a squad 
              scarred by a disastrous World Cup campaign</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The France squad is in such disarray following World 
              Cup humiliation that new boss Laurent Blanc has claimed he feels he is 
              'heading towards suicide or the guillotine'.</p>
              <p>The former 
              Manchester United player and Bordeaux chief was unveiled as the national
               manager after Les Bleus' catastrophic campaign in South Africa under 
              controversial Raymond Domenech.</p>
              <p>Domenech's six-year reign 
              ended with a player strike, the expulsion of striker Nicolas Anelka and a
               group stage exit without a win in this year's World Cup campaign. And 
              Blanc, who feels he has inherited a team at their most spineless, 
              immediately warned that no player is safe from reprisals.</p>
              <p>'What 
              bothers me is that, after the World Cup, a new coach should be able to 
              lean on a hard core of players. This hard core is not even a melon's 
              pip. My task is to find a hard core within this team,' he said.</p>
              <p>'Everyone
               wishes me luck. I get the impression I'm heading toward suicide, or the
               guillotine.'</p>
              <p>The 44-year-old, who has been touted as a 
              possible successor to Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford should he turn 
              around the France team's fortunes, plans to meet players in an effort to
               stamp out misconduct and determine who he can trust in the future.</p>
              <p>'I
               can't act like nothing happened in South Africa, it wouldn't go down 
              well. I followed the events, as you all did, with a lot of sadness,' he 
              said. 'I was outraged by certain behaviour. It's a delicate situation - 
              there are meetings to be had.'</p>

              games in South Africa</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Blanc intends to speak to Patrice Evra, Franck Ribery, Thierry Henry,
               William Gallas and Eric Abidal - reportedly the five main rebels at the
               World Cup - before deciding whether to pick them again. The new boss 
              insists he will select only those 'with the right mentality and team 
              spirit'.</p>
              <p>'There are very few people who can tell you what 
              really happened. I think I know a few of them,' added Blanc.</p>
              <p>'We
               will speak about the future, and about what happened in South Africa. I
               will make my choices, and perhaps among my choices there will be a 
              sporting punishment that means certain players who were present in South
               Africa are not among my choices.' </p>

              <p>Problems in the France camp during the World Cup were revealed by 
              French sports newspaper L'Equipe, which published details of an incident
               in which Anelka swore at Domenech the day after France lost 2-0 to 
              Mexico in their second group match.</p>
              <p>Anelka was sent home, and
               the next day the entire squad sat on the team bus, refusing to train in
               protest over Anelka's punishment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div id="ext-gen1009" class="moduleHalf">
              <div class="sport item">
              <div class="button-style"></div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>'What shocked me the most, what disappointed me the most, was the 
              behaviour of the squad during the public training session, 48 hours 
              before a match,' Blanc said. 'The decision (to strike) was badly thought
               through.'</p>
              <p>France's subsequent 2-1 defeat by South Africa 
              meant they went out for the second consecutive tournament without 
              winning a game, to follow on from a humiliating first-round Euro 2008 
              exit.</p>
              <p>Blanc said his side must now show some humility. 'At a 
              certain point in time our national team could have said "We're going to 
              the European Championship to win it" but I don't think we'll even be in 
              the top 10 FIFA rankings now,' he said.</p>
              <p>'We will need to be a
               bit humble, given that we're in a total rebuilding phase.'</p>
