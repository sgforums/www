              <p>The MK Dons boss said in his column for the <em>News of the World</em>: "Dimitar Berbatov was mentioned in the same breath as Eric Cantona when he moved to Old Trafford at the start of last season.</p>
              <p>"Well, no one can be mentioned in the same breath as Cantona. He was a
              one-off. Unique. In fact, the jury is still out when it comes to
              deciding if Berbatov really is a <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> player . . . full stop.</p>
              <p>"When we won the title in the 1992-93 season, Cantona was our talisman
              - the man who provided the magic. But that was only the half of it. His
              work-rate was phenomenal, his team ethic unquestionable.</p>
              <p>"Can we say the same of Berbatov - a player who cost, don't forget, more than £30million? Not yet, we can't.</p>
              <p>"That is why this is a huge season for him. <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Cristiano Ronaldo</span></abbr> has gone, taking his goals with him. Carlos Tevez has gone, taking his
              tireless enthusiasm with him. Berbatov has to step up to the plate on
              both fronts. Being a supremely talented player is not enough at Old
              Trafford, where standards are sky-high."</p>

              <p>Cantona a Legend la , a disrespect to Cantona leh ....</p>
              <p>No matter what Berbatov achieved at MU , there's no match at all .</p>
              <p>Me Liverpool fan must say Cantona was just a different class above any player on earth .</p>
              <p>Except for his Crystal Palace Kungfu kick ..... which was one i dun want to remember , other than that , Eric Cantona , there's only ONE Cantona .</p>
              <p>Pls la BaBaCock ? who's he ???</p>

              <p>well, I believe we need to class them differently.</p>
              <p>Cantona is legend in his own rights. same as Keano, and others.</p>
              <p>but along them will come greater like Rooney, Ronaldo..even Rio and etc.</p>
              <p>as for kungfu kick, don't forget it. cause from there, we see the greatness of SAF who was able to transform a rebel to a legend. No need to sweep under blanket.</p>
              <p>A true fan encompasses all.</p>
