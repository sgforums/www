              <p><strong>Arsenal have ruled midfielder Tomas Rosicky out of action until March ''at the earliest'' after the Czech star underwent surgery on the problem in Germany a month ago.</strong></p>
              <p>The Czech Republic international has been out with a damaged hamstring tendon since January and has made a slower than expected recovery, after originally being told his injury would be cured in ''two weeks''.</p>
              <p>He is due to report back to Arsenal later this month but manager Arsene Wenger admits it will be some time before the 27-year-old will be ready to play again.</p>
              <p>Wenger told the club's official website: ''He's doing rehab at the moment. ''He's back here on December 17 and then hopefully we can start to work with him. But it's a long-term prospect - maybe March at the earliest.''</p>
              <p>The former Borussia Dortmund playmaker said at the start of the year that he thinks that the busy nature of the Premier League could be a reason for his numerous fitness problems.</p>
              <p>"The [German] Bundesliga has a winter break whereas here in England winter is the time when the games are played in quick succession," he said. "In Germany the players can have a rest and have a winter pre-season, which is a big advantage of course. That is not the case here and the fitness sessions must be included during season training, which is a big difference.''</p>
              <p>Theo Walcott, Abou Diaby, Samir Nasri and Emmanuel Eboue have all suffered from injuries recently, leaving the Gunners with a lack of width, but the squad have been delivered more encouraging news on their other long-term absentee, Eduardo.</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old Croatian international, who has won 22 caps and scored 13 goals for his adopted country, has been out of action since the infamous tackle by Birmingham City defender Martin Taylor on February 23.</p>
              <p>"I believe we might see him for the first time in the Reserves on December 16 against Portsmouth," revealed Wenger. "After that we will just go from there but he looks very good and very sharp in training."</p>
