              <p><strong>NFA Singapore U-15 beat Newcastle United U-15 4-3 in their first 2011 Canon Lion City Cup match with an incredible comeback.</strong><br><br>SINGAPORE, 18 June 2011: In the opening match of the 23rd edition of this glorious youth tournament, the NFA Singapore U-15 team <strong>came back from a two goal deficit to make it 4-3 against</strong> the Newcastle United U-15 side at Jalan Besar Stadium.<br><br>A goal in the 4th minute from Newcastle’s James Atkinson gave his side the lead. The goal was a messy affair as a scramble led to Atkinson needing only a tap-in.<br><br>The Magpies’ joy was short lived as the Cubs equalized in the 13th minute with right winger Zulfadhmi Suzliman pouncing on a rebound from a shot earlier by Azhar Ramli.<br><br>Newcaslte got back into the lead by capitalizing on a defensive error in the 31st minute. Adam Armstrong, who was awarded the man-of –the-match, received a pass in the six-yard box and slotted it home neatly.<br><br>Coming into the second half with a one goal lead, the Magpies set their sights on increasing their lead and duly got it in the 62nd minute through Alex Gilliead.<br><br>The Cubs fought on with a couple of chances hitting the post but they pushed forward and got what they deserved in the 86th minute. Azhar Ramli proded the ball into Newcastle’s net and that was the beginning of a marvellous comeback that got the entire Jalan Besar crowd cheering in unison.<br><br>With five minutes added on the clock, the cubs broke down the Newcastle defence with brilliant passes and set up substitute, Rifqi Yazid to score the equalizer. And just when the crowd thought the home team will walk away with a well-rewarded draw, the boys went for the kill and Faridzuan Fuad slammed home an absolute screamer to give coach Dejan Gulscevic a winning start to the 2011 Canon Lion City Cup.<br><br>Despite the defeat, Newcaslte United U-15 coach, Lian Bramley said that he was pleased with his team and felt that his players had to adjust to the change in climate which caused them to lose out in the last fifteen minutes.<br><br>Singapore NFA U-15 coach, Dejan Gluscevic, was happy with his charges as he spoke to the press after the match.<br><br>He said: “I am not surprised that the boys have put on a great match as that is what they are capable of and this team shows its potential for the future of Singapore football.”<br><br>He also thanked the supporters and the players’ families for their contributions and efforts.”<br><br>Captain Adam Swandi was also quick to accept responsibility as the captain of the team when he added: “We have played in many matches where we conceded goals first and then came back from it. I was disappointed when we conceded but as captain, I knew I had to continue playing my game and guide my team-mates to come back into the game.”<br><br><br>Singapore NFA U-15 Starting Line-up: Heirul Suhanes, Ehvin Sasidharan, Mahathir Azeman, Sadik Said (Raja Ahmad Zaki 69), R Aarvin, Amirul Azmi, Zulfadhmi Suzliman, Muhelmy Suhaimi (Rifqi Yazid 86), Irfan Iezran (Faridzuan Fuad 75), Adam Swandi ©,Azhar Ramli<br><br>Newcastle U-15 Starting Line-up: Sam Bushy, Liam Gibson, Ben Drennan,Benjamin Askins, James Atkinson, Greg Olley (Daniel Barlasser 59), Jordan Storey, Alex Gilliead (Andrew Hall 84), Adam Armstrong, Dean Briggs ©, Callum Roberts (Jack Elliot 64)</p>
