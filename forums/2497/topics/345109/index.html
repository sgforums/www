              <h1>Pérez To Promise Kaká And Wenger For Real Madrid</h1>
              <h2>Florentino Pérez is set to repeat his trick of nine years ago by promising a big-name star in order to woo voters at this summer's presidential elections at Real Madrid, and also promises to land a world class trainer too.</h2>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/1146_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="230"></p>
              <p><em>Pérez introduced the Galácticos policy at Madrid</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div><strong>Kaká will become Real Madrid's new Luis Figo as Florentino Pérez prepares to promise the Spanish club's supporters that the Brazilian will join the club if he is re-elected as president.</strong><br><br>The former supremo has also pledge that Arséne Wenger will be the new coach, according to reports in Spain.</div>
              <p><br>The construction magnate took at the Bernabéu in 2000 after promising to prise Figo from Barcelona and he fulfilled that in a mega-deal that stunned the football world.<br><br>Now Pérez is back three years after standing down and he is ready to sign Kaká in order to regain control. He has reached a secret agreement with Milan supremo Silvio Berlusconi about the player's upcoming move, El Mundo Deportivo state.<br><br>Madrid will not be able to match the incredible financial package that Manchester City were rumoured to have prepared, but the attraction of playing for such an illustrious club has already persuaded the Brazilian.<br><br>Pérez is said to have agreed a deal worth around €80m for Kaká, but that is only part one of his plan to persuade supporters to vote for him at the club's presidential elections in the summer.<br><br>Arsene Wenger is set to be offered the duel role of head coach and general manager in a bid to persuade him to move to the Spanish outfit with the same duties that he currently has at Arsenal.<br><br>It would be a radical move for Madrid with the continental system being done away with and the traditional English style where one man controls everything.<br><br>The report plays on both Kaká's alleged comments about only ever wanting to leave Milan if Madrid came in for him and also Wenger's discomfort at the current situation behind the scenes at the Emirates.<br><br>Pérez introduced the Galácticos policy at Madrid, but sweeping changes in 2003 when 16 players were sold saw divisions and problems ensue and many stated that they were glad when it ended.<br><br>If he were to regain control, then there could be a revolt against a system that saw players picked for the team on their star factor rather than form or fitness.<br><br>Despite that, he did enjoy incredible success with his aggressive approach to signing players as Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo and David Beckham were all cajoled into moving to the club.<em><strong><br></strong></em></p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Perez wants Arsenal pair Wenger, Cesc at Real Madrid.</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>Real Madrid presidential hopeful Florentino Perez is ready to move for Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger.</p>
              <p>A source close to Perez told the <em>Mirror</em>: "Florentino wants to make Wenger both coach and general manager of Real this summer - and will promise it will happen."</p>
              <p>Perez's ambition extends to also signing Gunners skipper Cesc Fabregas and Kaka, from AC Milan.</p>
              <p>The Perez contact added: "With Kaka and Fabregas as players and Wenger
              as coach, Florentino will take Real back to where they should be."</p>
              <p>Wenger has twice before stayed loyal to Arsenal and rejected Perez's overtures.</p>
              <p>But the dual role - which would mean the departure of sporting
              director Predrag Mijatovic - would mean far greater control at Real.</p>
