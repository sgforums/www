            <div class='col-md body'>Arsene Wenger believes calls for a quota of home-produced players will not improve the quality of the game in England, in the wake of a damning Professional Football Association report.<br><br>The Arsenal manager also revealed he had tried to encourage English talent in his side but the players were not up to his high standards.<br><br>WengerÂ’s views of foreigners in the English game are at odds with his attitude about the next England manager, reiterating that an Englishman should succeed Steve McClaren, even claiming that the likes of MiddlesbroughÂ’s Gareth Southgate could do the job.<br><br>The damning PFA document, entitled Meltdown, reveals that in 1992-93 there was 71 per cent of topdivision players who were English. Last season, however, that figure had dropped to 38 per cent.<br><br>The PFA has called on the Premier League to bring in a new rule so that every team has at least three homegrown players Â— but of any nationality Â— on the pitch at any time in order to reverse the trend.<br><br>And Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson joined the debate, calling for the introduction of quotas to stave off the demise of English players from the Premier League.<br><br>Â“Whether it could be applied, or agreed to by all the clubs, I am not so sure,Â” Ferguson said. Â“But there would be nothing wrong with it.Â”<br><br>Wenger, however, remains adamant that such a cap would not work, saying: Â“I was at the centre of an experience (in France) where we had to play three players in the squad who were under 21. You know what these people became? Professional bench players.<br><br>Â“Every week they sat next to the manager, not only did more French players not play but they did not even play in the reserves or practise enough, and in the end we cut the rule and we opened it up completely again because what happens is you produce professional substitutes.Â”<br><br>PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor claimed the report revealed a crisis in the game.<br><br>Â“It is a crisis . . . we commissioned this report before England had failed to qualify for Euro 2008 because we could see which way the wind was blowing,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“Arsene Wenger is a manager you cannot help but admire and it is not his job to look after the interests of the England team. We have no issue with him bringing in young players from abroad such as Cesc Fabregas . . . at least in the Arsenal academy there is a level playing field for the young English players.Â”<br><br>Wenger claimed he made a Â“conscious effortÂ” to buy English in 2001, when he spent a combined Â£14 million on Everton striker Francis Jeffers and Ipswich goalkeeper Richard Wright. Jeffers is now at Sheffield Wednesday and Wright at West Ham.<br><br>Â“Yes, it was a conscious effort,Â” he said. Â“But when a guy sits in the stands at Arsenal and sees a fantastic cross and a volley, he doesnÂ’t think Eboue, where does he come fromÂ’. He either enjoys it or he doesnÂ’t enjoy it. And that at Arsenal has done a lot for the popularity of the game all over the world.Â”<br><br></div>

In years to come winning UCL is possible, the way Arsenal is managed is way better then any club not only talking about on the pitch.<br><br>U must have hard time at work, u compare yrself to a player in Europe top club...wat a joke.<br><br>The players under Wenger train r still better and look at Henry now, can he be at his best now.
