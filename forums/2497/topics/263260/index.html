            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/sp1_24_header.jpg"><br><br><strong>ARSENE WENGER is lining up a sensational Â£11million swoop to take Nicolas Anelka back to Arsenal. And the Gunners boss wants Ajax stars Klaas Jan Huntelaar and Ryan Babel as back-up if he fails to land the Frenchman. Emirates skipper Thierry Henry is set to join Barcelona for Â£16m tomorrow after a medical and Wenger's top target to replace him is Bolton's former Gunner Anelka. </strong><br><br>A source close to the Arsenal boss said: "Arsene reluctantly allowed Thierry to go. It is sad for everyone concerned but Thierry made it clear that this is what he wants to do. And Arsene definitely believes Anelka is the ideal replacement. "If he doesn't get Anelka then he will go for Jan Huntelaar Â— and Babel is also a possibility."<br><br>Wenger has maintained a close link with Anelka, 28, despite the striker's acrimonious departure from Arsenal when he joined Real Madrid in a Â£22million deal in 1999. And we understand he's already held preliminary talks with Anelka's people to sound him out about a move to the Emirates. Anelka, 28, who joined Bolton for Â£8m last year from Fenerbahce, would jump at the chance to work with Wenger again. He bagged 11 goals in 35 Premiership games last season and three of those came against Arsenal.<br><br>The legendary Arsenal boss had discovered Anelka as a 17-year-old prodigy and paid Paris St Germain just Â£500,000 for him in 1997. But the France star left Arsenal just 18 months later to join Madrid the following season Â– after forcing his way out of North London. Barcelona finally snatched Henry Â– as we told you first and exclusively three weeks ago Â– for Â£16m this week. It left Wenger looking for a top-class striker and if his move for Anelka falls through the French boss will go all out to bring Jan Huntelaar and Babel to the Emirates for a combined fee of about Â£25m.<br><br>Jan Huntelaar, 24, has also been targeted by Manchester United as well as Liverpool and Newcastle. The Ajax superstar bagged 37 goals in 48 appearances for the Dutch giants last term and Wenger rates him highly. Babel, 20, has already got 14 caps and four goals for Holland and was the star of their Under-21 side in the European Championships that ended last night (SATURDAY). He's scored 14 goals in 73 appearances for Ajax since making his debut as a 17-year-old prodigy a couple of years back.<br><br></div>

'The club has to service Â£250million of debt from the stadium build, and any budget Arsene has for new players covers their wages as well as fees. With Henry leaving he will have the Â£16million fee and will save about Â£5million a year on wages.' An indication of Arsenal's planning ahead came when they refused to sell striker Nicklas Bendtner to Birmingham, where he played last season on loan, said the source. 'We knew Henry would be leaving and Bendtner is a cheap replacement.'<br></blockquote>there you go.

The Arsenal manager has lined up the Bolton Wanderers forward, who spent almost three seasons at Highbury from 1997 to 1999, as the primary replacement for Thierry Henry.</strong><br><br>Wenger has never criticised Anelka for threatening to go on strike eight years ago unless he was sold. Wenger believed that Anelka, then 20, was naive and the manager was more angry about the behaviour of Lazio and Real Madrid, whom Anelka joined for Â£23 million. Some senior figures on the Arsenal board have voiced their concerns and remain upset at the way that AnelkaÂ’s brothers, Didier and Claude, who were acting as his agents, encouraged him not to honour his Arsenal contract.<br><br>Anelka scored 11 league goals for Bolton last season after joining the club from FenerbahÃ§e for Â£8 million. When he was linked with Manchester United earlier this month, he replied that he would not be able to turn down a move to Old Trafford and wanted to play for a top-four side.<br><br></div>
