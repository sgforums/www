              <p><strong>Liverpool co-owner Tom Hicks claims there is a large number of "interested buyers" in the club he and George Gillett put up for sale last month.</strong></p>
              <p>Having leveraged huge debt on the club - parent company Kop Holdings' were £351million in the red last summer with annual loan repayments of £40million - the Americans decided to end their tumultuous reign at Anfield.</p>
              <p>Liverpool are up for sale with an asking price of between £600million to £800million.</p>
              <p>Those figures have hardly had investors knocking down the door of chairman Martin Broughton, who was appointed to oversee the process.</p>
              <p>However, Hicks, who has suggested it could take between 12 and 18 months to sell the club, still believes there are plenty of candidates to take over.</p>
              <p>"Liverpool has a really big universe of interested buyers," said the Texan.</p>
              <p>"There are a number of wealthy people all over the world, particularly in the Middle East and Asia, who are enormous Liverpool fans."</p>
              <p>The 64-year-old admits he has had enough of owning clubs and sports franchises and is trying now to sell all of his interests.</p>
              <p>His Texas Rangers baseball side filed for bankruptcy on Monday some 13 months after its parent company, HSG Sports Group, defaulted on £360million of debt.</p>
              <p>The Dallas Stars ice hockey franchise is also being sold. Liverpool will be the last of his three main sports investments to be offloaded.</p>
              <p>And Hicks, who has been the target of a sustained and often vitriolic fans' campaign to sell up at Anfield, admits the high-profile nature of ownership had taken its toll.</p>
              <p>"Sports has never been my primary business," Hicks told Bloomberg BusinessWeek.</p>
              <p>"We are systematically selling our sports assets to focus on our core businesses like private equity and real estate.</p>
              <p>"The lack of privacy in sports is something that my family and I aren't willing to undertake any longer.</p>
              <p>"We'll always be big fans but we want our privacy back."</p>
