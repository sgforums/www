              <p><strong>Manchester United are holding talks with Lyon over the possible
              transfer of Karim Benzema to Old Trafford, according to the striker’s
              agent. </strong></p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has made no secret of his
              admiration for the French goal-machine and it would appear the Scot is
              ready to steal a march on the rivals for Benzema’s signature.</p>
              <p>The biggest clubs in Europe are on the trail
              of the 21-year-old, but Benzema’s agent Karim Djaziri claims United
              have made contact with Lyon.</p>
              <p>Djaziri told El Mundo: “I know that Lyon’s
              directors have met with Barca, Real Madrid and Manchester United’s
              representatives and that all those three great clubs are very
              interested in signing him regarding next season.”</p>
              <p>Lyon have resisted offers for Benzema in
              the past, as they have made it clear he is integral to their hopes of
              winning the Champions League, but it remains to be seen how long they
              can retain his services.</p>

              <p><br>Its very much up to each individual isn't it... What even makes you think they can get him for lesser then 32m pounds? Its also very much a "what if" statement isn't it when Lyon's president has already said $46m pounds... And why then its pointless to stick with Teves in the first place? Is Tevez not proven?</p>
              <p>I have also mentioned it won't cost $32m, the deal amount is to include the loan period as well... So probably another $22m... Would Ben cost $22m?</p>
              <p>And if you were to read carefully, I wasn't the one that came out with a top striker couldn't score in 3 years... I only gave that reply specially to your that question... A top striker who scored almost 20 goals in a season cannot score for the next 3 seasons? Well, If you like to put a bet on it I think there will be alot of takes...</p>
              <p>And indeed, Fergie like to have 4 strikers... But aren't you forgetting that Ronaldo is also viewed as a striker by UEFA? He was voted top striker in last season's tournament... And he was also top scorer not jus in EPL but also in the Champions League.</p>
              <p>Lastly, No I am not just trying to insist my point is right, I was only saying at the very worst, striker to striker, both can't score for 3 yrs as you put it... He still bring something to the team at the very least is still useful, Did Shevchenko even brought that with his $30.8m move when he couldn't score? Think about it...</p>

              <p>i think in current financial woes, not many club can afford over 30million for a player. Man utd, real, barca, man city.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>personally dont think man utd need more attacking player. i think man utd need a attacking midfielder to replace scholes. these days, man utd dont score much goals from midfield.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think Deco would be better for man utd is they sign him before chelsea.</p>
