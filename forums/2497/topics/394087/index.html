              <h1 class="storyTitle" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-size: 2.8em;">Injured Ramsey snubs calls from Shawcross</h1>
              <p><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2010/0227/ryanshawcross20100227_275x155.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="155"></p>
              <p><strong>Stoke defender Ryan 
              Shawcross has yet to hear from Aaron 
              Ramsey as he tries to apologise for the tackle which broke the 
              Arsenal midfielder's leg.</strong></p>
              <p>Shawcross, who received a three-match ban for the tackle that will 
              rule Ramsey out until early next season, has telephoned the Wales 
              international on several occasions and left messages. But Ramsey has not
               returned any of his calls as yet.</p>
              <p>The central defender, who was 
              named in the England squad for the first time when England played Egypt 
              two weeks ago, still hopes to speak to Ramsey.</p>
              <p>"I have made 
              efforts, I've left him messages and a text, and nothing has been 
              returned, but that's up to Aaron,'' Shawcross said in the <em>Times</em>. 
              "Will I see him? I might do in the future but it's totally up to Aaron.</p>
              <p>"I
               haven't spoken to him. It's up to him whether he gets back to me. There
               is a lot of emotion going on and he's probably trying to concentrate on
               having his rehab done and that's fair enough.''</p>
              <p>Shawcross insists
               he will not change as a player despite the criticism that has been 
              levelled at him.</p>
              <p>"I was quite surprised how quickly I was back to 
              normal,'' he added. "I knew straight after I was going to be the same 
              player and make tackles. It was an accident and these things happen in 
              football - I'm not going to 
              change the way I play.''</p>

              <p>no disrespect to either, the fact he called. or he could have called wenger to apologies.</p>
              <p>either way, i believe Ryan was not intending to break a leg when he goes into that challenge.</p>
              <p>Anyway, moving on...</p>

              <h1>Ramsey: Ryan wanted to 'take me out'</h1>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/03/article-1255130-087F82E8000005DC-969_468x286.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="286"></p>
              <p class="art-txt-first"><strong>Arsenal star Aaron Ramsey has accepted Ryan 
              Shawcross did not mean to break his leg - but believes the Stoke 
              defender wanted to "take him out".</strong></p>
              <p>The Wales international has now started the long 
              rehabilitation process following the incident during the Premier League 
              game at Britannia Stadium on February 27.</p>
              <p>Much has been made of whether there was any intent from Shawcross
               in the challenge, and the player has since tried to contact Ramsey.</p>
              <p>The 19-year-old Arsenal midfielder appreciates there was no 
              malice involves, but feels Shawcross did have enough time to pull out of
               the tackle.</p>
              <p>Ramsey, speaking to the official matchday programme, said: "I 
              remember everything, but you just have to get on with things, and that 
              is what I am doing at the moment.</p>
              <p>"I don't believe he wanted to break my leg, but I think he wanted
               to go through the ball and me - to take me out and make sure I felt the
               tackle.</p>
              <p>"He was caught out of position a little, but he could definitely 
              have changed his mind before making the tackle, realising that he was 
              not going to get there and so not committing.</p>
              <p>"If I was tackling and saw that there was not a chance of getting
               to the ball cleanly, I would not make the tackle - and I don't think 
              there was a chance of him getting there."</p>
              <p>Ramsey has not yet been in touch with Shawcross.</p>
              <p>"He has left me a voicemail and a text message, but I just want 
              to concentrate on my recovery for now," he said.</p>
              <p>Ramsey is set to take a break in Dubai, and admits he is not a 
              good patient.</p>
              <p>"You don't realise how much you would miss football until you are
               not doing it for a long period of time, the days just become boring, so
               I can't wait to continue with my recovery and get back into action," he
               said.</p>
              <p>Ramsey hopes his Arsenal team-mates - who are now also without 
              injured captain Cesc Fabregas - can go on to win some silverware.</p>
              <p>"What happened was a shock to everyone I think, but they've done 
              unbelievably well to go back and win that game and they've carried on 
              ever since," he said.</p>
              <p>"Hopefully that will continue - obviously I am very disappointed 
              not to be out there on the pitch, but I still feel a part of things and 
              believe I have contributed over the season.</p>
              <p>"I want to win the title as much as my team-mates do and 
              hopefully they can achieve that for all of us."</p>
