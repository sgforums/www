              <p><strong>Roy Keane had little sympathy for the Football Association of Ireland's unsuccessful campaign to have their controversial World Cup play-off against France replayed and said: 'What goes around comes around.'</strong></p>
              <p>The Irish FA and Republic manager Giovanni Trapattoni had made an impassioned plea to FIFA and the French Federation to replay Wednesday's World Cup play-off after Thierry Henry's blatant double handball led to France's extra-time winner.</p>
              <p>The Irish players claimed they were victims of a conspiracy to ensure Europe's leading nations made the final but FIFA today ruled that the result stands.</p>
              <p>Ipswich manager Keane's relationship with the FAI broke down following his walk-out from the Republic of Ireland training camp prior to the 2002 World Cup.  </p>
              <p>And he dismissed their calls for 'the honesty and integrity' of the sport to be protected in the wake of Henry's handball.</p>
              <p>He said: 'I think the supporters deserve better, the manager (Giovanni Trapattoni) deserves better and probably most of the players deserve better, but I'm not sure the FAI deserve better. What goes around comes around.'</p>
              <p>Keane also accused the Irish players of lacking mental strength when it mattered most. He added: 'They were afraid of that next step. Mentally, not strong enough. They can complain all they want but it’s not going to change. France are going to the World Cup and they need to get over it.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Slow motion: Keane insists Henry would never have had the time or the space in the Ireland penalty area if the team had defended properly</em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Talking specifically about France's winner, Keane laid the blame on Ireland's defence rather than Henry, who handled the ball before crossing for William Gallas to head in.</strong></p>
              <p>'I'd focus on why they didn't clear it,' he said. 'I'd be more annoyed with my defenders and my goalkeeper than Thierry Henry. How can you let the ball bounce in your six-yard box? How can you let Thierry Henry get goal-side of you?</p>
              <p>'If the ball goes into the six-yard box, where the hell is my goalkeeper?</p>
              <p>Keane's antipathy towards the FAI stems back to the Pacific island of Saipan seven years ago when he left the team's pre-World Cup training camp, complaining that the facilities were sub-standard.</p>
              <p>'(FAI chief executive) John Delaney is on about honesty and integrity but I wouldn’t take any notice of that man. 'People forget the last time Ireland were in the World Cup in 2002. People seem to forget what was going on.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">'That man’s on about honesty. I was one of the players and he didn’t even have the courtesy to ring me. He got interviewed and all he said was ‘I don’t know where he is. He’s on the island somewhere I think’.</p>
              </div>
              <p>'I’ve been involved with Ireland since I was 15 years of age and that man didn’ t even have the decency to make a phone call. He could have phoned me – of  course he could. He could have tried my hotel room.</p>
              <p>'He didn’t want to listen to my side of the story. I had a disagreement with Mick (McCarthy, then Ireland boss) and he’s the chief executive but he didn’t have the courtesy to speak to  me.</p>
              <p>'Even when I went back playing for Ireland it was the same. He walked past me in a hotel corridor. 'And this man’s on the television talking about the integrity and honesty of  the game, and what football’s all about.'</p>
              <p>'What goes around comes around. I’m a great believer in that.'</p>

              <p><br>Don't u realise he has an agenda when he makes such comment?</p>
              <p>It is obvious he wants the Italian manager out so that he can be Ireland Manager.</p>
              <p>He put the blame on defence and all fault will lies on the manager problem and Giovanni will get the boot.</p>
              <p>He is more evil than Henry handball....</p>

              <p>Keane is still bitter with the Irish FAI and its chief executive after so many years for the way he felt they treated him... Fancy him making such a silly comment cos of his own personal ill feeling towards them... The whole country is in distress and here is one joker rubbing salt into their wounds for his own personal cause... Blaming the defence, mainly <span style="color: #000000;">Paul McShane who was nearest to Henry, is just another of his trade mark behaviour... Cos McShane was one of his Sunderland players that wouldn't play well while he was the Sunderland manager cos of the way he treated them... </span></p>
              <p>Keane have a systematic ill feeling behaviour toward those he feels have treated him badly... Alf Inge Haland, Mick McCarthy, Steve Staunton, Sir Alex, United, some members of the 2002 Irish squad players and of course the FAI and its chief executive as well... He takes things too serious and never forgive others... But he also fail to look at himself as the reason that created the problem in the first place...</p>
              <p>Such a character will never be successful as a top manager... Cos he don't respect his own players and others, and always thinks too highly of himself, so his players will never work as hard as they can for him like what happened at Sunderland... The bitterness in the man is a real pity cos he was once a good player but today, he is just another with poor characteristics thats all...</p>
