              <p>His rejuvenated Chelsea team have stormed back into the race for the Premier League after looking dead and buried not so long ago.</p>
              <p>And victory at home to Spurs tomorrow will leave them three points behind leaders United - and breathing right down Alex Ferguson's neck.</p>
              <p>It was Fergie who famously coined the phrase 'squeaky bum time' but it is Chelsea chief Ancelotti who has started the mind games.</p>
              <p>He said: "When we were losing at home to United last month, we were looking at an 18- point gap at the top.</p>
              <p>"But if we can beat Tottenham we will only be three points behind them and that would be fantastic.</p>
              <p>"That will be good motivation for us because we need to put pressure on United before their game at Arsenal on Sunday. </p>
              <p>"The closer we can get to them, the more pressure we will put on them. United have the experience, tradition and the history to manage that pressure.</p>
              <p>"But we want to keep the Premier League title open until the very last minute. </p>
              <p>"To do that we have to beat Tottenham and then win at Old Trafford next weekend."</p>
              <p>And Ancelotti hopes rivals Arsenal can do him a favour, despite last week's crushing defeat at Bolton which ended the Gunners' own title ambitions.</p>
              <p>He added: "I'm sure Arsenal will do their best to win. They are a good team."</p>
              <p>The Italian also revealed he has been working with Fernando Torres and Didier Drogba in a bid to build a successful strike partnership.</p>
              <p>Torres finally broke his Chelsea duck in Saturday's 3-0 win over West Ham.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti added: "We have worked with them in training. It's too early to decide yet but it won't be a surprise if they start together on Saturday."</p>

              </div>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Harry Redknapp renewed the call for goalline technology to be introduced after Tottenham slipped to a controversial defeat that could end their chances of a securing a lucrative Champions League place.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Neither of Chelsea's goals should have stood, but Redknapp was angry in particular about the 45th-minute equaliser, scored by his nephew Frank Lampard, that was awarded despite never crossing the line after a bad fumble by Spurs goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes.</span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">With FIFA now committed at least to researching the possibility of using technology, though not TV replays, and with the Premier League sources last night reiterating their desire for the world governing body to speed up the process, Redknapp added force to the argument, especially with £30million riding on fourth place. Spurs are now four points behind Manchester City in fifth, having played a game more.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'The linesman's made an honest judgment, but he's guessed,' said Redknapp.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'He had to, because it's impossible to judge. He's had a guess and he's got it wrong. He didn't do it because he wanted Chelsea to win, but we need the technology.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'People say, "But that takes all the fun out of the game". But how's that fun? Getting decisions wrong and giving goals that shouldn't be given?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'It could cost us £30m, but what can we do? He's given a goal. Joe Jordan and Clive Allen were arguing on the touchline but I said that there's no point. It's a goal, he's awarded it.</span></p>
              <p> </p>

The crowd are all shouting, everyone's looking at him, and it's difficult. You know as well as I do how easy it would be to introduce replays. I've seen it in press boxes and the like before, four or five seconds, and you've got one.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Rather than the fourth official hurrying around telling people to get back in the technical area, he could just watch and see what happened. Everybody who understands football wants them introduced. They have to.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'We could make it easier for the officials. It's not his fault , he's not done it on purpose, but because he's right out there on the touchline, looking a long way across to the goal, and he's got to make a decision that's impossible to make. From that distance, it's impossible.'</span></p>

              <p>After the way Chelsea won the EPL title last season (Drogba's offside goal) and should they end up winning it again this season after last night's incident. And who can forget their game against United back in Dec but can conveniently be postponed to Mar to suit their form and also the way they were made to win the match... I tell you, I will give up and stop watching EPL from next season onwards...
