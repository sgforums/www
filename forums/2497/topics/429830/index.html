              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho will 'defend himself to the end' after being handed a five-match ban by UEFA.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The former Chelsea boss has already served a one-match ban and another is suspended, meaning he will miss Madrid's first three European games next season. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Mourinho has also been fined £44,000 by UEFA's control and disciplinary body for his sending-off and comments after the first leg, while Madrid midfielder Pepe has been given a one-game ban, which he served in the second leg, for his red card. </span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Mourinho did not appear before the media on the eve of Madrid's Primera Division clash with Sevilla, with his assistant Aitor Karanka taking his place.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Karanka also undertook media duties before and after this week's semi-final second leg with Barca, where a 1-1 draw saw Madrid tumble out of Europe 3-1 on aggregate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Asked about Mourinho's reaction to his ban, Karanka said: 'When you receive a sanction like that you never receive it well and more so if you don't know the reason for the sanction. The club have already announced they are going to appeal and, on a personal level, Mourinho is going to defend himself and he will fight to the end.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Karanka claimed the club still have not been told the reason for Mourinho's punishment.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'As things stand today, UEFA haven't communicated the reason for the sanctions against the coach,' he said.</span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Barcelona reserve keeper Jose Pinto, who was red-carded after a scuffle at half-time at the Bernabeu, has been given a three-game ban.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">A Real Madrid statement read: 'The UEFA Control and Disciplinary Body has announced to Real Madrid CF its decision to suspend coach Jose Mourinho for five games. The coach has already seen through the suspension of the first of these games. The suspension of the fifth and final game will be pending during the next three years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Real Madrid CF considers this resolution still suffers from the same defects found at the start of the disciplinary case, which made it impossible for our coach to use his right to defend himself, since the exact statements for which the disciplinary case was opened are still unknown. </span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Real Madrid CF will appeal this decision before the UEFA Appeals Body.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Barcelona have also announced they will appeal against the three-match ban handed down to Pinto.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Mourinho was sent off after protesting against Pepe's red card, and in the post-match press conference claimed Barcelona had yet to win a 'clean' Champions League title under Pep Guardiola.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He said then: 'It's clear that against Barcelona you have no chance. </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I don't understand why. I don't know if it's the publicity of UNICEF [the club's shirt sponsor], I don't know if it's the friendship of [Spanish football federation president Angel Maria] Villar at UEFA, where he is vice-president, I don't know if it's because they are very nice, but they have got this power. The rest of us have no chance.</span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>'Guardiola is a fantastic coach, but he has won one Champions League which I would be ashamed to win after the scandal at Stamford Bridge and this year, if he wins it again, it will be after the scandal at the Bernabeu.'</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Mourinho was referring to the Champions League semi-final between Barcelona and Chelsea in 2009, when the London side had four penalty claims turned down.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Portuguese coach has a long disciplinary history with UEFA. He was banned from the touchline for two matches in 2005 for alleging then-Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard had influenced referee Anders Frisk, while earlier this season he was banned for one match after appearing to instruct Real players Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos to be deliberately sent off.</span></p>
