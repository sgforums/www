              <p><strong>Bookmakers William Hill says that punters are queuing up to lay money on the 13/2 chance that Manchester United will draw Liverpool in the Champions League semi-final draw - and also betting that Liverpool will then win the tie 4-1.</strong></p>
              <p>“Whether they want to bet on the coincidence of United and Liverpool being drawn together after their recent Premier League game, or on the conspiracy theory that some way will be found to keep the Premiership clubs together to lessen the chances of one or two of them reaching the Final, is difficult to say, but that's definitely the way punters are thinking, " says Hill’s spokesman Graham Sharpe.</p>
              <p>If Manchester United and Liverpool were drawn to play each other, this would mean that Chelsea and Arsenal would also face a match-up.</p>
              <p>William Hill are offering 28/1 for Liverpool to win beat Man United 4-1 on aggregate if the two sides do meet, and at 9/1 for all four Premier League sides to be drawn together in any combination.</p>
              <p>Hills also offer 16/1 that all four sides avoid each other in the draw, 8/15 that a Premier League side will win the competition and 7/4 that both finalists will be Premier League sides.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">STEVEN GERRARD reckons Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal are quaking in their boots at the prospect of being paired with Liverpool tomorrow. </h2>
              <p class="article">Over the past week the Reds have dished out four-goal drubbings to both Real Madrid and United. Now skipper Gerro reckons the Kop have Europe’s big guns running scared ahead of the Champions League quarter-final draw in Nyon. </p>
              <p class="article">The first half of their 4-0 hiding of Real in particular — the Galacticos’ highest-ever Champions League defeat — sent shockwaves across the entire game. And Gerrard is convinced the one team their rivals will be desperately hoping to avoid in the draw is the Anfield outfit. </p>
              <p class="article">The bookmakers may still only rate them as fourth favourites behind Barca, holders United and Chelsea but the Liverpool skipper believes they could be left with egg on their face come May 27. </p>
              <p class="article">He roared: “If you ask me about a fear factor in the Champions League, I think the other seven are the ones who are going to have concerns about coming up against us, don’t you? The way I look at it is that we’re going to have to play them sooner of later so it doesn’t matter if it’s now, the semi-finals or the final. </p>
              <p class="article">“We’re not running scared of anyone. We’ll take whoever we get and believe that we are going to go through. “If we could hand-pick an opponent then maybe we’d want someone like Villarreal or Porto but, at this stage of the competition, there are no easy games. It may be a cliche but it’s true. </p>
              <p class="article">“Everyone who’s got to this stage has done well and believes in themselves. But we’ve shown — the players, manager and fans — we’re a force to be reckoned with when we pull it all together.” </p>
              <p class="article">Gerrard marked his 100th Euro appearance with a double against Real, leaving him level with Bayern’s Miroslav Klose as joint Champions League leading scorers on seven. Yet it was Liverpool’s first-half display against the Spanish giants which really left the Kop captain purring, regardless of his own personal milestone. </p>
              <p class="article">And he believes the opening 45 minutes, which blew Madrid out of the water as the Spaniards chased a 1-0 first-leg deficit, was the most complete in his Anfield career. </p>
              <p class="article">Gerrard added: “I honestly can’t remember us playing as well as we did in the first half of the Real game. “I don’t just mean in the Champions League or in Europe — I mean in any competition in all of the time I’ve been playing for Liverpool. </p>
              <p class="article">“I don’t think we’ve controlled a game like that from the very first minute, dictated it and bossed it that way before or for so long. “Playing like that, I don’t think there is a side in Europe that could have lived with us. We’ve played well against Arsenal, Juventus, Inter, Chelsea and whoever else, but that first-half performance against Madrid was better than them all. </p>
              <p class="article">“Maybe the results of some of those games were more important, like Milan in Istanbul, but in terms of pure control that was the best by a distance. “People are talking of Real being a bad team but they weren’t saying that the week before. </p>
              <p class="article">“The run of games they’ve been on in La Liga tells us they are a good team. “If they looked poor at Anfield it’s because that is how we made them look. We destroyed them and made them look ordinary and we deserve credit for that rather than looking for other reasons.” </p>
              <p class="article">Things are certainly looking rosier for the Reds than at any stage of the season, with Fernando Torres also hitting peak form after a hamstring-dogged campaign. </p>
              <p class="article">Torres gave United centre back pair Rio Ferdinand and — especially — Nemanja Vidic an absolute nightmare on Saturday to rekindle Anfield dreams of a first Premier League crown. But rattling up eight goals in a week — and leaving two of Europe’s true giants on their knees — also left Gerrard with regrets over what might have been, with the Reds still four points off the summit having played a game more than United. </p>
              <p class="article">He admitted: “There’s got to be a slight disappointment — for me anyway — when I see how well we have played. “If we had played like that every week we’d be five or six points clear at the top of the Premier League. “Real couldn’t live with us playing like that and I don’t think we’d have dropped half the points we have if we played like it — there’s a lesson there for us all.”</p>

              <p class="introcopy"><strong>The question dominating football in Europe at the moment is: Who can stop the English? The Premier League will cast a huge shadow over the Champions League draw today. If Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Porto or Villarreal draw any of England’s gang-of-four it will be like the European Cup Grim Reaper has come to town.</strong><br><br>Barcelona remain joint favourites with Manchester United as the competition reaches the quarter-final stage. But even they sound like they are running scared of the English teams.<br><br>Just listen to what their inspirational skipper Carles Puyol, who hopes to be back from injury for the quarter-finals, had to say about the prospect of coming up against either Manchester United or Liverpool.<br><br>Puyol remembers only too well what it was like to lose 1-0 to United at Old Trafford in last season’s semi-final, following a goalless draw at the Nou Camp. The Spanish legend said: “I want to be the champion and for that reason it will be excellent to avoid Manchester United in the draw. <br><br>“We still remember last year. United were lucky to win the game and it was very painful to be eliminated, but they are still the European champions and English champions so we do not want to face them now.<br><br>“It would be wrong to say that we fear any side in Europe, but at the same time it is logical to respect the power and quality of our rivals and particularly a team like United.<br><br>“Equally we do not really want to face Liverpool because with the manager they have and their Spanish players they know all about teams from La Liga. Their win over Real Madrid was magnificent and unexpected.’’<br><br>It is understandable that any team still left in the draw would want to avoid both United and Liverpool for the way they dismissed Inter Milan and Madrid. But the team most capable of stopping the Premier League charge is Barcelona.<br><br>They are in terrifying form at the moment and one reason for that is Arsenal legend Thierry Henry. The French ace has finally settled into life in Spain after stuttering last season, when Barca fans could not understand why they had not got the player who had been so mesmerising for the Gunners.<br><br>This season he has come alive again, as injury and personal problems have been put behind him. In scoring twice against Lyon in the last round, Henry passed the 20-goal mark for the Spanish league leaders.<br><br>Bearing in mind that both Samuel Eto’o and Lionel Messi passed the milestone weeks ago, you can see why they have perhaps the most feared front line in Europe.<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson has his own  quartet of goal machines to call on, including World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo. But Barca have already scored 28 goals in 10 Champions League games this season, so to say that they are on fire is an understatement.<br><br>While United are aiming for a historic Quintuple, Barca have their own treble of League, Champions League and Spanish Cup to battle for. Puyol added: “We do not feel the pressure of being favourites for the European Cup. We are prepared for whatever challenge comes along. ‘’We know that United can still win a lot of trophies, but so can we. We have our own treble on the agenda and we are convinced we can do it.’’<br><br>Chelsea are desperate to make amends for the pain of losing last year’s final on penalties. As well as that heartbreak in Moscow, their history includes some memorable clashes with Liverpool and their 2004 quarter-final defeat of Arsenal. But it is still Barcelona that Frank Lampard wants to avoid most – because he would love to play them in the final.<br><br>The Chelsea midfielder said: “If we managed to get to the final again I would rather not face an English team. We’ve done that. I would love to play Barca. “At the moment they are the glamour team. To play them on the biggest stage with the quality they have and beat them would be special.”<br><br>Lampard admitted the agony of last year, when John Terry missed the crucial penalty, still burns bright in the Chelsea team. He said: “It has to motivate you. It was an awful journey home after the final last time. I can remember that the plane journey was awful. “We all went our separate ways after that and I know John probably suffered more than most and we all felt for him. <br><br>“He deserved to lift the trophy and he will lift it one day. Let’s hope it can be this year.” Not if Barcelona have anything to say about it.</p>

              <p><strong>Defending European champions Manchester United drew Portuguese title holders FC Porto during Friday's Champions League quarter-final draw at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.</strong> </p>
              <p>The match brings back memories of 2004, when then Porto boss Jose Mourinho charged up the Old Trafford touchline in delight after a 90th-minute Costinha goal took the Portuguese side through at the expense of the English team.</p>
              <p>Liverpool drew Chelsea yet again and means Rafa Benitez's 2005 champions will face last season's beaten finalists for the fourth time in the knock-out stages in five seasons. The duo have also previously met in the group stages of the competition. </p>
              <p>Arsenal will play their first leg away to Villarreal in a repeat of the semi-final of 2006, although the Gunners played the first match at home on that occasion and went through 1-0 on aggregate after success at Highbury. </p>
              <p>Barcelona drew Bayern Munich. </p>
              <p>The quarter-finals will take place on April 7-8, with the return legs the following week. The draw for the semi-finals was also made in Switzerland. </p>
              <p>The winners of Liverpool's match against Chelsea will face the winners of Barcelona's match against Bayern for a place in the final. </p>
              <p>United will take on Arsenal for a place in the Rome showdown - assuming both Premier League teams win their quarter-final ties. </p>
              <p>The first leg of the semis is due to take place on April 28-29, with the return matches going ahead the following week.</p>

              <p><strong>Interesting stats:</strong></p>
              <p>» The side drawn to play the second-leg at home have won the
              previous three Chelsea/Liverpool Champions League clashes - handing the
              Blues the advantage.</p>
              <p>» Porto eliminated Manchester United the last time they met them in the knockout stages.</p>
              <p>» Last season every single quarter-final and semi-final was won by
              the team drawn to play the first leg away. If that happens again we
              will have an Arsenal/Chelsea final</p>
