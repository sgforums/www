              <p>David Beckham will be allowed to move away on loan from the L.A. Galaxy in January - but the club wants him to sort a deal soon.</p>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Beckham is expected to be loaned back to AC Milan to keep his fitness
              levels up and remain in Fabio Capello's squad for South Africa, with the Major
              League Soccer season starting again in March.</p>
              <p>The
              Galaxy have qualified for their first MLS post-season since 2005, but
              they do not want Beckham's attempts to secure a loan move to affect his
              form.</p>
              <p>Tim Leiweke, chief executive of Galaxy's parent company
              AEG, said: ''We have a deep appreciation of what he is doing over here
              with his national
              team,'' he said. ''I wanted him to know that we will support him so we
              are going to lend him
              out.''</p>
              <p>Although Leiweke is happy to loan Beckham to a European club prior to the World
              Cup, he is confident the former Manchester United and Real Madrid star will see
              out his contract with the Galaxy.</p>
              <p>''We
              know he has to be playing in Europe leading up to the World Cup. That
              has been made clear to us, and we are going to support that. He will be
              somewhere come January and we will see him back in July.</p>
              <p>''We have a contract and despite people thinking we're going to sell him, we're
              not. David is going to finish his career with the Galaxy.''</p>
              <p>Galaxy want Beckham's loan deal sorted out soon so he can concentrate on a
              title challenge with his club.</p>
              <p>''We want to get it done, for him and for us, because we have work to do over
              the next few weeks and I don't want any confusion,'' Leiwiceke added. ''It's the same with Landon Donovan, there are a lot of rumours of whether he
              is staying or going. We're going to clear that up in the next two weeks because
              we want the team to be focused.''</p>
              <p>Leiweke is also hoping Beckham can attract other big names to the club.</p>
              <p>''If we don't have a player like David going around telling every other great
              player that we're co-operative and it's a great place to play and 'you really
              should go and do this', if we don't have him as our ambassador then we're never
              going to get other players to take that kind of risk,'' he said. ''That is the battle for us. We can't do this with one guy.''</p>

              <p>I hate beckham. and its nothing to do with his skills.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I remember before he signed the contract with LA Galaxy,he said that he wanted to bring soccer to America. They paid him a super huge pay package. When the world cup got closer, and he did not get called up, he insisted on going to Milan like a spoiled brat. And when their season started, he insisted on staying in Milan and not move back to LA Galaxy.</p>
              <p>Sure they are not as good as Milan, but he signed a contract to be with them, and he should fulfill that contract.</p>
              <p>what happened to bringing soccer to America?</p>

              <p>he did. if he did not, explain why usa football stadium is packed. well, it was never pack for a footballing game untill he came</p>
              <p>but the main reason of moving to europe back is cause of capello.</p>
              <p>he did got called up by england when he is in LA.</p>
              <p>but capello hope he can be playing in top level of football to cont to be in his squad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to Beckham, Country is more important then any club business. </p>

              <p>If it was really that important, he should have done his research and not sign for LA galaxy on a 5 year contract.</p>
              <p>If one of your players, sign for your club, says he wants to change your club but openly go an find other clubs to sign him to increase his chances of playing in the national team, what would you as a fan think?</p>

              <p>if i am a fan of LA i would support his decision and just hope he come back and play for the team after the loan period.</p>
              <p>he did come back didn't he?</p>
              <p>beckham make is CLEAR to the media that he won't leave MLS for milan its only for a loan when mls is off, and had no intention of leaving at all.</p>
              <p>milan wanted to buy beckham out from LA has nothing to do with him. its like, u see a good product you would also want to buy it right?</p>

              <p>He did go back. But he missed many games for LA galaxy (1/2 of their season).</p>
              <p>Because he acted like a spoiled brat, that he refused to go back even when their season started and insisted on staying in Milan.</p>
              <p>Of course, if he went to Milan for loan, then don't miss any games for LA galaxy, not many people will fault him. But he did miss many games in fact. Its not professional to do that.</p>
