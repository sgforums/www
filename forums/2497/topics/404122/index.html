              <p><span>Chelsea Football Club is delighted to announce the 
              signing of Yossi Benayoun from Liverpool.</span></p>
              <p><span>The 30-year-old will link up with his new team-mates at Cobham 
              for the beginning of pre-season on Monday (July 5).</span></p>
              <p><span>'I am very excited to come to a club like Chelsea, it is a big 
              club and I think it is a dream for every player. Hopefully we will be 
              successful,' said the Israeli international, who has signed a three-year
               contract.</span></p>
              <p><span>Manager <a class="contextLink" href="http://www.chelseafc.com/page/TheManagement/0,,10268%7E1553809,00.html">Carlo

               lot of quality in midfield and can play in lots of positions. I like 
              his behaviour on the pitch and he will do a great job for us next 
              season.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Benayoun spent three seasons at Liverpool having first moved to
               the Premier League in 2005 when he joined West Ham from Spanish club 
              Racing Santander.</span></p>
              <p><span>The 5ft 8in midfielder captains his national team, and is 
              comfortable either on the wing or behind the forward line. </span></p>
              <p><span>The first chance to see Benayoun in a Chelsea shirt could come 
              at Crystal Palace on July 17, in our first pre-season friendly of the 
              summer. </span></p>

              <p>Benayoun, who has moved for an undisclosed fee, first moved to the Premier 
                    League in 2005 when he joined West Ham from Racing Santander.</p>
              <p>His excellent form for the Hammers, for whom he played in the 2006 FA Cup 
                    final, saw him secure a move to Anfield in the summer of 2007.</p>
              <p>He made 172 appearances for the Anfield club and scored 37 goals, including 
                    the header that gave the Merseysiders a 1-0 win at the Bernabeu when they 
                    met Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League during the 2008-09 
                    season.</p>
              <p>Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti hopes the addition of Benayoun will help his 
                    side retain the Premier League title and finally secure Champions League 
                    glory.</p>
              <p>The Italian said: "We are happy to have this new player.</p>

              <p><br>You can't try to trim team average age at the expense of quality,right? What is the point if you sign some 20years old player who play like sh*t?   Good young player then will cost a bomb.</p>
              <p>Yossaun for 5.5million, I think is a good deal. He is a quality player. Joe Cole is only 2 year younger than him and quite injury prone. Some 30 years old player can play up to 35-36years old. Ballack has a huge wages( 120,000 per week) and he is getting lots of red card recently.  I think Chelsea is doing a great thing in this deal.</p>
              <p>You want Chelsea to become Arsenal number 2, sign all young kid and get zero trophy???</p>

              <p>No, but Chelsea has themself stated they want to trim the squad's age and bring in young exciting players..</p>
              <p>Its not a good deal because you're letting go 1 player for free, and signing another without resale value. And Ballack is a very good intelligent midfielder, i hardly remember him getting sent off for Chelsea. So im not sure when your recently refers to.</p>
              <p>Chelsea is not Arsenal, Chelsea have way more experienced players so don't even try to compare the 2 teams and their players. But Benayoun is at best a bench player, and a stop gap measure. To be honest, i'll rather they play the likes of Kakuta more.</p>

              <p><br>Hardly remember?? You must have a bad memory.. Against Tottenham. Ballack charged at player recklessly and get himself send off. Watch more of him play, you will know he act more aggressive recently. Maybe he's getting old,lack of speed  and need to play more hard on opponent.</p>
              <p>Chelsea has Essien. So I think that is why Ballack looks surplus to Chelsea requirement. Kakuta still too young and inexperience. They got lots of Young exciting player but lack experience. They need more thing playing in less pressure to gain more exposure.</p>
              <p>I don't why you come in with resell values?  Most important thing in Soccer is winning. If you get an old man who can do the job and helps you to win. Who cares he's old?</p>
              <p>If Inter say they will sell Milito for 10million pound, who cares he got resale value anot, if he bangs in goal like nobody business. You get some shitty youngster who can't bang in goals, even he is 20 years old. He will have no resell value too.</p>
              <p>Soccer becomes a business but you can't divert from yr main aim that is winning which will reap in the most profit.</p>

              <p>Ballack is a smart intelligent player, who commits alot of tactical fouls to stop the other team, look at him play against Arsenal, Barcelona etc. Essien is a player who will easily get more cards then Ballack, and the same will be for Mikel. Im not against Ballack moving, but if he moves due to age concerns, then there should be no more 30 year old player you should be bringing in.</p>
              <p>Why am i concerned? Because the club has stated time and time again they want to be a proper business club instead of having to keep relying on Roman's money, and with Fifa and Uefa clamping down on club finances, why shouldn't i be concerned about resale values, transfer fees etc?</p>
