              <p>Because the Chelsea board seems to be contradicting themselves.</p>
              <p>They're releasing the likes of Ballack, Beletti, Deco etc because they want to reduce the squad's age, then they bring in a 30 yr old player. Doesn't really make any sense does it?</p>
              <p>Then they rather not pay Joe Cole wages, but spend 6.5mil on Benayoun where that transfer fee alone is enough to pay Joe Cole new wage demands + don't forget we still have to pay Benayoun's own wages. In essence, we're paying more for less.</p>

              <p><br>It may seem to be contradicting but if you look at it as a whole team game, it's actually not very much so... Chelsea will lose many experienced players for next season, namely Ballack, Deco, Belletti, Ferreira, Joe Cole and maybe even Carvalho...</p>
              <p>Therefore, they will need to bring in one or maybe even two to keep the team balanced. Youthful players may be great but when it comes to the pressure moments in a long season, it's usually the experienced that matters or shall we say helps... The addition of Benayoun shouldn't be seen as getting in an old player only... There is a lot more to it then just this...</p>
              <p>I feel there are a lot of points being made here by the board with just one action... And one and probably the most important of all could be to show the rest of the squad that they will no longer be held to ransom like in the case of Lampard and Terry...</p>
              <p>I understand Cole has been a good player for them but he wants $90k per week and a 5 yr contract like Terry and Lampard... The guy is quite injury prone too... Imagine if they gave him 5 yrs and with his injury history, he may not be the same player when he reach 30... They will have to continue paying him that same salary for another 3 yrs... There are quite a good number of wingers who are finish when they reach 30 yrs old... Like Duff and Kewell, they were great players in their mid 20s but their end time came early... Joe could very well go the same way like them...</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, Benayoun is a good player to have... And at 30, he still show a great deal in his game. So I believe he could be one of those who could go on till 33...</p>
              <p>So in essence, I belief they are paying a lot lesser and will get much more in the long run. </p>
