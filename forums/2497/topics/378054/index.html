              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Didier Drogba</span></abbr> says he'll always be grateful to his former <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> manager <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Jose Mourinho</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>The Ivorian hitman admits he would have risked breaking his legs
              playing for the Special One but was not happy with one of the
              successors Luiz Felipe Scolari who dropped Drogba - a decision that
              cost the Brazilian his job.</p>
              <p>He said: "Mourinho is somebody very strong tactically but
              mainly from the psychological side. He knows how to get through to the
              players.</p>
              <p>"I remember sometimes I would talk to him and say 'Why are you
              giving me two days off even though we have a match in a few days?' And
              he said that my rest was mostly psychological.</p>
              <p>"That means you can cut yourself off for a couple of days and
              you rest and you're mentally well and you come back fresh. The mental
              side is 90 per cent of football. The players are with him absolutely.
              He gives you everything.</p>
              <p>"He says 'Do what you want, with me you can do what you want.
              But on the pitch you give me everything. You don't betray me. I give
              you everything you want, I give you days off but you must be performing
              on the pitch.'</p>
              <p>"He would come and tell you if you had a bad game that you
              didn't play well but the next match if you played well he'd also come
              to say 'For me you were man of the match.'</p>
              <p>"I loved him because he made me progress as a player. I was ready to break my legs for him.</p>
              <p>"For Scolari also but I didn't have the chance. Football is like that."</p>

              <p>footballers arent judge by their working hours or days..but by the results during that 2hour span in a match..so from a manager's point of view, if working/training lesser will result in a better match output then its justified.</p>
