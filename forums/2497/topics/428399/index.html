              <h1>We can still win it! Ancelotti sounds rallying cry as Chelsea climb into second<br></h1>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">

              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span></span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span></span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span></span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Carlo Ancelotti declared Chelsea could complete a sensational late</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> comeback in the Barclays Premier League title race if Manchester United lose two</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>more matches before the end of the season.</span></strong></span></span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span></span><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">But the Blues boss admitted his own side also needed to win all five of their</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> remaining games to retain their crown.</span></span>  </span>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Chelsea took a small step towards the most improbable of late surges by beating</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> Birmingham 3-1 at Stamford Bridge to leapfrog ailing Arsenal into second place</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> and close to within six points of United.</span></span></span> </p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The leaders are still firm favourites to finish top, but have to play both of</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> their closest challengers in the next three games.</span></span></span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Ancelotti said: 'To win the title we'll need less points than last season.</span></span></span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">'We won it with 86 last season. Now, with 80 points, United can win the title.</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> They need 10 points.'</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">He added: 'In football, I learned that everything can happen in the game right</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> up to the final whistle.</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"You can win the title in the last minute and you can lose the title in the</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>last minute.</span></span></span></p>

              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">'If we thought that one month ago we'd have a little chance to come back to</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> fight for the title, I think that everyone could have said we were crazy.</span></span></span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">'Now we are happy tonight because we've reached second place. We await to see</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> what happens in the next five games.'</span></span></span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">However, Ancelotti refused to look too far ahead, saying: 'Our aim is to try</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> and win every game. After that, we can see our results and our position in the</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> table.</span></span></span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">'Six points at this stage with five games to go will not be easy, but we don't</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> have to think we can or can't do this.'</span></span></span></p>

              <p>Well, I think it's still all to play for... Cos United have a very tough list of games coming up against Arsenal and Chelsea and it comes sandwich in between their CL semi-finals... All that travelling and little rest in between will take its toll.</p>
              <p>So these 2 get a good rest with 1 match a week, they will have to play 4 high level games in 12 days which is a lot to expect and I don't think they can win half of it let alone win all... The only ray of hope they got is that 6 points... They must get at least 4 points from their next 3 league matches to have any real chance... Like I said at the beginning of the season, The team that finished above Chelsea will win the league title... And my belief is still the same...</p>

              <p>i agree with your last sentence fully.  but then again i just dont see arsenal finishing above chelsea.  unless chelsea suddenly hit a bad patch again.</p>

              <br><br></div>
              <div class="clear-left"><strong>PETR CECH has mocked title rivals Arsenal by insisting: You've bottled it again. </strong><strong>The Chelsea keeper said: "They were 3-1 up against Spurs and threw it away. They've had plenty of chances to close the gap on Manchester United but haven't taken them yet." </strong></div>

              <p>The Gunners' 3-3 draw at Spurs on Wednesday was their fifth in six league games and allowed Chelsea to leapfrog them into second place.</p>
              <p>Cech added: "For a long time Arsenal have been a threat. Now let's see how they cope with this situation."</p>
              <p>While the Gunners are stuttering, Chelsea have stormed back into contention with six wins in their last seven top-flight matches.</p>
              <p>Wednesday's 3-1 win over Birmingham saw Carlo Ancelotti's Blues close the gap on leaders United to six points.</p>
              <p>They must travel to Old Trafford next month to play United, who also face a tricky trip to Arsenal.</p>
              <p>Cech added: "You can see how quickly things change. Two weeks ago the situation looked one way. Now it looks another.</p>
              <p>"A few days on and everything looks different. We are back in second spot and we are only six points behind United.</p>
              <p>"We have two games at home - against West Ham and Spurs - which will be massive for us.</p>
              <p>"We have to keep winning to maintain our momentum and keep up the pressure.</p>
              <p>"Arsenal have a difficult game and then United have to play Arsenal so we could make up those six points."</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Chelsea were knocked out of the Champions League by United last week but Cech claims it could prove to be a blessing in disguise. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He added: 'They have to play a semi-final, so let’s see how they cope. We have one competition to focus on which is to our advantage because we can prepare all week and get more rest.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“Everything is close and it is important to score goals. We could end up with the same number of points, so goal difference will play a big part now.'</span></p>
