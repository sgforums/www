The singer decided to trace her roots to find out if she was related to 'White Christmas' legend Nat King Cole, but instead found a connection to English defender Ashley.<br><br>Mariah said: "It's fascinating. My grandmother was a Cole before she married and it turns out she comes from the same area of Alabama as Ashley's ancestors - the Deep South. We are still looking into it to see if we're also related to Nat King Cole. I'm such a huge fan of his. That would be wonderful, and would also explain so much."<br><br>A friend of Ashley's revealed he is thrilled to hear about the connection, and said: "Ashley is chuffed to bits to hear that they're related. He's always been a big fan of Mariah's, and grew up listening to jazz legends like Nat King Cole."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But it turns out Ashley's not the only person affiliated with Chelsea who has celebrity connections...<br><br><strong>John Terry and Winston Churchill</strong> - It's all so clear now. The leadership qualities, the fearlessness. Churchill saw off the Germans and JT has the very same blood running through his Blue veins.<br><br><strong>Arjen Robben and Woody Allen</strong> - Why didn't we see this before? They look like twins! Film-maker Allen is considered a genius in many circles and Robben's talent is undeniable, but their physical frailty and receding hairlines are what really make them inseparable.<br><br><strong>Andriy Shevchenko and Michael Jackson</strong> - Identical skin tone and shy demeanour. The one-time King of European football and former King of Pop have also suffered similar downfalls. I'm talking about their careers, not their bedroom habits!<br><br><strong>Michael Essien and Arnold Swarchenegger</strong> - Don't tell me you didn't guess this one. Come on it's obvious. The pair are virtually indestructible. I'm talking 'Terminator' Arnie, not 'Kindergarten Cop' Arnie.<br><br><strong>Avram Grant and Mr Bean</strong> - Well they both speak like t*ssers and have the same gormless look about them. I don't need DNA. How can they not be related?<br><br><strong>Roman Abramovich and George Bush</strong> - A whole lot of money, power and influence and not a shred of common sense. One makes up words in press conferences, the other gets his best mate with poor credentials to run a top-flight football club.</div>
