              <p>Spanish World Cup winner David Silva arrived for his medical this 
              morning ahead of completing his £24million switch to Manchester
               City.</p>
              <p>The midfielder has agreed a £160,000-a-week deal 
              at Eastlands and will officially be unveiled once he has the green light
               from City's medical team.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Silva will sign a four-year deal to join fellow new boys Yaya Toure 
              and Jerome Boateng - brought in from Barcelona and Hamburg respectively -
               at City.</p>
              <p>On agreeing the move last month, he said: 'I have 
              enjoyed six years at Valencia, they discovered me as a footballer and 
              they will always be a special club for me.</p>
              <p>'The time is right
               for me to seek a new challenge, and I am thrilled about playing in 
              England with Manchester City.</p>

               world and I want to bring success to City and win trophies for them.</p>

              <p>'That is why my advisers have been dealing with 
              City for me so that I can have my attentions only on South Africa and 
              playing well for my national team.'</p>

              <p><strong>David Silva is keen to lead Manchester City into the Champions League for the first time in the club’s history after finalising his £24million move from Valencia yesterday.</strong></p>
              <p>Silva completed his medical at Eastlands after his bit part in Spain’s maiden World Cup success in South Africa.</p>
              <p>‘I am looking forward to starting the season with my new team, I’m excited about it,’ Silva, 24, told City’s website. </p>
              <p>‘And I will be happy if at the end we are in the Champions League or if we win a trophy.</p>
              <p>‘Roberto Mancini and (chief executive) Garry Cook have told me we are building a very good team with some of the best players in the world and we are going to fight for honours.</p>
              <p>‘My first target is to get into the team, and then to fight for the league and the other competitions.’ </p>
              <p>Silva’s five-year deal was enough to prise him away from the club he signed for as a 14-year-old.</p>
              <p>He is City’s third summer signing following the capture of Germany defender Jerome Boateng and Ivory Coast midfielder Yaya Toure.</p>
