              <p class="body "><strong>England's new teenage <span style="color: #000000;">wonderkid Raheem Sterling</span> has been interviewed by detectives in connection with an alleged attack on a woman.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">Liverpool winger Sterling, 17, was quizzed under caution after he went to a police station by prior appointment.</p>
              <p class="body ">The player, who made his England debut against Sweden last week, has not been arrested and police say investigations are continuing into the alleged assault.</p>
              <p class="body ">A force spokeswoman said yesterday: “Merseyside police can confirm that a 17-year-old male from the Woolton area was interviewed under caution following a report of an assault on Friday, November 2.</p>
              <p class="body ">“A 27-year-old woman received slight injuries during the incident in the Liverpool 8 area.</p>
              <p class="body ">"The investigation is ongoing and no formal action has been taken.” </p>
              <p class="body "> </p>
              <p class="body ">It is understood that Sterling was quizzed by police on Merseyside on November 5, three days after the alleged bust-up.</p>
              <p class="body ">Last night Liverpool FC declined to comment on the police interview.</p>
              <p class="body ">Jamaican-born Sterling, who will turn 18 on December 8, is the fifth youngest footballer to represent the senior England team.</p>
              <p class="body ">He joined the academy at QPR when he was 10 but two years ago he was snapped up by the Anfield club and made his debut eight months ago.</p>
              <p class="body ">Sterling’s explosive performances this season earned him the international call-up and <span style="color: #000000;">he is expected to sign a new £30,000-a-week contract with the Reds</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></p>
              <p class="body ">He has a daughter, five-month-old Melody Rose.</p>

              <p><span><strong>Liverpool star Raheem Sterling has been charged with assaulting a woman.<br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The 18-year-old winger was summonsed to Liverpool Youth Court today on a charge of common assault.</span></p>
              <p><span>The Jamaica-born footballer, who lives in Woolton, Liverpool, did not attend the hearing and solicitor Mick Hogan appeared on his behalf.</span></p>
              <p><span>Police said a 27-year-old woman, who is known to the footballer, suffered 'slight' facial injuries during an alleged incident in Toxteth, on November 2.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>During today's short hearing Mr Hogan told the court that Sterling denies the allegation.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>He said the alleged offence took place when the footballer was 17 but, as he turned 18 in December, the matter should be transferred to the adult courts.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Mr Hogan said: 'I do have instructions to the effect that Mr Sterling will be pleading not guilty to this charge. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>'He is aware of today's hearing and the club are very supportive.'<br></span></p>
              <p><span>The move to the adult courts was supported by the prosecution and Chairman of the Bench Brian Upton adjourned the matter to Liverpool Magistrates' Court on February 22.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Sterling made his senior international debut for England last November against Sweden and has earned plaudits for his performances for Liverpool this season.</span></p>
              <p><span>The youngster recently signed a new deal with the Anfield outfit after several months of wrangling. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Speaking to Mail <a id="_GPLITA_1" style="text-decoration: underline;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Savings Sidekick" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/2497/topics/#">Online</a> earlier this month, Sterling said: 'I've become a better all-round person, especially in how I live my life off the pitch these days. And I've learned to be more selective with the people who I trust.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>'The people close to me now are good for me, I've learned from the experiences I had growing up, from the people who weren't there for me. I now listen to my elders at home and at the club. I take on board what these people tell me.'<br><br><br></span></p>
