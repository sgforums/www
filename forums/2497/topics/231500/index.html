But Capello has apparently ruled out any chance of Beckham playing a role for his side in the remaining months of his contract. 'Beckham will train with the team but he won't play,' Capello told a press conference.<br><br>His omission from Real's plans is sure to draw interest from clubs looking for a short-term loan deal, or Galaxy could even look to take him to California in time for the start of the MLS season in April.<br><br>Asked whether Beckham might leave the Bernabeu before the end of his contract, Capello insisted: 'You will have to ask Beckham that question.'<br><br>The former Manchester United midfielder this week signed a five-year deal worth a reported Â£128million with the American side, after finding his first-team opportunities in Spain limited following the arrival of the former AC Milan, Roma and Juventus coach last summer.<br><br>Capello added: 'The decision of the player is to go to Los Angeles, he has always been a great professional, but a player who has such an important contract with another club, we cannot count on him. He is not going to play any more.'<br><br>Meanwhile, AC Milan director Adriano Galliani has revealed that Beckham had been 'very, very close' to signing for his club rather than LA. At a meeting on Wednesday night, Beckham was offered a three-year contract on his current wages, giving him 100 per cent of his image rights (in Spain he has only 50 per cent).<br><br>'Beckham was tempted, his wife was happy to come here, because of their friendship with Armani, Cavalli, Dolce and Gabbana, but finally on Thursday morning he said that the American offer was too big to refuse,' said Galliani. Soccer prevailed over football. And football, represented by Real Madrid, got angry - and booted Beckham out of Europe.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>David Beckham is bemused by Real Madrid coach Fabio Capello's decision to exclude him from the team until he leaves for Los Angeles Galaxy at the end of the season. "As far as David is aware he has a contract for the remainder of the season and he remains dedicated to the club and the supporters," Beckham's spokesman Simon Oliveira told Reuters on Saturday.<br><br>"David is surprised at the quotes from Capello as no one from the club has informed him of this intention. He will continue to give his full commitment in a professional manner to the club." At a news conference earlier in the day, Capello said: "Beckham will train with the team but he won't play.<br><br>"He has always been a great professional but if a player has such an important contract with another club you cannot count on him. You can't have the same enthusiasm when your mind is on other things." Capello said the former England captain's decision to stay with Real until June was "his decision, not the club's".<br><br>When asked if the 31-year-old midfielder would go out on loan for the last six months of his contract, Capello replied: "You will have to ask Beckham that question". Beckham decided on Thursday not to extend his contract with Real, agreeing to move to Major League Soccer (MLS) when his deal expires in June.<br></div>
