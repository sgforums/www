              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>"Instead of asking 'we have the best league in the world, how can we make it greater?' they wonder 'how can we make it smaller?' " Wenger said on Friday.</p>
              <p>"The rules they decide are a disaster for this country. Ridiculous. They are all artificial and have nothing to do with top-level sport."</p>
              <p>In his criticisms, Wenger is out of step with the Arsenal board as the club voted – as did the other 19 in the League – unanimously for the rule change when it was agreed upon last year.</p>
              <p>The rationale from the Premier League is that the rules – with 'home-grown' defined as one who has been registered with the Football Association for three years prior to his 21st birthday – will help the England national team and, crucially, the development of young talent.</p>
              <p>However Wenger was dismissive of this argument. "You have as many foreign players in Spain as in England," he said of the world champions. "You can sign players from all over the world in Spain. Why do they still produce players and we do not? It's down to the coaching. You cannot just close your eyes and say: 'Let's kick the good players out' and produce the same quality [in the league].</p>
              <p>"I've been educating players since I was 25 and I know one rule. The first thing you do to develop a player is to put him with another good player. If you are a great player, you want to play with great players.</p>
              <p>"If you are a great musician, you want to play with an orchestra where you have the best musicians. If you offer the guy the chance to play in an orchestra with poor musicians, he will not be happy. You have something here [the Premier League] that the whole world watches. For me, to see that some people are only concerned with putting the quality down is sad."</p>
              <p>Arsenal will comfortably comply with the rules but Wenger insisted they would damage the league.</p>
              <p>"We have a situation where the richest people in the world want to invest in this country and you only think 'how can we keep foreign people out?' " he said.</p>
              <p>"You can't let the richest man from India, say, come here and invest a lot of money and then tell him 'oh no, you can only play with English players'. That does not work."</p>
              <p>A consequence of this, Wenger said, will be players demanding more money because there will be a premium on their qualification.</p>
              <p>He used the example of Stephen Ireland – who is classified as home-grown having been a trainee at Manchester City – and his proposed move to Aston Villa which has stalled over his financial demands.</p>
              <p>"I read that Ireland wants to go only if Man City gives him £2 million," he said. "That's because the new rules transform, even more, the agents into mercenaries. It is absolutely ridiculous and it is paralysing the market.</p>
              <p>"Nobody buys. It is a joke. But they will create more rules like that, the home-grown rule, which is rubbish. It is not linked with quality. Do you really think it will remain the best league in the world? No chance.</p>
              <p>"The Premier League have to decide: are they here to prepare the national team, so let's kick everybody out? or are they here to be the best league in the world?"</p>
              <p>Wenger said that he expected to sign a new three-year deal at Arsenal within a few weeks, with his contract expiring at the end of the season.</p>
              <p>"It will be sorted out very soon," he said. "I have to show as well how much I believe in this team by showing my commitment It is more a question about timing, and all the other ingredients which are in a contract will be easy to sort out."</p>
              <p>Wenger admitted that he had "not made up my mind" yet who will start in goal for Arsenal in Sunday's opening league game, away to Liverpool.</p>
              <p>The manager is in the market for a new goalkeeper and set to move, again, for Fulham's Mark Schwarzer after the Australian handed in a transfer request.</p>

              <p>Chief executive Richard Scudamore has defended the Premier League's new squad<br>rules, accusing Arsene Wenger of being 'emotive' in his criticism.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/14/article-1303019-066E0123000005DC-709_306x423.jpg" alt="Chief Executive of the Premier League Richard Scudamore " width="306" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>On the defensive: Richard Scudamore</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The new regulations, aimed at ensuring young British talent is 
              allowed to thrive, require each club to nominate a squad of 25 players -
               with eight of them homegrown - although there is no limit on the amount
               of under-21s teams can use.</p>
              <p>Arsenal boss Wenger described the rule as 'ridiculous', claiming it was 'artificial and has nothing to do with top-level sport'.</p>
              <p>Scudamore
               had a measure of sympathy with the Frenchman, insisting: 'In some ways I
               agree. For 12 years I argued for an open system.</p>
              <p>'But there is a 
              point at which you have to do something for the greater good. What we're
               trying to do is get young players through. It's not about the top 
              superstars.</p>
              <p>'They can have as many under-21s as they like. 
              It's not restricting the number of players - we're restricting the 
              number of over-21s.</p>
              <p>'What we're trying to do is make the marginal 
              decisions go the other way. If you're about to decide whether to give a 
              young player a contract or buy a foreign player then all of a sudden you
               think maybe we'll err on the side of the young player.</p>
              <p>'I think Arsene, much as I respect him, has got a little bit emotive on this one.'</p>
              <p>Wenger believes the rules could damage the league.</p>
              <p>He
               said: 'Instead of asking "We have the best league in the world, how can
               we make it greater?" they wonder "how can we make it smaller?"</p>

              <p>Wenger,
               who has introduced the likes of Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira and Cesc 
              Fabregas to the Premier League during his 14-year spell with the north 
              London<br>club, continued: 'You have as many foreign players in Spain as in England.</p>
