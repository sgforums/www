It is likely that the fee will be significantly more than the Â£5.5m United want to pay, with Southampton looking for closer to Â£10m, but an agreement is set to be reached whereby the Premiership club make an initial down payment and the remainder is subject to specific clauses.<br><br>Southampton have become resigned to losing Bale after the player, along with his parents, met club officials on Saturday after the home match against Burnley. It is understood those discussions established that Bale, whose contract expires in 18 months, will not consider signing another deal. With Southampton concerned that the player could leave for a lower fee in the summer and United's interest intensifying, Bale's departure is now regarded as a formality.<br><br>It is almost certain that Bale will return to Southampton on loan for the remainder of the season. George Burley, Southampton's manager, and Bale are keen that he has the opportunity to help the club win promotion back to the Premiership rather than be a squad player at United for the final four months of the campaign. Should Bale join United before the end of this month he will be prevented from appearing for Southampton until the transfer window closes.<br><br>That scenario is unlikely to prove problematic, however, with the defender expected to move to Old Trafford shortly before the end of January. Tottenham, desperate to recruit a left-sided player, have also been tracking Bale but the player has all but made up his mind that he will join Sir Alex Ferguson's side. The pull of United, together with Ryan Giggs's presence - a player Bale knows well from international duty with Wales - means there is effectively no decision to make.<br><br>Spurs had an Â£8m bid rejected last week, with Southampton confident that United's pursuit of the player would drive up the price. Having agreed a deal with Arsenal this time last year for Theo Walcott that could potentially be worth Â£12m, Southampton hope to secure a fee for Bale close to that figure. United may well balk at such demands but their desire to purchase a player who is regarded as the most promising left-back in the country should prevent any impasse.<br><br>Southampton have become similarly keen to reach an agreement following Saturday's talks. Should Bale be allowed to run his current contract down to the final 12 months, which would be his position were he still to be at St Mary's in the summer, his value would diminish further and the Championship club would be faced with the prospect of losing their most prized asset for a significantly lower fee.<br><br></div>
