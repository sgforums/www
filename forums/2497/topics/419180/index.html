              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">LIVERPOOL are close to making French midfielder Sylvain Marveaux their first January signing.</h2>
              <p>The Rennes ace, 24, was a guest in the director's box at Anfield last night as the Reds lost 1-0 to Wolves.</p>
              <p>Marveaux is rated at around £1.5million and has been likened to Chelsea star Florent Malouda.</p>
              <p>He can play in any position in midfield but is likely to feature on the wing for Liverpool, who are short of wide men.</p>
              <p>Central midfielder Raul Meireles was forced to play in an unnatural position on the right against Wolves.</p>
              <p>Despite an injury-plagued start to his career, Marveaux has developed into one of the finest talents in France.</p>
              <p>And new Kop director of football strategy Damien Comolli has identified him as a potential signing as he looks to shake-up the Reds' struggling squad.</p>

              <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>'s American owners are set to back under-fire boss Roy Hodgson in the transfer market, starting with the signing of Dutch winger Eljero Elia from Bundesliga side Hamburg.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The 23-year-old wide man has fallen out of favour with his current employers after failing to hit the heights of his debut campaign in Germany following a 2009 move from Steve McClaren's FC Twente.</p>
              <p>His slump in form has led to reports he would make the switch to Wolfsburg, currently managed by McClaren, in a bid rekindle the form that earned him rave reviews in Holland.</p>
              <p>However Hamburg daily newspaper Morgenpost has suggested today that Liverpool have made a bid in the region of £13million for a player who has previously been compared with current Anfield man Ryan Babel.</p>
              <p>With Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard both suffering with injuries over the course of the current campaign, Hodgson's team have struggled for a spark and often appeared one paced.</p>
              <p>Elia would certainly rectify that and it is understood that Liverpool are keen to tie up a deal quickly in a bid to maintain momentum from the last-gasp weekend win over Bolton.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old has, according to German press, already agreed personal terms with Liverpool. Elia has made 10 Bundesliga appearances this season, scoring twice. He was a member of Holland's World Cup squad, coming on as a 71st-minute substitute in the final for Dirk Kuyt.</p>

              <p>Elia reminds me of Balotelli, in terms of looks and temperament. I doubt Hodgson can handle him given the fact that he already criticised Cole and Johnson publicly while under immense pressure.</p>
              <p>And I thought Liverpool is still in need of a strike partner for Torres? Surely Hodgson cant be serious about making Torres-Ngog partnership his preferred choice?!</p>
