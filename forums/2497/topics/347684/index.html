              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has revealed he would
              rather win a third Champions League title this season than any other domestic trophy.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The current English, European and World champions currently have 17
              English league titles, one behind arch-rivals Liverpool's 18, who were
              last crowned champions in 1990.</p>
              <p>However, Ferguson says retaining the Champions League - something no
              team has done since the competition was re-named from the European Cup
              in 1992 - takes presidence over potentially completing a quadruple or
              equalling the number of league crowns won by their north-west
              adversaries.</p>
              <p>United face Jose Mourinho's Serie A leaders Inter Milan over two legs for a place in the last eight of the competition.<br> <br> "Is there a priority? The European Cup," Ferguson told the <em>Daily Star</em>.
              "I think there is an opportunity to draw level with Liverpool's 18
              titles. But when you look at our record in Europe, it should have been
              better.<br> <br> "Nobody has defended the Champions League since the new format, so
              that's a great challenge to us. We're at that time of the season when I
              expect the players to kick on. I've seen it over the years. We've not
              always excelled in the last part of the season and sometimes we've lost
              leagues in the run-in.<br> <br> "But in most cases, the players tend to respond and the present group
              seem to have a gear they can bring out. There is always a challenge and
              more expectations but the players have always made life easier for me.<br> <br> "We are this year fighting on all four points. The challenges never
              stop and that means there will still be a lot of passion and hunger for
              more success."</p>

              <p>I have to tell you honestly that... I think you are the first and only Pool fan that have ever admit or say Gerrard dive that I have come across in here... Well, full marks to you on this...</p>
              <p>In the past, Pool fans have always felt Gerrard is Mr Nice Guy, a good role model, or Mr Clean... But I guess his recent headlines however show he isn't all that... there's something else about him too... The fight in the Pub, injuring a DJ for refusing to play his song... all that problems...</p>
              <p>Recently I think a lot have been made of Gerrard's diving these last few months as Pool are challenging for the title this season, it could increase his tendency to go down easier to win matches... But to be honest, people can forget such things after sometime... But many are more upset not because he dives but rather because they perceive him to be a hypocrite after what he said in his interviews with the Press about other players diving...</p>

              <p>first around here to admit it? lol.<br><br>my friends and i all thought yes, gerrard dive at times, and sometimes, the way he dive is so much worse than ronaldo's.<br><br>so obvious, esp that match against chelsea, where because of diving, he got himself a yellow card.</p>
              <p>that dive is sooooooooooo obvious can? lol.</p>
              <p>for gerrard, mr nice guy, yes.<br>                    mr clean man, NO.</p>
              <p>no way, it's hard to find a clean player these days.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the lawsuit that gerrard is currently facing, is not much of my concern or what so ever.<br>as a fan, the only thing that matters me is his performance on the field.<br>as long as he play well, he leads well, im happy.</p>
              <p>i don wish to hate him like how i hate kuyt.</p>
