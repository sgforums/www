            <div class='col-md body'>Zenden ruled out for a month with a knee injury<br><br>Rafa Benitez was left with the ultimate irony of having Steven Gerrard left as his one fit central midfielder yesterday after Bolo Zenden was ruled out for at least a month with a knee injury<br><br>The Liverpool manager was left surveying a decimated midfield after Zenden joined Momo Sissoko and Xabi Alonso among the absentees with a knee problem that will take between four to six weeks to heal.<br><br>With Sissoko sidelined until the New Year with a damaged shoulder and Alonso targeting the December 9 game with Fulham for his comeback from a bruised hip, Benitez must choose between centre-back Jamie Carragher and untried 19-year-old Danny Guthrie to partner Gerrard against Portsmouth tomorrow, Wigan on Saturday, and Galatasaray in the Champions League next Tuesday.<br><br>Gerrard has made no secret of his desire to take responsibility from the middle but his position has been subject to great debate with Benitez preferring instead to use him in a free role Â— starting from the right of midfield.<br><br>The Spaniard steadfastly refused to be influenced by calls from former players and commentators to switch his captain but now finds himself with little choice.<br><br>For all the talk of Gerrard losing patience with his taskmaster boss, however, there remains a healthy mutual respect that was evident in their latest verbal exchange.<br><br>Benitez has exacting standards yet stressed he was sending out a positive message last week, in telling Gerrard he was Â‘not as close to his true level as he thinksÂ’.<br><br>And Gerrard, 26, says he is ready to take up Benitezs challenge to get even better. He said: The manager knows his football, and if someone of his experience says I can improve, I will take it on board and try and make it happen. I take it as a compliment, really. I did say I can feel myself getting close to my best, but that doesnt mean I am totally happy with how I am playing at the moment. I set myself high standards and try and be the best every time I play. No matter how old or experienced you are, you never stop learning in this game. I remember a quote from Roy Keane when he said he was still learning at 31. You learn from every match, every training session. I think Rafa studies the game so much that he is interested in the small details. Hes always going on at me and the other players to try and improve all the time, but I understand exactly what he means. When my form has not been there, there is no-one more frustrated than me. A lot of people point it out, but there is no-one more critical than myself. I want to get it right.<br><br>Meanwhile, Craig Bellamy is almost certain to miss Liverpools match against Portsmouth because of delays at his court hearing.<br><br>The Wales forward, who has denied an assault charge in Cardiff, is set to spend three more days in Magistrates Court this week. Matters have not been helped by the non-appearance of a witness, which curtailed progress yesterday.<br><br>Bellamy has still not given evidence himself and it is likely the case will continue into Wednesday, making it impossible for the 27-year-old to return to Anfield in time to be involved against Portsmouth.</div>
