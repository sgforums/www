              <h1>Agent: 'No chance' Hiddink will join Chelsea</h1>
              <p>Russia manager Guus Hiddink will never make a return to club management
              despite reports linking him with Chelsea, his agent has revealed.</p>
              <p>Cees van Nieuwenhuizen has responded to suggestions that Roman Abramovich is
              preparing to replace under-fire Stamford Bridge boss Avram Grant with the
              Dutchman, by confirming he is content to end his coaching career in
              international football.</p>
              <p>Van Nieuwenhuizen told BBC Sport: 'There is no chance of Guus going to
              Chelsea. He wants to end his career in international management.</p>
              <p>'He signed a new deal in March that runs up to the 2010 World Cup and always
              honours his contracts.'</p>
              <p>Grant has largely surpassed expectations since taking over from the popular
              Jose Mourinho and two wins in the next week, albeit against Liverpool and
              Manchester United, would see the Blues with one hand on a place in the Champions
              League final and a renewed chance of wresting the Premier League title from the
              Red Devils' grasp.</p>
              <p>That has not stopped questions being raised over his future with the London
              club, with Hiddink, not for the first time, mooted as a possible successor.</p>
              <p>But the 61-year-old's representative Van Nieuwenhuizen was unequivocal in
              distancing him from the club.</p>
              <p>'I don't know where these stories about Guus come from and I want to put an
              end to them once and for all,' he added.</p>
              <p>'It isn't about money for Guus. It's about him having signed a contract and
              wanting to get on with his job with Russia.'</p>

              <p>Grant will get to keep his job lah... And who knows, maybe he will even win the Premier League and Champions League for them some more... If you look at the league table, Chelsea is very close and if they can win that all important match at Stamford Bridge against United, then i belief they could win the premier league title cos United won't get 6 points against teams like West Ham and Wigan away.</p>
              <p>West Ham has usually taken points off united regardless where they play or where they are on the table... and Wigan's form has been very good recently so i don't expect United to get all 6 points especially with the pressure on the match...</p>
