              <p>Chelsea captain Terry thought his England pal was heading for the exit.</p>
              <p>He now believes Rooney's recent outburst will herald a change of policy at Chelsea's biggest rivals. He said: "I think Wayne staying will boost them and make it harder for us.</p>
              <p>"On the back of what has happened United will probably go and spend in January and at the end of the season.</p>
              <p>"The fact that clubs haven't been buying because of what's happened financially in the world has maybe helped Chelsea in the last few years. Wazza staying is massive for them."</p>

              <p>Chelsea skipper John Terry fears United will now have an extra spring in their step.</p>
              <p>He said: “Wayne is the best young player in the world, so this is massive for United. He’ll get his form back and this will be forgotten. ­Whatever he gets, he deserves every penny.”</p>

However, all parties have signed a confidentiality agreement meaning the full details of the contract will never be made public.<br><br>Although break clauses may be new to British football, they are common practice in Spain and are generally related to the total wages the player will earn over the duration of his contract.<br><br>A break clause protects the club against a player who tries to force a cut-price deal. But they also give the player the freedom to move if his valuation is met.</p>
