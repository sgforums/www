            <div class='col-md body'>Mikel claims family death threats made him play<br><br>Mikel John Obi claims threats made against his family forced him to play for Nigeria this week against the wishes of club manager Jose Mourinho.<br><br>The 19-year-old said he was in 'severe pain' following a 75-minute appearance for Chelsea in their 1-0 win at Charlton last weekend, and was advised by Stamford Bridge doctors not play for the Africans on Tuesday.<br><br>However, Mikel went against his club's advice to last the full 90 minutes as Nigeria crashed 4-1 to Ghana at Griffin Park.<br><br>Mourinho was reported to be furious with his participation in the match, and the Premiership champions have complained to FIFA as a result, but the teenager insists he was left with no choice.<br><br>'Nigerian fans were threatening my family back home,' he told The Sun. 'They believe I have started picking the games I play for my country.<br><br>'People are still angry that I didn't play in Lesotho for the 2008 African Championship qualifier in October.<br><br>'Only a few people know what I have been through at home in the past due to this situation. It was just too much for me to handle or control.<br><br>'It's a shame that things turned out this way but only God knows what would have happened to my family if I had stayed away from this game.'<br><br>The controversial midfielder is now most concerned with salvaging an already strained relationship with the Portuguese - who dropped the player earlier this season after questioning his attitude.<br><br>He added: 'Was Jose Mourinho angry with me for playing? Definitely. He was totally disappointed in me but I just hope I can explain things to him and then we'll see what happens.<br><br>'Hopefully he will understand what I have been through and the severe pressure I was put under.<br><br>'There was just too much pressure from the Nigerian football officials and, even though I tried to explain things to them, they refused to hear me out.'</div>
