              <p><strong>Chelsea have posted another enormous loss, despite a successful Double-winning season. The Blues lost £70.9m last season despite winning both the Premier League title and FA Cup.</strong></p>
              <p>Announcing financial results for the 12 months to June 30, 2010, Chelsea said turnover increased by 1.2 percent to £205.8m but that a reduction in the value of its squad was the main reason for the loss.</p>
              <p>Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay highlighted the fact that the club has become cash positive, with a surplus of £3.8m, compared to an outflow of £16.9m for the previous season.</p>
              <p>'The reduction in operating losses and increased sales in 2009-10 shows that we are moving in the right direction, especially when viewed against the difficult macroeconomic environment,' Gourlay said. 'The club is in a strong position to meet the challenges of UEFA 'financial fair play' initiatives, which will be relevant to the financial statements to be released in early 2013.'</p>
              <p>UEFA will ban clubs from its European competitions, including the lucrative Champions League, from 2012 if they go into debt on football-related business.</p>
              <p>'That the club was cash generative in the year when we recorded a historic FAPL and FA Cup double is a great encouragement and demonstrates significant progress as regards our financial results,' chairman Bruce Buck said.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"> In 2009, he converted £340m of interest-free loans into equity to make the club debt-free.</div>
              <div class="thinCenter">Chelsea's chances of retaining its Premier League title have been hit by a dreadful run of results.</div>
              <p>And finances will be hit further if they manage to complete their signing of Liverpool superstar Fernando Torres for £50m.</p>

              <p>out of these Chelsea young players only McEachran who looks promising although I think Sturridge is going to be good as well but the rest I am not very sure. Just my opinion cos I don't really watch Chelsea reserve game...only watched McEachran and Sturridge when they play in the first team..</p>

              <h2>CHELSEA`S WAGE BILL RISES</h2>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Chelsea's annual wage bill has soared to £172.5million - almost £40million more than the next highest payers Manchester City. </strong></p>
              <p>The figure for the year ending June 2010 is revealed in Chelsea's full annual accounts lodged with Companies House today and shows a significant increase on the previous year.</p>
              <p>In 2009, the club spent £165.6million on wages but that sum included pay-offs worth £12.6million to sacked manager Luiz Felipe Scolari and his assistants. Excluding the pay-offs, the rise in wages is £19.5million and represents a 12.7% increase.</p>
              <p>Manchester City's wage bill is £133.3million, Manchester United's £131.7million and Arsenal are fourth with £110million spent annually on salaries according to their most recent accounts.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's wages are 82% of their turnover - more healthy than City's 106% - but way off United's level of 46% and Arsenal's of 49%.</p>
              <p>The figures also confirm that Chelsea reported losses of £70.9million compared to £44.4million the previous year. The club indicated earlier this week that they believe they will halve their losses in the next financial year.</p>
              <p>The latest accounts also reveal that Chelsea will be liable for £3.8million extra in National Insurance contributions if HM Revenue and Customs succeed in their legal case that image rights payments should be taxed as income.</p>
              <p>If that is proved, the players themselves would be liable to pay any tax individually in relation to image rights.</p>
