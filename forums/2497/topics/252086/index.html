Beckham has yet to win a major trophy since joining Madrid in 2003, and this year's league title is his final opportunity to end that barren run before he quits Spain to join Major League Soccer side the Los Angeles Galaxy this summer. </strong><br><br>Beckham is desperate to go out on a high note, and Cicinho is determined to see the Englishman, who is held in high esteem among the Madrid squad, achieve that goal. The Brazilian said: "We have always said that Beckham is a great player, not just me but all of my team-mates. "We all know that is going to leave at the end of the season and we have to make the most of every moment that we have to work with him, because he wants to leave Madrid with a title to celebrate with the fans, and we have to make the most of all the training sessions and win every match so that can do this."<br><br>Beckham, 32 on Wednesday, has been in fine form since returning from a six-week absence due to a knee injury, and helped Madrid beat Valencia and Athletic Bilbao in the last two weekends. Those victories have seen Madrid climb to within two points of leaders Barcelona with only six games remaining in the season.<br><br>However, Beckham is set to miss this weekend's epic showdown with second-placed Sevilla the Bernabeu after picking up a yellow card for apparent time-wasting against Athletic. That was Beckham's 10th booking of the season and means he must now serve a ban - triggered once a player reaches five cautions - unless Madrid can get the decision overturned.<br><br>Cicinho admits it would be a blow to lose Beckham, but is confident Madrid have the strength in depth to be able to cover the former England captain's absence. The full-back said: "There exists the possibility that he can play if the overturn the card, we are hoping to see that happen because that would be good for us. "But we must also be aware that this group has many players who can help Real Madrid. Any player who plays in the game will do well and we can record the win."<br><br>With regards to the incident involving Beckham's yellow card, Cicinho said: "We wanted to play on but Bilbao players were very close to the ball, and we could not. "We asked the referee to move them away, but the referee misunderstood and he showed the card to Beckham. It was not to waste time. If nothing changes then we have to try to play without him."<br><br>Beckham was unable to take a full part in training today, with Madrid confirming in their medical bulletin that he was suffering from a thigh problem and a sore throat, and worked out in the gym and swimming pool.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>David Beckham will be able to play for Real Madrid in this weekend's crunch showdown with Sevilla after the Spanish FA overturned the yellow card he received against Athletic Bilbao. Beckham, 32, was booked in the 74th minute of the 4-1 win over Athletic at San Mames last Sunday for apparent time-wasting while preparing to take a free-kick.</strong><br><br>That was the former England captain's 10th yellow card of the season and meant he was due to serve a ban - triggered every time a player accumulates five cautions - which would have ruled him out of Sunday's match with Sevilla at the Bernabeu.<br><br>However, the Spanish FA's competition committee have quashed the booking following an appeal by Madrid, and now Beckham will be available for selection. Madrid are currently third in the Primera Liga standings, a point behind second-placed Sevilla and two points adrift of leaders Barcelona with six games remaining.<br><br>Beckham was unable to take a full part in training on Wednesday as he was suffering from a thigh problem and sore throat, but the midfielder was back among his team-mates on Thursday. Beckham, who has not won a major trophy since joining Madrid in 2003, is leaving Spain this summer to join Major League Soccer side the Los Angeles Galaxy.<br></div>
