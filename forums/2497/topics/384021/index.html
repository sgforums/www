              <p class="small bold">PAINFUL TRUTH ... Gerrard feels he won't have many more chances to win the Prem</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">STEVEN GERRARD admits he will never feel fulfilled as a footballer unless he wins the Premier League title with his beloved Liverpool. And he says the Reds' dismal showing this season is even harder to stomach because he reckons time is running out.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Anfield outfit are languishing in seventh place and trail leaders Chelsea by 12 points. Gerrard, 29, groaned: "It would mean everything to win the Premier League. It's frustrating not to have it already - I've come close on a couple of occasions. "And it is frustrating to be where we are in the league now because this was meant to be the year where we were going to be right up there all the way through.</p>
              <p class="article">"I've still got many more ambitions and dreams I want to fulfil before I finish playing. "I have been around for 11 years and I am getting towards the 30-years-of-age mark, so I'm running out of time.</p>
              <p class="article">"I want to make the most of the next four or five years. "It is important for us to try and get back up to the top of the table. I will continue to fight for the Premier League title from now until I stop playing.</p>
              <p class="article">"Hopefully, I can add it to my collection because it would round off a fantastic career. It would be extra special if I could do it as captain in the next couple of years. "I am not sure how long I am going to be skipper for, probably another two or three years. And if I don't do it as the captain then, hopefully, I can still lift it as a Liverpool player."</p>
              <p class="article">The England star played his 500th game for the Kop giants in Saturday's goalless draw at Blackburn. Gerro has led Liverpool to glory in the Champions League and FA Cup finals - but the Scousers' first league title since 1990 seems as far away as ever.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: "As captain, the most memorable moments have always got to be when I've lifted trophies - the FA Cup and, obviously, the European Cup. "If I had to pick a best moment, it would be the Champions League win against AC Milan in 2005.</p>
              <p class="article">"When I think back to that night in Istanbul, the hairs on my neck stand up and I still get a tingle through my body - but I want to do it again. "The experience of that night, the emotions we all went through and seeing the boys smiling at the end it, makes it difficult to describe even now. It was so special and I won't stop believing we can do it again.</p>
              <p class="article">"It's a difficult feeling to describe when you win wearing that red shirt, especially being a local boy and a Liverpool fan. "Every time I get on the bus after a victory I feel on top of the world." </p>
              <p class="article">In an interview to mark his landmark 500th appearance, Gerrard told Liverpool's wesbite he did not feel he had already secured his place among Anfield's all-time greats.</p>
              <p class="article">He explained: "I don't think I am a Liverpool legend. "You can only call players legends when they've finished and you look back on their careers and they have been successful or a top player throughout.</p>
              <p class="article">"A lot of people give the legendary status out too early for my liking. "I don't see myself as a legend - I see the likes of Dalglish, Hansen and Rush as legends. They have been there and done it.</p>
              <p class="article">"Hopefully, one day I can look back on what I've achieved and can say I'm a part of the legends at this club. But I certainly wouldn't put myself in that bracket now."</p>

              <p><br>I totally agree with your views on them... I believe they are still a very good outfit cos you don't become 2nd one year and the following year with almost all the same players only minus one Alonso but plus 2 new big money buys, you become bad...</p>
              <p>If people remember how Liverpool played especially in the 2nd half of last season, you will know they still got good players able to do a better job than what or where they currently are...</p>
              <p>My own opinion is, its all down to Rafa. Tactics wrong, players in wrong positions, subs used also not effective... I think they have gone back to the small club mentality again like whatever it is, just don't lose... winning is not as important as not losing...</p>
