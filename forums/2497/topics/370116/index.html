              <p><strong>BEIJING
              - Chinese fans will be able to watch English Premier League matches on
              free-to-air television again from next season in a move welcomed by the
              league's commercial director on Tuesday.</strong></p>
              <p>After years of free-to-air
              broadcasts, the exclusive TV rights until the end of the 2009-10 season
              were awarded to small digital broadcaster Win TV in 2007, resulting in
              millions of Chinese fans being unable to get their weekly fix of
              Premier League action.</p>
              <p>That hampered clubs like
              Manchester United from building on their fanbases in the world's most
              populous country, where the English champions believe they have 71
              million fans.</p>
              <p>Guangdong TV, which broadcasts
              to most of the nation, said last week it had paid Win TV 18 million
              yuan ($2.64 million) to show one Premier League game and a highlights
              package each week for next season.</p>
              <p>"We have many pay TV partners
              in Asia and we have a responsibility to maximise revenue for our clubs
              so that we can continue to attract the best players in the world," the
              league's commercial chief Richard Masters said at the Chinese Football
              Industry Development Forum.</p>
              <p>"That said, we are obviously
              happiest when we can match strong revenue with good viewing figures. We
              want as many people as possible to see Premier Leagues matches.</p>
              <p>"In China, we are very happy
              that our partner WIN TV has reached an agreement so that some matches
              will be seen free-to-air on local stations."</p>
              <p>Masters said that a new approach might be taken for China when the rights for the 2010-11 season and onwards were negotiated.</p>
              <p>"The Premier League is
              considering a strategy for China which has been successful in many
              regions in Africa whereby at least one ... match each week is
              guaranteed free-to-air coverage," he said.</p>
              <p>Manchester United played a
              friendly in Hangzhou on Sunday and Tottenham Hostpur, West Ham United
              and Hull City will be taking on local side Beijing Guoan in the
              biennial Premier League Asia Trophy in the Chinese capital starting on
              Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Asia accounted for more than 40 percent of the league's global audience with nearly one million fans tuning in, Masters said.</p>
