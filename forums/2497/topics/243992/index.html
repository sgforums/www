The England defender has pleaded with critics of the Portuguese winger to stop castigating him for being a diver. Ronaldo's fall under a challenge from Woodgate to win a penalty that clinched Manchester United's semi-final berth on Monday night revived the debate over the United star's tendency to go down under the slightest touch.</strong><br><br>But the on-loan Middlesbrough star offered surprising support despite having more reason to be furious with him than anyone else. And instead of pouring bitterness on his disappointment Woodgate has instead revealed what a stunning talent Ronaldo is to face - and insisted he is NOT a diver.<br><br>The acrimony between Boro and United spilled over when Ronaldo was accused of being a cheat after the penalty was awarded, sparking a clash between United No2 Carlos Queiroz and Boro's backroom staff. But Woodgate, who joined up with England yesterday despite admitting he is a doubt because of knee trouble, admitted: "Ronaldo is a fantastic player. There is a touch of genius in him and he lights up the Premiership.<br><br>"He is a very clever player - one of the best in the world. "The penalty was a decision which went against us but I don't think he dived so you can't blame him. "I don't know whether it was a penalty or not." But United boss Sir Alex Ferguson accused referees of failing to give Ronaldo enough protection.<br><br>He said: "He was fouled nine times in the first game at Middlesbrough. You need a strong referee, and we didn't get one. "But on Monday Mike Dean was strong and offered the players protection. "They wouldn't be talking about the penalty if it was any other player than Ronaldo, Jesus Christ," said Fergie.<br><br>Boro boss Gareth Southgate added: "We have played them three times and conceded three pens and they have all been possibly penalties, but possibly not."</div>
