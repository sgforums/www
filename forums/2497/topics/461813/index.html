              <p><span><strong>Liverpool are confident of finalising a £6million deal for Blackpool’s Tom Ince and will look to add Chelsea’s Daniel Sturridge for a  further £12m.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Arsenal’s reluctance to sell Theo Walcott in January, regardless of his contract negotiations, will delay any possible move from Liverpool until the summer, although the player may yet receive offers from elsewhere with Juventus, Chelsea and Manchester City keen. </span></p>
              <p><span>Ince, 20, left Liverpool for £250,000 compensation in August last year and has 18 months left on his contract. He has attracted attention from other clubs but Liverpool are willing to pay the asking price.  </span></p>
              <p><span>Blackpool, who have signed Bournemouth striker Wes Thomas, 25, until January 1, have allowed another forward, Adda Djeziri, 24, to join Scunthorpe.</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Daniel Sturridge's £12million move to Liverpool has hit a stumbling block due to a wrangle over agents fees.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Liverpool are stamping down on the money they pay agents after recently published figures showed their outlay since 2008-09 has been a staggering £31.3million - only Chelsea (£31.8m) and Manchester City (£39.02m) have paid more in the same period. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Liverpool had hoped that Sturridge - who has been told he can leave Chelsea after being left out of their squad for the Club World Cup - would have been in a position to complete a medical on Wednesday so that his switch from Stamford Bridge would be finalised in time for him to be unveiled on January 1. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>However, the medical never took place as problems emerged in the discussions between Chelsea and Sturridge's advisors over the terms of his departure. </span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span>There have also been some minor issues with Liverpool and Sturridge's advisors. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Though Liverpool remain confident the deal will eventually go through, manager Brendan Rodgers has other alternatives to turn to if discussions with Sturridge break down beyond repair. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Kevin Gamiero - a France international who is currently playing for Paris Saint-Germain - would be a potential target to come in on loan. The 25-year-old has not featured a great deal for PSG. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>There are no such concerns, however, over Tom Ince's impending return from Blackpool. He should officially become a Liverpool player when the transfer window opens.</span></p>

              <p>It seems that he is being cold storaged by Rodgers and seeking for early release to end his misery.</p>
              <p>Now, Ah Rod said that that is all for Jan 2013.</p>

              <p><strong><span>Daniel Sturridge has claimed that Liverpool are the biggest club in the Premier League.</span><br></strong></p>
              <p><span>Despite never lifting the title since the league's formation in 1992, Sturridge insists they are still above the likes of Manchester United, Man City, Chelsea and Arsenal.</span></p>
              <p><span>The England striker joined Liverpool for £12million from Chelsea last week after failing to make his mark at Stamford Bridge. The Reds are his third big club after leaving Man City at an early age.</span></p>
              <p><span>But Sturridge has raised eyebrows by claiming that Liverpool are still No 1 in England.</span></p>
              <p><span>'It is the biggest club I have ever played for. In the Premier League, there is no bigger club than Liverpool,' said Sturridge.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I thank the boss for giving me an opportunity to play for a club like this and I thank God for making it possible. It's amazing for the manager to put such faith in me. The only way I can repay him is by doing a job on the football field.</span></p>
              <p><span>'For him to pay money for me and to have faith in me and show everybody around the world that he is prepared to take a chance on me, I don't think I'll ever be able to repay him for that.</span></p>
              <p><span>'As a young player, when you play for big clubs you can sometimes get caught up in it and you never get another opportunity to play for another big club. So I'm grateful the manager has given me this chance and that he believes in me. I'm just glad to be here.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Sturridge has also revealed that he is desperate to link up with Liverpool hitman Luis Suarez - starting with Sunday's showdown with Manchester United.</span></p>
              <p><span>He added: 'It's going to be a pleasure for me to play with Luis. He shows what a good player he is every time he gets the ball with the way he really gets at defenders.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I'm looking forward to us forming a formidable partnership against the teams we've got coming up soon.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I'd love to start against United but it's down to the manager which team he picks. I'm just here to train hard and whichever team he picks will be the one that is right tactically. If he chooses me then great, if not I'll be looking to come on and make an impact.'</span></p>

              <p><span>In recent weeks, in particular against Fulham and Sunderland, the 32-year-old has excelled and he thinks now people are starting to see the Gerrard of old.</span></p>

              <p>To be very honest, nowadays i don't see many young boys wearing Liverpool shirt anymore as compared to 10 or 15 years back. Instead i see the numbers of more young Chelsea supporters as compare to 5, 10 years ago.</p>
              <p>If this goes on which i think it will, I can't help but believe in ten years time, the numbers of pool fans will dwindle even more while Chelsea's will continue to grow bigger... I have a friend with 2 young sons age about 14 and they are now genuine Chelsea fans. Not those glory hunters kinds who may change when their clubs' fortunes dived.</p>
              <p>I think it takes at least 20 years to build a strong fan base and just like Liverpool did in the 70s and 80s, Chelsea are half-way there now.</p>
              <p>The reality is Pool isn't the fancy of young boys today and not winning the title for 20 odd years doesn't help. The majority of Pool fans today are mostly in their mid 30s or late 40s or beyond... Arsenal's mainly mid 20s to early 40s. City is still very new with not many fans yet. They are maybe 10 years behind Chelsea i think. Only club i see with an age group across from kids to the elderly is United. Of course their success and playing style over the last 20 over years have helped I believe.</p>
