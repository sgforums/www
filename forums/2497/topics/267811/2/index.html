            <div class='col-md body'>lest all of us forget, Chelsea burnt millons of roubles and they are in the red.  Man U spent millions but they are profitable.  If you are making money as a PLC or entity, you can spend - its your revenues and profits anyways.  The whole system exist because you use the profits to buy players and improve your team.<br><br>However, Chelsea's approach is different, banking on Abramovich's millions, they went to the market and bought all the "top" players, nevermind the price and wants instant success.  And don't forget, before Mourinho was appointed manager, Mr Tinkerman failed miserably to land anything and was asked to leave.  So, its a fact that Chelsea bought their success by money.<br><br>Man U's spending this time round, no doubt are great but players are bought to ensure futher &amp; continued success.  And its very clear to SAF that he wants the European crown.  Mind you, Mourinho also wants the Champions League.  You think he doesn't want to spend?  he wants, its just that he has spent so much of Abramovich's money that he cannot spend some more.<br><br>Spending comes with expectations - and its not surprise that Man U, after their hefty outlay, will be expected to win trophies - its called return on investments - its not surprising.  But if you look at the players they are buying, almost of all them are under 25 - he is building for future.  thats not what Chelsea is doing when they buy Shevchenko or Ballack.  Liverpool buys torres and he is only 23.  This time round Chelsea is smarter - they realise they also need to buy young and talented players - thanks to the "show" by Ronaldo last season - hence come Malouda &amp; Alex.  Liverpool buys Babel and Torres, Arsenal for Eduardo.   Totttenham buys Bent and so on.<br><br>Who started this trend? Its Man U with their 12m outlay for certain Ronaldo.  But they did not buy success with Ronaldo, they bought future - and they reaped dividends in the last season.</div>

Its just that recently more emphasis has been placed on youth due to inflation of prices for proven players. As well as those academies that aims to provide their clubs with future talent.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah...splashing money does not equate to winning the trophy.  You can buy the best team in the world but you will win probably most of the time but that does not mean you will win all the trophies.<br><br>Real Madrid has tried for many years and failed until this season, actually they din't win fair and outright - they win simply because of the system that counts for head-to-head results and not goals scored /against.  Whatever it is, they are winners and should be congragulated.  They won after spending millions fo years.  Inter Milan won comfortably but their spending is nowhere near the level of EPL teams.<br><br>Spending on players is one thing, motivating them and gelling them into a lethal team is another.  That calls for a great manager / motivator who can harness the talents.  Thats why ppl like Mourinho and SAF stands out.</div>

The galatico policy isn't like they when out and buy all the star players within a year... It was stretch out to 3, 4 or maybe even 5 years... with 1 (one) star or galatico player you called it arriving each season... We over here may not be too familiar with the Spanish league but Barce the club didn't became famous overnight... They have a long history and a proud heritage... They have accomplish it by winning titles, playing good football and of course also having quality (star) players in their rank over the years... Great names like Gheorghe Hagi, Ronald Koeman, Hristo Stoitchkov, Gary Lineker, LuÃ­s Figo, Rivaldo, RomÃ¡rio, Diego Maradona, Ronaldinho, Samuel Eto'o just to name a few... have wore their famous shirt...<br><br>And if Spurs does win the EPL title, i think many will be proud of them... cos they have done it the hard way... They have build themselves up from small to what they are today just like Pool, Man u and also Arsenal... They didn't need "outside" help to win it. They manage their non-football affairs well which then enable them to channel its funds onto the pitch... If they manage it, I belief they will gain lots of respect from neutral fans cos like most big clubs today, They have done it the old fashion way, the hard way and not by mean of free handouts.</div>

We over here may not be too familiar with the Spanish league but Barce the club didn't became famous overnight... They have a long history and a proud heritage... They have accomplish it by winning titles, playing good football and of course also having quality (star) players in their rank over the years...
