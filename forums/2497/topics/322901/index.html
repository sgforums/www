              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>IAN WRIGHT fears Chelsea face a trophyless season under Phil Scolari. Avram Grant's short reign saw the Blues finish as runners-up in the Carling Cup, the Premier League AND the Champions League last term. But Wright is not convinced Big Phil will do any better than his predecessor.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">The Arsenal legend said: "He's a proven manager in the fact he's won the World Cup. "But I think he did it with a Brazil team that any half-decent manager would have won it with. "Scolari had some very decent players during his time with Portugal and I think they should be very disappointed they didn't do better in their own country at Euro 2004. "They lost to a Greece team they should have beaten so you have to question his tactical ability in that respect.</p>
              <p class="article">"It's going to be a major test for him at Chelsea because of the resources he's got. "He can bring in anyone he likes so in a way it'll be just like managing Brazil. "We'll have to see what he does, how they play and if he can handle the everyday pressure of being at a club like Chelsea.</p>

              <p class="article">"I personally don't think he can handle it and I don't believe he'll be a success here. "He's under pressure from the moment he walks through the door because the last manager got to the Champions League final and the one before won the Premier League twice.</p>
              <p class="article">"With the pressure he's under to try and gel a new team, it's going to be rocky unless he has an unbelievable start. "I wish him well but I just don't know if being at a top English club is the best fit for him."</p>

              <p>u know why? becos big phil is in it for the money...he even admits it.</p>
              <p>btw, i met this gunner legend (i am no arsenal fan, btw) ian wright here in singapore last time when he stop in transit for a few days on his way to bali. all the bros met and chill at pan pac where he stays. the joker dyed his hair blond. he actually gave me a signed autograph of a promo pic on him in an arsenal shirt. he went there without his wife, so you can pretty much guess he had a wild time in bali.</p>

              <p>i must admit, Chelsea is a team for big team players. Imagine playing alongside so many international captains.  but, then again, if you dont succeed, move to another club!<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p><br>Its always easy to say it at the start before things become clear... Weather Scolari will be seen as a success or a failure its still up in the air... But to dismiss Grants work last season as insignificant is totally rubbish... When Grant took over at Chelsea a month into the new season, the club was already way behind United and other clubs... He also got them back into the CL after their poor start with Mourinho in charge... He continue to improve their results even with unprecedented injuries to key players... This alone you have to give the man credit cos Mourinho had a lesser injury problem the season before and it shows he couldn't manage it...</p>
              <p>To say Chelsea's team sprite that push them forward is even more ridiculous... Having team sprite is important but team sprite don't come about if the manager is that bad... Seeing Ballack and Drogba having a go at each other and Terry and Hank Ten... I don't see any team sprite there at all... Its more like every man for himself...</p>
              <p>Its always very convenient to shift the blame onto Grant when things don't go well cos of his qualifications... or should i say lack of it... But he showed the world that he could also take them all the way to the CL final something that all their previous qualified managers couldn't and only losing because of a Terry miss last penalty... IMHO, Chelsea may not even have been in 2nd place had it not been for Grant's amazing chase to the last day cos Arsenal had a record points last season too. In the end, you can say they lost by 2 pts or maybe even could be goal difference... That 2 pts that was lost even before Grant took over...</p>
              <p>As for Scolari, well... I guess only winning the CL will be seen as an improvement from Grant... other than that, i think we have to take it that he didn't improve them much...</p>

              <p>well, i will have to totally disagree with you.  By saying indirectly that Grant picked up what Mourinho did is totally absurd. they are both from a different class.  Grant got the job because surprise surprise he is close to the owner.  We dont call Mourinho the 'Special One' for nothing, and theres surprise surprise no 'title' for Grant (trophy-wise and name-wise)</p>
              <p>Another thing is, it was really team spirit that brought Chelsea so far.  Whatever happened between the players remain off field (or factless rumours), but onfield, they put on a high work ethic (dont you reckon?). And yes there'll be rumours like what happened to Rooney and Ronaldo, but most importantly, professionals forget and get along for the spirit of the game.  Chelsea really went thru a season with a sudden change in management.  Other 'top flight' teams wont know it, coz their managers dont get sacked suddenly (liverpool, maybe). </p>
              <p>i reckon, an improvement from the 'old' chelsea, Scolari will bring in attacking mouth watering football.  Trophies or not, as long its for the good of the game.  And to say that Grant isnt to blame is absurd.  Anyone can be given that role with the line up of players that Chelsea had last season and be in the CL final, 2nd in EPL.</p>

              <p>credit needs to be given to him no doubt but if he is considered as good then i would find no words for some of the manager who managed to survies EPL with shoestring budget.</p>
              <p>but then again if only Chelsea had beaten ManU to the title last season!!!!!! oh and BTW just in case you or any of your buddies start jumping in to proclaim me as a Chelsea fan then please let me put it to you that i'm not and neither am i against ManU in general, just that i only felt abit of hypo in your post</p>

              <p>Grant is good? you gotta be kidding me.. his tactics or lack of is plain for all to see.. he'll start off with a lone striker with a supporting attacking mid then change to 2 strikers and a flat four mid when chips are down, back four doesn't needs change hence was remained unchanged, midfield was almost the same just a bit of rotatation which is a must in a big team like Chelsea, also playing that French striker who is only known to be able to play as a out and out striker as a wide forward or winger also says alot about him as a manager.. and not forgetting that he claims he'll break bone just to get his message across when it was eventually review that it was his assistance that gave the half time team talk on that very day, and talk about players squaring up.. what did he do when that happened? call that a good manager? just that ManU wins the title else i would seriously like to hear what you would have said about him...  </p>

              <p>Ahh... Perhaps you never seen my previous post way before the premiership title was decided... Maybe stell might have seen tho not too sure... Since Grant took over, Chelsea was the 2nd club i hope would win the title if United didn't... Cos realistically, only the big 4 stand a chance.</p>
              <p>Reason being very simple... Before Mourinho came to Chelsea, i like them as a second club just like i like Spurs now... During <span style="color: #000000;">Ruud Gullit</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and </span><span style="color: #000000;">Vialli's days, they were likeable... They brought in many quality foreign star players with their connections...</span></p>
              <p>Only when Mourinho came and the way he behaved made i belief not just me but many others as well to dislike Chelsea maybe even yourself... Honestly, of the big four, if United didn't win it... I would hope Chelsea does cos I perfer them to the other 2 of the big four. Reason very simple... I see them as the lesser of 3 evils... lol. Pool, no way, Arsenal... they are United's traditional rival for the past decade or more...</p>
              <p>Only when looking at Jose's behaviour... even a Pool win was welcome as long as not the Blues... Just like in the 2006/07 season... You cannot belief how many Arsenal and Pool fans hope United would win cos they didn't like Mourinho's Chelsea as well... Even in cyber or in real life, I came across so many non United fans cheering for them... lol... that was amazing... Pool and Gunners fans with United...</p>
              <p>I have to say since Grant took over, he have behave himself very well and have improve the image of Chelsea FC to other fans... During Mourinho's days... it was just crazy, the owner and Board probably knows it and apart from the chelsea fans... the other fans hated them cos of Jose. Grant on the other hand manage it in a more dignified manner therefore they became a more acceptable option to me...</p>
              <p>There you happy? Don't bet your last dollar or you may lose it...</p>

              <p>well.. i might lose my last dollar but i'll lose it happily if that's what really in your heart...</p>
              <p>talk about being supportive of Chelsea before and Spurs now.. how about putting it this way, the reason for the support is that these clubs bring in quality star players, right? then even thou they're still bringing or even bringing even more quality star players you don't like them which you claim its due to Jose? you can't be too serious with this, ain't you? you likes star players coming into EPL then, but when more came in you don't like them!!!!!!! IMHO, it all lies with not Jose but the fact that Jose brought them above ManU for 2 seasons.. you like them cause you thinks they wouldn't be able to take the title from ManU, you hate Arsenal because they're the team thats most capable of winning just about anything from ManU during the past few seasons as for Liverpool??? you hate them because thats the "in" thing to do if you're a ManU fan, just ask yourself how many present ManU fans are around when Liverpool sweep across England and Europe during the 80s? if you didn't seen them win then why hate them when they ain't winning? </p>
              <p>oh and BTW, i kinda remember you terming them as having brought the title!! "brought" in that senses probably means they use lots of money at one go to buy quality star players, right? so for some reason these very quality stars players that makes you like Chelsea are now being hate upon when they took the titile from ManU?</p>
