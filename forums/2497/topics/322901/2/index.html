              <p>oh and just in case i forgot, the reason for the unusual action for ManU, Arsenal &amp; Liverpool fans is not due to their hate for Jose, its more because of the "we all have the same enemy kinda thinking" just like how Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and the rest of the fans hate ManU during the late 90's..</p>
              <p>if you hate something, you'll need to have a focus, just like how ppl hate ManU for their behavior (when deep down there was any much indifferent), hate Chelsea because they brought the title/ Jose for this case.. you guys need someone to hate and will create something outta nowhere just to justified yourself that this hate is logic.. whether it is would probable never be known, as all fans tends to be big in ego when their team or their belief is in question hence i might still lose my last dollar but i think i'll win this engagement...</p>
              <p>Cheers to you!!! </p>

              <p>well.. i might lose my last dollar but i'll lose it happily if that's what really in your heart...</p>
              <p>talk about being supportive of Chelsea before and Spurs now.. how about putting it this way, the reason for the support is that these clubs bring in quality star players, right? then even thou they're still bringing or even bringing even more quality star players you don't like them which you claim its due to Jose? you can't be too serious with this, ain't you? you likes star players coming into EPL then, but when more came in you don't like them!!!!!!! IMHO, it all lies with not Jose but the fact that Jose brought them above ManU for 2 seasons.. you like them cause you thinks they wouldn't be able to take the title from ManU, you hate Arsenal because they're the team thats most capable of winning just about anything from ManU during the past few seasons as for Liverpool??? you hate them because thats the "in" thing to do if you're a ManU fan, just ask yourself how many present ManU fans are around when Liverpool sweep across England and Europe during the 80s? if you didn't seen them win then why hate them when they ain't winning? </p>
              <p>oh and BTW, i kinda remember you terming them as having brought the title!! "brought" in that senses probably means they use lots of money at one go to buy quality star players, right? so for some reason these very quality stars players that makes you like Chelsea are now being hate upon when they took the titile from ManU?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Wow... to use the word hate is a rather strong word... and I wouldn't use it on Liverpool or Arsenal for that matter... Not even the last season Chelsea under Grant. At most, you can say its dislike, just like in the same way all of the other 3 clubs fans dislike United. Only on Mourinho's Chelsea would qualify for it i guess... Reason very simple. The man was a mess... his accusation on referees in epl as well as in Europe, on other team players, even on medical staff is really uncalled for...</p>
              <p>The Chelsea board probably know this, Roman saw his club becoming hated across Europe because of Mourinho's antics and not because he was winning... Jose didn't win anything for Chelsea in Europe, but the way he behaved during those Barcelona matches and Liverpool's... accuse the referee going into barce's team room when he has no prove of it, making up stories that that referee favour Barce until that referee received death threats from crazy fans that he decided to retire from being a top referee altogether. Then there was his thing with Rafa and Wenger... For no reason he branded Wenger a voyeur... This was taking it over the top already... Opposing managers don't always get along too well but it remain in the football community. Jose took it out of it and it got so personal. Then with Rafa, well it was well known that Rafa refused to shake his hands for a long period of time due to his antics...</p>
              <p>Roman wanted not just to win, but to win playing nice football as well as to be loved by fans across the world like what Barce got the last 5 years... But unfortunately, with Mourinho, he knew it was never going to happen because of the way he behaved... A high ranking UEFA official branded Mourinho "An enemy of football" for the way he act and behaved during his time managing Chelsea... Obviously Roman can't be too pleased with such a term placed on his club manager from a neutral high ranking official from UEFA... It degraded his club... Mourinho drag Chelsea's good name through the mud while he was there...</p>
              <p>Ok, i think you are very much mistaken on this area... The <span style="color: #000000;">Gullit</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and </span><span style="color: #000000;">Vialli's days things were done much differently... They brough in players that they knew during their playing days, players that then Chelsea could never attract... It was more like their friendship and reputation that got those foreign players to Chelsea... things were done in a more football passionate way... In Mourinho's time, it was just money... If a player wasn't keen, offer him more money to break his contract... If the club don't want to sell, throw more money till they have no choice but to sell or risk keeping an unhappy player... Tapping up players like A Cole and Rio are proven and they were punished for it... These are more the style of the new chelsea than the one with <span style="color: #000000;">Gullit</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and </span><span style="color: #000000;">Vialli in charged...  Those players came for footballing reasons </span></span><span style="color: #000000;">and not just the money... If you care to check how much those players went to Chelsea, maybe you will get a better picture of it... </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Honestly saying, I don't feel anything great with what Jose did at Chelsea during his time there cause, they were in a different league to Arsenal and United those days... I agree he increased the level of football in the epl or should i say Roman did... Arsenal and United those days were going through a rebuilding process... The Rooneys, the Ronaldos, The Fabregas and the Flamini's, the Hleb's wasn't ready... </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Things are different today... They are much closer cause most of the top 4 are also able to spend with the new tv money coming in... So what Jose achieved then he may not be able to do it again in present day like the 2006/07 season proved. That could be one reason why he opt not to come back into the EPL for now... That why i said people should give Grant credit for what he did cos he manage in a more difficult period. And unless Roman decide to go crazy again and splash another $100 million... It won't be like those days when even before a ball is kick, Their CEO Peter Kenyon could proudly declear it will be a ONE horse race which was very true. So if base on some assumption that with or without Grant, Chelsea will still get the the CL final and last day of the league whatever so with Kenyon saying all those then... Can we also assume that without Mourinho, Chelsea would have won the epl title anyway since it was a ONE horse race?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Oh, am i the only one you seen mentioning that? Come on be honest... You have came across Pool and Gunners fans saying that too haven't you? So you don't need to quote me on it... I wasn't the first one who said it and i doubt i will be the last one too... There are just thousands who said that before me in here or in other forums over the last few years... I just happen to be one of those believers... </span></p>
              <p>And oh yeah, did I mentioned to you that during the 2006/07 season, I came across so many non United fans cheering for them in cyber as well as in real life... There were Pool and Gunners fans among them too... Cos they also dislike Mourinho's Chelsea... And amazingly, United was seen as a lesser of 3 evils to them then...  </p>
              <p>Lastly, i cannot emphasis enough to you that i don't hate any club right now... Hate is a very strong word to use... I am just like most fans who would prefer the club they support to win and the others not too... simple as that. I personally would have prefer United vs Pool in the CL final cos the rivalry was far greater from a United and Pool fans prospective... I don't expect you to understand this as you are not a fan of either clubs as you are a gunner supporter so i can fully understand your dislike for United as they were the only club that stand in your favourite club's way during the 90s... The feeling of beating Pool in the CL final would have been far greater to a United fan... Just Pool's 18 titles is more of a motivating factor to do better than them... let alone together they are the most supported clubs in England and most part of the world. </p>
              <p>Yes, you will definitely lose your last dollar from assuming otherwise again and for this engagement you call it... I would prefer to leave it to others to form their own judgement rather than to assumption too... But I and very glad to exchange views with anyone who has a different opinion from mine and if where possible, come to a middle ground if its sensible...  </p>

              <p><br>My apologies for the long message... cos i don't like to split my post into 3 or 4 postings... I prefer to have it all at one go to make it easier for others... They were in reply to all your other follow up postings that i missed earlier as i belief they deserve a reply. </p>
              <p>Anyway, I have seen you taking a very keen interest in Gunners affairs over time... Maybe I might have got it wrong, my apologies again and if you have no wish to or prefer to be anonymous on which club you are supporting or don't even support any... I will understand, no problem with it. But weather you are or not... It doesn't changed the points of the engagement does it?</p>

              <p>i'm a pool fan. and i kinda like jose's chelsea due to the extra drama it added. i was also hoping chelsea beat united to the title in 07/08 cus i didn't want united anywhere close our record of 18 titles.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i agree with zocross that grant did a good job with chelsea after the 'special one's' era. maybe it was due to ten gate, but credit still goes to the manager. he wasn't playing beautiful football but he knew chelsea dun have the talent to play beautiful football. so he stuck to the tried and tested 4-5-1 that did so well under jose. grant was also able to manage all those egos around him.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I dun like Jose as a person but i respected him for what he had acomplished. every good manager knows how to divert attention from his players, SAF restricted access for his players before big matches, AW backed his players with that "i didn't what happened" while Jose push pressure on to others and make the media lost their  interests in his players</span></p>
              <p>Roman wanted not just to win, but to win playing nice football as well as to be loved by fans across the world like what Barce got the last 5 years...

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">playing attractive football and winning is just about every manager's dream but there are bound to have some who are just not capable of it, probably due to the players they had or their focus on defences 1st, just like what Italians national team always did or even Graham's Arsenal (1:0 victories are what he care for when winning)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Barca's might have been your most liked team for the past 5 years but you might not have been in Spain during the same period, if you had you'll realised that they do have the fair share of haters just like any other team around the world</span></p>
              <p>Ok, i think you are very much mistaken on this area... The <span style="color: #000000;">Gullit</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and </span><span style="color: #000000;">Vialli's days things were done much differently...

If you care to check how much those players went to Chelsea, maybe you will get a better picture of it...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">even thou Gullit and Vialli managed to attract good players during their time in charged but if you have the time to build a winning team over a long period of time which Roman wasn't interested in, the only way for them is to buy players and buy them at the shortest possible time and when time is a concern then money will be the main moving force. I personnally don't like the way they goes round buying players but the fact is that's the only possible way to getting to where Roman wants in the shortest possible time </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Honestly saying, I don't feel anything great with what Jose did at Chelsea during his time there cause, they were in a different league to Arsenal and United those days...

The Rooneys, the Ronaldos, The Fabregas and the Flamini's, the Hleb's wasn't ready...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ronneys, Ronaldos might not be ready but there is Giggs, Rio, Carrick and the likes around so we can't really says ManU is rebuilding</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Arsenal would be the team who is indeed rebuilding, this i agreed</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">but that shouldn't takes anything away from Chelsea's title, their team might be consist of the best that Roman's money can laid on but having almost 50-60% of newly brought players playing and gel together in a team is never easy </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Things are different today... They are much closer cause most of the top 4 are also able to spend with the new tv money coming in... So what Jose achieved then he may not be able to do it again in present day like the 2006/07 season proved. That could be one reason why he opt not to come back into the EPL for now... That why i said people should give Grant credit for what he did cos he manage in a more difficult period. And unless Roman decide to go crazy again and splash another $100 million... It won't be like those days when even before a ball is kick, Their CEO Peter Kenyon could proudly declear it will be a ONE horse race which was very true. So if base on some assumption that with or without Grant, Chelsea will still get the the CL final and last day of the league whatever so with Kenyon saying all those then... Can we also assume that without Mourinho, Chelsea would have won the epl title anyway since it was a ONE horse race?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">i'm not prepare to go into such assumation, there wouldn't be a prove to what you or me can argue upon so its just personal opinion hence lets just keep it as an opinion.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Oh, am i the only one you seen mentioning that? Come on be honest... You have came across Pool and Gunners fans saying that too haven't you? So you don't need to quote me on it... I wasn't the first one who said it and i doubt i will be the last one too... There are just thousands who said that before me in here or in other forums over the last few years... I just happen to be one of those believers...</span></p>
              <p>And oh yeah, did I mentioned to you that during the 2006/07 season, I came across so many non United fans cheering for them in cyber as well as in real life... There were Pool and Gunners fans among them too... Cos they also dislike Mourinho's Chelsea... And amazingly, United was seen as a lesser of 3 evils to them then...  </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">might have been those you came across but again there is no way to prove it, just like the guy above me, he is a Pool's fan but he liked Jose's Chelsea</span></p>
              <p>Lastly, i cannot emphasis enough to you that i don't hate any club right now... Hate is a very strong word to use... I am just like most fans who would prefer the club they support to win and the others not too... simple as that. I personally would have prefer United vs Pool in the CL final cos the rivalry was far greater from a United and Pool fans prospective... I don't expect you to understand this as you are not a fan of either clubs as you are a gunner supporter so i can fully understand your dislike for United as they were the only club that stand in your favourite club's way during the 90s... The feeling of beating Pool in the CL final would have been far greater to a United fan... Just Pool's 18 titles is more of a motivating factor to do better than them... let alone together they are the most supported clubs in England and most part of the world. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">might have been a case of wrong choice of word, i'll take back my hate word if you think its too strong for you.. i don't disliked ManU, Liverpool nor Chelsea or Arsenal, and no i'm not a Gunners fan</span></p>
              <p>Yes, you will definitely lose your last dollar from assuming otherwise again and for this engagement you call it... I would prefer to leave it to others to form their own judgement rather than to assumption too... But I and very glad to exchange views with anyone who has a different opinion from mine and if where possible, come to a middle ground if its sensible...  </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cheers on this, there is no reason why this can't be a good exchange on views to me every post serves as a point of view from the very person who posted but just that if its being taken as posted that's going to cause misunderstanding.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">can't believe i spend so much time replying to such a long post, i'm happy to be able to give my 2 cents worth but lets keep it short the next round ya? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cheers to you too...</span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Ok, your post is rather confusing, I would have preferred you kept it in one rather than break them up... Anyway, here we go... I do agree with your first paragraph but I still feel he is overrated to be term "Special"... he is good but not special. His style tho good for the team but very bad for the club as a whole. Wenger is probably more special than him... and it doesn't address his antics of getting very personal like the cases i have mentioned and talking about Ronaldo's poor upbringing and stuff like that... It was needless... And when Gerrard decided to stay at Pool and not join his team, he said Pool was a little club when they met in the CL semi... Gerrard in replied said he was disrespectful and "He has made us laugh"</p>
              <p>On your 2nd, well... I don't think its every manager's dream to play attractive football, I think most just want to get the job done in whatever way possible and only a few would risk it. Jose had the squad, Robben, Duff, Joe Cole, Lampard, A Cole, but it was not his style... </p>
              <p>And on Barcelona, i wasn't referring to in Spain... That is more complicated as there may be some political implications in there as Barce is seen as a Catalan side in Spain rather than a Spanish side... They were not my most liked club either, I was only referring to that period of 3, 4 years where there was a general consensus across Europe and the world that they were playing the most attractive football in that continent... Which i also agreed... Its no surprise to see Roman is now interested on a few of their players, coincidently he even fashioned his club colours in some ways similarity to theirs...</p>
              <p>Ok, 3rd paragraph... Exactly what i meant... <span style="color: #000000;">Gullit</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and </span><span style="color: #000000;">Vialli's days... </span>things were done much differently and in a more football passionate way that got respect and support from neutrals.</p>
              <p>4th &amp; 5th paragraph... Yup, The Rooneys, the Ronaldos, The Fabregas, the Flamini's and the Hleb's wasn't ready... You can see very clearly they are the ones holding up their team today... Giggs? a then 32 years old Giggs was only a bit part player even till today at 35... Rio is a defender... Carrick just joint last season... Arsenal even no need to say... That was why Peter Kenyon dare and proudly said "the winner of the title will come from a small bunch of one".</p>
              <p>For a CEO to make such a comment is unusal unless he is very confident of it otherwise he risk losing his much valued judgement and standing in the business community and having eggs on his face.</p>
              <p>6th... there is no need to proved it cos i belief many knows it happened... I personally have came across them in real life and I can also say there were more than one such fan. If you really care to do a back search in this forum alone, maybe you might find a few too... You have to look at it from this point... Chelsea had won 2 EPL Titles in a row, Jose behaviour was getting more and more arrogant... Many wanted to see him fail thats why like you said they found another source for their common goal... Its not because they really wanted United to win, they just wanted Jose to lose...</p>
              <p>That guy also agreed Grant did a good job and deserved credit too... Do you?</p>
              <p>Like i said earlier, Its very convenient to blame Grant cos of his qualifications... Pick on him like... His tactics were bad, judgement poor and so fore... Cos they don't like him... But did anyone blame Mourinho when he made 3 subs at one go early in the second half then one of his player got injured and they ended up having to play with 10 men? Well, double standard?</p>
              <p>7th, yeah ok agree...</p>
              <p>8th, haha... I tried to kept this as short as a can... It has been an interesting exchange for me personally... Just like the last time we had one sometime back too tho i can't recalled what was it about now... But it was still fun and nothing personal i hope. For me, its all just about the different points of view.</p>
              <p>Ok time to go for lunch... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>well like i've said, i don't like Jose as a person but i respected him for what he had accomplished in life.</p>

              <p>Gullit and Vialli's days.. in another words its like you preferred them having star players but losing to your ManU.</p>
              <p>don't really knows which is the year you're referring to but over those period there are players like RVN, Scholes, Saha, Park, Smith and so on.. who all did a good job moving ManU forward, however, i don't know how you classified them as not ready, Ronaldo and Ronney played and scored almost 30-50 goals between for the past 3 season.</p>
              <p>Arsenal's team is young but they're ready if you asked AW.</p>
              <p>Peter Kenyon is a rat who can lies thru his teeth.</p>
              <p>things would be the same again if ManU is to win another title or two, ppl will pick on just about anything to justified themselves, just like how they pick from Ronney, Keano, Rio, to ManU's fans.. they just need to justified themselves and with Chelsea's spending and Jose, they have the perfect reason for it.</p>
              <p>no i don't, Grant is just crap if you ask me, IMHO, he was there just to show Jose that its Roman's money win them the 2 EPL title.</p>
              <p>double standard?  to have you quoting this would have really disappointed me since i always enjoyed exchanging views with you, its their tactics that we're talking about not who can predict who's going to get injuried, predicting the future probably doesn't comes under tactics i guess?</p>

              <p><br>Enough of Jose as you only seem to see the titles he won and seem to condone his antics where no other manager his taken it to such extreme...</p>
              <p>Like i have said earlier, I doubt very much its every manager who wants to play attractive football... Only the very few. There are 20 teams in the EPL and i can say at the very most and being on the plus side, half tried to do so and only half of that actually manage to do well at it. Of course no one play to lose unless they are on the take... But generally, most play just to stay in it. Its very difficult to say if its the players they have or not but i still belief its the manager that choose to go defensive or not... Newcastle under Big Sam wasn't attractive... Keegan took over the same players and change their style of play... Overall, they both did averagely well with different styles... Man City had an attractive squad but under Sven, well... lets just say they weren't going all out for it shall we...</p>
              <p>Barca wasn't just the most attractive team to me, I said there was a general consensus across Europe and the world that they were playing the most attractive football in that continent... As much as i don't like barce as well, i also had to agreed they were good for that period of 2, 3 yrs and i belief many agree with me even if they are not a supporter of that club.</p>
              <p>Ok the Gullit and Vialli's days... now you are making it personal here... Believe it or not, there is nothing to do with United here alright... It would be better that you not assume again towards this direction... I can tell you it was their methods that got many to take note of them, just like Spurs and Portsmouth today... Many just like to see the underdogs do well sometimes... Just like United were the underdogs during the 80s. That Chelsea got the respect and support from neutrals. Just go and ask many real Chelsea fans before Roman came, and they will tell you they started to support that club for this very reason... you can also add Hoddle in there as i think he was the one who started it... Their pattern of work were very impressive and believe it or not, they were actually playing attractive attacking football under those 3 managers...</p>
              <p>I referred to the years from mid 2003 to mid 2006. RVN spent 5 yrs at United, the first 3 yrs were very good until 2004, the next 2 were poor... he was sold in mid 2006 after a serious injuries and lost of form and ageing... Saha only came in to play after Ruud was sold. Scholes, during that time also had a bad injury and when he recovered, had another problem with his eyesight and was out for almost the whole season... Park, Smith precisely what i meant, they had players of these qualities during their rebuilding process... which was not good enough... Others like <span style="color: #000000;">Quinton Fortune,</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Silvestre, Tim Howard, and an ageing Roy Keane all were first team players... Solskjaer was consistently injured, Rio was ban for 8 months... Heinze got injured in early Sep and was out for the rest of the season. They depended on a young Fletcher and a Wes Brown that even today tho improve a lot you would still feel not good enough for the CB role. Anyway, i don't expect you to know or understand this as you not follow them as closely...</span></p>
              <p>Not ready means not mature enough yet... Still lacking in experience... I don't know where you got your goals numbers from 30 - 50 but Ronaldo only manager 4 in the 03/04 season... and 5 the next... and don't assume the Ronaldo then and the Ronaldo today is the same player alright...</p>
              <p>You are asking Wenger if they are ready? What do you expect him to say? Just like you said no manager would play to lose you expect Wenger to openly say his players are lousy, bad and not ready? What will it tell the players in his squad? He is doing his best to motivate them and not knock them down.</p>
              <p>On Kenyon, well it certainly didn't seem like he was lying when he said it would be a ONE horse race wasn't it? The title race ended well before March... He was proven right.</p>
              <p>So to you Grant was only there to show it was Roman's money that won that 2 EPL titles? Well... So are you also one of the believers that Chelsea bought the titles as well? Because that what you are saying right now... there is no 2 ways about it here...</p>
              <p>Yes double standard from some Grant hates... Like i said, Its very convenient to blame Grant cos of his qualifications... Every manager make mistakes... Fergie, Wenger, Rafa too... but they can be taken as oversight and forgotten easily... But if its Grant, it gets emphasize 100 times to become a very big deal! The good subs he made against Arsenal and United people forget them easily or credit it to his assistant... how convenient...</p>
              <p>The injuries he had to cope with losing Terry, Lampard, Cech, Ballack and Drogba, Essien and Kalou to ACN weren't telling and its all because he made it by continuing to win with his second strings players... Jose couldn't cope the year before even tho he had lesser injuries... and end up talking about eggs from different supermarkets...</p>
              <p>Injury and all is part of the game... Making subs is also a tactically move... In important match where there might be extra time, some don't even want to use one until the ET kicks in or when a penalty is to be the decider, they will put in the players that are more able in a penalty shoot-out... Even in a league match, most don't used all 3 before the last 15 mins of the match... The 3 that Jose changed were all able bodies and not due to injuries... It was only after the 3 changes that he got an injury to one of his player...</p>
              <p>But like i said, no one pick on it... Of course there were for the first 2 week but after that... He is forgiven... So why can't Grant be forgiven also? Because his name is Grant and not Jose? So this not qualified as double standard?</p>
