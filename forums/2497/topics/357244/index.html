              <p>New Ipswich boss Roy Keane has thrown down the gauntlet to his former Manchester United teammates Mark Hughes and Steve Bruce.</p>
              <p>He said: "Sparky and Brucey have not won a trophy, have they? They have
                  the potential. Sparky has done a brilliant job at Blackburn, but he is
                  facing different challenges at Manchester City. We are all facing
                  different challenges.</p>
              <p>"Until an ex-teammate of mine from '94 goes on and really
                  achieves something then I would not agree that they are successful
                  managers. You need a bit more than some of those managers have achieved
                  yet.</p>
              <p>"'I've watched Wigan a few times since I left Sunderland and Brucey looked after me and the kids for tickets."</p>

              <div class="text-center padding-top-5">
              <p class="small bold"><em><strong>BLASTING BACK ... City boss Mark Hughes</strong></em></p>
              <p class="small bold"> </p>
              <p class="article">Keano contacted his former team-mates yesterday to explain his outburst during 
              his first Press conference as boss of Championship side Ipswich.</p>
              <p class="article">He spoke to Bruce and sent a text to Hughes but, despite his attempts to make 
              peace, the pair were at pains to give him as good as they got.</p>
              <p class="article">Wigan gaffer Bruce stormed: “Roy is right to say none of us have won anything 
              yet — but that is because the big boys win practically everything every 
              year.</p>
              <p class="article">“If I finish in the top 10 with Wigan this season I will regard that as quite 
              an achievement. Until one of us gets one of the big jobs you won’t be able 
              to judge us.</p>
              <p class="article">“But, in Roy’s eyes, none of us will ever be classed as a successful manager 
              until we actually get one of those jobs, so it’s a bit of a no-win 
              situation.”</p>
              <p class="article">And Manchester City boss Hughes insisted Keane does not hold the copyright on 
              a will to win.</p>
              <p class="article">Sparky said: “Roy isn’t the only one with the mentality of wanting to win 
              things and be the best he can be.</p>
              <p class="article">“I would suggest all the players he mentioned and played alongside and are now 
              managers have also got that mentality. That’s why we’re all still in the 
              game.</p>
              <p class="article">“Success is relative and I thought he was right when he said I did an 
              excellent job at Blackburn.</p>
              <p class="article">“In the future, I’m trying to build something here myself.</p>
              <p class="article">“You will be judged at the top level if you can win trophies and, as a 
              manager, everyone strives to do that. I was able to do it as a player.</p>
              <p class="article">“As a manager I’ve been in the semi-finals of major competitions and not quite 
              made it but the drive and ambition to win trophies as a manager is exactly 
              the same as it was when I was a player.</p>
              <p class="article">“I’m not upset about it. I’m not really bothered, to be honest. I’m not going 
              to be coming into much contact with him, obviously.”</p>
              <p class="article">Keane also had a go at ex-managers Bryan Robson and Paul Ince, two more of his 
              team-mates from United’s 1994 Double-winning team.</p>
              <p class="article">But Bruce insisted Keane should get real and said: “Does any British manager 
              get a chance with one of the big clubs?</p>
              <p class="article">“Alex Ferguson got the job at United because he had been so successful in 
              Scotland but that wouldn’t be considered enough these days.</p>
              <p class="article">“The only new British coaches you see in the Premier League are the ones who 
              actually take their clubs up, like Tony Pulis and Tony Mowbray did.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <div class="float-right width-300 padding-left-10 padding-bottom-10 padding-top-10"></div>
              <p class="article">But despite being at loggerheads with Keane over what constitutes success, 
              Bruce insisted he is delighted to see him back in football.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: “I like Roy and the game is definitely richer — and livelier — with 
              him involved.</p>
              <p class="article">“While he was out of the game he came to more Wigan games than anywhere else 
              and we speak regularly — including today. Roy always speaks his mind. What 
              you see is what you get and it has always been the same.</p>
              <p class="article">“He sets himself incredibly high standards and expects everyone to match them.</p>
              <p class="article">“Roy has an incredible hunger and that is what sets the greats apart from the 
              rest.</p>
              <p class="article">“But he has taken on a lot at Ipswich, especially saying he will have failed 
              if he doesn’t take them up within two years.”</p>
              <p class="article">City boss Sparky added: “I don’t think there are many managers who get 
              appointed to a mid-table Championship team who can make the impact on the 
              world’s media as Roy has.</p>
              <p class="article">"That’s a compliment to him and the personality he is. He’s taken on a 
              big task, just as I did here.</p>
              <p class="article">“It must be a good opportunity because Roy’s gone back. Maybe he has been 
              given promises with regard to how much he’ll be able to spend.”</p>
