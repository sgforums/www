              <p>Who will create for them the answer is bendtner. why? bendtner assit 2 goals 2day. while fabregas is struggling to make impact. i know is very tough to win at Nou Camp but ball is round. without their centerback bendtner will be able to win more header. All Gunners fan can do is believe we can do it. And we hope to get arshvain back for the return leg. And we cant out pass barcelona so in the return i expect more long ball to bendtner and walcott to run forward. We were very lucky 2day to get a draw but i still believe arsenal can do it.</p>

              <p>In my opinion, with this result... United have a better chance of getting through than Arsenal. Reason is Arsenal fail to take any home advantage tonight therefore in the return, their chance of a win in Nou Camp is very slim...</p>
              <p>I am predicting gunners to lose by quite a big margin in Spain as they try to get a goal... Maybe 2 or 3 goals cos Barce already have 2 away goals so Arsenal need to come out. And to make matters worse, Andres Iniesta could be back for Barce too...</p>
              <p>Personally, even with Fabregas, it wouldn't make much of a difference in the return leg... In reality, I think he might just be a little happy he won't have to go through it... cos it could end up in an embarrassing defeat.</p>
              <p>Just my take on this, If United have a 45% - 55% chance, Gunners will only have 5% in Camp Nou. But as the romantics would like to belief in the ball is round, even 5% is a possibility i guess...</p>

              <p>yes it is. Barcelona taught Arsenal on the art of passing. its like men against boys really. I thought Barcelona were the home team, as they pass and pass the ball so easily and effortlessly. The only team that can match barcelona in passing now has to be the brazilian team. you play an open game against barcelona, that is suicidal man.</p>

              <p>At current point.Not many teams in europe could do with Barca's supreme ball game of possession and slick foot work.</p>
              <p>Arsenal should fear for their prides as barca will go for the early goal to settle the tie at Camp Nou.After which most probably they will just play their possession football which we have seen,very had to break up.The absence of the 2 first choice centre backs won't have much bearing as Barca are on Home advantage and we must take into consideration that Arsenal are weak travellers.How many in the team had experienced playing in front of such a daunting crowd of let's say 80000 fans?</p>

              <h1>Arsenal 2 Barcelona 2: Inspired Theo Walcott and hero Cesc Fabregas 
              brave Barca blitz to<br>keep Gunners alive and kicking<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>From Cesc Fabregas came the courage, from Theo Walcott the 
              inspiration, and from both of them the goals that somehow keep Arsenal in this extraordinary Champions League 
              quarter-final.</p>
              <p>Outclassed by Barcelona for the first hour, they 
              appeared to be out of the competition for another season when Zlatan 
              Ibrahimovic scored the second of his two fine goals.</p>
              <p>But then 
              came the moment when Arsene Wenger decided there was nothing else for 
              it. The moment when he dragged off a full back, sent on a super-quick 
              right winger and simply hoped for the best.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/31/article-1262667-08F351E9000005DC-477_468x286.jpg" alt="Cesc Fabregas" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>On the spot: Cesc Fabregas smashes home 
              Arsenal's equaliser late on</em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Walcott was terrific, the manner in which he took his 
              69th-minute
              goal surely enough to convince Arsenal's manager that the young England
              international must start in the Nou Camp next Tuesday; that he made a
              mistake in responding to an injury to Andrey Arshavin by sending on
              Emmanuel Eboue after only 27 minutes.</p>
              <p>The decision to then take off Bacary Sagna and move Eboue into
              defence turned this contest on its head at the Emirates, and with
              Barcelona now without their two central defenders - both Carles Puyol
              and Gerard Pique are suspended - they have to use Walcott in a bid to
              take advantage.</p>
              <p>That Walcott then provided the cross that led to Fabregas's
              equaliser only strengthened his case. It was a terrific ball, one that
              Nicklas Bendtner headed down, forcing Puyol to foul Fabregas in a
              reckless attempt to stop him scoring.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/31/article-1262667-08F35A34000005DC-598_468x312.jpg" alt="Fabregas" width="468" height="312">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Upended: Fabregas is brought down by Carles 
              Puyol, who was sent off late on</em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For Fabregas there were echoes of Roy Keane in Turin 11 years
               ago.
              He might not have dominated the game in the way Keane did after seeing
              Juventus take a two-goal lead and receiving the booked that ruled him
              out of the final, but it was heroic nevertheless.</p>
              <p>Having only played after passing a late fitness test, he was a
              distraught, dejected figure when Massimo Busacca showed him a yellow
              card for what looked a perfectly good challenge on Sergio Busquets,
              complaining to the Swiss official as the two men returned to their
              respective dressing rooms at half-time.</p>
              <p>But Fabregas bravely battled on, not just scoring his 85th-minute
              penalty but limping through the final few minutes. It seems on landing
              after taking his spot-kick he suffered what looked suspiciously like a
              stress fracture; the kind of injury that comes as a result of severe
              shin splints; the kind of injury that might just have ended his season
              and ruined his chances of representing Spain at this summer's World
              Cup.</p>

              </div>
              <p>The sight of him suffering only added to the sense of drama and the
              sense of defiance in Arsenal ranks. But Barcelona will wonder how they
              allowed Arsenal to battle their way back into this tie, given how
              superior they were for the opening hour. They were magnificent,
              mesmerising, every inch the best team in Europe.</p>

              <p>This was not exactly what Wenger had in mind when he said this would
              be a celebration of football at its finest. It was football at its
              finest, but only by Barcelona. Only by the side who gave Arsenal a
              lesson in the finer arts of the beautiful game.</p>
              <p>Only by the 
              side that
              even sprung something of a surprise in switching from the 4-3-3
              formation that Wenger so admires to a more orthodox 4-4-2 that they
              have apparently been practising in training. Arshavin's injury forced
              Wenger to make a change but he changed his formation to match them too,
              pushing Fabregas into an even more advanced role behind Bendtner and
              making his wingers adopt a more defensive approach.</p>
              <p>Even then there was little Arsenal could do to contain them, because
              while the classy Catalans are a side that can pass their opponents to
              death they can also hit them on the break.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Their opening goal, scored 22 seconds into the second half 
              and
              before Wenger had even returned to his seat, was more Bolton than
              Barcelona. A long ball forward from the centre half and a lob over the
              goalkeeper. OK, so Kevin Davies might have struggled to finish with the
              finesse of Ibrahimovic, but you get the drift.</p>
              <p>Lionel Messi 
              was not at his most resplendent but in tandem with the
              wonderful Xavi Hernandez he had Arsenal chasing shadows. By half-time
              Barca had enjoyed 71 per cent of the ball and unleashed more than nine
              shots on targets with none in return, Arsenal's only contribution of
              note the yellow card for Fabregas and the disappearance of William
              Gallas on a stretcher with what looked like a recurrence of his calf
              injury.</p>
              <p>Blaming defeat in that Champions League Final four years ago on the
              dismissal of Jens Lehmann will be wearing a bit thin now, because had
              it not been for the heroics of Manuel Almunia there would have been no
              comeback.</p>

              </div>
              <p>With the loss of Gallas came a slightly bizarre decision from
              Wenger. Rather than send on Sol Campbell, he opted for Alex Song as his
              replacement and sent on Denilson from the bench.</p>
              <p>But it was 
              Song who failed to respond to a decent ball forward from
              Pique by chasing down Ibrahimovic, the Swede using the time and space
              to beat Almunia with a super chip, and Song who then combined with Gael
              Clichy to lose the Barcelona striker for a second time. This time Xavi
              was the provider, Ibrahimovic driving a bullet past Arsenal's
              goalkeeper.</p>

              </div>
              <p>From
               Walcott, however, came the start of a remarkable revival that
              took advantage of the complacency that had spread through the Catalans.
              Suddenly Arsenal were playing with more urgency; more fluency too.</p>
              <p>It
               was a super pass from Bendtner but an even more impressive angled
              run from Walcott that ended with a finish that Victor Valdes proved
              powerless to stop.</p>

              <p>What then followed was more astonishing 
              still. A moment of madness
              from Puyol and a moment of pure theatre from Fabregas, once a son of
              Barcelona but now the adopted son of Arsenal.</p>
              <p>Last night he 
              fought to the final whistle for them and gave them a
              fighting chance, even if it is hard to see beyond Pep Guardiola's side
              for a place in the semi-finals.</p>

              <p><br>Barce shot is mostly direct to Alumnia, his mistake is moving to early away from goal line, and very often he make this mistake.</p>
              <p>Look at the number of goal conceed in EPL compare to Chelsea and MU. He is good but not the best in the world, to be UCL winner u need a super goal keeper meaning he can think a step ahead of his opponent.</p>
              <p>Bendtner is good? 1 to 1 also cannot score! he is not a out and out striker, without a cool mind infront of goal, creativity and pin point accuraccy, very slow, his goal r in some ways luck or he have the height thats all.</p>
              <p>His 2 assist in this game is only the plus point, other than that he shouldn't be the lone striker up front.</p>
              <p>Song is very good, meaning there other 3 defender plus the DM is not alert to cover those 2 goals which conceed cheaply. That's where strength in depth is not there to go all the way to win the trophy.</p>
              <p>The point is Arsenal defence and keeper is not good enuff to collect UCL medal. If those 2 goals r really of quality than I don't think we can fault the defence.</p>
              <p>Looking forward to 2nd leg, if Arsenal still conceed this kind of stupid goals, thats is why many pundit and expert can forsee, they only have themself to blame.</p>
              <p>As a fan, we want them to put up a good fight and show us what they have, I think they can, Wenger need to push the youngster hard, really hard. Why Henry leave? He can see the limit of gunner, but ofcouse the $ and reward he wanted. It about team, telant and the hunger to win. I din see any of this last nite except Wacott pace and Fab determination, the rest r out gun by Barce one on one.</p>
              <p>I never see Gunner playing like a kid since '89. 30-70% WTF.</p>
