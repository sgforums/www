            <div class='col-md body'>Unhappy Mido: Joining Spurs was 'a big mistake'<br><br>Mido's future at Tottenham looks increasingly uncertain after the Egypt striker admitted he is unsettled at White Hart Lane.<br><br>The 24-year-old only made seven Premiership starts this season and was on the verge of signing for Manchester City at the end of the January transfer window only to agree to stay with Spurs and assess his options this summer.<br><br>His first season since making his loan from Roma a permanent deal has been hampered by injuries which have limited his availability and resulted in just five goals.<br><br>He said: 'I would be lying if I said that I am happy at Spurs. Any player who doesn't play will not feel happy.'<br><br>Mido was linked with a move back to Celta Vigo as well as City last season before boss Martin Jol persuaded him to stay.<br><br>Jol's three other strikers - Dimitar Berbatov, Robbie Keane and Jermain Defoe - also scored more than 60 goals between them during the campaign, which has limited opportunities for a fourth attacker.<br><br>Mido believes he made a mistake to sign on a permanent basis a year ago after turning down the chance to stay at Roma or join other teams.<br><br>In an interview with Al-Mehwar, an Egyptian television channel, he added: 'The hard times started with me making the wrong decision.<br><br>'I made a big mistake when I signed permanently for Spurs. I know that this could result in problems but it is the truth.'<br></div>

But I have four years remaining on my contract with Tottenham and I play in the strongest league in the world. So, I see no reason to even think about coming back.<br><br>"Yes I had difficult times this season with Spurs but I am eager to bounce back and get back to my normal form.<br><br>"Every player passes through hard times in his career.<br><br>"The important thing is that he must have the will to come back."<br><br>Mido signed a five-year deal with Spurs last summer, but he has admitted he made a mistake in committing his future to the North Londoners.<br><br>He added: "The hard times started with me making the wrong decision. I made a big mistake when I signed permanently for Spurs.<br><br>"This is the first time that I announce this and I know that this could result in problems but it is the truth and I have to say it.<br><br>"Firstly, I spent a very good loan period at Tottenham. We ended fifth and qualified for Europe and I was one of the top scorers together with Robbie Keane.<br><br>"At the end of the season, I had many options. I had the option to return to Roma which is a very big team and they ended second in the Calcio and I also had other choices.<br><br>"Officials at Roma begged me to stay and so did my agent Mino Raiola but I decided against all their advice to sign permanently for Spurs.<br><br>"I wanted to join Tottenham because I loved the club and wanted to be there, particularly in London, and so did my family.<br><br>"It wasn't the best decision I've made and I am not going to repeat these kind of mistakes again."<br><br>When asked about his future, Mido added: "I am contracted for four years with Tottenham. But if I get a good offer, then I will be in another place next season." </span></div>
