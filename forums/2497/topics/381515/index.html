              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>David Ngog's outrageous dive against Birmingham City could lead to a major change in the way the English game is governed. The Football Association are ready to act after a series of damaging incidents - highlighted by Sportsmail’s campaign against diving cheats.</strong></p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Sportsmail understands the FA are now looking to make a significant change to their own rulebook, allowing them to take action against players such as Ngog.</p>
              </div>
              <p>At present, the FA follow FIFA’s regulations in refusing to punish players retrospectively who are shown to have cheated through diving.</p>
              <p>The Liverpool striker won a crucial penalty on Monday night when he went down as<br>Birmingham midfielder Lee Carsley slid in to challenge. His action, which led to Steven Gerrard converting the penalty to earn under-pressure Liverpool a 2-2 draw, has been condemned across the game.</p>
              <p>FA officials recognise the damage such incidents inflict on the sport and are mindful that UEFA have banned cheats on the basis of video evidence. Europe’s ruling body banned the Arsenal striker Eduardo after he dived against Celtic, before reversing the decision.</p>
              <p>The call for action has grown stronger since Sportsmail launched our campaign to outlaw diving cheats and we have been backed by managers, players and fans alike.</p>
              <p>The Eduardo incident and the one involving team-mate Emmanuel Eboue against Manchester United in August highlighted the growing menace in the game.</p>
              <p>The FA move comes as Birmingham City defender Scott Dann, sickened by the incident which cost his side victory, called for tough action to clear the game of cheats.</p>
              <p>Dann, a lifelong Liverpool fan, said: ‘The only way you can stop it is to suspend cheats and it is up to the FA to sort it out.</p>
              <p>‘Rules can be changed to clean up football and this is something that needs to be addressed and people have to be punished heavily. Everyone who saw it knew it was a dive. It was so obvious.’</p>
              <p>Match referee Peter Walton will be asked to explain his decision to award the penalty at a special meeting of referees called to deal with what is a growing crisis in the game.</p>
              <p>Referees’ chief Keith Hackett said: ‘I will be sitting down with Peter on a one-to-one basis, as well as in a group format, to see how we can best deal with this problem so that errors are reduced.</p>
              <p>‘We will go through what the referee could have done to avoid this error.’</p>
              <p>Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez is unlikely to take any action against Ngog but will have to address his side’s shortcomings as a matter of urgency, as winger Albert Riera reflected on a return of one win from nine games and admitted it has turned into a mental barrier for Liverpool’s under-performing players.</p>
              <p>Riera and Yossi Benayoun both face up to six weeks out with torn hamstrings. Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard are doubts for the visit of Manchester City a week on Saturday. To add to the injury problems, defender Daniel Agger has reported more discomfort in his troublesome back.</p>
              <p>Goalkeeper Pepe Reina recently described Liverpool’s precarious Champions’ League plight as ‘disgraceful’ and Riera was just as forthright as he bluntly conceded his team’s attempts to halt the slide are ‘not working’.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">IT'S said the camera never lies. Well I think it's time to find out if players are big enough never to tell porkies as well. Time and again players are caught by video replays breaking the rules when the referee has missed the offence.</h2>
              <p class="article">There's the penalty that got away or was given, the punch that hit but was missed or the handball that was never seen by the man in the middle. But there it is for all to witness later on, with blame being heaped on the ref for cocking up and even louder demands for the villains to be punished after the event.</p>
              <p class="article">Well, here is an idea to help stamp out cheating in football - why don't we just <strong>ASK</strong> players whether they are guilty or not? It's simple, it's direct and not as daft as some might think it is.</p>
              <p class="article">I can hear you saying if players have already cheated, then they would lie about it too. Well, I have a nasty little sting in the tail.</p>
              <p class="article">Say a referee is unsure whether, for instance a goal has been scored with a hand. He asks the player if it was indeed handball. If the player admits to an offence, it's a free-kick to the other side and no card is given. But if he says no offence was committed and TV replays later proved he was lying, then he should be hammered with a FIVE-MATCH ban and NO appeal on the sentence.</p>
              <p class="article">Asking players if a penalty is just or a foul has been committed is something that routinely goes on at my training ground all the time. It's impossible to keep up with the pace of play - the switch from defence to attack is lightning quick and unlike at Premier League stadiums, we don't have the use of instant video playback.</p>
              <p class="article">This is where I feel fourth officials should be of use, rather than telling managers they are half a yard outside the technical area. For the life of me, I don't understand why video technology is not used to help officials reach decision <strong>DURING</strong> games.</p>
              <p class="article">Retrospective punishments are fine by me but why not dish out the punishment immediately, so the offending team are hit on the day?</p>
              <p class="article">I cannot understand the reluctance to use video technology from the touchline. What is there to be afraid of?</p>
              <p class="article">Use <strong>FIVE</strong> officials is UEFA's answer to debatable decisions. Well, five officials got it wrong at Fulham recently when the wrong player was initially sent off.</p>
              <p class="article">While I'm at it, I'd like to nail another myth about diving. No manager in my long experience has ever told a player to try to con a referee by diving.</p>
              <p class="article">Referees are also pilloried for not keeping up with play but the speed of athletic footballers makes it impossible for them and they have to make decisions from 40 yards away.</p>
              <p class="article">You can bet your last penny there would be a camera nearer to a flashpoint than the referee - so why not use them? And if the people who run the game don't fancy that, then the referee can always ask.</p>

              <p>ngog's dive is even worst than the eduardo one, at least for eduardo, you cant tell whether the defender touched him or not, but this ngog one is simply never touch at all, and he fell/dive. Marvellous.</p>

              <p>Frankly speaking, I'd go a little easy on the ref.... after all, he is already expected to run around the field like mad and be able to make major decisions based on split-second viewings.....</p>
              <p>But both Michel Platini and Sepp Blatter should hammer their heads against the wall for saying that video evidence compromises the spontaneity of the game..... there's no problem at all as long you limit the use of such evidence to things like dubious penalties, violent conduct, and red cards.....</p>
              <p>At the very least, allow for retrospective punishment, and make it severe. It won't stop all divers, but it will at least make them think twice.</p>
