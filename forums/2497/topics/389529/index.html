              <h1>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger backs Sol Campbell to shackle in-form Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Arsene Wenger has every confidence veteran Sol Campbell can produce
              the 'big game' required should he be needed to stand in for Thomas
              Vermaelen and shackle Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney at Emirates Stadium on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Belgium
              defender Vermaelen, who has impressed since his £10million summer
              transfer from Ajax, is struggling to be fit to face the Barclays
              Premier League champions after picking up a knee injury in the midweek
              goalless draw at Villa Park.</p>
              <p>Former Gunners captain Campbell
              came on as Vermaelen's replacement to make his first league appearance
              since rejoining the Gunners on a short-term deal.</p>
              <p>Wenger has no doubt the former England centre-back can step in again should he be called for.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/01/29/article-0-080CB58C000005DC-136_468x286.jpg" alt="Sol Campbell comes on for injured Thomas Vermaelen" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Changing of the guard: Sol Campbell replaces Thomas Vermaelen at Villa Park</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>'Sol is ready, if he has recovered well. I have to assess him today,
              but normally he will play if Vermaelen doesn't play,' said Wenger,
              whose side are now back in third place, two points behind leaders
              Chelsea following the midweek games.</p>
              <p>The good news we have on
              Vermaelen is that there is no fracture. We have to assess his knee
              today, there is still a small chance that he plays on Sunday.</p>
              <p>'We
              will do the maximum to get him fit, but at the moment it looks
              unlikely. It should be a very short-term injury, and at the latest he
              should be ready for the Chelsea game.'</p>
              <p>Campbell, 35, led the Gunners through their unbeaten league championship campaign of 2003/2004, when rivalry between Arsenal and United was at its height.</p>
              <p>Wenger
              added: 'Sol has experience and he likes the big games. He can turn up
              if needed and experience helps in these kind of games. Sol can cope
              with Rooney.</p>
              <p>'I believe Sol has worked very hard and credit
              to him, every day he was motivated to push himself and he is quite fit,
              he looks fit.'</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Red devil: Chris Smalling will join Manchester United in the summer</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Meanwhile Wenger admitted he was disappointed to have missed out on the capture of defender Chris Smalling.</p>
              <p>Manchester
              United won the race to land the highly-rated 20-year-old centre-half
              from Fulham, who plucked him from non-league Maidstone.</p>
              <p>Despite
              his disappointment at being unable to convince the youngster to come to
              the Emirates Stadium, as he had done with United target Aaron Ramsey,
              Wenger believes Smalling has a bright future.</p>
              <p>'Manchester
              United got Smalling in the end. I am sorry because we were very close
              to getting him and we were on the case very early,' said the Gunners
              boss. 'I wish the player well.</p>
              <p>'At the end of the day it is
              important he has a good career. In both clubs he has a good chance to
              make a great career. The most important thing is he does that.'</p>

              <p><br>if you compare arsene wenger to the previous managers, then of course wenger is the best. that's only because you are not comparing to the best managers in the world like mourinho, ferguson and ancelotti. if arsenal wants to improve, they cannot keep thinking we have the most goals scored, our strike rate is good, we need no strikers. imagine if they had added 2 strikers, they could have netted many more goals</p>

              <p><br>yeah, he can find a job at some smaller club, but not at a big club. Joan Laporte is doing extremely well at Barca, Mourinho and Inter Milan, Ferguson at Man Utd and Ancelotti at Chelsea. No big club needs Wenger.</p>

              <p><br>if you compare arsene wenger to the previous managers, then of course wenger is the best. that's only because you are not comparing to the best managers in the world like mourinho, ferguson and ancelotti. if arsenal wants to improve, they cannot keep thinking we have the most goals scored, our strike rate is good, we need no strikers. imagine if they had added 2 strikers, they could have netted many more goals</p>

              <p>he almost won the UEFA cup in 2000 and the CL in 2006, but almost is not good enough, cos no one remember runner up position. but he won 3 league titles over 10 year period, plus 4 fa cups along the way. the only manager whose record towers wenger is Fergie. tell me, since the inception of EPL in 1992, besides fergie, anyone record is better than wenger's one? keegan? bobby robson? houllier?</p>
