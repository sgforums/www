            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://soccernet-akamai.espn.go.com/design05/images/JonMC/December2007/jones-275.jpg"><br><br>Sunderland manager Roy Keane is convinced his side should have been given the benefit of the doubt over Stephen Hunt's last-minute goal which earned Reading a 2-1 victory.<br><br>Referee Steve Tanner, having consulted with linesman Steve Rubery, ruled that Black Cats goalkeeper Craig Gordon had been unable to prevent Hunt's shot from crossing the line.<br><br>But Keane insisted it had been an impossible call for an official to make from such a distance and that television replays had also been unable to shed any light on it.<br><br>He said: 'Nobody is certain it crossed the line. If the referee's assistant can give it then obviously he has got very good eyesight.<br><br>'I've seen a replay and I am told to believe every game that if an official is not sure on any decision, be it a sending off or a penalty kick, if they are not sure they can't give it.<br><br>'If the linesman is sure then all credit to him. He must have fantastic vision because we have watched it a few times and it is still unclear.'<br><br>It was the second game in succession that a stoppage-time decision went against Sunderland, who thought they had taken the lead at home to Aston Villa last week only for that to be ruled out.<br><br>Keane added: 'People will talk about the goal last week but there were lots of decisions that went against us. That's the way things are at the moment and we have got to try to rise above it.<br><br>'We could talk all night all about it but it isn't going to change anything.'<br><br>Reading manager Steve Coppell admitted it had been a fortunate end to a performance he still regarded as worthy of a win.<br><br>He said: 'I felt we deserved it but I'm bound to say that. In the first 45 minutes we had the majority of the play and chances although they had one excellent chance.<br><br>'When we got the goal I would have hoped it would turn out to be one of those emphatic 1-0 wins but as often happens the goal was the signal for the final act in the play and the final act almost turned into a tragedy but in the end was fortunate, which is the best way of putting it.'<br><br><strong>sad case, and bad luck for RK <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </strong></div>
