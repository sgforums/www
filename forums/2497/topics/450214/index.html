              <p><span><strong>Chelsea and Manchester United are leading the race to sign Japan forward Shinji Kagawa who is refusing to sign a contract at Borussia Dortmund.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The 23-year-old is attracted to a switch to the Barclays Premier League due to the huge popularity of the English game in his homeland.</span></p>
              <p><span>The German club have given him two weeks to decide on a contract extension to 2016 that would double his salary from £1.25million per year to £2.5m. But they would be forced to sell Kagawa in the summer or risk losing him for nothing when his contract runs out in 2013.</span></p>
              <p><span>Dortmund paid just £294,000 to buy him from J-League Cereza Osaka in summer 2010 but he has been a revelation. </span> </p>
              <div class="moduleHalf"><span>He helped them lift the Bundesliga title and even though he missed the second half of the season with an ankle injury he still scored eight goals in 18 games. Kagawa has 15 goals in 36 games this season — two goals and six assists in the league — and Dortmund lead the Bundesliga by three points.</span></div>
              <div class="moduleHalf"><span>.</span></div>
              <div class="moduleHalf"><span>The striker, who has 29 caps and nine goals for Japan, has said joining Manchester United would be a dream.</span></div>
              <div class="moduleHalf"><span>.</span></div>
              <div class="moduleHalf"><span>Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc said: ‘Shinji must now decide. We know he is flirting with clubs in England and Spain.’</span></div>

              <p>I guess if he can score eight goals in 18 games in the Bundesliga, he isn't a lousy player. It's not like he scored in the Dutch league, the German league is very difficult as well. Previous players like Berbatov, Demba Ba, Demba Cisse, Edin Dzeko all cross over from the german league to the epl.</p>
              <p>And also he left 1 yr contract. So could be a bargain value buy. And still so young.</p>

              When will we see a chinese in the EPL again?
              
              
              United and Chelsea confirm want to buy him lah, he is quite good based on his current performance.
              
              
              But i need to know that if he join a EPL team, he might not play first team football so much.

              <p>This guy isn't only going to be a squad player. He has every chance to make the first team his own looking at his record at Dortmund.</p>
              <p>He has started 29 and only one as sub in Dortmund's 32 league games so far this season.</p>
              <p>He is their 2nd highest goalscorer with 13 from midfield. Their top scorer is a striker on 20 goals. One more and he will be their joint 2nd highest assists too.</p>
              <p>His record is rather impressive with 30 shots on goal with 13 goals return in the league. And only got 1 yellow card in all 29 matches.</p>
              <p>Dortmund are top of the league by a big margin so will most likely win the title. And he played a big role for them this season.</p>
              <p>Compare him to German star Mario Gotze also at Dortmund, played only 15, 2 as sub. Golas 5, assists 5, 2 yellow and 1 red card.</p>
              <p>At 23 only, he has a lot more to offer.</p>
              <p>This guy is a bargain even if he comes at $10m or $12m. Because if you can do well in the German league and even win the title, you can't be a poor player. It's always good to have such players in the squad anyway.</p>

              <div class="sport item"><span style="font-size: small;">However, Kagawa appeared to rubbish the claim, telling Bild newspaper: 'I have not yet decided what I will do.

              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Kagawa's is valued at well over £10m, but with his contract set to exprie next summer, Dortmund will cash in on one of their prize assets rather than lose him for free.</span></p>
