              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No10: The host broadcaster</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>A massive electrical storm in Vienna saw Germany’s thrilling showdown with Turkey ruined for every armchair fan around the world. At least 10 minutes of the rollercoaster semi-final was lost in the TV coverage, including Miroslav Klose’s goal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No9: Karim Benzema</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>The France striker went into the tournament with a growing reputation as his country’s wonderkid. Fans were told he was the hottest property outside Italy, Spain and England. But Benzema failed to impress during his two dismal displays for the hopeless French.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No8: Adrian Mutu</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>The former Chelsea striker was tipped to pull up trees with underdogs Romania. And with a penalty against Italy, he was one kick away from sending his side into the quarter-finals. But Mutu fluffed his effort and Romania later tumbled out against Holland.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No7: The co-hosts</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>Austria and Switzerland were both among the first seeds for the tournament as the host nations but they barely raised a cheer for their own fans. Austria bowed out with a single draw, while Switzerland’s only points came against Portugal in a dead rubber following their own elimination.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No6: Mario Gomez</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>Germany’s route to the final was no mean feat — especially when you consider they were effectively playing with 10 men for their three group games. Gomez contributed next to nothing, with boss Joachim Low seeing sense in the quarter-finals to finally drop him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No5: Thierry Henry</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>The man whose star continues to fade must take some of the stick for France’s disjointed campaign this month. Henry’s goal against Holland masked an ineffective showing, with his deflection against Italy condemning his side to an early exit from the group stages.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No4: Greece</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>It seems a bit harsh for the surprise winners of Euro 2004 to be here but defeat in all three group games was truly woeful. And Greece's arch-rivals Turkey rubbed the defending champions' noses in it by reaching the semi-finals with a series of thrilling comebacks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No3: Eric Abidal</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>Playing the world champions in a win-or-bust final group game is never easy, yet France did not help themselves. When defender Abidal chopped down Italy’s Luca Toni for a first-half penalty and straight red card, it was au revoir Les Bleus.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No2: Petr Cech</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>Leading 2-1 against Turkey with just two minutes left, Czech Republic had one foot in the quarter-finals— until Cech’s howler. The Chelsea keeper horribly fluffed a routine cross for the equaliser, before an injury-time winner sent his side packing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No1: Luca Toni</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>The Italian hotshot came to the finals on the back of a golden season with Bayern Munich, notching 31 goals in the Bundesliga. But Toni endured a dreadful tournament, missing countless chances as well as looking like a man running through treacle.</p>
