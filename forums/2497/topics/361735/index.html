              <p>The negotiations were carried out by Portsmouth chief executive Peter Storrie, agent Pini Zahavi and another major football fixer, Pairoj Piempongsant - the Thai businessman who brokered the deal that saw Thaksin Shinawatra sell <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Manchester City</span></span></a> to the Abu Dhabi United Group.</p>
              <p>The setting was the top-floor open-air bar of the Sofitel hotel overlooking the Eternal City. Storrie returned to the UK yesterday morning after a sizeable full breakfast without staying for the match, his job done after a clinching takeover summit on Tuesday night with Sulaiman.</p>
              <p>The sale, which is now the subject of due diligence, ensures Portsmouth will not suffer the potential ignominy of being the first Premier League club to go into administration.</p>
              <p>UAE property developer Sulaiman was the frontman for the Abu Dhabi United Group after their purchase of Manchester City, whose bold predictions included the signing of Cristiano Ronaldo, before City owner Sheik Mansour opted for a lower profile.</p>
              <p>Sulaiman is understood to be paying £80million for Portsmouth through his new investment vehicle, Al Fahim Asia Associates. Pompey had debts of around £65m with £40m owed to the South African Standard Bank and another £25m in loans to current owner Alexandre Gaydamak.</p>
              <p>The agreement, just before Standard Bank were due a huge repayment that was in danger of taking Pompey under, means a firesale of players is averted. Instead the club will have unexpected spending power for next season, by when it is likely that manager Paul Hart will have been replaced.</p>
              <p>Zahavi, who is involved in more big deals than any other agent, was close to securing a South African buyer for Portsmouth before Sulaiman got the taste for Premier League football ownership from his Manchester City experience.</p>

              <p>The "sky's the limit" for Portsmouth after the takeover by Dr Sulaiman Al Fahim.</p>
              <p>Al Fahim and his AAA consortium struck a shock £60million deal with Pompey in a secret meeting on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>A source revealed to <em>The Sun</em>: "This is Portsmouth's
              wildest dream come true. The club was in a desperate financial mess but
              all the debt has been cleared in one huge swoop.</p>
              <p>"This lot mean business. They have huge plans for the club and want to out-do Manchester City in the spending stakes.</p>
              <p>"They'll transform Portsmouth into a real Premier force - the sky's the limit now."</p>
              <p>Al Fahim's consortium made their sudden move this week and now plan to rebuild the Premier League strugglers from top to bottom.</p>
              <p>And a brand new stadium, either on the existing Fratton Park site, or elsewhere in the city is under discussion.</p>
              <p>The deal raises question marks over the future of current boss Paul Hart who is yet to sign a permanent deal.</p>

              first they need to hire a good manager. maybe sven goran erikkson would fit the bill, as he was not bad as man city manager. cl next season is a bit 2 fast lar. they shd aim for top 6 for next season and then aim for cl within 3 seasons. Villa will be challenging for 4th place next season, together with everton. as for Man City, dun think they can finish top 4 next season.

              <h1>Sven linked with Pompey as part of takeover</h1>
              <p><strong>Paul Hart's time in charge of Portsmouth appears to be drawing to a close after Sven-Goran Eriksson signalled his interested in taking over at Fratton Park.</strong></p>

              <p>Al Fahim's arrival is expected to lead to considerable change at Pompey with a high-profile manager likely to be installed in order help attract big-name players.<br><br>Eriksson's agent, Athole Still, has made it clear his man is ready to return to club football, and the Premier League in particular.</p>
              <p>Now out of work, Still said of his client: ''He is looking forward to getting back into club management and wants to be back in the Premier League. [Portsmouth] is a club with money and a club that looks like it will have ambition, which is very important to any top manager.<br><br>Still added: ''Sven was interested before when Portsmouth were looking for a replacement for Tony Adams. All that I would say at the moment is he has an interest in coming back to the Premier League, and has an interest in being involved with any club that has genuine ambitions.<br><br>''He wants to be back in the game within weeks rather than months, and has offers on the table at home and abroad. At this moment in time, there has been no official approach from Portsmouth, though.''<br><br>Al Fahim is due to complete his takeover in a few weeks following a period of formal financial and legal due diligence.</p>
