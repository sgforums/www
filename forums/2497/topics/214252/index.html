            <div class='col-md body'>DAVID BECKHAMÂ’S dream of playing in America has got the Yanks drooling.<br><br>Becks is considering cashing in on the final years of his career with a blockbusting move from Real Madrid to Major League Soccer at the end of the season.<br><br>MLS moneymen are even set to change their salary cap rules to pave the way for BeckhamÂ’s arrival, with LA Galaxy or New York Red Bulls his likely destination.<br><br>An announcement is expected on November 12 on a new Â“designated playerÂ” rule which will allow MLS clubs to break the bank to sign a superstar for the 2007 season.<br><br>And MLS deputy commissioner Ivan Gazidis has predicted the Becks effect would send fans crazy. He said: Â“We have 65 million people that are connected by soccer in this country but theyÂ’re not rabid yet.<br><br>Â“ThatÂ’s the challenge and the opportunity of soccer in the US and itÂ’s the challenge and the opportunity for David Beckham in the United States.<br><br>Â“Whoever is able to connect and activate that massive potential fan base wins.<br><br>And if Beckham can do that and help MLS do that, those are the kinds of marriages made in heaven.Â”<br><br>Becks, 31, already has a soccer school in Los Angeles. And, after being axed by England, Gazidis reckons the time is right for Brand Beckham to launch a US invasion.<br><br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/0200646020800.jpg"><br><br>I think Beck should just leave Real at the end of the season and go to the US and play in the Major League Soccer. It will do him much better, and he can get a huge sign on fee when he leave Real for nothing cos his contract ends in june 07.  And in US, he can play till he is 36 to 37... like the former German captain. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MLS would be like the Nationwide League. I think Becks probably feels he still has another 2 or 3 years at the highest level.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It won't be that bad i think... cos US football has improve over the last few years. Moreover he can prolong his playing career by another few years also and his salary will not be lesser than what he is getting now and he can get a sign on fee somemore...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>At the same time, he can use his last few years of playing to promote his Brand Beckham in the US as well...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It really all makes economical sense if Becks moves to MLS now.....hahah anyway i just can't imagine him missing out on Champions League football. Even Matthaeus went over when he was 34 r 35. Pele late 30s too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah but times have change, when Lothar Matthaus went the the MLS, it was a new football league, just starting out only and probably division one or lesser in standard and not to mention the salary of players much lower too.<br><br>Today their standard of football have improve and they can also afford to pay more for salary... not to mention they are the land for marketing &amp; advertising... Man u, Chelsea, Real, Barce all want to break into the US market but have so far not been very successful.<br><br>Beck is probably the most famous football player in the US. and unlike all those other euro stars that went there, he has a brand of fashion items to sell too besides football.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>REAL MADRID believe David Beckham will snub the USA for a new two-year contract. Club president Ramon Calderon hailed the Major League target as one of Real's "most important" players.<br><br>But Calderon said: "I think Beckham, from the point of view of the fan, is one of the most important players at Real Madrid. For many reasons - commercial and sporting.<br><br>"I speak as a fan and as the president of Real Madrid. "But Beckham would be nothing commercially if he wasn't for his sporting ability.<br><br>"Capello said to me that he counts on Beckham. Therefore he has requested that I renew his contract, and that is what we are doing."<br><br>But Calderon added: "Beckham has many offers because he is a key player in many senses.<br><br>"I think that he is going to renew his contract for another two years, but we will have to wait see if he wants to continue or not."<br><br>Former England skipper Becks, 31 contract runs out next summer.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah i feel that he should leave REAL MADRID when his contract expire in june next year and go the the US and play in the Major League better... No point going there when he is 35... might as well go now when he can still play in top level until he is around 33 and he can still continue till he is 37 or 38 in the US.<br><br>After all, Real was trying to force him to take a lower pay as they thought no one wants him... Now news that the Major League wants him... they start to ask him to stay. See if they still want to reduce his salary...<br><br>If he goes to the US, he would be one of the best players there and he can also promote his Brand Beckham easier... So for commercial or sporting reasons, he should leave Real and get a huge sign on fee for himself from the Major League.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
