              <h2>With Arsenal's Emmanuel Adebayor thought to be commanding asking
              price of up to £35 million from Milan and Barcelona, Goal.com's Sulmaan
              Ahmad questions just what makes the striker so special.</h2>
              <p>Say what you like about Cristiano Ronaldo, he can only dream of being as overrated as Emmanuel Adebayor has been this summer.<br><br>He
              is younger, faster, more skilful, versatile, prolific and of course
              marketable - and considering he is just 23 years of age to the great
              Zinedine Zidane's 29 at the time of his transfer from Juventus to Real
              Madrid, the Manchester United ace, if he leaves, should logically break
              the world record transfer fee.<br><br>Let any and every comparison and
              mention of Ronaldo end there, as meanwhile, an equally dubious transfer
              saga has almost slipped by unnoticed, that being of Adebayor.<br><br>Having
              signed for the Gunners in January 2006 from AS Monaco for an
              undisclosed fee reported to be in the region of £3 million, Adebayor
              had a modest beginning to his Arsenal career, before a disappointing
              World Cup campaign - in which the supposed star of Togo was outshone by
              team-mate Mohamed Kader - was followed by an unfulfilling season at
              Arsenal in 2006-07. The striker scored just 12 goals in 44 games - just
              over one in four - about half the return expected of a top class
              striker.<br><br>He's still young, he has potential, he needs time, <em>Arsene knows</em> - what haven't we heard before? What was most surprising is that he did
              in fact come good, and far sooner than anyone had expected. Thierry
              Henry, club icon and personal friend of Adebayor, left the club due to
              on and off-field problems, with Barcelona his choice of location for a
              fresh start. That, coupled with Robin van Persie's continued love
              affair with the treatment table and new signing Eduardo da Silva being
              eased into life at the Emirates, made Adebayor the focal point of all
              of Arsenal's attacks.<br><br>It was a role he relished, hammering home
              a fantastic 30 goals in 48 games. Following words of caution from
              manager Arsene Wenger - who pointed out that he still misses many
              chances - the Togo international said he was aiming for 40 next season.
              Then the interest began rolling in. The man known as the Togonator has
              been targeted by European demigods
              Barcelona and Milan this summer - at first laughed off as paper talk -
              but as quotes from club officials began emerging, Adebayor's overstated
              loyalty was well and truly put to the test.<br> <br>Milan chief Adriano Galliani's obsession with the tall, dark
              stranger has traversed borders of uncomfortable obsession previously
              reserved for Ashley Cole and mobile phones - and with little reason.
              The 24-year-old did manage a goal in their Champions League tie this
              season, but it was into a near-empty net with seconds remaining and the
              game already over. Having already obtained Mathieu Flamini, the key to
              the Gunners' Milanese triumph in March, on a free transfer, the <em>Rossoneri</em> seemed determined to throw the saved money away on the Togonator.<br><br>However,
              failure to qualify for the Champions League has left the 2007 winners
              strapped for cash and unable to meet Mr Wenger's dubious asking price,
              yet there is ongoing interest from Barcelona. While Italy was said to
              be Ade's preferred destination, it seems Barcelona will do just as
              well, as the likelihood of his exit continues to escalate with Arsene
              Wenger fed up of the striker's demands. Speculation is only likely to
              let up if Barça, Milan and any others lurking recover some semblance of
              rationality and refuse to pay so far over the odds for a striker that
              is still largely unproven.<br><br>Better options exist for both clubs:
              Didier Drogba may be six years Adebayor's senior, but advancing years
              have been more of a prerequisite than a stumbling block for Milan,
              while Barcelona have enough emerging young stars to realistically
              compensate for such a short-term option. Samuel Eto'o, the man looking
              to be replaced at Barcelona, has been incredibly prolific during his
              five seasons with the club and could prove a viable and cheaper option
              for Milan. Adebayor cannot even consider himself in the same league as
              Mario Gomez and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar - at least until he has repeated
              his form for at least one further season - so how is he worth £30
              million? How is he deserving of a salary in the same bracket or even
              the same currency as Thierry Henry?<br><br>Whether early senility is
              settling in for Arsene Wenger or just bitterness over Flamini and the
              reportedly impending departure of Aliaksandr Hleb, this transfer saga
              would almost be better explained as the Frenchman playing the world's
              most protracted practical joke on us all. If Barcelona are offering
              anything anywhere near £30 million, Wenger should take the money and
              run. Despite the odd Francis Jeffers and Jose Antonio Reyes, the
              Professor generally spends money better than most, and provided
              goal-machine Eduardo da Silva recovers full fitness early on this
              season, Adebayor could be replaced for half his asking price - at most
              - with very little difficulty, and the remainder of the money could be
              used to shore up the defence or replace Mathieu Flamini. Take it all in
              - what Gunners fan wouldn't sell if given the chance?<br><br>Wenger's
              reluctance to let Adebayor leave may now become his own undoing, as he
              could end up with a player who reportedly wants out - or at least a far
              bigger salary - yet hasn't consistently produced the performances to
              earn it. By the time the boss next has the opportunity to offload him,
              other clubs will have sought out alternative options and his market
              value is unlikely to be anywhere near the figures being quoted this
              summer. The entire drama has been a comedy of errors from all parties
              involved, and it is well and truly on Ade's head to now prove his worth
              - whether he stays at Arsenal or secures the major move he is said to
              be after. Can he do it?<br><br><em><strong>Sulmaan Ahmad</strong></em></p>
