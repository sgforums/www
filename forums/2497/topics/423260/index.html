              <div><em>Wenger believes his Arsenal side can win an astonishing four trophies this season</em></div>
              <div>.</div>

              <div>
              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger believes the confidence his Arsenal side have taken from their Champions League first-leg triumph over Barcelona can inspire them to win an astonishing four trophies this season.</strong></p>
              <p>He insists the Gunners will show exactly the same hunger and commitment against League One Leyton Orient in the FA Cup on Sunday that they demonstrated against the Spanish giants on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>In stark contrast to recent seasons, when Arsenal have prioritised the Premier League and the Champions League, Wenger is set to field a virtual full-strength team against Orient.</p>
              <p>"We want to go for every single competition," he said.</p>
              
              <div class="news_mpu_article"></div>
              <p>"How far will we go? I personally believe we can go in every competition to the end… but we can as well stop very quickly.</p>
              <p>"It's just down to how much we believe and how much commitment we show.</p>
              <p>"What I am convinced of is that we have the hunger and we have some talent and we are committed to going as far as we can."</p>
              <p>Arsenal are already in the final of the Carling Cup later this month against Birmingham, lie second in the Premier League, four points behind Manchester United, and their home win against Barca gives them an opportunity of progressing to the quarter-finals of the Champions League next month.</p>
              <p>"Our destiny will be made by how we focus every time, how much we can mobilise our resources in every single game," added Wenger.</p>
              <p>"The intelligent attitude will be to just worry about the next game and the next game is Leyton Orient. We had tough games against Leeds, tough games against Ipswich, a tough game against Huddersfield. We have been warned how difficult it is.</p>
              <p>"We can gain more respect from everybody if we turn up on Sunday with absolutely full commitment. Then people will say this team is ready to have a real go and not choose the competition or the games.</p>
              <p>"When you are a top-level competitive person or team you go absolutely 100% committed into every game."</p>
              <p>Theo Walcott is likely to have recovered from a slight hamstring strain, while Johan Djourou is responding well to treatment on a back injury.</p>
              <p>Wenger is likely to rest centre-back Laurent Koscielny, who felt "very tired" after the Barcelona match, but a full-house at Orient will be treated to most of the stars who just a few days earlier defeated the team universally recognised as the best in the world.</p>
              <p>Almost certainly that will include 19-year-old midfielder Jack Wilshere, who gave a supremely mature performance against Xavi and Andres Iniesta on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas described Wilshere as having an "English heart with Spanish quality" and Wenger said: "Spanish technique, certainly.</p>
              <p>"He has an English heart because he is an English boy. He just loves to win, like all the other players in my team.</p>
              <p>"He takes everything at the moment with a cool head and that's what I like. When you are at his age, you want to play and to play again and show how good you are. What I like, he is not fazed by the occasion, he is not inhibited and just plays free. That is what is fantastic about him."</p>
              <p>Wenger does not believe the FA Cup needs an overhaul and is against scrapping replays, despite Arsenal having a hectic schedule.</p>
              <p>"There is an historic love story between people and the FA Cup and people are scared every time that this history goes out of the game," he said. "I don't believe (it will) because I believe that everybody likes to go to Wembley and the final of the FA Cup."</p>
              <p>On replays, he added: "They sometimes give you a chance to get yourself out of a tricky game. Against Leeds, we had to go to Leeds and we still qualified. It is fair financially for the smaller clubs to get something."</p>

              <p>In the end, the numbers 25 meant a freaking thin squad and strong teams meant nothing when facing congested fixtures. Including youngsters against adults? Well, you might as else throw the game away.</p>

              <p>I guess at the time he said it, it was a fact...</p>
              <p>And he tried to used it as an encouragement for his team. But as with last few seasons... His Arsenal side alway lose it towards the end. It's quite strange cos their problems always starts around Feb or Mar time... very consistent in this area.</p>
              <p>But don't rule them out of the league yet... Who knows, they can still win the league come May.</p>
              <p>On a personally level, I belief the Arsenal board are very happy with him despite they having not won a trophy in almost 6 yrs. Cos Arsenal isn't run by one man out to win. They are rule by a bunch of minor shareholders whose main objective is to see the club turn in a profitable season year on year so as to generate a better income.</p>
              <p>It is quite strange that the people with the biggest shareholding isn't running the club... Of their 2 biggest shareholders, one is on board at the invitation of the minor directors so as to counter the 2nd biggest shareholder... They remove their 4th biggest shareholder from the board in Lady Nina Bracewell Smith.</p>
              <p>I guess any changes for Arsenal will only come after Oct 2012 when the board of directors agreement not to trade any of their current shareholdings expire...</p>
              <p>Until then, Wenger will still have time to experiment as his side is still getting into the CL every year and making a nice profit for them...</p>

              <p>I think wenger is in denial based on his words. He says they lost to barca under strange circumstances. LOL. What. Barca outplayed you for pete's sake.</p>
              <p>The mix up between Koscielny and Szcesny, his keeper did not communicate with the defender. The onus was on the latter to tell the former since he was behind him. Keeper too young? Inexperienced? Highly possible.</p>
              <p>The loss to man utd; "we were not outplayed but man utd were more clinical". LOL! Even if your team wasn't outplayed, being clinical in front of goal is what wins games. First day in charge? Definitely not.</p>
              <p>How often have we heard him saying his team is one for the future and when they lost, he will say injuries, suspension etc. He needs another thierry henry and david seaman to save his quick eroding reputation.</p>
