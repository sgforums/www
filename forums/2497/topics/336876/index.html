              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">CHELSEA coach Ray Wilkins last night accused Arsenal of disrespecting the 
              Carling Cup.</h2>
              <p class="article">Wilkins believes the Gunners are wrong to play a team of kids instead of their 
              star names.</p>
              <p class="article">And he insists Chelsea will not devalue the competition by doing the same.</p>
              <p class="article">He also taunted Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger by claiming the kids experiment 
              has left his club trophyless.</p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea will field a senior side against Burnley tonight and Wilkins said: 
              “It’s all about winning trophies when you’re a big club.</p>
              <p class="article">"The fact we’ve won the Carling Cup twice in the last four years and Arsenal 
              have won none justifies our policy,</p>
              <p class="article">“You enter a competition to win the competition. Why go into it if you’re not 
              concerned whether you win it?</p>
              <p class="article">“Playing a young or weakened team undermines the value of the competition.</p>
              <p class="article">“And we have not and will not do that. We want to win it, big time.”</p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea will recall Didier Drogba and Wilkins promised the only youngsters who 
              will feature will be on the bench.</p>

              <h2>Championship side record shock win</h2>
              <p>Goalkeeper Brian Jensen was the Burnley hero as Chelsea crashed out of
              the Carling Cup on penalties at Stamford Bridge 5-4 on penalties after
              a 1-1 draw.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jensen saved from captain Wayne Bridge and John Mikel Obi to put the Coca-Cola Championship side into the quarter-finals.</p>
              <p>Returning
              striker Didier Drogba put Chelsea in front in the 27th minute but
              Burnley substitute Ade Akinbiyi equalised with 20 minutes remaining.</p>
              <p>Both
              sides ended the game with 10 men after Burnley's Steve Caldwell was
              sent off for a second bookable offence late on, while Franco Di Santo
              was forced off injured with all Chelsea's substitutes already used.</p>
              <p>But
              Jensen sparked scenes of celebration when he saved Obi's sudden-death
              spot-kick to put the second-tier side into the last eight.</p>
              <p>Burnley
              had already beaten Bury, Oldham and Fulham to reach the fourth round
              and brought 6,500 fans to Stamford Bridge in the hope of witnessing
              another upset.</p>
              <p>In the 11th minute Bridge, skipper for the night
              in the absence of substitute John Terry, sent a curling shot just wide
              of the upright.</p>
              <p>Owen Coyle's side, fifth in the Championship
              having lost just four times this season, were coping well with
              Chelsea's attacking ambitions.</p>
              <p>In the 19th minute, Chelsea should
              have opened the scoring when Drogba, making his first start for six
              weeks, put Salomon Kalou clear.</p>
              <p>But the Ivory Coast striker was thwarted by Jensen as Kalou tried to take the ball around the Burnley goalkeeper.</p>
              <p>At
              the opposite end, a mistake by Chelsea keeper Carlo Cudicini almost
              gifted Burnley an opener but Paulo Ferreira was on hand to clear the
              danger.</p>
              <p>An injury to Juliano Belletti forced Chelsea to make an early change and he was replaced by Frank Lampard in the 25th minute.</p>
              <p>England midfielder Lampard made an instant impact as Chelsea went in front in the 27th minute.</p>
              <p>His precision pass to Drogba set the striker on a trademark run into the Burnley penalty area.</p>
              <p>Drogba left Michael Duff on the floor as he swept into the area and curled the ball around the unprotected Jensen.</p>
              <p>Lampard's
              introduction had clearly helped Chelsea to get on top of their game,
              with the England midfielder now at the heart of all their best moves.</p>
              <p>In
              the 38th minute Jensen had to be at his best to keep out a low, angled
              drive from Florent Malouda as Chelsea looked to end Burnley's interest
              in the contest for good.</p>
              <p>The second goal almost arrived in the
              45th minute when Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic headed a free-kick
              from Mineiro against the crossbar.</p>
              <p>In the 55th minute Ivanovic
              put another header over the bar after Kalou and Malouda had combined to
              get the ball into the penalty area.</p>
              <p>Kalou was then thwarted by Jensen when Drogba put his Ivory Coast team-mate through on goal.</p>
              <p>Burnley, sensing that they were still in with a chance, replaced Martin Paterson with Akinbiyi on the hour.</p>
              <p>Drogba,
              the main threat to Burnley in the opening half started to look an
              isolated figure as the Blues settled for containment rather than a
              decisive second goal.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's frustration was underlined by Scolari's next move, which was to replace Drogba with Di Santo in the 68th minute.</p>
              <p>But Chelsea were stunned in the 70th minute.</p>
              <p>Chris
              Eagles burst on to a pass from Robbie Blake and when his shot was saved
              by Cudicini, substitute Akinbiyi pounced to equalise.</p>
              <p>Di Santo missed two gilt-edged chances to restore Chelsea's lead as the game finally petered out into extra-time.</p>
              <p>But
              Chelsea's misery continued when an injury to Di Santo reduced them to
              10 men three minutes into the first period of added time.</p>
              <p>Both
              sides failed to carve out a clear chance in the opening half but
              Akinbiyi brought a fine save from Cudicini with a deft header in the
              111th minute.</p>
              <p>Six minutes from time Chelsea defender Alex scuffed
              a shot over the bar from point-blank range as the game lurched towards
              penalty showdown.</p>
              <p>The numbers were even out moments later when Caldwell was sent off for a second bookable offence after blocking Malouda.</p>
              <p>But that was the last event of note before the game went to penalties and Jensen became Burnley's hero.</p>
              <p><em>LOL@him, chelsea 1st team lost to Burnley!</em></p>

              <p>that's what i'm implying... fielded a full team and can't even beat Burnley... still want to complain that Arsenal is belittling the competition by fielding a young side...</p>
              <p>don't blame on penalties... they should have wrapped it up by half time against an unknown team.</p>
