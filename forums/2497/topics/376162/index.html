              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ARSENE WENGER has jumped to the defence of <strong>Emmanuel Eboue after another cheating row erupted following Arsenal's win over Wigan. Eboue was booked for deliberate handball when he got on the end of a cross midway through the first half in the 4-0 win at the Emirates Stadium, which comes hot on the heels of the Eduardo diving saga from a few weeks ago.</strong></h2>
              <p class="article">Wenger said: "Of course we want to stamp out cheating in the game. It is not necessarily cheating sometimes, it [handball] can be a reflex as well.</p>
              <p class="article">"I do not encourage cheating and we all have to fight against it, but in this particular situation it can be a reflex as well.</p>
              <p class="article">"When the player goes down sometimes it is not always because he wants to cheat. "It can be a foul and he makes a bit more of it, but the personality I feel in England that the personality of the player who does it is more important than the importance of the foul and the cheating.</p>
              <p class="article">"I mean some players get away with things and other don't." This was a symbolic match for Eboue as he was jeered by his own supporters in the fixture last season.</p>
              <p class="article">On this occasion he was cheered off when substituted in the 73rd minute, confirming his cult-hero status. It was a typical performance from the Ivory Coast international as he was productive — he deflected Eduardo's shot in for the third goal — but raised eyebrows with his celebrations.</p>
              <p class="article">Wenger, when asked about the turnaround in the fans' view of Eboue, added: "I believe Eboue did what you have to do in our job, which is to shut up, play and let everyone else talk while he produces quality performances.</p>
              <p class="article">"His is a job for strong people, and you can respond mentally. The supporters are behind him again as he plays well and he plays with the right spirit. "He is sensitive and a bit and an extrovert, but he's a creative player."</p>
              <p class="article">Thomas Vermaelen scored the first two goals — a header from a corner and a delightful curling effort. He now has four goals since arriving from Ajax.</p>
              <p class="article">And Wenger joked: "Let's be honest for once. I thought he could adapt quickly but maybe not as quickly as that!"</p>
              <p class="article">Cesc Fabregas wrapped up the scoring in stoppage time. Wigan boss Roberto Martinez was furious with his side's display. He stormed: "We were very poor in our performance. "That was not our style at all. We did not get anywhere near the Arsenal players in the first half.</p>
              <p class="article">"Our starting position was wrong and there was a lack of belief. We are not normally a defensive side, but we had a slow start and that was the reason for our performance.</p>
              <p class="article">"I cannot not take any positives from the performance — or the lack of it."</p>
