              <p>Nothing wrong with being hardworking and pressuring defenders.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tevez does that often and brilliantly to force defenders to make quick decisions in the hopes that some of the defenders will panic and give away the ball.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do agree that pairing Kuyt and Torres upfront as an out an out striker supporting each other is way better than leaving Torres just by himself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>kuyt may not have technical ability but while the rest are giving up or taking a break, he's still chasing after that ball.</p>
              <p>did you guys forget how he hassled giggs at the goal line and won the ball, then he crossed it for babel to score against man utd?   give that same situation to babel, do u think he will bother going all the way?</p>

              <p>no fan will know exactly what job rafael tells kuyt to do in
              every game.</p>
              <p>but judging by how kuyt plays, he's one i will choose to be on
              the bench and will play him when i'm trying to protect a lead in
              dying mins or will play him when i need more of the ball's
              possession.</p>

              <p>the reason kuyt is on the wing is because he feels that witha hardworking player like kuyt there, the opponent left back wont think bout bombing up front all the time and he can also sorta neutralised the opponent strength there especially if they have good left siders.. its all about mentality, rafa is first and foremost a defensive minded manager, he's mentality is always to not lose, therefore playing kuyt on the right wing is a defensive tactic from him.</p>
              <p>Somehow if benitez was the one who bought Ronaldo when he first came to the premier league, im quite quite sure Ronaldo wouldnt be the man he is today, its all about his mentality with how the game should be played.</p>
