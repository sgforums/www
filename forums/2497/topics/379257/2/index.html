              <p>the problem is that benitez want to micro manage everything</p>
              <p>its like he wants to play fifa 10 or winning eleven, when he presses forward and X, the player must go forward.</p>
              <p>i've read interviews where managers go crazy when players don't do what they are told to do (insane instructions)</p>
              <p>one striker was threatened to be dropped by his manager when he passed the ball square to another striker when the manager told him that he must only knock the ball forward ONLY throughout the whole game.</p>
              <p>which makes me think that the players are not lousy overnight</p>

              <p>that's one solution to solve also</p>
              <p>but i would prefer to get rid of rafael and a few fringe players.</p>
              <p>i think the whole team need some real good restructuring</p>
              <p>since kuyt can raise some good money for now, i would say go ahead</p>
