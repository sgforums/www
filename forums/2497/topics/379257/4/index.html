              <p><br>if i were ah ben, i wouldn't risk starting ayala in BPL matches in this crucial period.. just look at jay spearing.. he gt a horrible debut...n btw LFC wouldn't be able to afford a potent winger like david silva or lavezzi w/o selling players...n players like lennon and swp wouldn't even tink of joining LFC as LFC dun really have a gd record of developing players...in short, there must be some selling before LFC can buy due to its financial position and no external investments..</p>

              <p class="small bold"><em>COLD FISH ... Rafa: Players are tell tale twits... put criticism down to players trying to sell books</em></p>
              <p><br><br> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">RAFA BENITEZ was not impressed when Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres labelled him a cold fish.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Liverpool boss thought something smelled a bit and it might have been to do with his star men having books to sell. Both Gerrard and Torres attacked Benitez's impersonal style in their autobiographies. And one of the big criticisms being aimed at the Spaniard is he refuses to put an arm round players and give his squad encouragement.</p>
              <p class="article">The cold fish, it is said, much prefers to batter them. Gerrard claimed Benitez had never said "well done" to him.</p>
              <p class="article">While Torres told of when team-mates congratulated him on the birth of his daughter, Benitez patted him on the back and remarked: "I was really pleased with the way you attacked the near post for the corners."</p>
              <p class="article">It is a picture of a manager without a human side and nothing to talk about except tactics. Yet, as Liverpool flounder in the Premier League and host Lyon tonight in a big Champions League clash, Benitez insists he has been unfairly portrayed.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "When you repeat a lie a lot of times this happens. "I have conversations with all of the players about positives and negatives and we analyse all of it. Each of them has a DVD.</p>
              <p class="article">"Gerrard wanted to see the negatives and I said the positives but he just wanted the negatives. "We have normal conversations but they have to sell books and you have to write something.</p>
              <p class="article">"I talk with all of them. You cannot be close friends because you have to make decisions but the relationship is not bad.</p>
              <p class="article">"If they do well, I say 'well done'. I say this 100 times. "I was surprised with Fernando saying what I said.</p>
              <p class="article">"It's true I said what I did but I said 'congratulations' about the baby too but you have to sell books."</p>
              <p class="article">Striker Torres is still out with a groin injury but hopes to face Manchester United on Sunday. Gerrard is back, however, after the bizarre defeat to Sunderland.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: "People are saying the game should be replayed but we will not be asking for this. "I said we did not play well because I did not want to use the incident as an excuse. "With the same squad more or less we got 86 points last season. So I think the squad is good.</p>
              <p class="article">"But too many players out of the starting eleven have been injured and this is something that hasn't been easy to manage. "It's just a matter of time before we're playing at our best again."</p>

              <p class="small"><em>COLD FISH ... Rafa: Players are tell tale twits... put criticism down to players trying to sell books</em></p>
              <p><br><br> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">RAFA BENITEZ was not impressed when Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres labelled him a cold fish.</h2>
              <p>The Liverpool boss thought something smelled a bit and it might have been to do with his star men having books to sell. Both Gerrard and Torres attacked Benitez's impersonal style in their autobiographies. And one of the big criticisms being aimed at the Spaniard is he refuses to put an arm round players and give his squad encouragement.</p>
              <p>The cold fish, it is said, much prefers to batter them. Gerrard claimed Benitez had never said "well done" to him.</p>
              <p>While Torres told of when team-mates congratulated him on the birth of his daughter, Benitez patted him on the back and remarked: "I was really pleased with the way you attacked the near post for the corners."</p>
              <p>It is a picture of a manager without a human side and nothing to talk about except tactics. Yet, as Liverpool flounder in the Premier League and host Lyon tonight in a big Champions League clash, Benitez insists he has been unfairly portrayed.</p>
              <p>He said: "When you repeat a lie a lot of times this happens. "I have conversations with all of the players about positives and negatives and we analyse all of it. Each of them has a DVD.</p>
              <p>"Gerrard wanted to see the negatives and I said the positives but he just wanted the negatives. "We have normal conversations but they have to sell books and you have to write something.</p>
              <p>"I talk with all of them. You cannot be close friends because you have to make decisions but the relationship is not bad.</p>
              <p>"If they do well, I say 'well done'. I say this 100 times. "I was surprised with Fernando saying what I said.</p>
              <p>"It's true I said what I did but I said 'congratulations' about the baby too but you have to sell books."</p>
              <p>Striker Torres is still out with a groin injury but hopes to face Manchester United on Sunday. Gerrard is back, however, after the bizarre defeat to Sunderland.</p>
              <p>He added: "People are saying the game should be replayed but we will not be asking for this. "I said we did not play well because I did not want to use the incident as an excuse. "With the same squad more or less we got 86 points last season. So I think the squad is good.</p>
              <p>"But too many players out of the starting eleven have been injured and this is something that hasn't been easy to manage. "It's just a matter of time before we're playing at our best again."</p>

              <p><br>But this will cost Pool $20 million pounds and if they don't qualify for the CL... It could be another $20 to $30 million pounds off their books... Pool can't afford to pay off so much, their profit before repaying their bank loan is about $40m and the loan interest cost something like $30m... So if they don't have the $40 to $50 million, they will be in the Red so to speak financially...</p>
              <p>The only good thing for next season is their shirt sponsorship will start... Exactly $20m, But is it worth to use up the whole year's shirt sponsorship money to sack Rafa?</p>
