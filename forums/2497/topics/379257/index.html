              </div>

              <p><em>Liverpool have no chance of winning the title this season and I fear the club are going backwards unless drastic changes are made.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>I was at Sunderland to see Rafa Benitez’s side slump to their fourth defeat in the Premier League already this term. And at the risk of upsetting Liverpool fans again, I think there must be huge changes at the top of the club immediately to salvage anything from the season.</strong></p>
              <p>Liverpool supporters have been outspoken in their criticism of me after I declared they had only three title-winning players in their side in the shape of Pepe Reina, Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres. But without the latter pair at the weekend, Benitez’s side were appallingly bad at the Stadium of Light.</p>
              <p>I don’t ever remember playing as poorly for Liverpool during my time at the club as their front men did on Saturday at Sunderland. And I take no pleasure writing this as I genuinely would like to see Liverpool win the title this season.</p>
              <p>You can forgive players who are out of form but I can barely recall a strike on target or an opportunity created by Liverpool. The side appeared physically lightweight to me and compared to the likes of Chelsea recently, Liverpool look like skinny boys versus men.</p>
              <p>Liverpool FC’s huge success in the past has always been built on pass and move. Yet their attacking options including Dirk Kuyt, Ryan Babel and Lucas just are not good enough technically to play for Liverpool.</p>
              <p>I don’t just want to slag Liverpool off as I realise there have been accusations of me being a disloyal former player, who is bitter and jealous. But such claims are totally unfair as I genuinely believe the only way the club can move forward is by getting rid of Tom Hicks and George Gillett.</p>
              <p>I am so incensed by the behaviour of the hapless American pair  - they must sell up now. After trying to flog the club on the quiet following their ill-fated takeover, they should have the guts to come out and say they are too small for the job and without any class.</p>
              <p>Crucially they don’t have the money for the job either. And while we are changing the guard at Anfield, boss Benitez should go too.</p>
              <p>As excellent as Rafa was when Liverpool won the Champions League in 2005, he should make way for a winner. And that winner is former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, who is now doing a fine job at Inter Milan.</p>
              <p>Liverpool fans are notoriously loyal and believe Benitez is the heir apparent to Kenny Dalglish, Joe Fagan, Bob Paisley and Bill Shankly. But Rafa is not fit to lace their boots in terms of management ability.</p>
              <p>Liverpool played three centre-halves at Sunderland and teams haven’t been doing that for years. I thought overall Liverpool’s display was the first performance where I can hand on heart see they are going backwards.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Are Liverpool really going backwards? Is it time for Rafa to go? Have your say...</em></p>

              <p>RB actually isnt that great a manager. Did he really won liverpool the UCL trophy? Nope.. it was gerrard that single handedly won liverpool the title. Milan were leading 3-0 and gerrard suddenly ki siao and led liverpool back. It was not benitez, benitez did nothing great at all.</p>
              <p>Seriously speaking, I agree that liverpool is going backwards. Where has all the money gone?? What players did he buy?? Voronin?? Who the hell is that pony tail guy?</p>
              <p>Even though he bought Dirk Kuyt, Kuyt is just an ordinary player, just a hardworking one. He is not a ronaldo, not a giggs or a arshavin. He is just normal kuyt.</p>
              <p>Arsene Wenger once labeled Ryan Babel as the next thierry henry. Benitez bought him, and kept him on the bench. I am sure if it was wenger, Babel would have been a great player by now. Daniel agger is a good player, but benitez refuses to play him even though he is fit. His insistence to play lucas simply destroyed the team. Failure to replace Alonso is also another reason.</p>
              <p>Spending silly money on players like Glen Johnson is also one of his mistakes. $18 million pounds can give you a good RB as well as a good DM. Yet he spend all 18 million on Glen Johnson, which in my opinion is just plain ordinary.</p>
              <p>Also spending another $20million of that Aqualiani guy, is simply stupid!!!! That guy is fragile and not tested in the EPL. Fancy him breaking his legs against Bolton, Blackburn, Chelsea, Birmingham? Its stupid to to replace to alonso with this italian. Aqualiani should be blessed that newcastle are already relegated. Imagine Barton, Butt, Nolan, Smith, Taylor and Taylor, aqua's legs can maybe last him a mere few minutes given that he plays in the most physical position of the squad.</p>
              <p>Yes, it is also true that liverpool is a 2 man team. Gerrard has been carrying the burden of pulling liverpool through matches for many seasons. Torres has shared the blamed now. However, apart from the 2 of them, liverpool consists of just ordinary players.</p>
              <p>As we have seen, against sunderland, the lost of these 2 players is too great. liverpool were just not themselves without gerrard and torres. Benitez should how to spend some serious money on quality players. Spend wisely like professor wenger.</p>
              <p>Also liverpool has no youths. Where are all the youths? I dont see any youths at all!!!</p>
              <p>The only trophy that liverpool can probably win this season is the carling cup, and that is if they can get past the arsenal youngsters in the next round.</p>
              <p>Finally, who the hell in the EPL plays a 3-5-2 nowadays? This formation is suicide!!!! Especially when you are playing lucas as the holding midfielder. If liverpool continues to play this formation, teams like man utd and arsenal would tear them apart easily.</p>

              <p>The <em>Mirror</em> says the Anfield boss read the riot act to his squad after the beach ball incident against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sunderland</span></abbr> on Saturday which drove another stake into his title hopes.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> now face a daunting week which could make or break their season with
              home games against Lyon in the Champions League on Tuesday followed by
              the crunch <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> showdown against arch-rivals <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Benitez put his players through their paces yesterday after refusing to
              blame the Kop fan who threw on the beach ball which caused the freak
              deflected goal or the referee who allowed it.</p>

              <p>i wouldn't blame the kop fan too much.</p>
              <p>sure, his beach ball caused the goal but liverpool had the rest of the game to do something about it.</p>

              <p>RB actually isnt that great a manager. Did he really won liverpool the UCL trophy? Nope.. it was gerrard that single handedly won liverpool the title. Milan were leading 3-0 and gerrard suddenly ki siao and led liverpool back. It was not benitez, benitez did nothing great at all.</p>
              <p>Seriously speaking, I agree that liverpool is going backwards. Where has all the money gone?? What players did he buy?? Voronin?? Who the hell is that pony tail guy?</p>
              <p>Even though he bought Dirk Kuyt, Kuyt is just an ordinary player, just a hardworking one. He is not a ronaldo, not a giggs or a arshavin. He is just normal kuyt.</p>
              <p>Arsene Wenger once labeled Ryan Babel as the next thierry henry. Benitez bought him, and kept him on the bench. I am sure if it was wenger, Babel would have been a great player by now. Daniel agger is a good player, but benitez refuses to play him even though he is fit. His insistence to play lucas simply destroyed the team. Failure to replace Alonso is also another reason.</p>
              <p>Spending silly money on players like Glen Johnson is also one of his mistakes. $18 million pounds can give you a good RB as well as a good DM. Yet he spend all 18 million on Glen Johnson, which in my opinion is just plain ordinary.</p>
              <p>Also spending another $20million of that Aqualiani guy, is simply stupid!!!! That guy is fragile and not tested in the EPL. Fancy him breaking his legs against Bolton, Blackburn, Chelsea, Birmingham? Its stupid to to replace to alonso with this italian. Aqualiani should be blessed that newcastle are already relegated. Imagine Barton, Butt, Nolan, Smith, Taylor and Taylor, aqua's legs can maybe last him a mere few minutes given that he plays in the most physical position of the squad.</p>
              <p>Yes, it is also true that liverpool is a 2 man team. Gerrard has been carrying the burden of pulling liverpool through matches for many seasons. Torres has shared the blamed now. However, apart from the 2 of them, liverpool consists of just ordinary players.</p>
              <p>As we have seen, against sunderland, the lost of these 2 players is too great. liverpool were just not themselves without gerrard and torres. Benitez should how to spend some serious money on quality players. Spend wisely like professor wenger.</p>
              <p>Also liverpool has no youths. Where are all the youths? I dont see any youths at all!!!</p>
              <p>The only trophy that liverpool can probably win this season is the carling cup, and that is if they can get past the arsenal youngsters in the next round.</p>
              <p>Finally, who the hell in the EPL plays a 3-5-2 nowadays? This formation is suicide!!!! Especially when you are playing lucas as the holding midfielder. If liverpool continues to play this formation, teams like man utd and arsenal would tear them apart easily.</p>

              <p><br>hmm.. bt it's nt easy to get rafa out and the americans cannot afford to do tt  as the americans are even too poor to compensate RB...seriously, i really hope that liverpool FC fans around the globe especially in USA can really make some noise on how the two yankees are mis-managing the club.. at least, must drag their reputation into the mud....</p>
