The holding midfielder is not renowned as a potent threat to goal but, on this occasion, he connected beautifully and It left Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho grinning from ear to ear.<br><br>Spurs - who had last beaten Chelsea at home in the league in 1987 came back when Michael Dawson brought Spurs back into the match with a well-placed header, before Lennon capitalised on Robbie Keane's good work with a crisp finish.<br><br>With seven minutes of the half gone, Keane dazzled substitute Khalid Boulahrouz, who came on for Paulo Ferreira, and fired in a great cross into the area that was controlled and then coolly finished by the diminutive Lennon.<br><br>It was fantastic technique from the England star and was just reward for his valiant work. Chelsea began to look more desperate as Spurs grew in confidence and that anxiety resulted in fouls committed. Chelsea were reduced to 10 men when John Terry picked up a second booking over an incident with Pascal Chimbonda<br><br>For the Blues this proved costly when Terry was shown his second yellow and sent off for what seemed like an altercation with Chimbonda.<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42279000/jpg/_42279880_lennon2032.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think the resilience of Man U has yet to be tested fully.  results against big &amp; robust teams like Blackburn &amp; Chelsea is truly the litmus test of their championship credentials.<br><br>Looking at their flip flop performance against Arsenal &amp; Reading (easy picking) and Copenhagen, I still have lingering doubts.  Hopefully they can show themselves against Blackburn and get a win over Chelsea nxt weekend to put some gaps.  Their big away games have yet to come - away to Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham, etc, beginning this weekend to Blackburn - which is a potential banana skin for them.<br><br>Furthermore, once without their first team players, Man U don't really perform which is worrying because Giggs, Scholes, Neville are not young and one cannot expect them to play in every match.  Somewhat, Richardson, Fletcher and O'shea cannot command the midfield.  Carrick don't seem to be the player that Keane used to be....hopefully they sign someone good this Jan.</div>
