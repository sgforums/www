              </p><h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">TOTTENHAM'S senior players have heaped shame on the club 
              by organising a secret Christmas party in Dublin behind the back of manager 
              Harry Redknapp.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Sun can today reveal <strong>SIXTEEN</strong> first-team stars 
              coughed up £2,000 each to party organiser Robbie Keane for the wild night out 
              after Redknapp had allowed them to go on what he believed was a golf trip.</p>
              <p class="article">But the shamed players abused that privilege, with six of them 
              even hiring a private jet to fly there and back.</p>
              <p class="article">They arrived in Dublin last Tuesday and spent the night 
              partying in a bar and a nightclub before flying back the following day.</p>
              <p class="article">The party came just four days before Champions League-chasing 
              Spurs lost 1-0 at home to struggling Wolves and is a major embarrassment to 
              Redknapp, who only last Friday insisted there would be no Christmas party for 
              his players.</p>
              <p class="article">Redknapp, however, said last night the players had told him 
              they were going to Dublin for a golf trip.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "Wednesday was their day off and Robbie told me they 
              were going to Ireland to play golf. I had no problem with that.</p>
              <p class="article">"However, it is widely known that I do not approve of Christmas 
              parties and I've always made it clear players should only drink in moderation.</p>
              <p class="article">"Whatever happened in Ireland, I do not accept it had any 
              effect on the result against Wolves.</p>
              <p class="article">"The squad trained brilliantly on Thursday and Friday and there 
              were other reasons why we lost that match.</p>
              <p class="article">"On Wednesday this week, when we beat Man City 3-0, you could 
              see the true character and talent in this team."</p>

              <p class="article" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The objective? To get the entire Spurs squad to Dublin for a wild Christmas party and back again while maintaining the fiction that it was just a golf trip.</p>
              <p class="article" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Skipper Robbie Keane - the mastermind behind the plan - had been on reconnaissance many times to Ireland's capital city. </p>
              <p class="article" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">It was, after all, his birthplace and he was familiar with the lie of the land. He discreetly collected £2,000 in cash from each player to pay for the celebrations and on Tuesday last week, when training finished at Spurs' Chigwell headquarters, Operation Christmas Knees-up swung into action. </p>
              <p class="article" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Jonathan Woodgate and five team-mates hired a Citation 2 luxury private jet costing £5,200 from AD Aviation and flew out of Stansted executive terminal. And they paid out again for another one from London Aviation to get them back. </p>
              <p class="article" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Meanwhile, the rest of the squad clambered aboard scheduled flights. Sixteen senior players made the trip while four did not, those being Wilson Palacios, Roman Pavlyuchenko, Gareth Bale and Giovani Dos Santos. </p>
              <p class="article" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The 16 met up late on Tuesday afternoon and some started drinking in Gibneys in Malahide which is about 10 miles out of Dublin and one of Keane's favourite haunts. </p>
              <p class="article" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">They then moved on into the city to the Jackson Court Hotel. Attached to the hotel is Copper Face Jacks nightclub, which is open seven nights a week so all entertainment is on tap if required. </p>
              <p class="article" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Reviews of the hotel on the internet observe that it is not the place to stay if you want a good night's sleep because the rooms are over the nightclub which doesn't close until 4am.</p>

              <p class="article" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong>One described the club as "pretty sleazy" while another said the noise from the music was "incredible". Even the hotel describes itself as "lively" and Tottenham's squad were clearly not going to let them down.<span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p class="article" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">They may, however, have let their manager down. Because less than 48 hours after their return to England, Redknapp was publicly explaining just why Spurs players would <strong>NOT</strong>be having any Christmas parties this year. </p>
              <p class="article" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Redknapp declared that footballers' parties were "too much aggro" and pointedly added: "I don't think my players would take the liberty of having one without asking me first." </p>
              <p class="article" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Well, they did have one and they didn't ask. The more you examine Redknapp's views on the subject the easier it is to understand how angry the manager will be at having been deceived. </p>
              <p class="article" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">He continued: "The only advice I have about a Christmas party is don't have one. "I don't see the point because they're nothing but aggravation for everybody. "Everyone's waiting for you to trip up, go out and get drunk or act silly. You don't need that. </p>
              <p class="article" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"It's a long season and at the end of that, if we are successful and achieve something at Tottenham, they can go and have a party. They can go and enjoy their break in the summer. </p>
              <p class="article" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"This is a busy period, a working period. Why should we have Christmas parties? Every year there's aggro at every football club that has one. "If they tell me they're having a Christmas party, I'll tell them they're not having one. "I want to see them enjoy themselves but not at this time of year. They've got nothing to celebrate. "They have to maintain their fitness and be prepared for a tough programme coming up. </p>
              <p class="article" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"One thing they don't need is to get a load of booze down their neck." Now the squad is living in fear of Redknapp's retribution once he finds out all the details of the Dublin trip. </p>
              <p class="article" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">He warned his players earlier in the season that he did not expect to hear any reports of them going out partying. Redknapp was furious when he saw pictures of Peter Crouch and Woodgate in a nightclub after a game at Portsmouth. </p>
              <p class="article" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Even so, as a Spurs insider told SunSport: "The players were determined to have a Christmas party and, being Irish, Robbie thought Dublin would be a great place to have it. "It's amazing they thought they could get away with it."</p>
              <p class="article" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">By coincidence Bolton players were staying in Malahide the same week and a Reebok source said: "One or two of our lads bumped into some of the Tottenham players over in Dublin. </p>
              <p class="article" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"We heard the Spurs lads were heading for a nightclub called Copper Face Jacks. "But they said they were going back to London early the next day. </p>
              <p class="article" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"It caused a fair amount of amusement when we heard that Harry Redknapp had banned them from having a Christmas party - as we thought that they'd already had it."</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p>Robbie Keane's future at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> is in doubt.</p>
              <p>The <em>Daily Mail</em> says Keane's future at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> was thrown into further doubt when manager  <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Harry Redknapp</span></abbr> admitted that he wants Peter Crouch and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Jermain Defoe</span></abbr> to continue their partnership up front.</p>
              <p>Keane is facing an awkward day on Monday too when Redknapp investigates
              his players' secret Christmas party, which was arranged by the Ireland
              striker without the manager's permission.</p>
              <p>When asked if it would be difficult to break up the
              Crouch-Defoe partnership, Redknapp - who favours using two up front not
              three - said: "Of course. They have done really well. The goal when
              they combined against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> in midweek was a classic case of the big'un and the little'un.</p>
              <p>"All the football we played and the fantastic passing movements, then
              we had one ball from Gomes, Crouch gets up for a great header and Defoe
              is feeding off it and it's in the back of the net.</p>
              <p>"That is route-one football at its best. In general we pass the
              ball unbelievably but sometimes that is just as effective. That is what
              you look for in a partnership when you have a giant and a little'un."</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Aston Villa and Celtic are also keen on the 29-year-old Republic of Ireland striker, but Steve Bruce's Black Cats have the ready cash for a deal at around £12million. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Spurs boss Harry Redknapp has long been considering selling Keane but the player's lead role in an unsanctioned Dublin Christmas party has made up his mind. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Keane, who is likely to be stripped of the club captaincy, faces a heavy fine along with all the 16 Spurs players who defied Redknapp's party-ban by organising the jaunt. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Sunderland were close to making a move for Keane last summer but Spurs said no after their bid for West Ham's Carlton Cole fell through. If Keane departs this time, Cole is still top of Tottenham's wanted list. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Keane who re-joined Spurs from Liverpool last January for a basic £12 million fee would command a similar amount. Sunderland could meet that but Villa would have to sell to afford him.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Celtic retain a strong interest but would try and loan the player initially which would not suit Spurs.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy has made it clear that Redknapp must fund new signings with sales this January.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">On the basis Redknapp wants two new forwards, he is also prepared to off load Roman Pavlyuchenko, probably back to Russian club Zenit St Petersburg, to boost his forward line as Spurs seek to kick on from their strong start and secure Champions League football.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Along with Cole the strikers that interest Tottenham are Bordeaux's Marouane Chamakh, Andre-Pierre Gignac of Tolouse, Wigan's Hugo Rodallega and former Portsmouth forward Lomana Lua-Lua now playing in Qatar. </p>
