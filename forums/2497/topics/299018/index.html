The alleged 26-year-old victim is pictured celebrating at a bash in the city bar where she works part-timeÂ—two months before she claimed she was attacked by young United star Jonny Evans. Today we can reveal police officers have taken her back to the Â£395-a-night Great John Street Hotel where the Old Trafford party was held to help her remember details of her alleged ordeal.</strong><br><br>On Thursday night, accompanied by her boyfriend, the girl went into the bedroom where she says she went with the Northern Ireland international before the attack. She also visited the bar where the party took place. A source told us: "She was very upsetÂ—it was very harrowing for her. "But she cannot fully remember what happened when she was in the room or exactly who was in there with her because she was really drunk. The police believed the only way to get a full picture was to take her back to the hotel and refresh her memory.<br><br>"Her visit was made all the more stressful because the hotel was open and obviously plenty of the guests were full of Christmas spirit. "But all the police were in plain clothes so they didn't stand out."<br><br><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/2312_manu_02.jpg"><br><span class="small">Jonny Evans</span><br><br>Detectives are studying CCTV of the party in search of footage of Evans and the girl. Officers are trying to piece together the hours before the alleged attack in a bid to see how the pair were interacting.<br><br>A police source said: "If the couple are caught on camera in romantic clinches then it will help Jonny's case. "Of course any rape allegation will be treated extremely seriously but there are doubts over her story." At first it was thought the camera system at the Great John Street hotel had been turned off at the request of those organising the boozy party. But detectives have discovered recordings which appear to show revellers in full swing.<br><br>The girl told police that the soccer ace attacked her after she went upstairs with him following a dance. It was the woman's boyfriend who raised the alarm at 4.15am, dialling 999. Cops are also investigating allegations that the player was involved in a scuffle with the boyfriend.<br><br>Meanwhile Evans' student girlfriend Kate Wathall, 20, said she was shocked at the claims against him, but insisted he was no sex attacker. "I'm still Jonny's girlfriend and people can draw their own conclusions," she said.<br><br></div>
