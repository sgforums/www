The Liverpool boss has already made initial contact with his old club and is moving quickly to find a solution to his problem position on the left flank. Benitez hopes to rush through a deal Â— following his admission after last weekÂ’s Champions League final defeat to AC Milan his side need a revolution if they are to be genuine Premiership challengers next term. And Valencia, for all their public vows about hanging on to their stars, are keen to cash in to fund their own rebuilding plans.</strong><br><br>Benitez coached Silva, 21, during his days in charge at La Mestalla when the Spanish international was coming through the ranks. After being loaned out as part of his development, Silva returned to Valencia last summer Â— and enjoyed a sparkling campaign in a title bid which only ended with last weekendÂ’s 3-2 loss at home to Villarreal. He also scored in a 1-1 Champions League quarter-final draw at Chelsea last month.<br><br>Silva only signed a new four-year deal 12 months ago but after a sensational season he is not happy with the terms. Valencia are not among the highest payers in Spain and he admitted recently there has been tentative interest in him. He said: Â“We deserve something more than what we have. The truth is, yes, we have received offers from other teams that value us.Â”<br><br>Silva, who hails from Gran Canaria, made such progress on his return to La Mestalla he won his first full cap last November, then featured in SpainÂ’s 1-0 friendly win against England at Old Trafford in February. While Silva has a Â£40m release clause in his contract, he knows the club will have to slash that if they want to cash in on him.<br><br>Chelsea and Tottenham are also keen on landing the rising star Â— but the prospect of joining LiverpoolÂ’s Spanish contingent is sure to prove a big draw card for the player. The way is also clear for him to make a big impact Â— with LiverpoolÂ’s left-side contingent Bolo Zenden, Mark Gonzalez and Harry Kewell all being nudged towards the Anfield exit door.<br></div>
