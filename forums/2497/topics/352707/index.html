              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez and Sir Alex Ferguson were at loggerheads again yesterday after the </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong> manager reacted furiously to taunts about his transfer spending.</strong></p>
              <p>Ferguson reignited his war of words with Benitez by inferring his bitter Anfield rival was a chequebook manager and claiming he had comfortably outspent <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United</span></a> over the past five years.</p>
              <p>On a day when the Champions League draw set up the possibility of a United-Liverpool final, the Old Trafford boss, reflecting on Benitez signing a new deal, said: ‘You’ll see Rafa produce an incredible spending spree — that’s absolutely certain, now the contract is done. They talk of a recession, but there won’t be one at Liverpool. He’s well ahead of us in spending over the last five years and that will continue. You can expect a big spending splurge at Liverpool. That’s his way.</p>

              <p><strong>‘I was amazed at what he was saying about transfer money. I talked to people here and said, “Check that out, I’m sure I’ve not spent that much”. Sure enough, Liverpool have spent £24million more than Manchester United over the last five years.’</strong></p>
              <p>Benitez attacked Ferguson over his influence on match officials and FA chiefs earlier this year and wasted no time renewing hostilities after being told of his latest remarks.</p>
              <p>He said: ‘Maybe some people have better memories than me, but I don’t think so. Just check out the figures. I’ve spent £24m more than him, have I? Check the figures. It does not matter what Ferguson says about money, they have more than us and they can spend more than us.</p>
              <p>‘Maybe if we move into a new stadium, we will be in a better position to compete financially. But in the meantime, we have to manage with what we have got, react to<br>situations quickly and make sure every aspect of every single deal is done to the best of our ability.’</p>
              <p>Ferguson risked further antagonising Benitez by arguing that United have a better record for producing homegrown talent. ‘We’ve signed 18 players in the last five years. Eight of them are young and there’s a balance about doing things correctly. We like to develop our young players, but other clubs may be different. Rafa has a different philosophy from me about producing players, but everyone has a different way of doing things.’</p>
              <p>Ferguson had to contend with Jose Mourinho being backed by Roman Abramovich’s fortune at Stamford Bridge, but saw him off after being powerless to prevent <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span></a> winning successive titles in 2005 and 2006. </p>

              <p><strong>‘We had to address how we could meet their challenge and get back to being No 1. Now it’s Liverpool. But it doesn’t matter where the challenge is coming from, whether it is Liverpool, Chelsea or </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Arsenal</strong></span></a><strong>. We have to look where we’re going. You don’t always succeed and there were people telling me I’d gone and my shelf life was up when we were trying to rebuild the side four years ago.</strong></p>
              <p>‘But you try to be No 1 and that’s what we’ll keep doing.’ Benitez insisted he would remain for all of his five-year agreement, regardless of ownership issues.</p>
              <p>It was thought he had sought assurances he could walk away if new owners took over who were not to his liking, but he said: ‘There is no get-out clause and I am 100 per cent committed to this club. Both owners signed the contract and that was important.’</p>

              <p class="small bold"><em>FERGUSON ... checked the facts</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">ALEX FERGUSON has told Rafa Benitez to get his facts right. The Manchester United boss has been irritated this week after the Liverpool chief claimed Ferguson’s troops top the Premier League because they spend millions more in the transfer market. </h2>
              <p class="article">But Fergie yesterday put him right after getting staff at Old Trafford to do the figures to prove that it is actually Benitez who has spent the most over the past five years. </p>
              <p class="article">Ferguson said: “I talked to some of the people in the sports technology department and said ‘check that out.’ “We worked out that in the last five years Liverpool have spent around £24million more than Manchester United.</p>
              <p class="article">“He is well ahead of us in spending in the last five years. “The most amazing fact about them is that they have used 60 players in the reserves this season.” And Ferguson has predicted Spaniard Benitez will now be let loose to go on a huge spending spree after signing a new five-year contract with Liverpool. </p>
              <p class="article">He said: “You will see Rafa produce an incredible spending spree — that is an absolute certainty now he has signed a new contract. “They talk of a recession but there will not be one at Liverpool. “You can expect a big spending purge at Liverpool, there is no doubt about it. That is his way.” </p>
              <p class="article">The actual figures show Benitez has spent £191.95m and brought in 34 players since becoming Liverpool boss in 2004. Ferguson has spent £172.25m in the same period, while also sticking to his philosophy of developing young players. </p>
              <p class="article">He added: “We have signed 18 players in the last five years. “Eight of them are young players and there is a balance about doing things correctly. “We like to do develop our young players but other clubs are maybe different. </p>
              <p class="article">“Rafa has a different philosophy from me about producing players but that is the great thing about football — everyone has a different way of doing things.” The latest spat follows Liverpool’s 4-1 victory at Old Trafford last Saturday which breathed new life into the title race. </p>
              <p class="article">Benitez said after that game Liverpool were the best team in Europe and United were weak in defence. But despite that he bemoaned an apparent difference in the two clubs’ spending power. </p>
              <p class="article">Benitez said: “I think in modern football today the money makes a massive difference, you could see that in their substitutes. “Tell me the value of these players? You can play in a different way if you have different players, the money is a massive difference.” </p>
              <p class="article">Benitez also infamously ranted in a Press conference about Ferguson’s attitude to referees, an outburst the United boss described as ‘disturbed’. United go to Fulham today with a four-point lead over both Liverpool and Chelsea having played a game less than their two rivals — who were yesterday drawn together in the Champions League quarter-finals. </p>
              <p class="article">And Fergie could yet meet Benitez in the European final in Rome, with the northern giants having been kept apart in the quarter and semi-final draw.</p>
