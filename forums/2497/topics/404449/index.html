              <h1>World Cup 2010 Comment: Six Candidates To Battle It Out For 
              Ballon d'Or Award</h1>
              <h2>Marcus Haydon describes how the final week of the World Cup may 
              well determine the winner of the European Footballer of the Year title.</h2>
              <div id="small_article_image_container"><img src="http://u.goal.com/24900/24900_news.jpg" alt="Ballon d'Or France Football"></div>
              <div><em>Ballon d'Or France Football</em><span id="divAdnetKeyword"><span id="divAdnetKeyword"><span id="divAdnetKeyword"><span id="divAdnetKeyword"><span id="divAdnetKeyword"><em></em></span></span></span></span></span></div>
              </div>
              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"><br>A
               glance back through the past winners of the Ballon d’Or highlights a 
              clear pattern. Whenever a World Cup year comes around, the winner of the
               game’s most celebrated individual award is almost always, somewhat 
              unsurprisingly, a significant figure at that year’s big tournament. <br><br>In
               2006 the Italian captain Fabio Cannavaro was the winner, just months 
              after leading his country to a World Cup triumph. In 2002 it was the 
              Golden Boot winner Ronaldo that collected the award, having scored the 
              winner in that year’s final. While 1998 saw Zinedine Zidane given the 
              award for his sensational performance during that year’s World Cup in 
              France. Lothar Matthaus took it in 1990, Paolo Rossi in 1982 and Johan 
              Cruyff in 1974. The list goes on.<br><br>When this clear connection is 
              combined with the absence of the world’s two most iconic footballers - 
              Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo - in the final stages of this year’s 
              tournament, an intriguingly open contest for the award appears to be 
              being played out as a sub-text to the final stages of the competition in
               South Africa.<br><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Wesley
               Sneijder</strong></span><br><em>Inter &amp; Netherlands</em><br><img src="http://u.goal.com/102800/102827_hp.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="131"><br><br>The huge recruitment drive that followed Florentino 
              Perez’s re-election as Real Madrid president forced Sneijder out of the 
              Santiago Bernabeu last summer. The Spanish giants may well be having 
              second thoughts about that decision though, with Sneijder impressing 
              hugely during Inter’s run to the Champions League title as well as at 
              the World Cup in South Africa.<br><br>Tenacious and inventive, Sneijder 
              broke into the Ajax team at a young age - impressing with his positive 
              attitude and proficient technique. However, the diminutive playmaker 
              really burst onto the scene in 2007 after signing for Real Madrid and 
              then producing some superb displays for Netherlands at Euro 2008. 
              Despite his small size, the midfielder’s robust frame and dogged 
              approach has seen him cope comfortably with more combative opponents.<span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><br><span style="font-size: small;"><br> </span><br>Arjen
               Robben</strong></span><br><em>Bayern Munich &amp; Netherlands</em><br><img src="http://u.goal.com/102900/102971_hp.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="131"><br><br>Another Real Madrid cast-off, Robben has flourished 
              in Germany with Bayern Munich. Like his compatriot Sneijder, Robben 
              performed well in Spain but was forced from the club after the signings 
              of Critiano Ronaldo and Kaka. Blessed with electric acceleration and 
              swift footwork, the winger produced sublime performances at club level 
              to help Bayern to a domestic double and an appearance in the Champions 
              League final.<br><br>Often employed as an ‘inside-out’ winger who cuts 
              inside onto his stronger side to offer a goal threat, Robben has also 
              shown his worth at international level, returning from injury to score 
              against Slovakia and help his team past Brazil. Capable of turning a 
              game on its head in an instant, the flying winger could prove key to 
              Dutch success.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Diego
               Forlan</strong></span><br><em>Atletico Madrid &amp; Uruguay</em><br><img src="http://u.goal.com/102800/102857_hp.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="131"><br><br>There are very few Manchester United fans who would 
              have believed the transformation of the Uruguayan striker. Having taken 
              eight months to claim his first goal in English football, Forlan only 
              lasted two years at Old Trafford before leaving for Spain. However, 
              since moving, the striker has matured into a forward of great quality 
              and intelligence.<br><br>He’s won the Pichichi trophy twice in his six 
              years in Spain and scored the winning goal in last season’s Europa 
              League final to give Atletico Madrid their first European trophy since 
              1962. Wonderfully instinctive and stealthy in and around the penalty 
              area, Forlan has claimed three goals so far at the World Cup and shown 
              his versatility after being deployed in a deeper-lying attacking role.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Bastian Schweinsteiger</strong></span><br><em>Bayern
               Munich &amp; Germany</em><br><img src="http://u.goal.com/99700/99737_hp.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="131"><br><br>Having broken through into Bayern Munich’s 
              first-team at just 18 years old, ‘Schweini’ seemed destined not to 
              fulfill the potential some felt he had. However, after being moved into 
              central midfield last season by Bayern coach Louis van Gaal, Bastian has
               be reborn. His assimilation into the role has been almost seamless and 
              he played a vital role as the German side made it to the Champions 
              League final.<br><br>Joachim Loew recognized the midfielder's progress 
              and has adopted him in a similar role at international level - giving 
              the side balance alongside Sami Khedira. His performances throughout the
               World Cup have been assured and he was outstanding against Argentina on
               Saturday. Or, as the <em>Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung</em> so
               eloquently labeled him: “the epicenter of the German game”.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>David Villa</strong></span><br><em>Barcelona
               &amp; Spain</em><br><img src="http://u.goal.com/102600/102628_hp.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="131"><br><br>Despite the plentiful talent 
              present in the Spanish squad, five goals from David Villa have dragged 
              Vicente del Bosque’s men into the last four. La Furia Roja have 
              struggled badly to ignite the World Cup with their unique fluency, but 
              the Barcelona frontman has been involved in every one of their goals 
              (scoring five and assisting the other one).<br><br>At club level he has 
              earned a move to Barcelona following five years at Valencia in which he 
              has scored in excess of 100 goals. His phenomenal technical ability has 
              allowed him to bag a wide variety of goals and establish the proud 
              Asturian as one of the most feared forwards in the world.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Xavi</strong></span><br><em>Barcelona
               &amp; Spain</em><br><img src="http://u.goal.com/102600/102627_hp.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="131"><br><br>While Matt Lawton of the <em>Daily
               Mail</em> may be blind
               to the merits of Barcelona’s brilliant midfielder, the rest of the 
              world certainly isn’t. The ingenious playmaker personifies the intuitive
               virtues of the Catalan giants, and is also a leader at international 
              level. A natural in possession, every movement, pass and action is 
              undertaken with an innate understanding of others’ positions and 
              intentions. Xavi is the veiled assassin.<br><br>His work for Spain in 
              South Africa has been troubled by the counter measures employed by a 
              number of sides, suffocating the central areas in which he operates. 
              Despite this, his quality remains a beacon in the team’s play, making 
              more passes than anybody else in the tournament. He also helped 
              Barcelona to a second successive title, despite the massive spending of 
              Real Madrid, and will undoubtedly go down as one of the players of his 
              generation.<br></span></p>
