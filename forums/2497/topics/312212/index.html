              <p><strong>Javier Mascherano is set to be handed a lengthy ban after his demented reaction to being sent of during Liverpool's 3-0 defeat to Manchester United.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Already facing a one-match ban following his dismissal, the Argentine is likely to face severe sanction from the FA after he refused to accept Steve Bennett's decision and leave the pitch.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In scenes as ugly as those at White Hart Lane on Wednesday when Ashley Cole refused to turn around and face referee Mike Riley, it required the personal intervention of manager Rafa Benitez before Mascherano was finally placated. Even then, he had to accompanied by Liverpool's physio and substitute Peter Crouch as he continued to remonstrate with Bennett.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00457/page_50_-_mascheran_457506a.jpg"><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00457/page_50_-_mascheran_457506a.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="168"></a> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>In a week in which the harassment of referees has been a hot topic, Mascherano's reaction could not have been worse timed. A charge of FA improper conduct is bound to be levelled at the midfielder with a lengthy ban seemingly inevitable.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While<span style="color: #000000;"> Benitez</span> has continued to defend his player, Sir Alex Ferguson had no sympathy.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>"Dissent is dissent," the Manchester United manager maintained. "I don't know why Mascherano came from central midfield to argue with the referee. With all the things that have happened this week with Ashley Cole, there has been a lot of attention on dissent and this was dissent."</p>

              <h1>I don't know why I was sent off - Liverpool star Mascherano confused by Old Trafford red card</h1>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_04/liver2303_468x355.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Surprised: Javier Mascherano is shown the red card by referee Steve Bennett</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Javier Mascherano still has no idea why he was sent off against Manchester United during Liverpool's 3-0 Barclays Premier League defeat at Old Trafford.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While the possibility persists that the Argentinian could yet have to serve more than the mandatory one-match ban - because he failed to leave the pitch immediately after being red-carded - Mascherano remains non-plussed over the initial reason for yesterday's dismissal.</p>
              <p>Referee Steve Bennett had already booked him for a foul when Mascherano sought to make his feelings known to the official after Fernando Torres had also been given a yellow card.</p>
              <p>It was then the referee gave the midfielder his second booking for dissent.</p>
              <p>But Mascherano claimed: "I do not know why I was sent off.</p>
              <p>"I asked the referee what was happening. I did not swear; I was not aggressive and I did not confront him.</p>
              <p>"All I did was ask him what was happening, nothing else."</p>
              <p>Mascherano, who subsequently lost his cool as he made his way off the field, told the Liverpool Echo: "When he showed me the second yellow card and sent me off I could not believe it.</p>
              <p>"I am sorry to my team-mates because that meant we went down to 10 men - and that made things even more difficult for us."</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dumb and even dumber</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>JAVIER MASCHERANO has ignored the furious outcry over his senseless red card against Manchester United by insisting he did nothing wrong.</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">It seemed like the man dubbed the dumbest man on the planet got even dumber as he claimed he was not in ref Steve Bennett’s face. Liverpool’s Argentinian midfielder insisted: “I do not know why I was sent off. I asked the referee what was happening.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">"I did not swear, I was not aggressive and I did not confront him. All I did was ask him what was happening, nothing else. "So when he showed me the second yellow card and sent me off I could not believe it. “I am sorry to my team-mates because that meant we went down to 10 men and that made things even more difficult for us.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Mascherano received his second yellow card for dissent, just four days after the game was in uproar over Ashley Cole’s decision to turn his back on ref Mike Riley. The Argentinian also refused to leave the field in the 3-0 defeat against United — his seventh act of contempt towards the officials — and an FA source confirmed he will almost certainly face a charge of improper conduct.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Because of the Bank Holiday, Bennett’s report will not be studied by disciplinary bosses until today. But it is expected to confirm the sending off was for “consistent dissent”.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <h4>Benitez defended Mascherano</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article">The case will be fast-tracked because of the publicity the incident attracted and Mascherano can expect his automatic one-match ban to be increased to three games. The only bright spot for Liverpool is that his suspension will apply only to domestic games, so he will not be ruled out of the Champions League quarter-final ties with Arsenal next month. But he will miss Sunday’s Merseyside derby at Anfield as well as the Premier League clash with Arsenal on April 5 and the home match against Blackburn eight days later.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Boss Rafa Benitez also defended Mascherano and tried to deflect criticism by suggesting Bennett had not offered star striker Fernando Torres enough protection. Benitez claimed Torres received some rough treatment from Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic, and he took him off with nine minutes to play. He said: “Fernando has some knocks on his ribs and ankle. A lot of knocks and a lot of kicks. I was just trying to protect him. The doctors will do a scan on him.”</p>

              <p>the primarily reason Masc got the card was due to the recent case on cashey cole incident at white heart lane...however i pity him also... just give him a standard  3game ban is more than sufficient enough to send a message across to other players...</p>

              <p>any dissent is instantly dealt with a yellow...</p>
              <p>and to ensure that decisions are made correctly and that there is no call for any dissent, they MUST use the 4th referee and technology... the decision is instant as the 4th ref can be sitting in front of the monitors and instant replay and all that can be called up immediately..</p>
              <p>i think the FA, UEFA and FIFA are all asses seeing their idiocy at stonewalling what is being used effectively in other sports...</p>

              <p><strong>FA TO STUDY MASCHERANO RUMPUS</strong></p>
              <p><strong><img src="http://clientimages.teamtalk.com/08/03/240/Football_Premier_League_Manchester_United_Liv_745623.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180"></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>The Football Association will review television footage of Javier Mascherano's controversial red card at Old Trafford and also study the report of referee Steve Bennett before deciding whether to charge the Liverpool midfielder.</strong></p>
              <p>Argentina international Mascherano was sent off for picking up two cautions during the Barclays Premier League game against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday - the second for dissent towards the match official.</p>
              <p>Bennett's report is understood to make a point of mentioning the time it took an angry Mascherano to leave the pitch. A decision from the FA is expected on Wednesday afternoon, which is likely to result in a charge and could lead to an extended ban for the player.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meanwhile his manager Rafael Benitez wants showdown talks with referees' boss Keith Hackett. The Liverpool boss feels his side have been much-maligned after the incident on Sunday and may well become victims of an FA clean-up campaign - even though Mascherano's dismissal is his club's first of the season.</p>
              <p>Benitez - although accepting Mascherano made a big mistake to argue with the official - fears an example may be made of the Argentinian midfielder. Benitez told liverpoolfc.tv: "I would like to speak to Keith Hackett, because it is important that we find a solution.</p>
              <p>If Mascherano is banned from subsequent games against Arsenal and Blackburn, Liverpool could well demand a personal hearing - which would delay any future ban. Mascherano would be banned from league games only - starting with Sunday's derby against Everton - but would be able to play in both Champions League quarter-final legs against Arsenal.</p>

              <h2>LIVERPOOL FEARFUL AS BENNETT REPORTS MASCHERANO</h2>
              <p><img src="http://clientimages.teamtalk.com/08/03/240/Javier_Mascherano_off_OT_747019.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180"></p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Referee Steve Bennett has reported Liverpool midfielder Javier Mascherano for failing to leave the pitch following his dismissal against Manchester United.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although the Argentine has continued to protest that he did nothing wrong, The Daily Mirror claims that 'Bennett has told the FA in his official match report that the South American refused to leave the pitch after being sent off.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He is understood to have said that Mascherano only eventually made his way to the tunnel because he was led off by his team-mates, a clear breach of the regulations demanding that players leave the field immediately.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bennett's complaint clears the way for the FA to charge Mascherano with misconduct and increase his suspension to three matches. However, according to The Times, Liverpool remain fearful that the FA will make 'an example' of Mascherano and will claim that 'the reaction' to his red card 'has been excessive.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'The club will point out that he left the field within 30 seconds of being shown the red card, even though it took the intervention at pitchside of Rafael Benítez, the Liverpool manager, before he headed for the dressing-room,' the newspaper reports.</p>
