              <p><strong>Hodgson has already had a conversation with FA chairman David Bernstein after West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace gave the go-ahead for talks with Albion's 64-year-old manager.</strong></p>
              <p>No approach has been made to Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp, who had been viewed as the favourite to succeed Fabio Capello.</p>
              <p>Bernstein said: "I'm grateful to Jeremy and all at West Bromwich Albion for their co-operation in allowing us to approach Roy, who I have since spoken with.</p>
              <p>"Roy is the only manager we have approached and we remain on course to make an appointment within the timescale we set-out soon after Fabio Capello's departure.</p>
              <p>"Further conversations will now take place with Roy and my Club England colleagues before any further announcements can be made."</p>
              </div>
              <p>Hodgson has coached the Switzerland and Finland national teams with considerable success in the past. He has also been extraordinarily successful on limited resources at West Brom, for whom he signed an 18-month contract last February after a disappointing spell at Liverpool.</p>
              <p>He also ticks the boxes for the FA because he is very much committed to their coaching project involving the new centre at Burton. </p>
              <p>Hodgson has a vast and up-to-date knowledge of European football, having been a UEFA spy for the last 16 years. </p>
              <p>He has been to every European Championships since 1996, compiled dossiers on all the top countries and has previously declared: “I enjoy international football because you are working with the best players.</p>
              <p>“I’m a great admirer of the England team.</p>
              <p>“It’s the most important English football job in the country.</p>
              <p>Hodgson, who has also managed Switzerland, the UAE and Finland, was quickly congratulated by Redknapp. </p>
              <p>The Tottenham manager said: “Good luck to Roy. I can see my future at Tottenham and I would like to stay. But that is down to the chairman.”</p>
              <p>West Brom said in a statement: "The club are currently in negotiations with Roy about a new contract - his current deal ends on June 30 - and remain very keen to bring these talks to a successful conclusion.</p>
              <p>"However, Roy has expressed a desire to explore this opportunity and, accordingly, the club have granted him permission to speak to the FA."</p>
              <p>Peace added: "Roy has done a fantastic job over the past 15 months and the fact the FA want to discuss the England role with him is testament to that.</p>
              <p>"Roy is a proud Englishman and we can understand why he wants to speak to the FA about this highly-prestigious managerial position.</p>
              <p>"However, we have emphasised to Roy how much we would like him to remain as our head coach and continue his major contribution to our project at the Hawthorns as we look to establish ourselves as a Premier League club.</p>
              <p>"Everyone here has an excellent working relationship with him and he is immensely popular with our supporters."</p>
