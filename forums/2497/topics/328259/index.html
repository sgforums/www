              <p class="first"><strong>Manchester City owner Thaksin Shinawatra has offered to resign from
              the club's board, executive chairman Garry Cook has revealed.</strong></p>
              <p>The former Thai prime minister flew to Britain last week instead of returning to his homeland to face court charges.</p>
              <p>The Premier League has been monitoring the situation.</p>
              <p>Cook said: "Dr Thaksin is embarrassed about the indignity brought on
              all the entities - the club, the Premier League - he never intended
              this."
              </p>
              <p>He added: "Dr Thaksin has been really open about this.</p>
              <p>"He has said to me, 'if you need me to resign from the football
              club as a director, because it would serve the needs of the Premier
              League, then I'm fine with that as long as that doesn't change any
              other thing.'"</p>
              <p>It is not clear what the board's exact response to Shinawatra's offer was.</p>
              <p>Cook said Thaksin will not be present at Eastlands when City host West Ham on Sunday because of fears for his safety.</p>
              <p>"He wants to be at this ground on Sunday but he is hearing advice about being in a public space," Cook added.</p>
              <p>The Premier League has indicated it may ask Thaksin to take its 'fit and proper person test' to see if he can own a club.</p>
              <p>"I think there is a very loose term about what is 'fit and proper'," said Cook.</p>
              <p>"It is almost a tongue-in-cheek term that you would use for Premier
              League football over the last 10 years. There are plenty of unfit and
              improper individuals."</p>
              <p>Cook also admitted Thaksin does have financial constraints -
              his assets have been frozen in Thailand - but denied it will be a major
              problem for City.</p>
              <p>"Dr Thaksin is in a political situation and a case that affects
              his assets, so that's well documented. So that's a hurdle," Cook said.</p>
              <p>"The truth of it is this club is not going to go out of business. This club is not bankrupt. We're moving forward."</p>
              <p>City manager Mark Hughes, who had dinner with Shinawatra this week, is pleased with the club's progress in the transfer market.</p>
              <p>The latest arrival, Belgium's 22-year-old midfielder Vincent
              Kompany, could make his debut against the Hammers after signing a
              four-year deal following his move from Hamburg for a reported £6m.</p>
              <p>His signing follows the capture of Brazil striker Jo in the close season for £18m.</p>
              <p>"We keep on telling everyone there is not a financial situation here and no constraints," said Hughes.</p>
              <p>"Some people are putting out a lot of negativity about the
              club. That will change once we start winning games. People will then
              concentrate on football, which is the most important thing."</p>

              <p>It's indeed a surprise that he is embarassed over his lack of morals. For a man who has an insatiable greed for wealth, he seem to accept corruption as a way of life back in Thailand. Now, he lives in a society with higher moral and ethical standards, he is embarassed over his past.</p>
              <p>Now, Manchester City is stucked with a 'poor' owner with less resources compared to other Premier League clubs, Manchester City is struggling for survival even before the season has started.</p>
              <p>For the benefit of Man City Club and fans, he should sell the club.</p>
              <p>Greed is not immoral... insatiable greed is not immoral.. corruption is only acceptable in Thailand, not in cultured society in UK.</p>
