              <p>The American businessman and co-owner George Gillett are ready to listen to offers for the Reds after appointing new chairman Martin Broughton to help find buyers. </p>
              <p>But when announcing plans to sell, Hicks also indicated that he believed the club have tripled in value under his control to an asking price of effectively £800million. </p>
              <p>This suggested the Texan will not be willing to accept a cut-price, quick conclusion to his turbulent time at Anfield, which began in February 2007, and he has now reinforced that fact. </p>
              <p>"From discussions we've had over the last two years, there are plenty of those people [potential investors in Liverpool] out there," Hicks said in <em>The Times</em>. "We've owned it three years. We won't own it for five. </p>
              <p>"I can still be a fan. But I've paid a terrible price. I'm 64 years old. I don't want that any more. </p>

              <p>Liverpool
               may remain under its American ownership for two more years, according 
              to one half of the unpopular duo who own the club.</p>
              <p>Co-owner 
              Tom Hicks has revealed there are several interest parties looking into 
              purchasing the Anfield outfit. However offers have not been forthcoming.</p>
              <p>Hicks
               bought the club along with George Gillet in 2007 but the pair have 
              endured a frosty relationship ever since, forcing 64-year-old Hicks to 
              consider his future on Merseyside.</p>

              <p>In interviews Hicks has admitted his regret at paying what he did for
               Liverpool, a 'terrible price' for something that is no longer part of 
              his life.</p>
              <p>Fans, too, have let their opinion be known, 
              regularly calling for the Americans' departure.</p>
              <p>Hicks said: 'From 
              discussions we've had over the last two years, there
              are plenty of those people (to invest in Liverpool) out there.</p>

              <p>Hicks' relationship with the club's 
              followers was plunged further into crisis last year when his son, Tom 
              Jnr, sent an explicit email to a fan.</p>
