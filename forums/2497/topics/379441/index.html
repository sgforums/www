              <p><strong>LIVERPOOL - Liverpool's hopes of progressing to the knockout stages of the Champions League suffered a serious blow after Cesar Delgado hit a stoppage-time winner to hand Olympique Lyon a 2-1 victory on Tuesday.</strong></p>
              <p>The five-times European champions had overcome the loss of captain Steven Gerrard, who lasted 24 minutes in his comeback game before limping off injured, to take a 41st minute lead through Yossi Benayoun.</p>
              <p>But Lyon substitute Maxime Gonalons headed a 72nd minute equaliser before Delgado's late winner stunned Rafa Benitez's side.</p>
              <p>"It was a deserved victory, we deserved what we got," Lyon coach Claude Puel told reporters.</p>
              <p>"There's still lots of work to do though. Obviously Liverpool are going to come to our place to win because they have got to win.</p>
              <p>"But we're going to savour the moment.</p>
              <p>"Liverpool were strong to start with and put us under a lot of pressure, but we managed to remain calm and strong at the back."</p>
              <p>Liverpool are in danger of dropping into the Europa League after falling three-points behind second-placed Fiorentina in Group E. <br><br>Lyon have a maximum nine points with Fiorentina on six, Liverpool three and Debrecen yet to register a point after three games.</p>

              <div class="newsubmit"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Liverpool</span></span> boss Rafael Benitez has admitted that the injury to captain <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Steven Gerrard</span></span> in Tuesday’s Champions League match against Lyon was just bad luck.</abbr></div>
              <div class="content">
              <p>Gerrard was in doubt leading into the match after missing the league fixture at <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Sunderland</span></span> on Saturday with a groin problem but Benitez decided to give him a start.</abbr></p>
              <p>However, the inclusion backfired when Gerrard had to be substituted in the 25th minute and although the Reds went ahead 16 minutes later, eventually lost the match 2-1 to the French outfit.</p>
              <p>Benitez stands by his decision, saying Gerrard’s injury was just bad luck.</p>
              <p>"It was not a gamble to play Gerrard. He wanted to play and had trained normally for two games,” the Spaniard said.</p>
              <p>"He was given the all-clear by the doctor, and what happened was just bad luck. He felt something wrong in his groin, and it was wise to come off."</p>
              <p>Benitez did say, however, that injury problems were the main factor for the loss at the end of the day.</p>
              <p>"We just had too many problems before and during the game,” he added.</p>
              <p>“Losing Glen Johnson before the match, and then Gerrard and Martin Kelly during the match, was just too much to contend with.”</p>

              <p>Former <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Liverpool</span></span> captain Graeme Souness has blasted current manager Rafael Benitez for poor recruiting in recent years.</abbr></p>
              <p>The Reds went down to French club Lyon 2-1 in the Champions League on Tuesday night, their second straight loss in that competition and Souness believes that the Spaniard has not signed enough good players during his tenure at Anfield.</p>
              <p>"It's no good turning round and saying there wasn't enough money in the summer. What about the previous years?” Souness said.</p>
              <p>"If you have been there for five years you have had the chance to build your own club. It's no good pointing to being without your best two players,” referring to <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Steven Gerrard</span></span> (substituted due to injury) and <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Fernando Torres</span></span>.</abbr></abbr></p>
              <p>"There was no spark. It just wasn't there. It was plod, plod, plod. Without <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Steven Gerrard</span></span> and <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Fernando Torres</span></span> there was no imagination.</abbr></abbr></p>
              <p>"You want your strongest team whenever you are playing a big game but he 's not had his strongest team tonight.</p>
              <p>"The criticism aimed at Rafa would be that he had signed 67 players and if you are missing two or three you don't look anything like a team that can win big games in the Champions League or the other <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Premier League</span></span> contenders."</abbr></p>

              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez was reeling from L</strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>iverpool's</strong></span> <strong>worst run of results in 22 years and another injury setback for Steven Gerrard after a Champions League calamity at Anfield.</strong></p>
              <p>Liverpool are facing elimination at the group stage after an injury-time winner from Lyon substitute Cesar Delgado left them floundering behind the French side and Fiorentina.</p>
              <p>Arsenal also conceded a goal in added time as they drew 1-1 with AZ Alkmaar in Holland.</p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>Benitez's gamble over Gerrard's fitness backfired and he was booed by Liverpool fans after substituting in-form Yossi Benayoun, who put Liverpool ahead in the 2-1 defeat.</strong> </p>
              <p>Liverpool have now lost four games in a row for the first time since 1987 and defeat against <span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United</span> on Sunday would further inflame the supporters' anger.</p>
              <p>But Benitez adopted a defiant stance as he brushed aside suggestions the pressure might be mounting and said: 'My appetite for the job is as strong as ever.'</p>
              <div>
              <p>Gerrard had been declared ready to return 24 hours earlier after missing Saturday's defeat at <span style="color: #003580;">Sunderland</span> with a groin strain, but he cut a sorry figure as he made his way off, head bowed, after barely 25 minutes.</p>
              </div>
              <p>It was clear the England midfielder's troublesome groin was restricting his movement once more and a packed Anfield was reduced to stunned silence as he gave way to Fabio Aurelio.</p>
              <p>Benitez faces an anxious wait while Gerrard's bleak prospects of facing United on Sunday are assessed but he had other things on his mind as he reflected on a defeat that leaves them having to win all three remaining Group E games to be sure of going through.</p>
              <p>He said: 'I don't think it was a risk with Gerrard because he wanted to play and the doctor gave him the all-clear. He had been training for two days but sometimes luck can go against you. He just felt something and knew he had to come off. We will know more tomorrow about Stevie and Glen Johnson, who injured a groin in training.</p>
              <p>'There have just been too many problems, before the game and during it, and I am really disappointed with the outcome.</p>
              <p>'It was a difficult game with all our problems, and we had done well to be leading at the break. Then we had two or three chances soon after the interval.</p>

              <p><strong>'Had we scored, it would have changed everything. But we have to lift ourselves for the United game on Sunday, we have to push on.</strong></p>
              <p>'Who will lift me? My staff will help me and I am sure the players will be there for me as well, as will everyone else who wants to see Liverpool win. I know the fans did not want to see Yossi go off, but I knew he was tired and that we needed fresh legs. I can understand it, though. They like him and wanted him on the pitch.</p>
              <p>'All I am concerned about is preparing for the next game and I will start that as soon as I finish this press conference.'</p>
              <p>Liverpool have been written off by many in the Premier League title chase and are now in dire straits in Europe, six points behind Lyon and three behind Fiorentina, who beat Debrecen 4-3 in Hungary.</p>

              <p><strong>Jamie Carragher put on a brave face and claimed Sunday's Anfield showdown with United could be the perfect opportunity for lifting morale.</strong></p>
              <p>'It's a massive disappointment, losing like that, a bad result which leaves us a lot to do,' he said.</p>
              <p>'We're going through a tough patch but we've had those before, and I am sure we will come through this one.</p>
              <p>'We have great fight and character. We had a lot of young lads tonight and if we could have hung on for a draw, it would have been a good result.</p>
              <p>'It's always a great game against United. They are a top side, and that could be just the game we need.'</p>

              <p>Actually I watched the first half and found Pool played rather well leh... They became better after Gerrard went out on the 24th mins and small ben scored and took them into the half with a 1 - 0 lead...</p>
              <p>In the first half, the Lyon keeper had to make a few great saves and Reina only had like one serious point blank save to make and it even came from his own player, don't know was it Carragher or Insua trying to give Lyon a 9th min lead.</p>
              <p>Lyon had to put up with the first 20 mins of Pool's pressure... and when small ben scored, i thought the match was over as Pool looked in control going into the break... I didn't expect Lyon to be able to come back and win this though...</p>
              <p>Pool are in quite deep trouble in the CL now...</p>
