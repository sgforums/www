              <h1 class="title">Man United Chasing “The New Ronaldinho" – Liverpool, Inter and Real Also Interested - See Him In Action</h1>
              <p><span class="taxonomy"> </span></p>
              <p></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3c73ff; text-decoration: underline;">Manchester United</span> are understood to be in talks with Brazilian club Grêmio concerning the transfer of Douglas Costa, their much sought after <span style="color: #3c73ff; text-decoration: underline;">teenage</span> midfield player, as Sir Alex Ferguson looks to replace <span style="color: #3c73ff; text-decoration: underline;">Real Madrid</span>-bound Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>Costa, who is commonly known simply as Douglas, is a left-footed
              attacking midfield player and free-kick specialist. In Brazil he is
              being hailed as "the new Ronaldinho" after earning rave reviews in his
              first full season with the Grêmio senior squad.</p>
              <p>United have been monitoring his progress for about two years; but
              following outstanding performances in the junior Copa Santiago
              tournament in January 2008, several other leading European clubs,
              including <span style="color: #3c73ff; text-decoration: underline;">Liverpool</span>, <span style="color: #3c73ff; text-decoration: underline;">Inter</span> Milan and Real Madrid began to show an interest.</p>
              <p>Grêmio responded by giving him a contract until February 2013, with
              a release clause estimated to be worth £13.5 million. However, Ferguson
              remains confident of signing the player this summer and adding him to
              the growing roster of Brazilian stars at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Douglas’s agent Cesar Bottega, however, was more circumspect
              yesterday when speaking about the negotiations: "There have been some
              informal conversations [but] I don’t believe they can reach those
              values. Right now, an offer might come in at a maximum of £6.7million.
              But this would not be enough for [Grêmio] president Duda Kroeff. At the
              end of the Brasileirão [Brazil’s equivalent of the Premier League which
              ends in December], Douglas will be worth at least twice what he’s worth
              now.”</p>
              <p>Ferguson is also hoping to complete the transfer of Antonio <span style="color: #3c73ff; text-decoration: underline;">Valencia</span>, the <span style="color: #3c73ff; text-decoration: underline;">Wigan Athletic</span> and Ecuador winger, before United head off to Asia for a series of pre-season friendlies in the middle of July.</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> are continuing talks with Gremio over teenage starlet Douglas Costa.</p>
              <p><em>The Times</em> says <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr>,
              the United manager, wants to take Douglas on a three-week trial this
              summer before deciding whether to make an offer for the 18-year-old,
              but that request was rejected by Duda Kroeff, the Grêmio president, who
              has told the Barclays Premier League champions to make a straight cash
              bid or end their interest.</p>
              <p>Douglas is understood to have a release clause of about £21
              million in his contract, which has four years left to run, but United
              are prepared to pay only about a third of that figure.</p>
              <p>“I received a phone call from someone working for Manchester
              United,” Kroeff said. “He asked for Douglas to be released [for a
              trial] and said that he would not play, but that they wanted to see him
              in action. I said to them that this will not happen.</p>
              <p>“Douglas is not at a stage where he would go through such a
              situation. He is an established player, he is not a stranger. He has no
              need to face tests at European clubs.”</p>
