              <h1>Newcastle United Set For Take Over By Singapore Consortium - Report</h1>
              <h2>A group from the Far East are lining up a purchase of the Magpies, according to local press.</h2>
              <p>Newcastle United were put up for sale by beleaguered owner Mike Ashley in the wake of their ignominious relegation from the Premier League for £100 million, and it now looks as though a potential buyer has been found. <br><br>Singapore-based organisation The Profitable Group have been linked with the purchase of the club by <em>The Newcastle Evening Chronicle</em>, in what could well be a very popular development with supporters.<br><br>The
              group are rumoured to have a strong Geordie connection, and have former
              Liverpool, Everton and Aston Villa midfielder Steve McMahon on board as
              Group Commercial Director.<br><br>They also apparently have plans to
              turn the club into a trust, giving the fans a greater say in club
              affairs, along the lines of the way in which Barcelona are run. There
              is also a reported intention to appoint Alan Shearer as manager, back
              him with funds and appoint a footballing figure to the board, in order
              to avoid the kind of high-profile errors made by Ashley during his
              torrid tenure with the club.<br><br>"Yes we are interested in buying Newcastle United - and we’re putting together a plan," a Profitable Group spokesman told <em>The Chronicle</em>.</p>
              <p>"We have spoken with Mike Ashley and Derek Llambias and we are hoping that we can reveal a lot more in the next few days.</p>
              <p>"We
              have people within the company who have strong Geordie roots that
              stretch more than 40 years. And there are people here who have a love
              for the club - we think that is vital for Newcastle at the moment. </p>
              <p>"The
              plan we have in mind is to get the club on a sound financial footing
              first and foremost. Then we aim to turn the club into a trust. It will
              be very similar to the Barcelona model where fans have a major say on
              what happens at the club.</p>
              <p>"Without any question we see Alan Shearer as the man to manage
              the team. Yes, we have Steve McMahon on board but he is not looking
              into management. He is though a football man and understands the game
              inside out.</p>
              <p>"There is also scope to look at increasing the capacity [of St James' Park] to 60,000 which is being explored."</p>
              <p>It
              is certainly a huge challenge to restore the club to greatness, and one
              that former chairman Sir John Hall thinks would be beyond the financial
              reach of many local entrepreneurs.</p>
              <p>"It's not an easy league to
              get out of these days. It's a very, very tough league, and I don't know
              how we're going to fare," Hall told <em><span class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;"><span style="color: #0464d1;"><span class="kLink" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #0464d1; color: #0464d1 ! important; font-family: Verdana,Arial; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static; background-color: transparent;">Sky </span><span class="kLink" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #0464d1; color: #0464d1 ! important; font-family: Verdana,Arial; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static; background-color: transparent;">Sports</span></span></span> News</em>.</p>
              <p>"It's
              way beyond the resources of most of the local businessmen whose hearts
              are in their local club. We haven't got the billions to invest or to
              play the game as this foreign investors are coming in."</p>

              <h1>Singapore group refuses comment on Toon takeover report</h1>
              <div id="storyBy"></div>
              <p>SINGAPORE, June 10 (Reuters) - The investment group linked
              to a multi-million pound takeover of English club Newcastle
              United has refused to comment on reports of the bid which would
              turn the Championship (second division) side into a
              Barcelona-style trust.</p>
              <p>"We are aware of the reports but we have no comment at the
              moment," John Gaunt, Chief Executive Officer, Profitable Group,
              told Reuters when contacted at his Singapore headquarters on
              Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The investment group had contacted advisor Seymour Pierce
              to conduct the sale, Britain's Financial Times reported.</p>
              <p>Former Liverpool and England midfielder Steve McMahon is on
              the board of Profitable, which told the Newcastle Evening
              Chronicle that it had spoken to Newcastle United owner Mike
              Ashley and was putting together a plan.</p>
              <p>Ashley officially put the recently relegated club up for
              sale on Monday for 100 million pounds ($160.9 million)
              [ID:nSP490692].</p>
              <p>The Evening Chronicle reported on Tuesday it had seen the
              company's initial blueprint for a takeover and that a source
              had outlined some of the groups plans including:</p>
              <p>* Turning the club into a trust where fans have a major say</p>
              <p>* Increasing St James' Park capacity from 52,000 to 60,000</p>
              <p>* Retaining Alan Shearer as manager</p>
              <p>Profitable Group is the company behind Liverpool's visit to
              Southeast Asia next month. The Premier League giants will play
              games in Bangkok and Singapore during the tour.</p>
              <p>According to its website, the Profitable Group "exists to
              increase the wealth of its clients, its employees and its
              owners, through the provision of strategically selected
              investment opportunities".</p>
              <p>The group says its aim is "to be internationally recognised
              as a premier provider of strategic global investment and a
              responsible and ethical builder of wealth".</p>
              <p>McMahon is not the only soccer connection the investment
              group boasts.</p>
              <p>Former Celtic, Liverpool and Scotland striker Kenny
              Dalglish is listed as UK Operations Advisor while ex-Birmingham
              City player Paul Masefield is listed as a Sponsorship Manager.</p>

              <p>Ashley will not sell at £100m if they are still in the top flight....this is already a cut price...if i got the money, i will also buy it...good investment, they will be up there next season.</p>
