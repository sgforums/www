            <div class='col-md body'><strong>JENS LEHMANN has revealed his mounting frustration at his lack of Arsenal action this year. The German international has played in only five of the GunnersÂ’ last 12 games and is suspended for this SundayÂ’s Carling Cup final clash with Chelsea. And keeper Lehmann, 37, is growing tired of life on the sidelines as he tries to convince Arsene Wenger to give him a new contract.</strong><br><br>Gunners boss Wenger has decided to play back-up keeper Manuel Almunia in the domestic cup competitions this season while Lehmann remains No 1 for the Premiership and Champions League. Asked whether ArsenalÂ’s mounting fixture congestion is taking its toll on the squad, Lehmann replied: Â“I donÂ’t know. Ask the other players. I donÂ’t play twice a week.<br><br>Â“For me the break between games is probably too long but we have this rubbish system in England with all the cup games and you have to go with that.Â” Lehmann played in TuesdayÂ’s 1-0 Champions League defeat away to PSV Eindhoven but will not feature again until the Premiership game against Reading on March 3.<br><br>And Almunia, 29, is determined to make the most of LehmannÂ’s absence against Chelsea on Sunday and in next weekÂ’s FA Cup replay at Blackburn. The Spanish stopper admits: Â“Like everyone, I am happy when I am playing and upset when I am back on the bench.<br><br>Â“I get on fine with Jens. We respect each other and there is no problem between us. But the only person who helps me to improve is the goalkeeping coach Gerry Peyton.Â” With Arsenal refusing to offer Lehmann more than 12 months on his new contract, Wenger has already hinted that Almunia could be his first-choice goalkeeper for next season.<br><br>Almunia added: Â“I am glad to hear that because I know the boss is very happy with my performances. The most important thing for me right now is the Carling Cup final and I am very excited about that. Â“This game is my finest moment in England and am very proud for all the young players and for myself as well.<br><br>Wenger has already said that striker Henry and defender William Gallas will not feature in SundayÂ’s game. And Henry insists: Â“Since IÂ’ve been at Arsenal I never play in the Carling Cup. I think I have only played two games in this competition.<br><br>Â“Whoever has played in all the wins at West Brom, at Everton, at Liverpool and against Spurs in the semi-final deserves to play again in the final. Â“I will be at Cardiff on Sunday to cheer the team and whoever plays I hope it will be a good game for us and that we win the cup for our supporters.<br></div>
