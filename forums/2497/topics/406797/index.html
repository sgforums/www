              <h1>Mark Schwarzer: I want to join Arsenal! New Fulham boss Mark Hughes is ready to swoop for West Ham keeper Robert Green</h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Mark Schwarzer remains determined to quit Fulham for Arsenal despite the appointment of Mark Hughes as manager at Craven Cottage.</p>
              <p>Hughes' appointment on a two-year deal was confirmed by Fulham on Thursday and the former Wales, Blackburn and Manchester City manager will be in the stands to watch his new side take on Portsmouth on Saturday before being officially unveiled on Tuesday.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/29/article-1298754-0A9E25A9000005DC-698_468x286.jpg" alt="Gunning for a move: Schwarzer wants to join Arsenal despite Fulham's appointment of Hughes" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Gunning for a move: Schwarzer wants to join Arsenal despite Fulham's
              appointment of Hughes</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Hughes will earn £2million a year before performance - related 
              bonuses and has been allowed to bring in his coaching team of Mark 
              Bowen, Eddie Niedzwiecki and Kevin Hitchcock.</p>
              <p>Fulham's caretaker manager, Ray Lewington, will stay at the club in a coaching capacity.</p>
              <p>But
               despite the arrival of the new managerial team, Schwarzer, 37, has his 
              heart set on bringing down the curtain down on his career at Arsenal 
              meaning Hughes must decide whether to sanction a deal to sign West Ham keeper Robert Green.</p>
              <p>Fulham have already rejected a £2million offer from Arsenal for Schwarzer who they value at double that amount.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/29/article-1298754-0A9B1DDB000005DC-75_306x423.jpg" alt="Go Green: Fulham have identified the West Ham No 1 as a replacement for Schwarzer" width="306" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Go Green: Fulham have identified the West Ham No 1 as a replacement for Schwarzer</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>A compromise deal is likely to be struck, however, and Hughes must 
              decide whether to use that cash and a slice of his £20m transfer kitty 
              to land Green who is valued in the £6m bracket by West Ham despite his 
              howler for England in the World Cup.</p>
              <p>Hughes must also decide whether to finalise a £2m deal for Aston Villa midfielder Steve Sidwell which has been on the back burner for several weeks as Fulham sought a replacement for Roy Hodgson.</p>
              <p>The
               new Fulham manager has transfer targets of his own, of course, and 
              unsurprisingly the names of Craig Bellamy, Stephen Ireland, and even 
              Roque Santa Cruz feature on his shopping list.</p>
              <p>The trio are all 
              available as City set about trimming their squad to the require figure 
              of 25 for the coming Barclays Premier League campaign.</p>
              <p>But Hughes will face competition from Spurs for Bellamy after <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span> revealed that Harry Redknapp had made a cheeky £4m bid while he would 
              need to take a considerable in his £95,000-a-week wages to move to 
              either side.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p>In addition, the Wales striker has told Roberto Mancini of his desire
               to stay at Eastlands despite clashing with the City manager last 
              season, but it remains to be seen whether he will make the cut.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/29/article-1298754-0332AB62000005DC-233_468x286.jpg" alt="Better together: Mark Hughes may look to sign Manchester City striker Craig Bellamy" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Better together: Mark Hughes may look to sign Manchester City striker Craig Bellamy</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Ireland's relationship with Hughes certainly boosts Fulham's chances 
              but a reported price tag of £10m and interest from bigger clubs are 
              significant stumbling blocks.</p>
              <p>And Santa Cruz's valuation and 
              wage packet means a loan move is Hughes' only realistic chance of a 
              reunion with the Paraguay striker.</p>
              <p>Away from City, Luke Young's 
              decision to back out of a move from Aston Villa to Liverpool over fears 
              of a lack of first team action could encourage Hughes to make a move.</p>
