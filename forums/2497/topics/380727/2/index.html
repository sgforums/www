              <p>well, how would you rate wenger in this case, he has won trophies, but he had had a barren spell. But all in all, he did well for the club.</p>
              <p>He did not spend tons when the club need to save, and got a brand new stadium. He sold when needed, and got maximum from those sales, and on top of that, he established an excellent youth policy and is reaping its reward.</p>

              <p>simple, his track record speaks for itself. 3 league titles and 4 fa cups, plus dunno how many times league runner up, CL runner up and uefa cup runner up, and also league cup runner up, all within 10-12 years timeframe.</p>
              <p>he always bring in youth and reserve players to their squad and look how much arsenal save in transfer fees. he also has a knack of spotting talent like henry was a winger at juventus before coming to arsenal and converted as a striker. altho arsenal has not been winning for 4 years, but they are challenges for league, fa cup and CL in every season.</p>
              <p>what more do you want from a manager like wenger? although his trophies are not much as compared to fergie, but also equally impressive. its a matter of time before he resume winning trophies again.</p>

              <p>yep, but that was in the past, in the last 5 years or so, he has not won anything so accordingly to your theory of managers+trophies, he may be deemed unsuccessful by some.. Mourinho's chants, right?</p>
              <p>To me, he is one of the greats, similiarly to Fergie for revolutionising EPL.</p>

              <p><br> yes. so in other words.. how u define successful managers, is also
              by their history? if one manager has a good past history, and then
              suddenly, he caused the fall of one of the club, will he still be
              considered a good one in your eyes?</p>
              <p>if a manager, who has a knack of managing a club to promotion to
              next level for eg BPL, is he a good and successful manager? lol
              think Roy Keane.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>well, think Scholari, he did well with Brazil, but failed @ Chelsea. To me, Scholari is a good coach with an international team but he is not adept with a club team hence he struggled. Similarly, I think Fergie excelled at MU, but he may not do as well with Scotland as Scholari with Brazil.</p>
              <p>Keano is wet behind the ears, think Southgate or even McClaren. To me, they have the experience of managing a team, but lack the grandmaster touch of propelling the team to greatness like a Fergie, Wenger, or even Mourinho. And that's hurting Hughes at the moment too.</p>
              <p>For me, I feel a successful manager needs to take care of his 1st team, plus the youth, Finances and still be challenging for honours on the major stages like UCL or etc.</p>
              <p>And as such, Wenger, Fergie are the elite masters, while Moyes, Martin ONeil, Harry Rednapp, are a level below.  I think Bruce, are up and coming. </p>

              <p><br>I'd think, even if a club is not challenging for honours, or even mid table team, if the manager is managing the club well enough, producing good enough results, i would say the manager is a good and successful manager. there will only be one winner at the end of the season, and if we go by the theory that managers + trophies = successful, then, other than the Big 4 who have a chance of winning, other managers are not good nor successful.</p>
