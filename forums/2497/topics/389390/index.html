              <p><strong><br></strong><br><strong>The Liverpool beach ball is already behind glass at the National Football Museum. Alongside all those other objects, mementoes and trinkets which recount the fascinating, beautiful and occasionally grimy story of the game in this country, lies the inflatable sphere which was tossed from the away end by a naive young Liverpool supporter at the Stadium of Light on October 17.</strong></p>
              <p>Amazing, isn’t it? Amazing to think that as well as the sections devoted to Sir Tom Finney and the Busby Babes, Maradona’s ‘Hand of God’ shirt and the oldest surviving FA Cup, the object which Darren Bent’s shot cannoned off and then flew into Pepe Reina’s goal has so quickly been enshrined as part of our shared experience. Three months ago and already an historical exhibit.</p>

              <div class="entry-more">
              <p>Amazing, too, to recall that day and consider it in the context of Sunderland’s recent, deflating results; how little Craig Gordon had to do, aside from one fine save from David Ngog, Lorik Cana’s stand-in heroics in defence - “I’ve witnessed an exceptional performance,” Steve Bruce said - and, of course, Bent’s energy and enthusiasm in attack. At least one thing can still be relied upon.</p>
              <p>George Gillett, Liverpool’s co-owner, stated earlier this month that Liverpool were still struggling to come to terms with the beach ball incident and, for a variety of reasons, you can make a case that Sunderland’s season also hinged on that moment. Lee Cattermole’s loss to injury, the (premature?) euphoria which swept around Wearside, the fact that the two clubs still appear locked in a grizzly embrace.</p>
              <p>Ironic that, even then, Bruce and Rafael Benitez were engaged in an undiplomatic spat regarding Kenwyne Jones, with the pair forced apart by Neil Swarbrick, the fourth official, when the striker was felled by a heavy challenge which would later require a trip to hospital. Now, of course, they are squabbling over Jones’ future, and about who spoke to who, about what and when.</p>
              <p>Bruce said. “He has had his head turned by the ludicrous notion he will go on loan.</p>
              <p>“Hopefully, that has been put to bed now and he has to get over it. I’ve tried to be as honest as I can - we want him leading the attack and being the Kenwyne Jones we know he is, but he is not that at the moment and hopefully he can get it back. I’ve only worked with him for a few months and he has wonderful talent and a wonderful idea of the game, but he has to do it repeatedly.</p>
              <p>“We have to make him the Kenwyne we know he can be. Maybe his focus has not been on playing – it was elsewhere on Saturday.</p>
              <p>Nobody should forget the crimes against football which supporters have endured over the last decade; it is down to the players and management to change that. They are aware of it and that helps but, like Bent’s beach ball, optimism presently feels like a relic.</p>
