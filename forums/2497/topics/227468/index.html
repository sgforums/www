            <div class='col-md body'>Les Reed has left Charlton by mutual consent and Alan Pardew has been appointed as his replacement at The Valley.<br><br>Pardew, who was sacked by West Ham earlier this month, has signed a three-and-a-half-year deal and becomes the club's third manager this season.<br><br>Reed was promoted from the role of assistant boss in mid-November when Iain Dowie lost his job with the Addicks' bottom of the Barclays Premiership but has failed to turn their fortunes around during his month at the helm.<br><br>Dowie was appointed as Alan Curbishley's replacement in the summer, with Reed given the job upon the former Crystal Palace boss' departure.<br><br>But the former Football Association technical director managed just one win from his eight games in charge and presided over last week's Carling Cup quarter-final defeat at home to Coca-Cola League Two Wycombe.<br><br>Despite assurances before that game the club had no intention of changing managers before the end of the current campaign, yesterday's 2-0 defeat at Boro proved the final straw.<br><br>Pardew's first match in charge will be Wednesday's London derby with Fulham.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How strange things are with these bosses... a few days ago he was backing him in public, a few days later... he got sack! The very same thing can be said about Alan Pardew too... He had the same experience at West Ham. The new boss came out an said they trusted him and he was the right man for the job, then...<br><br>But at least he got a "golden handshake" and got 1.5m pay off and now he got a new job with a 3 and a half yrs contract. Seems everything went well for Pardew after all.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><span class="large"><strong>Charlton chairman backs boss Reed</strong> </span><br><span style="color: olive;">Thursday, 21 December 2006,<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42376000/jpg/_42376745_reed203.jpg"><br><br>Charlton chairman Richard Murray has given his backing to under-fire manager Les Reed and said the club will provide funds for new signings in January.<br><br>Murray said the signings made by Reed's predecessor may have something to do with the club's current predicament.<br><br>"We spent a lot of money in the summer - Â£11m we didn't have to spend.<br><br>"We backed Iain, they were his signings, but I had never heard of Souleymane Diawara, apparently the best centre-half you've never heard of.<br><br>"For a club like ours to spend Â£3.7m on one player like that is a fortune. Some people must not look at Les, but at what went on before." </span><br><br></div>
