              <p><strong>Barcelona’s management team were sitting uncomfortably on Thursday as Lionel Messi missed training with a knee problem. </strong></p>
              <p>The little Argentinian genius, who has scored 37 goals and created a
              further 16 this season, arrived for Barcelona’s press open day carrying
              a slight limp and sat out of practice as a precaution. </p>
              <p>Spanish media are currently positive that the injury will not rule
              Messi out of the Champions League final against Manchester United, with
              suggestions even emerging that the player’s absence could be early mind

              <p class="article">The thought of the Old Trafford men winning a fourth trophy this season is too much for the Spaniard.</p>

              <p class="article">Reina has been on the winning side against United twice this season and added: “The key was we approached both games with nerve and played a passing game from man to man. That is the way to do most damage.</p>

              <p><strong>Stevie G wants a United Victory</strong></p>
              <p>Speaking to the British press, Steven Gerrard said: "I hope it's a very good game from a neutral point of view."</p>
              <p>"I'll be watching the game and hope there is a lot of entertainment. It's obviously a difficult question. But I've got a lot of good friends who play for Man Utd so I hope they win."</p>
              <p>Liverpool and United share one of the greatest and fiercest rivalries in English football, but it seems Gerrard's affinity for some of his England colleagues such as Wayne Rooney and Rio Ferdinand has led him to back the EPL champions.</p>
              <p>Gerrard's statements came in the wake of his club boss Rafael Benitez saying that he would not congratulate United manager Sir Alex Ferguson for winning the EPL title for the third successive season.</p>

              <h1>Messi's no flop and will prove that against United, says Pique<br></h1>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Defensive rock: Gerard Pique, in action against Chelsea's Didier Drogba, is a key man for Barca</em></p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1186919" rel="1186919|3| nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1186919/Messis-flop-prove-United-says-Pique.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Gerard Pique has warned his former </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> team-mates that Lionel Messi is ready to show England just what he can do in the Champions League final on Wednesday.</strong></p>
              <p>Barcelona defender Pique, who played a major part in United's march to their Champions League triumph last season, has dismissed the criticism that Messi struggles against clubs from England.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <div class="floatRHS">
              <p class="imageCaption">Argentina star Messi has yet to score when confronted by Premier League opposition, having come up against <span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span>, <span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool </span>and Manchester United in recent years.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>However, Pique said: 'It's not a fair criticism. It's true that he hasn't scored but he has played really well. It doesn't matter whether it's an English side or not, we expect him to do well as he's one of the best players in the world.</p>
              <p>'We have confidence in him. Sometimes there's too much pressure, though. He's not a machine and sometimes he can have bad games.'</p>
              <p>Wednesday's final has been billed as the battle of the planet's top two players, with world player of the year Cristiano Ronaldo up against Messi, who finished second in that poll.</p>
              <p>Pique has played with both and said: 'Ronaldo is more complete in that he's good in the air, good at shooting and he's quick and strong. But when Leo's got the ball he can create attacks just by himself, which alone can win you ties.'</p>
              <p>Eidur Gudjohnsen, who played against Messi with Chelsea but has been a Barcelona team-mate for the past three seasons, also dismisses the idea that the Argentinian struggles against English tactics.</p>
              <p>'I don't see anything in it,' he said. 'When we played against United at Old Trafford in the semifinal last year he was absolutely brilliant. 'I don't know where that theory comes from. Maybe he hasn't scored but hopefully he will change that very soon.</p>

              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>World Cup winner Marcel Desailly believes Wayne Rooney has now moved into the group of current world greats. While all the talk has surrounded the personal battle between Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi in Wednesday night's Champions League final in Rome, Rooney's presence has largely been ignored.</strong></p>
              <p>However, it is felt that had voting been taken now, the former Everton star would have been close to landing the PFA player of the year prize, with England set to benefit in next month's World Cup qualifiers against Kazakhstan and Andorra.</p>
              <p>And Desailly, who won the European Cup with AC Milan as well as the World Cup with France, feels Rooney has deserved the accolade of one of the world's best.</p>
              <p>"Rooney is a world class player," said the former Chelsea star.</p>
              <p>"He is among the elite, there is no doubt in my mind about that at all.</p>
              <p>"The only problem is the England national team have not done anything to confirm it."</p>
              <p>Desailly feels Rooney's arrival on the scene as a callow teenager at Euro 2004 has tended to obscure the vast improvements he has made to his game.</p>
              <p>Aside from goalscoring and forceful attacking play, Rooney has also learned the art of defending and it is likely he will be asked to provide assistance to Patrice Evra on the United left as the Premier League champions attempt to subdue Messi.</p>
              <p>"Wayne came into the game such a long time ago," said Desailly.</p>
              <p>"Since then he has shown how good he is, both tactically and technically. "With the goals as well he has shown he is an amazing player. He is top class."</p>
              <p>Yet Desailly does not believe Rooney's contribution will be enough to allow United to become the first side to retain the European Cup since it was rebranded as the Champions League.</p>
              <p>"For the players it would be something special to retain the Champions League," he said. "You have all that pressure to deal with and have been working all year to get there. "If you look at the two teams, they are both full of exceptionally gifted players.</p>
              <p>"But Barcelona have a bit extra. They can hold their shape from the beginning to the end. They are the ones I think will win."</p>

              <p><strong>Barcelona have admitted that Wayne Rooney is the Manchester United player they fear most in tomorrow night's Champions League final in Rome.</strong></p>
              <p>'When he is really focused he is simply unstoppable,' said defender Gerard Pique of his former United team-mate. 'I have never seen a player as powerful as Rooney - the way he goes past people, the intensity of his play, the runs he makes from the first minute to the last and the shot that he has. World class.</p>
              <p>'Perhaps he does not get the credit he deserves because he should score more goals but he offers so much.'</p>
              <p>Pique's words were echoed by Barca midfielder Andres Iniesta who, along with Thierry Henry, now looks certain to start in Rome after an injury scare.</p>
              <p>Iniesta said: 'What I value most about the way United play is how hard players like Rooney work. He was filling in at left back against us last year in the semi-final. We cannot commit any mistakes because they have so much firepower up front.'</p>
              <p>The return to training of Iniesta and Henry has clearly offered the Catalans a huge boost. Midfielder Xavi revealed: 'They both looked very good and very comfortable right from the start of the session. We now have them back with us and if nothing strange happens they will play the final.'</p>
              <p>Barca coach Pep Guardiola's only conundrum looks to be at left back where Mali midfielder Seydou Keita could be picked ahead of veteran defender Sylvinho, despite never having started a match at full back in his career.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Xavi reckons red-hot team-mate Lionel Messi is easily the best player on the planet - and Cristiano Ronaldo gets "burned" in comparison.</strong></p>
              <p>Argentine Messi has scored 37 goals this season to help Barcelona land La Liga and the Copa del Rey. And now he has the chance to prove his pedigree in the Champions League Final against Manchester United tomorrow night.</p>
              <p>"For me Messi is the best footballer in the world, the No.1," said Spaniard Xavi, the Player of the Tournament at Euro 2008. "He is different, there is not another player like him. "You can't compare him with anyone else because they will end up getting burned. He is the best.</p>
              <p>"For me, the things he is showing mean he is the best. With respect to Cristiano and all the rest of the very good footballers there are today in the world of football, Messi is showing everybody he is the No.1. "I haven't seen anything like him on a pitch or in training.</p>
              <p>"To have him with us is fantastic and, truthfully, I wouldn't swap him for anybody." Midfielder Xavi was part of the Barca team which was defeated by a cagey United in the semi-finals last year.</p>
              <p>"There is always revenge in football," said the 29-year-old, who came through the Barca youth ranks. "That game was a great disappointment. It is a different kind of football that works as well.</p>
