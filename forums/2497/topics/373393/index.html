              <div class="content">
              <p>There are reports of a new row between <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> manager <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> and midfielder Michael Carrick.</p>
              <p>The <em>Manchester Evening News</em> says the alleged Carrick fall-out
              surfaced on fans' forums on the web and followed a quote attributed to
              Sir Alex when Carrick was omitted from the 18 on duty for the league
              opener against Birmingham.</p>
              <p>"There's no injury to Michael Carrick. You'll have to ask him why he's out," Ferguson was said to have told a TV station.</p>
              <p>It followed a supposed verbal spat between Carrick and the manager at the Community Shield against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>The 28-year-old has won the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> title in every one of his three seasons as a United player since he moved from Spurs for around £18m in the summer of 2006.</p>
              <p>But the speculation over a bust-up has also sparked talk of a
              return to White Hart Lane for the England midfielder in a swap deal -
              plus £10m for Spurs - that would bring Luka Modric to Old Trafford.</p>

              <p>this is with much prove that fergie said "There’s no injury to Michael Carrick. You’ll have to ask him why he’s
              out,” said Ferguson, before claiming Rio will be out for the next few
              weeks with his thigh injury, Jonny Evans is having a problem with his
              ankle and Nemanja Vidic is still off."</p>

              i meant the quote "But the speculation over a bust-up has also sparked talk of a return to White Hart Lane for the England midfielder in a swap deal - plus Â£10m for Spurs - that would bring Luka Modric to Old Trafford."
              
              it's highly unlikely isn't it? luka modric also just recently brushed off the rumours.

              <p>Carrick, its hard to say lah... He, Anderson all fighting of that one, two spot but now Fletcher (The most improved and hardworking united player in my opinion) has made that one spot for himself liao... So its up to Carrick and Anderson to fight it out lor...</p>

              <h1>Anderson rift reports rubbish - Fergie</h1>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Manchester
              United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has dismissed reports of a rift with
              Anderson and also denied there is an issue with Michael Carrick.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/09/08/330/Anderson_2352487.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>It was claimed earlier this
              week the pair had exchanged angry words after Anderson was left out of
              the side for the Community Shield defeat to Chelsea earlier this month.</p>
              <p>Anderson subsequently missed the opening Premier League game
              against Birmingham and although he was involved at Burnley four days
              later, it was in an unaccustomed wide berth and he was promptly left
              out of last weekend's win at Wigan.</p>
              <p>The Brazilian said earlier this week that he was unhappy at
              being overlooked for the Chelsea game, although he also stated his
              desire to remain with United and prove worthy of a place in Ferguson's
              long-term plans for the club.</p>
              <p>However, the United boss has rejected talk of a row and insists
              Anderson's omission was purely to do with trying to keep a fresh team
              on the pitch during the early part of the season.</p>
              <p>"There is no issue at all," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"What you'll find is they are not playing. When that happens people make an issue of it.</p>
              <p>"But stuff about a dust-up with Anderson is absolute rubbish."</p>
              <p>It seems Ferguson feels the same way about Michael Carrick, who
              has also been strangely overlooked for the same matches as Anderson.</p>
              <p>Again, there had been rumours of problems behind the scenes but
              Ferguson merely puts the England star's absence down to squad rotation.</p>
              <p>"We had Fletcher and Scholes back for Wigan so it was just a matter of freshening it up," he said.</p>
              <p>"We are also trying to push Darron Gibson on as much as we can because the boy has improved at a fantastic rate of knots.</p>
              <p>"There is no reason other than that."</p>
