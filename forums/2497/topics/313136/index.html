              <p><strong>Rob Styles, who awarded the season's daftest penalty at Birmingham on Saturday, has been left off the Barclays Premier League list for this weekend's games.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Hampshire official baffled players on both sides by pointing to the spot when Manchester City's Sun Jihai went shoulder to shoulder with Gary McSheffrey.</p>
              <p>BBC Match Of The Day pundit Mark Lawrenson described the incident as 'the worst penalty decision I have seen in my life'.</p>
              <p>Sun said yesterday: 'I turned around and chased the ball with McSheffrey, and it was in front of me. 'He went for the ball and tried to push me, but I just used my shoulder for a 50-50. When I heard the whistle I thought he was diving maybe, but the referee pointed to the spot.</p>
              <p>'I could not believe it. Even somebody who knows a little bit about football wouldn't think that was a penalty. 'I couldn't do anything about it so I had to walk away, but that decision killed the game off for us.'</p>
              <p>McSheffrey beat Joe Hart with the spot-kick to clinch a 3-1 victory and give Birmingham a huge boost in their relegation battle.</p>
              <p>In the current climate of extra scrutiny of referees, Styles finds himself without a top game in either the Premier League or semi-finals of the FA Cup this weekend.</p>
              <p>It is not the first time this season Styles' decisions have been criticised. After he awarded a penalty to Chelsea at Anfield in August, referees' supremo Keith Hackett apologised to Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez.</p>

              <h2>STYLES `RESTED` AFTER MISTAKES</h2>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Referee Rob Styles has been 'rested' from Premier League action this weekend after a series of bizarre decisions.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Styles appeared to 'even things up' in Birmingham's 3-1 win over Manchester City last weekend, by awarding Birmingham a highly contentious penalty after sending off defender Franck Queudrue earlier in the game.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This was the third game in a row that Styles has pulled such a trick, giving penalties to Nottingham Forest and Watford after dismissing players in their games against Northampton and Stoke respectively.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Styles, who came under immense pressure earlier in the season because of his poor handling of the Chelsea v Liverpool game at Anfield - in which he awarded an extremely soft spot-kick to Florent Malouda - has been left off both the Premier League and Football League lists for the weekend action.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Uriah Rennie will also be putting his feet up after his decision to send off Steve Kabba in Watford's game against Hull was overturned this week.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This suggests that referees chief Keith Hackett is continuing a policy of cracking down on poor performances from his officials. Mike Riley was 'rested' last weekend after his perceived mishandling of the Tottenham v Chelsea game last month, in which he failed to send Ashley Cole off for a late and high challenge on Alan Hutton.</p>

              <p>soon, very few will want to be refs, have to take so much shiet.</p>
              <p>the managers should ask themselves, why are these mistakes getting common.....</p>
              <p>reason very simple. because of their mind game and play acting tactics, imho. </p>
