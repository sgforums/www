              <p><strong>MILAN - UEFA Cup favourites AC Milan were
              knocked out by Werder Bremen on Thursday when Claudio Pizarro's
              second-half double earned the German side a 2-2 draw and sent
              them through to the last 16 on away goals.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Andrea Pirlo put the seven-times European champions ahead at
              the San Siro with a penalty in the 27th minute after Torsten
              Frings had blocked a David Beckham free kick with his arm.</p>
              <p>Brazilian forward Alexandre Pato doubled the lead six
              minutes later, rifling the ball under the bar from outside the
              area at the end of a superb run from just beyond halfway to put
              Milan 3-1 ahead on aggregate.</p>
              <p>The Germans, who were well on top before the opening goal
              and wasted good chances after Pato struck, hit back in the 68th
              minute when Pizarro nodded in a Diego free kick.</p>
              <p>The Peruvian used his head again to dispatch a cross from
              the left 12 minutes from time and send Werder through.</p>
              <p>The early exit will increase speculation that coach Carlo
              Ancelotti is in danger of losing his job, with Milan's Serie A
              title hopes looking slender as they trail leaders Inter by 11
              points.</p>
              <p>"They outplayed us in the first half, when we were fresher,
              and in the second," Ancelotti told reporters.</p>
              <p>"It was continual suffering. We have to accept the way
              things went this evening and not be afraid to say Werder clearly
              deserved it. It's a delicate moment, we have lots of players
              injured.</p>
              <p>"Anyway we are not a team in bits. We have to recover and
              not get depressed in order to hit the target of qualifying for
              the Champions League (next year)."</p>
              <p>Italy full back Gianluca Zambrotta called on his team mates
              to get behind the boss.</p>
              <p>"At the moment we have to be close to the coach and stay
              united to overcome this negative phase of the season together,"
              Zambrotta said.</p>
              <p>"We are all disappointed about the failure to qualify, but
              we tried in every way to go through to the next round.</p>
              <p>"Now we must look ahead and not give up because the
              (domestic) championship is not over, there are still lots of
              games to go and one of our aims is to conquer one of the top
              three positions."</p>
              <p><strong>VILLA &amp; SPURS OUT</strong><br> <br> Former UEFA Cup winners CSKA Moscow took full advantage of an
              under-strength Aston Villa team by easing into the last 16 with a 3-1
              aggregate win.<br> <br> Villa manager Martin O'Neill had made no secret that his season's goal
              was securing a Champions League qualification place in the Premier
              League and fielded just three of the starting side that lost 1-0 to
              Chelsea last weekend.<br> <br> A 1-1 draw in the first leg at Villa Park left all to play for but in
              sub-zero temperatures in the Russian capital, the 2005 winners proved
              too strong in a 2-0 win.<br> <br> Yuri Zhirkov scored from outside the penalty area just past the hour
              mark and the competition's leading scorer Vagner Love took his tally to
              10 with a crisp finish in stoppage time.</p>
              <p>CSKA will play Shakhtar Donetsk
              in the second knockout round after the Ukranians scored a late
              equaliser at White Hart Lane to secure a 1-1 draw on the night and 3-1
              win on aggregate. Giovani netted for the Londoners.</p>
