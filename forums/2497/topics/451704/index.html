              <p><span><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish believes an 'obsession' with the Barclays Premier League appears to be reducing the value of winning cup competitions.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The Reds head into Saturday's FA Cup final against Chelsea looking for their second piece of silverware this season having already lifted the Carling Cup.</span></p>
              <p><span>However, Liverpool's league form has been wildly inconsistent in the current campaign and a fourth home defeat to Fulham on Tuesday night means they have now dropped 30 points at Anfield.</span></p>
              <p><span>Their eighth-place position is well below the standard required by principal owner John Henry - who arrived on Merseyside on Wednesday ahead of Saturday's trip to Wembley - who at the start of the season felt Dalglish's side should have been challenging for a top-four place.</span></p>
              <p><span>But while the Reds boss accepts their league form has not been good enough he does not believe it should devalue their progress in knockout competitions, having ended a six-year wait for silverware.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Any competition you enter you want to do the best you possibly can in,' said the Scot.</span></p>
              <p><span>'In the league it is 38 games and at the end you finish in a position which tells you how successful it has been.</span></p>
              <p><span>'In cup competitions there are obviously not as many games and if you get beaten you are out.</span></p>

              <p><span>'There is an obsession with the Premier League simply because of what it holds for every club and the value financially for every club, the rewards you get for finishing in the top four and getting in the Champions League.</span></p>
              <p><span>'But there is a satisfaction from winning a cup competition which you don't get from finishing fifth or sixth in the league.</span></p>
              <p><span>'We have already tasted a cup final this year, albeit the Carling Cup, and getting to the FA Cup final should never be under-estimated in any way.</span></p>
              <p><span>'It is a fantastic day out for everyone and is great reward for the efforts and commitment of the players and the respect we have paid to the competition.</span></p>
              <p><span>'We think we deserve to be there and we are happy to be there.</span></p>
              <p><span>'We will see what happens. We are in the cup final and there is no guarantee we will win but there is a guarantee we will give everything we have got to try to win.</span></p>
              <p><span>'The season will be assessed when it's finished.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Captain Steven Gerrard has spoken a number of times in the past of having to address their league form and he reiterated that stance.</span></p>
              <p><span>Gerrard insisted winning two trophies in a season - the only two competitions they realistically had a chance of success in as they were well off the Premier League pace even before the campaign kicked off - should be regarded as an achievement.</span></p>
              <p><span>'It is a successful season. This club is all about winning big trophies and the FA Cup certainly comes under that,' said Gerrard.</span></p>
              <p><span>'We will assess the season after the weekend. If we can look back and say we have won two cups we will be happy.</span></p>
              <p><span>'But of course we still have to address the problem of our league position.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Gerrard added: 'Some of the biggest experiences myself and Jamie have had over the years have been winning cups.</span></p>
              <p><span>'They are nights when you are successful you look back on with fond memories.</span></p>
              <p><span>'The FA Cup is special altogether but we got a taste of success winning the Carling Cup and that will help some of the younger players in the squad and everyone really because winning breeds confidence.'</span></p>

              <p>Teams are not created overnight. Time is needed to build a strong foundation.</p>
              <p>Alex Ferguson waited six years before lifting his first trophy(league cup) with Man Utd.</p>
              <p>When big owner took over Chelsea and Man City, sucess is not instantaneous either. The teams took a few season before claiming an 'elite' status in epl.</p>
              <p>Real Madrid spend and spend over the last three seasons, they were inferior against Barc until this season.</p>
              <p>Base on statistic, many consider Alex Ferguson a superior coach than Arsene Wenger. For me, Arsene Wenger's is superior; judging on the style Arsenal plays. Arsenal didn't have the finance. Man Utd has better businessmen running club, marketing them into a global brand.</p>
