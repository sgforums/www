Last month's brawl between China's under-21 team and English club Queens Park Rangers proved that Chinese athletes did not have enough brawn, according to Zhang Xinshi, a biology researcher from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. </strong><br><br>'You can't just say you aren't used to eating beef and drinking milk and leave it at that,' Zhang said during a discussion of Chinese agriculture at this week's meeting of the advisory body CPPCC. 'Our football can't reach a higher level. We are only good at skilful sports. Running for two 45 minute halves on such a large pitch at speeds like 100m, how can (our) bodies do that?<br><br>'We all saw the recent fight in England and they (the players) were beaten to a pulp. 'Sounds tragic? But if you are as strong as a buffalo how can they beat you up? Therefore I don't think we should advocate the Chinese grain-eating tradition.'<br><br>Chinese defender Zheng Tao was taken to hospital with a fractured jaw after the 30-man fight during an ill-tempered friendly at QPR's training ground, which provoked a media storm in China.<br><br>QPR assistant manager Richard Hill was interviewed by police for his part in the fracas but English media reported on Monday that no charges would be brought against him.</div>
