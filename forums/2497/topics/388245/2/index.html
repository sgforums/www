              <p>if rafa is sacked, who is going to replace him?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it easy to sack the manager, but the hard job is, who is replacing him? the next manager needs to bring win the league title in the next 2-3 seasons, never mind 5 seasons. look at the successive managers since 1990 from souness to evans then houllier and now rafa. will it add on the lists after rafa is gone?</p>

              <p>Seriously, as a Liverpool fan, I am not expecting any manager to win the BPL title with the existing players that Ah Ben are using.</p>
              <p>A change of manager is required at the moment to restore some decent reputation of Liverpool football club.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben is destorying Liverpool with his pests and his omitting of certain fit players that he dun like.</p>
              <p>He is putting his ego in front of the club.</p>
              <p>He cannot compare himself to Shankly.</p>
              <p>Shankly would have put his difference aside and use Babel tonight.</p>
              <p>Now, every game to Liverpool is MASSIVE to the players.</p>
              <p>They cannot even pose a serious threat to the goal keeper tonight.</p>

              <p>I think Rick Parry must be glad he left the club last season or he will be made the scapegoat by Rafa again for this season's poor performance...</p>
              <p>I think Rafa is quite smart and he made used of Parry and the 2 owners to make the fans like him more... I mean, if the fans hate someone more, they will like him more too right? Cos they will somehow see him closer to them than the owners they hate...  </p>
              <p>Weird I know, but i think it had worked well for him...</p>

              <p>I guess life comes in a cycle.</p>
              <p>Keane was actually chosen by Ah Ben but Parry was blamed for keane's flop.</p>
              <p>I guess flop mean not playing to Ah Ben's instructions.</p>
              <p>So, after drumming up all the drama last season, Ah Ben got the full control that he wanted.</p>
              <p>His insistence of staying is to prove to his critics that his tactics are working.</p>
              <p>But, the result are a good indication.</p>

              <p>Ah Ben already played some mind games last season when the owners wanted to replace him with Klinsman.</p>
              <p>So, the owner will be quite hesitant to remove this nail in the eye, considering the fans already ousted one of the owner's son.</p>
              <p>Only the fans can pressurised the owners to act.</p>
              <p>But, some of the fans there and here are still holding blind faith to Ah Ben.</p>
              <p>Now, I forsee Ah Ben using critics from ex-Liverpool players to work in his favour.</p>
              <p>But, he dun have much bargaining power at the moment.</p>

              <p>I think Pool and Rafa have been quite unlucky lately... Most of the late goals against them keeps going in and theirs unlike last season where they had a number of late goals to win or draw matches, isn't going in for them at the moment... I lost count of how many already this season alone... In CL Lyon 2x and Fiorentina. Then Reading, now last night latest...</p>
              <p>The only late goal I can recall they got was against Birmingham, the Ngog penalty...</p>

              <p>actually regarding about luck, I would say you make your own luck. you must first work hard, chasing, tackling and never stop running and tracking back to defend and move forward as a team.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Luck would favour a team who never stop running and chasing the game even if it seem to be a lost cause. so in essence, you make your own luck. luck will favour teams that work hard and never give up.</p>

              <p>yes you need hard work, motivation and tireless running to win games. but sometimes working hard is not enough if you face teams like barcelona, who will simply pass and pass and make you run until you tired.</p>

              <p>fine but who is the next manager/coach is also as important as the sacking. if you sack rafa and the next one also turn out to be a dud manager like him, isnt it back to square one after 5-6 seasons later.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you need a manager who is able to win trophies and his track record is not in questioned. I leave it to you to surmise which manager meet this criteria.</p>
