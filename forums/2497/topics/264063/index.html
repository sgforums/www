            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Fulham have made their first signing of the close season, bringing in defender Aaron Hughes in a Â£1million transfer from Aston Villa.</strong><br><br>The versatile Northern Ireland international, who can play either in central defence or at full-back, has agreed a three-year deal with the Cottagers in a move which sees him reunited with former international manager Lawrie Sanchez in the capital.<br><br>The 27-year-old moves to Craven Cottage after two years at Villa which saw him make 50 league starts although he failed to score during his time in the midlands.<br><br>Hughes had joined Villa after spending the first nine years of his career at Newcastle before a Â£1million switch.<br><br>Now, Hughes is looking forward to once again working with the former Wimbledon player and told Fulham's official website: "I'm delighted to be joining Fulham and am looking forward to working with Lawrie Sanchez at club level.<br><br>"I enjoyed my time at Aston Villa but when this opportunity presented itself I had no hesitation in coming to discuss the manager's ambitions for the club, which obviously were of great interest to me.<br><br>"I'm happy to have signed before the start of pre-season, which gives me the opportunity of being with the lads on day one, when we come back to training next week."<br><br>Sanchez welcomed Hughes to the capital and praised his leadership skills.<br><br>"I am delighted that we have been able to bring Aaron to Fulham. As my captain whilst I was manager of Northern Ireland, I saw his obvious leadership skills and his qualities as a player which are widely recognised, so I'm delighted that he becomes my first signing of the summer.<br><br>"He'll bring some much-needed depth to the squad and a level of commitment and tenacity that forms an integral part of my philosophy for next season's campaign."<br><br>Hughes' Villa team-mate, midfielder Steven Davis, is also reportedly close to joining Fulham.</div>
