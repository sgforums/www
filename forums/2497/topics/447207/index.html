              <p class="introduction"><strong>Wayne Rooney says Steven Gerrard should be the next England captain. </strong></p>
              <p>The Manchester United striker, who admits he would like the job himself, used his Twitter account to back Gerrard's claims to replace John Terry.</p>
              <p>"I would love to be England captain," <span style="color: #000000;"><span class="text">he tweeted.</span><span class="external-link-icon"> </span></span><span style="color: #000000;"> "But that's up to [the] new manager. Gerrard is perfect choice." </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The Football Association stripped Terry of the armband while he awaits </span><span style="color: #000000;">trial for alleged racial abuse of Anton Ferdinand</span><span style="color: #000000;"> - a charge he denies. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The captaincy issue has taken a back seat for England following the </span><span style="color: #000000;">resignation of Fabio Capello on Wednesday.</span></p>
              <p>On Italian television, the Italian had criticised the FA's decision to take the armband from Terry before he stands trial.</p>
              <p>That led to a meeting with top FA officials, which ended with Capello tendering his resignation.</p>
              <p>Liverpool skipper Gerrard is one of the favourites to replace Terry, having had previous experience of the job under Capello.</p>
              <p>One of his main rivals for the role, Rio Ferdinand - the brother of QPR defender Anton - has <span style="color: #000000;">said he does not wish</span> to be considered for the post</p>

              Gerrard do has the experience and skill to become the captain. 
              
              But does he have the energy to do so or not? He is in his 30s and from his recent games at Liverpool, it shows that he do get quite tired at final dozen mins of the game.
              
              If they need someone to be the captain immediately, he will be the best choice though.

              <p>My choice is Scott Parker since Rooney is suspended for the first 2 matches.</p>
              <p>He probably can play more games than the rest like Gerrard, Lampard or Barry. And he is in the best of form compare to them.</p>

              <p>The Tottenham midfielder, 31, was picked by caretaker boss Stuart Pearce to lead the Three Lions today.</p>
              <p>He was told at a team meeting this morning after Pearce decided to delay his announcement until after yesterday's Press conference.</p>
              <p>It caps an incredible rise for the former Charlton, Chelsea, Newcastle and West Ham midfielder.</p>
              <p>He made his international debut against Denmark in November 2003 but played just twice between then and last year.</p>
              <p>In 2011, he played seven matches and was a key player under Fabio Capello, who resigned earlier this month.</p>
              <p>His excellent form for the relegated Hammers last season earned him the Football Writers' Footballer of the Year award and a big-money move to Tottenham.</p>

              <p><strong>And on Monday, he was voted England Fans Player of the Year for 2011 ahead of Joe Hart and Ashley Young.</strong></p>
              <p>Speaking after receiving the award, Parker said: "It's a great honour for me. Just looking at the past names that are on it, it's quite an achievement.</p>
              <p>"It's a proud moment for me and I'm really, really happy. Like anything, when the fans appreciate what you are doing, it's extra special.</p>

              <p>He added: "As a youngster, it was my dream to play for England. I'm very proud when I play for my country."</p>
              <p>Caretaker boss Pearce also sang the praises of Parker for winning the trophy.</p>
              <p>Psycho said: "The thing with Scotty, around any training camp, he's popular and bubbly.</p>
              <p>"All the players enjoy his company and that's the impression I get being around him and coaching him.</p>
              <p>"He's infectious in what he does on the football pitch and a real team player.</p>
              <p>"In this day and age in football, where people talk about selfish individuals, I class Scott as a real throw-back to yesteryear when the team comes before Scott Parker.</p>

              <p><strong>"I think that's the biggest compliment I can pay to him. He thoroughly deserves every accolade he gets, that's for sure."</strong></p>
              <p>Speaking about the armband yesterday, Pearce said: "Captaining England was the proudest moment of my career.</p>
              <p>"If I feel that in my heart I can't take the decision lightly.</p>
              <p>"I can only view it as I see it. When you play for your country that is the true pinnacle of anyone's career. That is still the case."</p>

              <p>Striker Michael Owen tweeted: "Congrats to Scott Parker. Great honour."</p>
              <p>Parker's manager at Tottenham Harry Redknapp is the hot favourite to take over as England boss.</p>
              <p>And he said: "Scott has captained the team here a couple of times this year and he is a fantastic boy, a great professional.</p>
              <p>"You couldn't get a better boy. He is a top-class person and a top-class player."</p>

              <p>england is going to crash out of the grp stage.</p>
              <p>If Pearce is appointed as england manager if Harry rejected england's approach, hasnt england learnt from its lessons when it appointed mclaren, who failed to take england to the euro2008 finals. I suppose they wont make its mistake twice, by appointing someone who lacks experience and acumen to take england forward.</p>

              Gerrard is getting old really fast. Lampard better but still 33 already. Terry is also in his 30s.
              
              Time for the younger generation to take over England and achieve new heights.
