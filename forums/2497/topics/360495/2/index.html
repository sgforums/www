              <p>You choose to click on it with your own finger... The clip starts to load even then it may be lagging a little... But you choose to wait during that short moment... Your screen starts to have pictures on it... After 5 sec, your finger can easily stop it but you choose to let it continue and watched at your own free will... </p>
              <p>Now, after finishing the short clip, you want to come and blame others for your own desire to watching it?  lol...  Rather funny right...</p>
              <p>Anyway, there is really nothing to it... I know my reason...  I belief even Liverpool fans might find it funny... The music and the kind of dancing... Its just for laugh only... Why so serious? </p>

              <p>yes, without good players, the manager can win nothing, but as pool showed, they got the best striker, best midfielder, but what they win?</p>
              <p>so what you got the best crew, without a good captain, can ur ship go anywhere?</p>
              <p>He was right not to congratulate? BS la. Common courtesy la. No one ask him to bow, but just a "well-done". Is that so beneath him?  This show his petty, and narrow-mindness. </p>

              <p><br>I believe you are greatly mistaken here... It is not the United fans who expect or want or even need any congratulatory message from Rafa or Liverpool...</p>
              <p>It is the Press and the Tv media who are more interested given their high profile spat through the used of them... It was the reporters who asked him...</p>
              <p>What Rafa choose to do or say its totally up to him, its just a reflection of himself but unfortunately he being the Liverpool manager at that point of time, it will somehow  come across as his club's bitterness over it as well... So maybe its unfair to the Pool fans that he acted the way he did... Last year Avram Grant took it much closer, to the last day and at the end of it, acted like a true gentleman and congratulated the winner right after his match to close a chapter to the season... In a way, it reflected well on his club to the neutrals...</p>
              <p>We have seen much fiercer battles even to the highest office in the land but once everything is settled and over, they stop all this ranting and behave like proper gentlemans... Good example like John McCaine...</p>
              <p>We can look at how Fergie and Mourinho were at it all the way before their respective sides met... But once its over, they make up and even buy each other a bottle of wine... I guess thats what they call sportsmanship... Unfortunately... The arrogance you mentioned seems more befitting of Rafa's behaviour don't you agree?</p>

              <p>premier league, division 1, whatever... it is just another name. the reality is liverpool and man u share the honours now as the most successful team in england.</p>
              <p>mm treble, as you called it, is still an achievement. more so in 2001, when teams still placed importance to euro tourney and fa cup. only league cup has eroded in performance. if you ask saf if he rather win the league cup or forgo it, he will not have your arrogance to say the latter.</p>
              <p>man u did well. exceptionally well under saf, but the reality is every dog has its day. man u is having theirs now but the truth is, man u will also go down that slippery road in the not too near future. in fact, i would argue that the moment saf retires, man u will also be `retiring'.</p>
              <p>another fact is, man u now only as good as liverpool in the english football championship history. so, there is no need for jibberish remarks and sarcasms. win 19, then i think you have the right to diss us. so, for now, we don't mind sharing honors even if we don't like it.</p>
              <p>and regardless of how rafa reacts to this, let's not get carried away. rafa is dispensable. liverpool is likely to be around a lot longer. as someone above rightly noted, it is the press who add spices to the fued. only the fools bought into it and stir it up.</p>
              <p>man u had a 28 barren years before it captured the premiership in '92. liverpool has not tasted epl glory for the last 19.</p>
              <p>well, we can afford to wait a year or more.</p>
              <p>no worries.  </p>

              <p><br>I believe you are greatly mistaken here... It is not the United fans who expect or want or even need any congratulatory message from Rafa or Liverpool...</p>
              <p>It is the Press and the Tv media who are more interested given their high profile spat through the used of them... It was the reporters who asked him...</p>
              <p>What Rafa choose to do or say its totally up to him, its just a reflection of himself but unfortunately he being the Liverpool manager at that point of time, it will somehow  come across as his club's bitterness over it as well... So maybe its unfair to the Pool fans that he acted the way he did... Last year Avram Grant took it much closer, to the last day and at the end of it, acted like a true gentleman and congratulated the winner right after his match to close a chapter to the season... In a way, it reflected well on his club to the neutrals...</p>
              <p>We have seen much fiercer battles even to the highest office in the land but once everything is settled and over, they stop all this ranting and behave like proper gentlemans... Good example like John McCaine...</p>
              <p>We can look at how Fergie and Mourinho were at it all the way before their respective sides met... But once its over, they make up and even buy each other a bottle of wine... I guess thats what they call sportsmanship... Unfortunately... The arrogance you mentioned seems more befitting of Rafa's behaviour don't you agree?</p>

              </span></p><p><strong>After a prolonged battle for
              the championship, Benitez pointedly refused to give Ferguson any
              personal praise, preferring instead to acknowledge Manchester United as
              a club. </strong></p>
              <p>The Liverpool boss is still aggrieved at some of the main
              arguments in his infamous 'Rafa's rant', namely that Ferguson is
              allowed to behave in a manner other managers would not get away with.</p>
              <p>Still, it seemed churlish in the extreme for Benitez not to at
              least offer his rival a pat on the back for his 11th league title.</p>
              <p>Ferguson was certainly pretty taken aback by such conduct, even
              if his feud seems to have superseded his long dispute with Arsene
              Wenger.</p>
