            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/christmasmour.jpg"><br><br>NEWCASTLE legend Chris Waddle reckons Jose Mourinho is increasing the ill-feeling towards Chelsea with his Â‘ridiculousÂ’ antics. The Blues boss was up to his old tricks at St JamesÂ’ Park on Wednesday by waving an imaginary yellow card after a foul by the ToonÂ’s Nicky Butt. And SunSport columnist Waddle believes action must be taken against the Portuguese manager unless he starts to behave. Waddle said: Â“He seems to think heÂ’s above the law now Â— and itÂ’s time something was done about it.<br><br>Â“HeÂ’s making himself look ridiculous by doing that and it certainly rubs people up the wrong way. Â“ThereÂ’s a lot of ill-feeling towards Chelsea but he is turning more and more people against them.<br><br>"Maybe, because he didnÂ’t play football at the top level himself, he wants to be the centre of attention. Either that or he doesnÂ’t understand the rules. Â“If he were a player he would be booked for doing something like that.<br><br>Â“You saw him running down the touchline when they scored at Everton. But if other managers or players did something like that he would be the first to criticise. Â“The bloke is becoming a law unto himself and itÂ’s time something was done about it.Â”<br><br>Former top referee Jeff Winter believes Mourinho should have been warned or even sent to the stands during WednesdayÂ’s Carling Cup quarter-final, which Chelsea won 1-0 with a goal from striker Didier Drogba.<br><br>Players who wave imaginary cards are generally booked and Winter reckons the same should apply to managers. He said: Â“We were always told that if a player waves an imaginary yellow card then he should be booked. Â“So thereÂ’s no reason why a manager should not be given a warning or even sent to the stands if he does it.<br><br>Â“At the very least the fourth official should be having a word with him to stop him from doing it. Â“But the problem is that officials these days seem to be scared of Chelsea.Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is it common? I didn't know that... The last manager that celebrated like that and only once, now has a case pending against him by the FA and no longer has a job... Anyway its Chris Waddle's, Sky Sports pundit Ray Wilkins and chief executive of the League Managers Association John Barnwell's point...  not mine... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Everton threatened legal action against Mourinho before he decided on his climb-down.<br><br>"Frankly, I expected the apology. I think he knew he had called it wrong at the end of the match and good men change their decisions," said Moyes, who underlined the managers' code which discourages criticism of opposing players.<br><br>Moyes said: "I don't think managers slag off players from other teams - it is very rare - and when it is done it is frowned upon.</div>
