            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Rafa Benitez took his spending to Â£37million inside a week yesterday as Liverpool underlined their determination not to be left behind in the coming season's title race.</strong><br><br>Alarmed at the way his side trailed in a distant third last season and how champions Manchester United have set the pace in this summer's transfer dealings, the Anfield boss reacted by adding Â£12m Ryan Babel and Â£5m Yossi Benayoun to last week's Â£20m record capture of Atletico Madrid striker Fernando Torres.<br><br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/07_01/babelDM1107_468x642.jpg"><br><br>Ajax's Holland Under 21 forward Babel flew to England for a medical and pay talks after the clubs agreed a fee, while Benayoun headed north last night ahead of a press conference to confirm his arrival from West Ham.<br><br>Negotiations over Babel's contract should be quick after the 20-year-old admitted he was eager to prove himself.<br><br>He said: "I've spoken to Rafa Benitez and that was when I knew everything would be signed. He has a clear vision of what he wants and said I'd be competing with six others for four positions in the forward line."<br><br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/07_01/trainingDM1107_468x377.jpg"><br><br>Benayoun made it equally clear he wanted to be part of Benitez's plan to end a barren spell in the league that dates back to 1990.<br><br>The Israel midfielder accepted a four-year deal that will reward him with around Â£45,000 a week but still leave him Â£2m worse off than if he had responded to overtures from Manchester City.<br><br>After hearing the 27-year-old had stalled over a new contract at Upton Park last month, City told his advisers they would top West Ham's Â£50,000-a-week weekly wage by at least Â£5,000.<br><br>Benayoun rejected it without even speaking to City and told West Ham he intended holding out for a move to Anfield. His defiance finally paid off when they relented over their Â£6m asking price and sanctioned a Â£5m deal.<br><br>Benitez may flex his financial muscle again after earmarking United's Â£6m-rated Gabriel Heinze for his problem left-back position, although Real Madrid are also keen on the Argentina defender.<br><br>Whatever the outcome over Heinze, Benitez is content that American owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks have heeded his call for substantial transfer backing and delivered a clear statement of intent about taking Liverpool back to the top.<br><br>"They were unequivocal about backing the manager and here is the proof," said chief executive Rick Parry.</div>

The Ajax hitman completed his Anfield move yesterday, with the clubs eventually agreeing a compromise fee that could reach up to Â£12million. And that figure will see the Dutch star net almost Â£3m Â— even before he picks up a penny in wages on his five-year deal. </strong><br><br>Babel, 20, had an agreement with Ajax that saw him collect half of any transfer fee over and above Â£6m. With the figure set to ultimately reach around double that, he was laughing all the way to the bank as he completed the formalities. Babel follows club record Â£21.5m hotshot Fernando Torres, West Ham midfielder Yossi Benayoun, Bayer Leverkusen free Andriy Voronin and Brazilian rookie Lukas Leiva into Anfield.<br><br>Gabriel Heinze will complete boss Rafa BenitezÂ’s summer dealings, if the Manchester United defender completes a Â£5m switch after ArgentinaÂ’s Copa America showdown with Brazil.<br><br>Benayoun, 27, becomes the third Israeli to play for Liverpool, after Avi Cohen and Ronny Rosenthal. And Cohen, who spent two seasons at Anfield, reckons the Hammers star will be a huge hit on Merseyside. He said: Â“This is the chance for Yossi to become a big name around the world. Â“He played very well for West Ham and has already shown he has got the ability and talent to perform at the highest level.<br><br>Â“YossiÂ’s so skilful and clever and very good at being able to spot the right pass to play. Liverpool have been looking for someone like him and IÂ’m sure he will be a great success. Â“He can play as a striker or out wide and I think he will suit LiverpoolÂ’s style very well.Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>I can be the new Henry, claims Babel<br><br>Ryan Babel is aiming to light up Liverpool the way Thierry Henry ignited Arsenal - and believes the Reds can win the Premier League.</strong><br><br>The 20-year-old forward has sealed a five-year deal at Anfield after helping Holland win the European Under-21 Championship. Liverpool had to pay Ajax Â£11.5million for his services and Babel is determined to give value for money.<br><br>Henry quickly established himself as one of the Premier League's finest entertainers and Babel revealed he sees himself in the same mould as the Frenchman.<br><br>Babel said: "It is great that some people are comparing me to Henry. I will work hard to get to his level or maybe beyond it in the next few years.<br><br>"Hopefully I am somebody that will please the supporters. I am a fast player, who likes to dribble and play beautiful football. I like to score goals as well.<br><br>"I have heard the Liverpool fans get behind the team in every game and that is important to me."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe not now but he sure looks very promising like the French flyer in Henry.<br><br>I jus checked out his vids on YT, he's suuuuure is pacy alright! Does remind you of Henry when he is full flight with the ball.. taking on defenders and scores a memorable goal thereafter. Good eye for goal and not afriad to take shots from long distance.<br><br>This is a confident lad and a different mould compared to the great Dutch man in Bergkamp.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Benitez die die cannot end this season throphyless i'm afraid. He has piled a big pressure on himself with all the buys which includes more than half a dozen of youngsters.<br><br>Pool's defence is really, without a doubt, lack of decent covers. Palletta is like Silvestre, a one man self-destruct team player. Hyypia is not young any more and neither is Finnan and Carragher. Riise and Aurelio can only aid in attack but cant really defend. Aberloa and Agger needs more chance to prove themselves.<br><br>They need someone in the mould of Campbell. Strong and Robust and Good in air as well, a direct complacement for Agger.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers.<br>CK</div>
