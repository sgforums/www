              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ANDRIY SHEVCHENKO rolled back the years to leave Manchester City's Europa League hopes hanging by a thread.</h2>
              <p>City striker Edin Dzeko had admitted ex-Chelsea forward Shevchenko has always been his idol in the build-up to the game. And while the Bosnian had another quiet match, Sheva showed how it should be done with a well-taken opener and a classy all-round display.</p>
              <p>Oleh Gusev added a second late on to give City a real mountain to climb in the return leg next Thursday. And their night was summed up by another childish display from bad-boy Italian Mario Balotelli, who clearly did not fancy the cold in the Ukraine.</p>
              <p>City could have taken an early lead from Aleksandar Kolarov's corner but Balotelli volleyed over.</p>
              <p>Minutes later, a clever ball by David Silva looked to have put Micah Richards clear but he was just beaten to it by Kiev keeper Alexandr Shovkovskiy.</p>
              <p>Kolarov then found himself with a free-kick 25 yards out but his effort was straight at the home keeper.</p>
              <p>The full-back was really in the thick of it and had another chance with a left-footed volley, which was again too close to the keeper.</p>
              <p>Kiev put eight past Besiktas over two legs but did not fashion a single chance in the opening quarter of this.</p>
              <p>But, when they finally dId, they took the lead as Andriy Yarmolenko held off Silva and put over a dangerous cross.</p>
              <p>Nobody tracked Shevchenko and he got his toe in ahead of City stopper Joe Hart to score a real poacher's goal.</p>
              <p>It was a 67th strike in European competition for Sheva, 34, who struggled so badly during his time in England with Chelsea.</p>
              <p>He could have added to that tally just before the break but his half-volley from 18 yards whistled just over.</p>
              <p>Kiev, who have not lost in six home European ties, then finished the opening half strongly as Gusev and Artem Milevsky both had shots which were narrowly off target.</p>
              <p>City had been disappointing for the first 45 minutes and boss Roberto Mancini clearly thought so too as he was going mad in the dugout.</p>
              <p>Balotelli had been as frustrating as ever and seemed reluctant to come out for the second half.</p>
              <p>But Mancini ordered him to continue - and the ex-Inter Milan striker promptly got himself booked for a wild challenge on Ayila Yussuf.</p>
              <p>It was no surprise then that he was hauled off on 57 minutes, to be replaced by skipper Carlos Tevez.</p>
              <p>City seemed to have bucked their ideas up with yet another Kolarov shot being deflected over.</p>
              <p>Then some good work by Gareth Barry on the edge of the box saw him create a chance for Yaya Toure - but his low shot was pushed round the post by Shovkovskiy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="float-right padding-left-10 width-300 padding-bottom-10 padding-top-10">
              <div class="grey-ad-line width-300 position-relative">
              <p> </p>
              City went close again when Pablo Zabaleta's cross-cum-shot was scuffed wide by Spanish winger Silva.</div>
              <div class="grey-ad-line width-300 position-relative">.</div>
              </div>
              <p>And the visitors were left kicking themselves when Kiev doubled their lead as a cross from the right was flicked on by Milevsky.</p>
              <p>Richards reacted too slowly and Gusev took a touch on his chest before blasting a volley past Hart.</p>
              <p>Yussuf could have effectively ended the tie right at the death with City at full stretch but Hart made what could yet be a crucial save.</p>
