            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by zocoss:<br><strong><span class="large">[b]Fergie already planning next Euro tilt with Hargreaves at the heart</span></strong><br><br><strong>A final in Athens may have been taken away from Sir Alex FergusonÂ’s team but victory at City will take them to within touching distance of a ninth Premiership title. Ryan Giggs Â— who has eight such medals already Â— was the only United player with enough class to stop and talk after his teamÂ’s 3-0 defeat at the San Siro. "We just did not perform on the night and Milan deserved to go through," he admitted. "We are greedy and we wanted to win everything this year. We are out of the Champions League but we have got two other trophies to earmark. There is still a lot to play for and thatÂ’s what we have to tell ourselves. "Saturday was always going to be a big game but now thereÂ’s even more riding on it because we have to get a positive result to put the pressure on Chelsea." With their title rivals and FA Cup Final opponents seemingly struggling to overcome physical and mental fatigue, United must fancy their chances of a Double. </strong><br><br>Indeed, if they beat a City team that has not scored at home since New YearÂ’s Day, and Chelsea fail to win at Arsenal on Sunday, then the Premiership title would go to Old Trafford with two games to spare. The Holy Grail has proved beyond Ferguson for another year but he has immediately turned to planning for another campaign. The United manager said: "Milan were better than us. They showed us where we need to get to. On the evidence of Wednesday, it could be a long journey, but not necessarily."<br><br>Taking their defending out of the equation Â— UnitedÂ’s first-choice back four would have been far less generousÂ—FergusonÂ’s men suffered from a failure to interrupt the triangular passing rhythms of MilanÂ’s outstanding midfield and an inability to hold possession at the top of their 4-2-3-1 formation.<br><br>Answer No 1 will arrive in the shape of Owen Hargreaves this summer. An Â£18million deal with Bayern Munich has been agreed in principle for the England midfield player who would add much-needed physical presence. Answer No 2 will arrive in a new centre forward. Ferguson has completely lost faith in Louis Saha and the Frenchman will be sold if at all possible this summer. Ideally, Ferguson would like TottenhamÂ’s Dimitar Berbatov in his place.<br><br>The BulgarianÂ’s presence would not only bring United a natural attacking focus but also free Wayne Rooney from the restrictive role he was asked to play on Wednesday. Rooney is at his best 30 yards from goal with team-mates ahead of him, not in the role he occupied in Milan as the lone striker.<br><br>United face a struggle to snare Berbatov, one of the PremiershipÂ’s star turns. Initial soundings have not yielded much encouragement, and yesterday Spurs manager Martin Jol reiterated the clubÂ’s determination to hang on to him. Chelsea are also keen on Berbatov but Jol insisted: "I have no fears. The chairman wouldnÂ’t sanction it even if I would like to sell him.<br><br>Ferguson also has NewcastleÂ’s Michael Owen and BarcelonaÂ’s Eidur Gudjohnsen in mind, even though the latter does not quite fit the same centre-forward job description. These matters have been earmarked as a priority by Ferguson for some time. Wednesday may have exposed UnitedÂ’s deficiencies to a European audience but it told the Scot nothing he did not know already.<br><br>Quite simply, you can get away with cracks in your make-up in the Premiership. In Europe those cracks merely widen. But few recover their sense of purpose quicker than the PremiershipÂ’s first knight. Chances are the joke will be on City by Saturday tea-time.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>I think OwenH is one fix.<br></div>

I think Milan after their experience with Liverpool in the final and seeing Man U's play against Roma, they knew not to let the English side take long shots.<br><br>Milan threw bodies infront of shots by Scholes and Carrick and rushed to deny them any chance to score from range. I think Milan themselves were pretty aware of their keeper not being 100% as well.<br><br>I think the early goal really helped Milan too because from then on, Man U had to chase. Milan could afford to sit back and defend which like any Italian side, they can do quite well.</div>

I saw Giggs on far right pretty often. If it was 4-4-2 playing as CF, he would have had Ronaldo still on the left but someone else on the right. But Flecther, Scholes and Carrick were always in the centre.<br><br>He has put Giggs and Ronaldo on opposite flanks pretty often this season, because he wants them to cut into the centre. But centre was effectively controlled by Gattuso and Seedorf. Everytime they tried to cut in, they would be effectively blocked off and forced to run into a defender.<br><br>To add, I think Rooney can't perform in a 4-5-1 formation. Remember England vs Portugal? I think Fergie played 4-5-1 to hold onto possession, which didn't happen actually.</div>

The midfield kept giving away passes and possession and despite employing a 5 man midfield, they had problems employing it to their advantage. Milan managed to close off many of the passes to their two wingers, sometimes Scholes, Carrick and Flectcher made it easy for them to do so.</div>
