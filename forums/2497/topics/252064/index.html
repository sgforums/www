            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Manchester United could lost 3-0 at the San Siro to bow out of the UEFA Champion's League 5-3 on aggregrate.</strong><br><br><img src="http://soccernet-akamai.espn.go.com/design05/images/domr/edwinvandersar_dejected_412.jpg"><br><br>It was never going to be an easy game for the English side with most of their first choice defenders out injured. Ferdinand made the bench but played no part for the 90 min that AC Milan dominated.<br><br>In a way it could be said that the pitch and the weather won it for AC Milan in the first half. The heavy rain right before and during the first half of the match made the pitch slippery and harder to run on.<br><br>Being an English side, Manchester United's game would have relied on pace and runs to get their game going. Milan have players like Inzaghi and Kaka who have great pace, but it was the Red Devil's overall game that was affected.<br><br>Manchester United players struggled to adapt to the pitch and their unease with the ground showed. Poor, sloppy passes and not running into position in time. Man U not only gave away possession cheaply at times but the slower pace of the game meant Milan's older, more experienced players could afford to pass the ball around and prod for gaps in Man U's somewhat makeshift defence.<br><br>Moreover, the english side had no answer to the midfield pairing of Gattuso and Seedorf, who controlled the midfield. Gattuso was practically bossing the United midfield around. This despite Alex Ferguson playing what was seemingly a 4-5-1 formation, no doubt to try and hold more possession.<br><br>Just as Man U struggled to contain Kaka at Old Trafford, they had the same problem at San Siro and it was the Brazilian who first found the back of the net early in the 11th min. From then on, Man U had to do all the chasing.<br><br>Manchester United was poor at defending which led to the second goal. Was not able to play their attacking game due to their problems with the pitch. And were thoroughly outmatched in central midfield.<br><br>AC Milan were deserverd winners, but things could easily have been different had the pitch been in normal condition. Milan might still have won but perhaps we would have seen more of a contest.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">So much for an all English final.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, the real better team won. and it was a learning experience for MUFC and hopefully SAF.<br><br>They restricted Ronaldo's run to zero. They just put a gattuso or Seedorf in his path and they ended his involvement.<br><br>And despite overwhelm in MF, SAF did not move and expect Rooney to do miracles.<br><br>Giggs was so sluggish that seeing him with the captain armband really made me puke. The last one who wore that in this type of situation single-handled brought the team to Nou Camp, and yes, I am talking about the legendary KEANO.<br><br>The gamble to play Vidic was a risk and a failure.<br><br>The lesson has been whipped into MUFC, they have never won against AC Milan. Itself a loud message that despite our attacking, without a ball-winner in MF, while Milan has got two, will not help MUFC cause.<br><br>Liverpool has a truckload of MF generals that are able to match Milan and hopefully do another Istanbul.<br><br>All the best, Reds.<br><br></div>

The running, the aggression they showed how much they wanted it more than united...<br><br>Anyway, united like chelsea, seems like they didn't have much in them anymore...

            <div class='col-md body'>It was raining pretty heavily. The pitch was quite slippery. Everyone was like slipping every few steps. No excuse though, and Man Utd is very poor away from home in European matches. Maybe its due to SAF coaching. Like alittle psychological.<br><br>Nvm, at least now Man Utd will have more experience, especially for the young players like ronaldo, rooney, carrick. If we win the EPL and FA cup, I still think it will be a good season. Who the hell would have thought that Man Utd could have gone so far when we only bought Carrick at the start of the season. Actually, if they win the EPL alone, I would be pleased enough.<br><br>Next season will only be better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Fergie already planning next Euro tilt with Hargreaves at the heart</strong></span><br><br><strong>A final in Athens may have been taken away from Sir Alex FergusonÂ’s team but victory at City will take them to within touching distance of a ninth Premiership title. Ryan Giggs Â— who has eight such medals already Â— was the only United player with enough class to stop and talk after his teamÂ’s 3-0 defeat at the San Siro. "We just did not perform on the night and Milan deserved to go through," he admitted. "We are greedy and we wanted to win everything this year. We are out of the Champions League but we have got two other trophies to earmark. There is still a lot to play for and thatÂ’s what we have to tell ourselves. "Saturday was always going to be a big game but now thereÂ’s even more riding on it because we have to get a positive result to put the pressure on Chelsea." With their title rivals and FA Cup Final opponents seemingly struggling to overcome physical and mental fatigue, United must fancy their chances of a Double. </strong><br><br>Indeed, if they beat a City team that has not scored at home since New YearÂ’s Day, and Chelsea fail to win at Arsenal on Sunday, then the Premiership title would go to Old Trafford with two games to spare. The Holy Grail has proved beyond Ferguson for another year but he has immediately turned to planning for another campaign. The United manager said: "Milan were better than us. They showed us where we need to get to. On the evidence of Wednesday, it could be a long journey, but not necessarily."<br><br>Taking their defending out of the equation Â— UnitedÂ’s first-choice back four would have been far less generousÂ—FergusonÂ’s men suffered from a failure to interrupt the triangular passing rhythms of MilanÂ’s outstanding midfield and an inability to hold possession at the top of their 4-2-3-1 formation.<br><br>Answer No 1 will arrive in the shape of Owen Hargreaves this summer. An Â£18million deal with Bayern Munich has been agreed in principle for the England midfield player who would add much-needed physical presence. Answer No 2 will arrive in a new centre forward. Ferguson has completely lost faith in Louis Saha and the Frenchman will be sold if at all possible this summer. Ideally, Ferguson would like TottenhamÂ’s Dimitar Berbatov in his place.<br><br>The BulgarianÂ’s presence would not only bring United a natural attacking focus but also free Wayne Rooney from the restrictive role he was asked to play on Wednesday. Rooney is at his best 30 yards from goal with team-mates ahead of him, not in the role he occupied in Milan as the lone striker.<br><br>United face a struggle to snare Berbatov, one of the PremiershipÂ’s star turns. Initial soundings have not yielded much encouragement, and yesterday Spurs manager Martin Jol reiterated the clubÂ’s determination to hang on to him. Chelsea are also keen on Berbatov but Jol insisted: "I have no fears. The chairman wouldnÂ’t sanction it even if I would like to sell him.<br><br>Ferguson also has NewcastleÂ’s Michael Owen and BarcelonaÂ’s Eidur Gudjohnsen in mind, even though the latter does not quite fit the same centre-forward job description. These matters have been earmarked as a priority by Ferguson for some time. Wednesday may have exposed UnitedÂ’s deficiencies to a European audience but it told the Scot nothing he did not know already.<br><br>Quite simply, you can get away with cracks in your make-up in the Premiership. In Europe those cracks merely widen. But few recover their sense of purpose quicker than the PremiershipÂ’s first knight. Chances are the joke will be on City by Saturday tea-time.<br><br></div>
