            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea have moved to tie their key stars to long-term deals as fears mount that Jose Mourinho will leave the club at the end of the season.<br><br>Although chief exectuive Peter Kenyon has denied newspaper reports that this will be Mourinho's third and final year in west London, negotiations are already underway to tie a host of Stamford Bridge players to 'golden handcuffs' deals to stop them leaving with the Portuguese next summer.<br><br>"My question is 'Why would he want to go?', and I don't think he does," Kenyon protested when asked about Mourinho's future. "We are chasing ghosts thinking he is going to ride off into the sunset. Where else is he going to go?"<br><br>Such public confidence belies private fears that, whatever Chelsea's wishes, Mourinho will not be at Stamford Bridge next season. And that has manifested itself in Chelsea's latest attempts to extend the contracts of their key personnel, with the club reduced to stating during negotiations that they 'hoped' the manager would be in place next August, but 'they were not in a position to guarantee that.'<br><br>Worried that Mourinho will attempt to take his players with him if he does leave for pastures new in the summer, Chelsea have been swift to offer massively improved contracts to their biggest names.<br><br>Despite having over a year and a half remaining on his deal, Didier Drogba has seen his wages more than double to over Â£90,000-a-week in exchange for his commitment to the club until 2010.<br><br>'Also elbowing for space at a crowded west London negotiating table are Chelsea's two English figureheads. John Terry and Frank Lampard are set to be upgraded to the same Â£121,000-a-week terms that brought Michael Ballack and Andriy Shevchenko to the club in the last transfer window,' reports The Sunday Times.<br><br>Michael Essien is also in line for a massive pay-rise - despite already being on one of the longest contracts at the club. Chelsea have indicated that his wages will also exceed the Â£90,000-a-week barrier.<br><br>While such deals seem unnecessary with so long remaining on the players' contracts, and while they further embarrass Kenyon's prediction that the club would be able to survive without vast handouts from Roman Abramovich by 2010, the Chelsea hierarchy feel they are necessary to prevent bids for those players from whichever new club Mourinho finds himself at next summer.<br><br>Such deals are in stark contrast to those offered to William Gallas. Mourinho complained this week that "I did my best to try and keep him at the club," - an admission seen in some quarters as a criticism of Kenyon's tough bargaining.<br><br>Mourinho also spoke for the first time about an apparent willingness to leave the club if his contract was paid off, saying of Abramovich: "The day he doesn't respect me, just give me the cheque and send me home."<br><br>The Portuguese has threatened to resign twice during his tenure at Stamford Bridge. The first time, in April 2005, he was angry that the club had failed to support him in his disciplinary dispute with UEFA. Then, at the end of last season, Mourinho admitted "a couple of times during the season, I thought about closing the door and saying goodbye."<br><br>Chelsea's solution then was to offer their manager a Â£5.2m-a-year contract extension - a policy they are repeating with his players as fears over the inevitability of his departure grow.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In my frank opinion, they should let him go. I understand many may feel that he is winning them titles (2 only) But the thing is... Their owner and chief-executive Peter Kenyon's has higher targets for the club and wants them to become the biggest club in the world. And in order to do so... you cannot have so many people disliking your club.<br><br>You will need to grow and build your fan base but with mourinho, they have more people loathing them rather then love them. Mourinho's ways make lots of people unhappy and angry in England as well as across Europe... The things he say are most of the time insensitive and very insulting to others... And his brand of football looks boring as many have said.<br><br>Whoever consider employing him after he leave chelsea, better be prepare for their club to be loathe by many... He is a good manager but then again, a good manager would not make many to dislike your club right?<br><br>If chelsea gets Marcello Lippi, Frank Rijkaard or someone else... i seriously belief there will be very much lesser people disliking Chelsea FC...<br><br>I do feel that Mourinho, as much as he is winning these past 2 years... Clubs like man u, pool and gunners are catching up with him even with the extra tens of millions he has on them... And i do feel he is a liability to Chelsea.<br><br>Roman Abramovich has throw in more than $400 million into chelsea, and only have 2 epl titles to show for but strangely, they have not build up on their fan base which is in a way more important than winning the epl title itself... If they can't even fill up their 42 thousand stadium, then they seriously do have a problem if they want to become the biggest club in the world.<br><br>In a way, Man utd didn't win any epl titles during the 70s and 80s i think but their fan base grew bigger and bigger... across the world.<br><br>Chelsea would be better off without Mourinho... at least they could be a club that people may grow to like and support.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Mourinho have said such things before in his press interviews... You probably won't hear Fergie saying that to Malcolm Glazer or Wenger to David Dein, Rafa to his boss right... But if he was to leave, he won't find a better club than chelsea cos no other club can give him that kind of money to buy, try and test players and if it doesn't work out within 6 months, buy again... not even at Real cos every club has a budget except at chelsea...<br><br>I know what you mean, but what i am saying is Abramovich and chief-executive Peter Kenyon has bigger targets for the club and their objective is to make chelsea become the biggest club in the world.<br><br>Mour is winning them titles (2 only actually considering the amount he has spent) but he is certainly not winning them fans... Their support base is not growing... Kenyon has a bigger job on his hands in the long term, and that is to make Chelsea the biggest club in the world as he puts it...<br><br>Under Claudio Ranieri or Gianluca Vialli, they were quite a likeable football club. but since mourinho took over, they have not only become the most loathe in England, but i belief across Europe as well since mourinho attacks Uefa officials and also other club managers like Rijkaard and even his ex-player like... Eidur Gudjohnsen.<br><br>His style is rather strange i must say... and winning titles don't necessary make your club bigger as newcastle and man utd have shown... They didn't win the league during the 70s and 80s... but oddly, it was during these time that their fan base grew bigger... Playing good attractive football and having a good attitude will make more neutral fans more favourable to your club that what i feel...<br><br>Winning titles alone will not be enough... But one thing i personally feel its true... Rijkaard has improve Barce image and more people are supporting them now compare to a few years ago...<br><br></div>
