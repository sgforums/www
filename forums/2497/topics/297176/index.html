We've been sent a document with the reasons why he's being deported and they are ridiculous.'<br><br>Bangura's story is one dominated by tragedy and hardship. He left Africa four years ago due to the civil war in Sierra Leone, in which his father was stabbed to death. He was then groomed as a male prostitute when he first came to the UK, via Guinea and France, but managed to escape and claim asylum. If Bangura is deported he will lose everything he has Â– not to mention the fact that his life will be in danger, possibly from the men who killed his father.<br><br>Watford's players plan to wear special T-shirts highlighting Bangura's situation at this Saturday's home match against Plymouth Argyle.<br><br>Bangura was first spotted by Watford scouts when he played for a youth side in Chertsey and he signed for the club's academy, making his first-team debut in April 2005. Since then has racked up more than 50 appearances, been voted the club's Young Player of the Year, and earlier this season he wore the captain's armband.<br><br>In other words, he is a very talented young man making a new life for himself and his young family in Britain. It would be plain wrong to kick him out.<br><br>Here's the petition!<br><br><a href="http://www.thepetitionsite.com/1/save-al-bangura" rel="nofollow">http://www.thepetitionsite.com/1/save-al-bangura</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>New hope for Bangura as Watford allowed to apply for work permit</strong><br><br>Watford midfielder Al Bangura's hopes of staying in the United Kingdom have been boosted after the Home Office agreed to allow the Coca-Cola Championship club to apply for a work permit for him.<br><br>The 19-year-old was refused leave to stay in the UK last week and was set to be deported to his native Sierra Leone. But after a meeting with Home Office minister Liam Byrne the club have been handed the option of applying for a work permit.<br><br>Labour MP Claire Ward - who brokered the meeting and has been a staunch supporter of Bangura's case - said: "We've been offered another avenue which we hope will allow Al to remain in the country.<br><br>"Liam Byrne has given a concession which will allow Watford Football Club to apply for a work permit for Al and for Al to remain in the country while that happens. This is exceptional news."<br><br>Bangura's chances of attaining a work permit would normally be slim as he is uncapped and Sierra Leone are outside the top 70 nations in FIFA's rankings.<br><br>But Ward hopes that the inclusion of members of the football world on a panel will help his case.</div>
