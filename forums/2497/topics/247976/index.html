Sun can reveal the Blues boss has already mapped out the clubÂ’s pre-season schedule and demanded that Argentine striker Hernan Crespo be brought back to Stamford Bridge this summer.</strong><br><br>But Blues owner Roman Abramovich will make Mourinho sweat on his Chelsea future. A source close to Red Rom said: Â“Roman does not think the problems with Mourinho are doing any harm. In fact, he is quite happy that it seems to have bonded the team. The future is up in the air. It could go either way.Â”<br><br>Crespo is on loan at Inter Milan and would prefer to stay in Italian football. But Mourinho is fearful of losing Didier Drogba and Salomon Kalou during next yearÂ’s African Nations Cup and has told the club to get Crespo back.<br><br>Crespo endured an unhappy time in England and was allowed to leave last summer for family reasons. Mourinho said: Â“I understand the human side of CrespoÂ’s story Â— but business is business. Â“ItÂ’s up to Abramovich and Peter Kenyon now. I have told them my plans. Crespo is ours and I need a striker.<br><br>"IÂ’m sure I will lose Drogba and Kalou, who will go to play in the African Cup of Nations, so I need a striker like Crespo to be at Chelsea.Â” Chelsea still pay half of CrespoÂ’s Â£87,000- a-week wages despite the fact he has played all season at Inter.<br><br>Abramovich snubbed ChelseaÂ’s memorable 2-1 win against Valencia on Tuesday night causing further speculation that Mourinho will be replaced this summer. But the Portuguese coach has already finalised every detail of the clubÂ’s pre-season programme, including a three-game tour of the USA in July.<br><br>Mourinho was also asked by one of AbramovichÂ’s close aides if he would take his team to Russia for a friendly in early August. The manager said it would not be a problem Â— though he was slightly surprised that the owner had asked his permission.<br></div>
