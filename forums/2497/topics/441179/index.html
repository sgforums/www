              <p><strong>Arsenal midfielder</strong> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/122089/Jack-Wilshere"><span style="color: #225fb2;"><strong>Jack Wilshere</strong></span></a> <strong>reaffirmed his commitment to the club by stating his "promise" to stay at the Emirates Stadium for the remainder of his career.</strong> </p>
              <p>Wilshere, currently sidelined after picking up a stress fracture in his right ankle during the summer, has stepped up his recovery process as he aims for a return to action toward the end of the year. He said his long-term aim, though, is to work alongside the Gunners' other young players to "create something special" into the future.</p>
              <p>When asked if he plans to stay with Arsenal for the rest of his playing days, he said: "I promise that. I've been at the club since I was nine and learned to love it. From the [Patrick] Vieira days, to [Dennis] Bergkamp, [Cesc] Fabregas, I've watched them come through and move on. There's a crop of new players, [Aaron] Ramsey, myself, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/99500/Kieran-Gibbs"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Kieran Gibbs</span></a>. Hopefully we can really create something special. I love the club and I want to be part of its future."</p>
              <p>Wilshere went under the knife six weeks ago to correct his ankle problem. After the initial frustration, Wilshere, who is yet to make an appearance for Arsenal this season, is on track in his rehabilitation after undergoing a routine check-up on his injury on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>"As I said had 6 week X-ray earlier and all going well," he wrote on his <em>Twitter</em> page. "I can start to work a bit harder now."</p>
              <p>The midfielder also praised his team-mates' recent performances in his absence. Wilshere believes the current crop of players have turned the corner after a difficult start to the campaign, and says he has seen glimpses of a return to the club's glory days.</p>
              <p>"We seem to get better and better every week," he told <em>iFilm London</em>. "We had a bad start to the season and everyone knows that. I'm not going to lie and say we did well.</p>
              <p>"The boys had to play together, they're new players some of them. We seem to be getting better and better every week. [Against West Brom] was probably one of our best performances. We passed it around like the old Arsenal and we seem to be back to winning ways."</p>
