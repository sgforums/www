              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Pass master: Alonso is the subject of a £20m bid from Real</em></p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1190676" rel="1190676|3| nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1190676/Real-Madrid-public-making-20m-bid-Liverpools-Xabi-Alonso.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Real Madrid have tabled an offer of £20million for </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong> midfielder Xabi Alonso.</strong></p>
              <p>President Florentino Perez is determined to press ahead with his move for the Spain playmaker and sees him as the perfect anchor to a new-look midfield that could yet contain Chelsea target Kaka.</p>
              <p>Perez said: ‘As a fan, I would say that Xabi is a great player. I think he is the best passer of the ball in Europe. ‘I would be happy (to have him), but I cannot talk about the player without having spoken first to Rafa Benitez, as he is the one who needs to know that we are interested in his player.’</p>
              <p>Though Benitez may well be angered by a familiar Real tactic of going public with their interest in a transfer target, he knows Alonso’s thoughts are now focused on his next move.</p>
              <p>Alonso, 27, is a key figure at Anfield, particularly after they missed out on Gareth Barry, but has grown concerned with continued speculation over his future.</p>
              <p>He is keen to stay in England but is due to join up with the national side for the<br>Confederations Cup in South Africa next week and Spanish sources say Madrid will try to persuade him that now is the right time to return to <span style="font-style: italic;">La Liga</span>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinFloatLHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/06/03/article-1190676-0513DF3B000005DC-442_233x224.jpg" alt="Middlesbrough's Tuncay Sanli " width="233" height="224">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Target: Tuncay</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Benitez, meanwhile, is ready to offer Turkey’s Tuncay the chance to extend his Barclays Premier League stay by bidding around £5m for the </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/middlesbrough.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Middlesbrough</strong></span></a><strong> striker.</strong></p>
              <p>Asked about the possibility of a move to Anfield, Tuncay said: ‘I have heard something about that, but there has been nothing official so far. Of course, I would like to play for a big team.’</p>
              <p>Benitez, who is also considering an approach for Middlesbrough midfielder Gary O’Neil as an affordable option for increasing Liverpool’s attacking threat, has not given up hope of agreeing a fee for Valencia’s Spain winger David Silva.</p>

              <p><br>I think so too. He likes to buy cheap players and expand the squad...Barry gone, Tevez will be gone, Villa &amp; Silva potentially will as well...</p>
              <p>I think the most important player that Rafa need to sign now is Glenn Johnson, and so many clubs are monitoring him as well, maybe Rafa will lose him too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's gonna be very tough next season, potentially finish 3rd or 4th.</p>

              <p>Yeah, i think so. He likes to expand his squad rather than buy 1 world class player. Barry is gone. Don't think the big name target will be at Anfield too. I think it's critical to sign Glenn Johnson but alot of clubs are monitoring him...</p>
              <p>Liverpool will finish 3rd or 4th next season I suppose...</p>

              <p>Rafa should just go for it... It is mentioned that he will have full control of transfers... There is no one at Anfield able to stop him now... and they have given him $30m to spend... excluding the sum he can rise from selling ... This would give him about $50 to $60 million in transfer budget...</p>
              <p>So he should go for the players that he feel can really help the team... Stop the hustling... Good players will cost top dollar... He already possess a very good squad, what they need is the extra quality players...  and not the run of the mill type like 75 percent of his purchases...  Be it one or two players, if they are quality, it will show...  Buying 5 or 6 players with that same budget may look good at first but... they will also show their "quality" and why they cost lesser...</p>
              <p>Bottomline is, I think Rafa is afraid to take risk now... Putting a lot of money in one player and if he doesn't makes it...  will look much worse than spending it on 3 to 4 players...  Cos out of 3 or 4, maybe you can expect 1 or 2 to be successful... But one for one, the chances of course is very much lesser. And his experienced with Robbie Keane couldn't have help.</p>

              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Tuncay Sanli has admitted he would relish the opportunity to join Liverpool this summer. </strong></p>
              <p class="ss-text-bold"><img src="http://img.skysports.com/09/05/218x298/Tuncay1_2307697.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="298"></p>
              <p><strong>The Turkey international was part of the Middlesbrough
              squad which slipped out of the Premier League at the end of the 2008/09
              campaign.</strong></p>
              <p>He is expected to form part of a Riverside Stadium exodus this summer, and there are no shortage of potential takers.</p>
              <p>Tuncay's selfless running and creative ability marks him out as an ideal foil to a free-scoring centre-forward.</p>
              <p>That
              has attracted the attention of Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez, among
              others, who is keen to pair the 27-year-old alongside Spanish superstar
              Fernando Torres.</p>
              <p>Rumours of interest from Anfield have now reached Tuncay and he claims a switch to Merseyside would appeal.</p>
              <p>"Yes, I've heard something about that but nothing official has arrived to me," he said.</p>
              <p>"Of course I would like to play for a big club."</p>
