            <div class='col-md body'><p>Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon has dismissed suggestions the Spanish champions would be willing to spend £80million on Cristiano Ronaldo. <br><br>Speculation has been rife that Madrid would smash their own world-record transfer fee - set when they splashed £46million on Zinedine Zidane in 2001 - by offering Manchester United in the region of 100 million euros for Ronaldo if the Red Devils decided to cash in on their prize asset. <br><br>However, speaking just days after Madrid coach Bernd Schuster urged the club to 'pay what is necessary' to take Ronaldo to the Bernabeu, Calderon insists they will not break the bank for any player. <br><br>When asked about Ronaldo, Calderon said in remarks reported by Marca: 'There is no 'Cristiano Ronaldo case' because Manchester (United) do not want to sell. <br><br>'In any case, Real Madrid will never pay 100 million euros for anybody.' <br><br>United, who recently reported the Primera Liga champions to FIFA over what they considered to be attempts to unsettle the player, have stated that the Portugal international is not for sale.<br><br><br>YES AHHHHH!!!</p></div>

              <p><br>No lah, its getting out of hand for them... Cos it started out as only $50m, then it was already a new world record then as the talk in the Press continues, its going up by the days $60, $70, $75 million then last week $100 million Euros about $80m pounds...</p>
              <p>I belief Real are realizing this and wish to put a cap on it before it get even bigger... To be fair, $60m pounds would be a proper price as many believe Ronny has peak and won't get any better... Ronaldo's game depend a lot on speed, his running with the ball on his feet is his plus point so in 4 to 5 yrs time, he won't be that super anymore... Not to mention his salary if he goes to Real would be between $182,000 to $300,000 a week... And anyone who thinks Ronaldo would be like Beckham in the image and fashion world is greatly mistaken...</p>

              <p class="story"><strong><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/39340000/jpg/_39340408_rummenigge203.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="152"></strong></p>
              <p class="story"> </p>
              <p class="story"><strong>Earlier today, Ferguson, Queiroz and Manchester United received support for their stance from an unexpected source as Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, the Bayern Munich chairman, criticised Real Madrid's conduct in the Ronaldo transfer saga.</strong></p>
              <p class="story">Rummenigge is less worried about Manchester United being bullied into agreeing to sell Ronaldo than the negative precedent such a move may create. "This is not a question of money for Manchester United. The player and Real Madrid can say what they want, United have the last word and if they say it is not happening then that is that," Rummenigge said.</p>
              <p class="story">"Teams will always have players in their squad that see incredible offers come in for them and contracts put forward that could see them earn a lot more money than they do with your club."</p>
              <p class="story">Speculation about Real Madrid offering to pay an £80 million fee for Ronaldo were thrown into doubt when earlier this week club president Ramon Calderon said they would "never pay €100million for any player".</p>
              <p class="story">Nevertheless, the Spanish champions were also reported to be offering to pay Ronaldo £182,000-a-week after tax. Rummenigge says the publication of such figures are unfortunate. "That is the world that we currently live in, but luckily people can still say no. No is a very good word. In fact it is one of my favourites," he said.</p>
              <p class="story">"I cannot believe that a club like Real Madrid can force a player like Cristiano Ronaldo to cause such tension, because the price that they will have to pay is too high for everyone. "I think that this is dangerous for world football. Each club has to find its own way of dealing with things in these cases. This is a situation that only concerns Manchester United, but I would like to see Ronaldo stay at the club for the benefit of everyone."</p>
              <p class="story">Manchester United have no doubt that Ronaldo is crucial to the club's future success. Indeed, there is no doubt that he is one of the world's top players and his statistics reflect his meteoric rise to superstardom and suggest that perhaps his best is yet to come. The rising rate of his Premier League goalscoring reflects that. From 2003-04 to 07-08, his tallies rose as: 4, 5, 9, 17 and 31. However, his potential move may serve to undermine a Manchester United squad that could ill-afford to lose him.</p>
              <p class="story">Their reliance on Ronaldo's goals would be difficult to overcome and together with uncertainty over the future of forward Carlos Tevez who is entering the final year of a two-year lon deal that saw him move to Old Trafford from West Ham, could serve to leave the club unsettled for years to come.</p>
