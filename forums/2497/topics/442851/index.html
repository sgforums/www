              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>The FA Cup is destined to claim one major casualty after the giants of Manchester were paired on Sunday.</strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;">United will not need reminding that the last time they played City they were thrashed 6-1. Roberto Mancini’s side also won last season’s Cup semi-final at Wembley  1-0 thanks to a Yaya Toure goal.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Delighted United defender Rio Ferdinand tweeted: ‘Third round FA Cup game versus Man City. Great game to kick off this year’s FA Cup, can’t wait.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Blackburn travel to Newcastle in the other all top-flight tie.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Andre Villas-Boas will be introduced to the FA Cup in a repeat of the 2010 final as Chelsea entertain Portsmouth, and Arsenal and Leeds play again. They met at this stage 12 months ago.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Aston Villa head to Bristol Rovers, whose boss Paul Buckle said: ‘The Villa game will be a great day for the club. I’ve never been drawn against a Premier League side in the FA Cup before.’</span></p>

              <p><br>You made it sound as if as it is a forgone conclusion that Liverpool will win the Carling Cup just because their opponents have difficult games elsewhere...Dun underestimate the strength of Man City. They can easily play two different strong teams if they want to. If Liverpool indeed win the Carling Cup (and this is a big IF), then it is down to their capability more than anything else.</p>

              <p>We cannot deny if City don't have the important distractions, they will send more time in their preparation and able to put out their best 11 when they meet. However, due to the situation that is now, they can't put out say, a very weak side in between matches as they might if they were to meet a 3rd, or 2nd division side... and this would have allowed a full 8 days of rest instead of a 3 to 4 now.</p>
              <p>And even if they played the same players, their physical fitness will not be as good either. So either way, it isn't helpful.</p>
              <p>And there is no such thing as 2 strong teams in a squad as there will always be the first 11, then the rest. Just like there is no 2 Joe Hart, no 2 Kompany and no 2 Aguero. And also even when there is 2 Toure, one is clearly more important than the other... One is indispensable while the other they didn't need in their rise to the top.</p>

              <p>Man City have depth in their reserves.</p>
              <p>So, they can play their reserved team for some of the game.</p>
              <p>It depend on which cup they want to forgo.</p>
              <p>If they can thrash Liverpool during the 1st leg of League Cup, they can rest during the 2nd leg.</p>
              <p>But, injury to both Liverpool and Man City will play an important role for congested fixture.</p>
              <p>The players that both teams buy on Jan 2012 will also make a difference.</p>
              <p>Mancini should be more keen on the BPL title and maintain their unbeaten record.</p>
              <p>They have already scored so many goals that it is a BIG waste not to win the title.</p>

              <p>Indeed... Looking at the fixture of City's, I think they may consider to forego the Carling Cup and just hope for the best outcome cos the FA cup against United is not just a 4th round reward, there is real pride at stake too as City is always trying to live up to United's status...</p>
              <p>Also more importantly, losing could shake their confidence for the 2nd half of the league season... And look at their match coming up against Spurs 3 days before they meet Pool in the 2nd leg as well... I am quite sure the City machine will crack up if they try to go with their best 11 in all these matches... Hence, I belief they may put lesser likes out and hope they can still make it. For instance maybe Hargreaves and Barry for Yaya and De Jong kind of 2nd strings...</p>

              <p>if city really cant cope then they should forget about the FA cup as its only in the 3rd round.</p>
              <p>it may be more important than the carling but nowhere as important as the premiership title.  they should focus on the premiership.</p>
              <p>a few points lead is nothing in the premiership as there are many more games to play.</p>

              <p>Seeing it from another angle, they can clinch Carling Cup once they beat Liverpool.</p>

              <p>actually that is what they should do.  challenge all honours.</p>

              <p>Off course challenge for all honours but prioritise definitely.</p>
              <p>I guess it's easy when you think beat Pool and for sure win the Carling cup... But Pool will be thinking the very same thing too and probably more driven when they perhap know the league is beyond their reach this season and the Carling cup could be their best hope of getting into Europe next season... So City will have more on their plate like the... League, the FA cup, their pride against United and not least their confidence all to consider... and when you look at the Spurs match 3 days before their Anfield game, it's a big ask even from City's standard...</p>
              <p>So it's more logical for them to put their best against United and Spurs as it could help them greatly in their title chase... Losing both even though United's is an FA cup, could damage their confidence and form a great deal for the rest of this season...</p>
              <p>Seriously, if City is going to get anything from Anfield on a highly charge semi-final cup night, they will need all their best 11 to get through. But if they used most of them in their Spurs match, these fellows won't be fit in the last 20 mins. And that is not even considering the extra time should it go into it...</p>
              <p>And if they are as expected get knock out of the CL this week, the premier league becomes all the more important. As i think even winning both cups would be deem a failure but a league title alone would be seen as a success.</p>
              <p>The best chance is for City to use their back-up players against Pool (both legs) and keep their fingers cross and hope for the best... But I don't think it's going to be enough cos Pool is really driven to win this... Tough luck for City... lol.</p>

              <p>city i feel should reserve their strongest team for all the premiership games.</p>
              <p>its not easy to win the premiership.  now that they are ahead they should not waste it.</p>
              <p>field reserve squads for both the FA and carling cup.  city can win it next time.  even smaller clubs have won both these cups.  but never the premiership title.</p>
              <p>now that city are out of the CL i hope they wont focus too much on the europa title.</p>
              <p>they should even consider fielding young players for all those games.</p>
              <p>but then i believe their pride may affect their decision making.</p>
