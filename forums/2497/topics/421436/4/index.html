              <p>aiya...liverpool fans name their son torres also not F torres fault ah.</p>
              <p>frankly how can blame player who seek for greener pasture.</p>
              <p>player lifespan is very short. you either play for money or play for trophy.</p>
              <p>liverpool cant match chelsea pay packet, chances of winning trophy are slimmer than winning 4D.</p>

              <p>imo as a Chelsea fan, I think this is a great transfer.</p>
              <p>Put aside the financial reglation issues but heck Torres is really a superb signing. It just shows that Chelsea really wants to win something, maybe CL? I dont know, Torres can't play CL, can he?</p>
              <p>The main point is that we were all moaning about Darren Bent's price from Sunderland to Villa at 24m, but come this Andry Carrol who is only proven half a season and is already sold at 35m.</p>
              <p>Add in 10m, you get an internationally proven striker and WC winner - Fernando Torres. It isn't a bad deal after all. Whatsmore Torres has scored many goals despite of his injuries.</p>

              <p>he is eligible for CL this season cos he only played in Europa league...no doubt he is a very good striker, as long as he take care of his hamstring and of course he has to stop sulking when he is out there on the pitch...</p>

              Looks like the arrival of Torres has inspired the likes of Anelka and Drogba to perform to the best of their abilities, as evident in the victory over Sunderland last night. Can't help but relate to how Drogba rose to top form with the arrival of Andrei Shevchenko many years ago. Hopefully Torres won't end up like that 30m pd flop though :p
              
              I guess with the arrival of Torres, Kalou would now be spending more time on the bench, with Anelka, Drogba and Malouda as the other attacking options. The question is, who will be leading the line? Drogba or Torres?

              <p>The parents can always give relatively common first names with Liverpool connotations.</p>
              <p>Say, John (John Barnes), Ian (Ian Rush), James (Jamie Redknapp/Carragher), Kenneth (Kenny Dalglish), William (Bill Shankly)..... the list goes on.</p>
              <p>I swear, if I ever come across a baby named Fernando Torres Lim, or Dirk Kuyt Tan, I'll roll on the floor laughing.</p>

              <p>Torres is a good striker but so far, apart from his first season, he has been quite injury prone in the last 2... No doubt he would be a plus for Chelsea and when he is motivated as I belief he will be at Chelsea, we may see an even better Torres cos somehow, I felt his body language playing for Pool this last 2 seasons seems like disinterested kind... Sometimes want to play, play. Sometimes don't want to play, don't show up kind...</p>
              <p>Anyway, Torres is now history for Pool. It must have been very disappointing for them that Torres have done this. But life goes on... and Pool themselves have 2 new strikers as well...</p>
              <p>Though I still feel both could have been got at a lower sum, but I think Carroll may end up being not too bad a signing. Cos the guy got something Torres is missing... The passion like Rooney, Tevez, Bellamy... Not all players have this. But must know how to use it also lah otherwise he end up like an expensive Kuyt...</p>
