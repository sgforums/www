              <p>The reason he has asked to leave so late in the window I guess is probably he wasn't aware Chelsea were seriously interested in him at first... But having been told by his agent or read from the Press reports coming out... He probably went to ask Pool management if there was indeed a bid for him from Chelsea... Then the rest as they say is history...</p>
              <p>I think Pool didn't wanted to let him know about the bid from Chelsea for him especially so late in the window...  But the Press got inside info either from Pool or Chelsea side... That's why this news is so accurate even from the breaking moment...</p>
              <p>Now Pool are desperate and seems to have to pay more for Suarez...  From their last bid of £12 over million, now they have agreed to pay £22.8 million...</p>
              <p>My personally opinion is... Pool got shot on both sides of the deal cos they could have got more for Torres last season when City &amp; Chelsea were looking... Some mentioned $60 to $80m having seen Ronaldo go for that price remember? But now it's only $40m for a player of Torres finishing skills... Then on to Suarez... With the uncertainty over the Torres situation, and the closing window approaching, it has forced them to pay almost the full amount Ajax asked  £22.8 million...</p>
              <p>Paying so much for a player from the Dutch league is risky and overpriced... From  £12+ million to almost £23 million... It seems like a panic buy.</p>
              <p>Cos there are many examples of "top strikers" in the recent Dutch league like Alves, <span style="color: #000000;">Huntelaar... all not done that well after moving to bigger leagues... Anyway, even if he does well, it's still overpriced considering he is from the Dutch league and they are trying to get rid of him after disciplinary problems over there...</span></p>
              <p>I guess Torres probably don't belief Kenny can do any better than the last few either... But if Pool got Mourinho, it could be a different matter...</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I think 22.8million for Suarez is well worth it when you consider Bent already cost 25 million and Dzeko 27 million? To be honest, 12million is abit ridiculous if you ask me..he was Dutch top scorer last season as well as Ducth footballer of the year...</p>
              <p>AND I don't think Liverpool will sell Torres for less than 40million...he is a good finisher but he has alot of weaknesses if you do watch his every game. He is not in the same class as Ronaldo...I am sure Liverpool will not allow him to leave now but most probably during the summer. Gotta cash on him then...</p>

              <p><br>Though you are right, Ruud did move for that sum but the Dutch league then and now is miles apart... The PSV, Ajax and even Feyenoord could get to the later stages or even win the European Cup / CL but the present Dutch representives would be lucky to get pass the first round...  </p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">
              </span></p><p>Those days, the players they exported were like Dennis Bergkamp, Jaap Stam, Mark van Bommel, Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder, Rafael van der Vaart, Boudewijn Zenden, Clarence Seedorf, Patrick Kluivert, Marc Overmars... The list goes on and we can see the quality is there. But of the last few years...</p>
              Afonso Alves, <span style="color: #000000;">Salomon Kalou</span><span style="color: #000000;">, Huntelaar, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Dirk Kuyt... I think </span>Middlesbrough paid a club record for Alves but got relegated to the Championship at the end cos he only gave them 4 goals in 31 league games... And that from a top scorer in the Dutch league... 31 games 34 goals...<p></p>

              <p><br>Errr... I think you mistaken him with Shevchenko lah... Berbatov only turn 30 today... Even at this hour in England, he isn't 30 yet also... And he signed for United 2 1/2 years liao...</p>
              <p>To be honest, if Torres can stay injury free, even $60m would be worth it... On Sturridge, thought he had good potential but unfortunately, after 1, 2 yrs... I think he has actually become a worse player than when he first left City... lol.</p>
              <p>So not too surprise Chelsea are offering him in a package deal... Cos they thought they sign him for free so they offered him a high salary but in the end, the tribunal decided they had to pay about $3+m I think to City. So whoever takes him would have to continue paying him his higher than usual salary for a youth player who have not even made it to the first team... </p>
              <p>So I don't think Pool would be that silly to want him as they already have Ngog in that same category who I think is a slight better than him too...</p>

              <p><br>You really think it's well worth it? Is it your heart or your head saying this? Don't you think it's rather too high of a sum to pay for a player from the Dutch league?</p>
              <p>Afonso Alves another top scorer South Americian in the Dutch league went for like $12m only and Huntelaar, also another top scorer in the Dutch league... went for like $18m...</p>
              <p>Well, Alves Play 31 Score 34, Play 8, Score 11...</p>
              <p>Huntelaar Play 34 Score 33</p>

              <p>I would say Pool would have done better by paying another $2m and getting Bent instead... At least the guy is English somemore and will help with the quota apart from a proven goal scorer in the Premier League...</p>

He played the full 90 minutes for the Londoners in Saturday's 1-1 draw against Everton in the FA Cup fourth round but has played for eight different clubs in his career, including Liverpool on loan in 2002.<br><br>Chelsea would still prefer to offload Sturridge, who has failed to spark since joining from Manchester City in 2009 and attracted interest from Liverpool last month but is considered as a prospect for the future rather than someone who is ready to deliver now.<br><br>Liverpool turned down an opening £35m offer from Chelsea for Torres on Thursday and are determined that their star striker will only leave under their terms, despite the player's desire to leave Anfield.<br><br>“Fernando is under long-term contract and the club expect him to honour the commitment he made to Liverpool FC and its supporters when he signed the agreement,” said the club in a statement on Friday night.<br><br>There are conflicting reports as to whether or not Torres' contract, which expires in summer 2013, includes a buyout clause that will allow him to leave if a club offers £50m after the end of the season. Goal revealed on Friday that he has made up his mind that he will not be playing for Liverpool by the start of next season.<br><br>Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is determined to complete a deal for the World Cup winner, who he also tried to sign last summer but was rebuffed by the Merseyside club.<br><br>When contacted by Goal, a Liverpool spokesman said: "We don't comment on transfer speculation."<br><br></span></div>

              <p>Actually, giving Anelka wouldn't be a huge lose to Chelsea cos the guy is like coming to 32 yrs old in a month time and his contract is finishing and not even sure if Chelsea will offer him a new one. So in a way, they can more or less cash in on him and at the same time reduce the age of their ageing squad especially in their strike force department...</p>
              <p>Since Pool value Anelka at $8m, so a $42m plus Anelka would do the trick I guess...</p>
              <p>But if Roman not happy and digs in, he might just make it a "Take it of leave it" to Pool... Take $42m + Daniel Sturridge or accept lesser if you want Anelka...</p>
              <p>As the window nears... Pool will be hard press cos I think they have very little choice cos they will see no point keeping an unhappy player in the squad... And Torres probably won't want to walk out onto Anfield anytime soon...</p>

              <p>The weird thing about this deal if it goes through... Torres could be in the Chelsea line-up against Pool next weekend... But not at Anfield lah, so he will be ok... lol.</p>
              <p>But seriously, $110,000 compare to $200,000 a week... who wouldn't want right? So can't blame him also lah...</p>

              <p>wat a joke. one has to understand, who anelka want to join liverpool?</p>
              <p>just ask yourself.</p>
              <p>1. what happen to anelka the last time he was a liverpool player?</p>
              <p>2. give up UCL football to join maybe not even europa football next year?</p>
              <p>liverpool you are fighting a losing battle trying to clinch on to a player who no longer want to play for you.</p>
              <p>liverpool is in downhill. too late to nature young talents now, no star players want to stay let alone sign for you. a manager kenny, that is more of a desperate man paying crazy money for suarez?? i would rather you sign adebayor who is proven for that money.  liverpool totally lost the plot!! and lost big time!!</p>

              <p>Probably only a short term solution because come to think of it, should Torres really be sold, Liverpool will be left with Suarez (if he signs) Kuyt (if Dalglish decides to put him as a striker), N'Gog and Jovanovic up front, hardly a wise decision right?</p>
              <p>And Daniel Sturridge is still unproven, so taking Anelka would be a short-term solution, an experienced striker that at least can last the 2nd half of the season before yet another replacement is purchased (or not).</p>

              <p>To be honest, I really think he is worth the money but at the end of the day, we need to see his performance to judge, and we shall see. I am not expecting him to bang in goals like Torres in his first half season here (he is no Torres and I am sure Torres is a more prolific  goal scorer than him). But one thing I like about him is that he can play as a main striker or be a supporting striker. And he also can play as a winger as well (he started there). He is a versatile player.</p>

              <p>But I hope he want to pay 50m+ for Torres as it will really help Liverpool. Can't imagine how low the dressing room would be if the transfer doesn't go through...having the need to share the same team with someone who doesnt really want to play just sucks!</p>
