              <p><span><strong>Chelsea have made a stunning £35million offer for Liverpool striker Fernando Torres, only to see it flatly rejected.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>A Liverpool spokesman confirmed: 'Chelsea have made a bid for Fernando, which has been turned down. The player is not for sale.'</span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>However, Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich will not be deterred and is expected to return with an increased offer for the 26-year-old, who had a £50m get-out clause written into his Anfield contract last summer.</span></p>
              <p><span>The Barclays Premier League champions have been admirers of Torres for many years and have now made a move to try to get their title bid back on track.</span></p>
              <p><span>Abramovich has been disappointed by the slump in form endured by Carlo Ancelotti's team this season and, with Didier Drogba turning 33 in March, feels it is now time to splash out on a new star striker at Stamford Bridge.</span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Transfer talk: Liverpool insist striker Fernando Torres is not for sale</em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span><strong>Liverpool's owners, the Fenway Sports Group, are said to be determined to fend off Chelsea's interest and keep hold of the Spain World Cup winner, who arrived at Anfield from Atletico Madrid for £21m in the summer of 2007.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Torres has suffered a difficult season after returning injured from Spain's World Cup campaign in South Africa last summer. </span></p>
              <p><span>However, the appointment of Kenny Dalglish as manager following the departure of Roy Hodgson appears to have lifted the striker, who has shown his prolific form of old in recent weeks, scoring three goals in four matches.</span></p>
              <p><span>Chelsea will have to move quickly if they want to tie up a deal for Torres before the transfer window closes at 11pm on Monday, but it will take a huge offer to persuade Liverpool chairman John W Henry to sanction the sale.</span></p>
              <p><span>Henry will be wary of a backlash from the Anfield faithful should they lose their talisman, while the likes of skipper Steven Gerrard would also see his departure as a sign that the club lacks ambition, and may even force him to consider his own future.</span></p>
              <p><span>Torres's contract, which runs until the summer of 2013, is worth £110,000 a week but Chelsea could easily double that. </span></p>

              <p>The Kop superstar has made it clear he wants the Merseysiders to accept the £40m offer the Blues tabled this week.</p>
              <p>A top Reds' source said: "Unfortunately Fernando has decided he wants to leave Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"It is a very sad day for all of us, but now we have to wait and see what the club decides.</p>

              <p><strong>"It is clear this is the last thing Kenny Dalglish expected although it has been clear for some time that Torres' patience has run out." </strong></p>
              <p>SunSport understands the Spanish striker will either put in a transfer request or issue a statement later today.</p>
              <p>His representatives were examining all possibilities before making a final decision.</p>
              <p>Torres will say in his statement that he believes it is best for both parties to accept the offer because he believes it is a good one for Liverpool and a good one for himself</p>
              <p>It is understood Chelsea will offer him wages of £150,000 a week — matching the club's top earners John Terry and Frank Lampard.</p>
              <p>Liverpool fans will be heartbroken, particularly as their rivalry with the Double winners has become second only to that with Manchester United following Jose Mourinho's reign at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>Reds do not believe Torres would ever join one of their fiercest rivals and his decision is certain to leave Anfield shell-shocked.</p>
              <p>It is precisely for that reason that Torres' representatives are carefully weighing up the options before taking the next step.</p>

              <p>Torres joined Liverpool to play champion league soccer and not to fight a battle of relegation.</p>
              <p>So, he may be planning a move to the Blues for a while so that he can stay in his national squad.</p>
              <p>I am a bit appointed with the non-urgency of the Liverpool management in securing signature of more players.</p>
              <p>It seems like both the transfer deal will be doomed for failure if they dun agreed by Sat.</p>
              <p>Therefore, it is pointless for Torres to stick around fighting a lone striker battle if the rest of the squad are simply not strong.</p>

              <p><br>Suarez is joining pending medical...<br>Torres has all the right to ask for transfer but asking it 4 days before transfer window shut is quite dissapointing of him. He asked the board to fix the ownership issue (done), he was unhappy with Roy Hodgson style (KK has improved the team and Torres' form), He asked for addition (Liverpool has just signed Suarez)...he has to at least wait until end of the season (I've expected him to leave anyway at the end of the season).</p>
              <p>But maybe the board asked him not to leave first until Liverpool got his replacement (Suarez)? Dunno...</p>

              <p>The reason he has asked to leave so late in the window I guess is probably he wasn't aware Chelsea were seriously interested in him at first... But having been told by his agent or read from the Press reports coming out... He probably went to ask Pool management if there was indeed a bid for him from Chelsea... Then the rest as they say is history...</p>
              <p>I think Pool didn't wanted to let him know about the bid from Chelsea for him especially so late in the window...  But the Press got inside info either from Pool or Chelsea side... That's why this news is so accurate even from the breaking moment...</p>
              <p>Now Pool are desperate and seems to have to pay more for Suarez...  From their last bid of £12 over million, now they have agreed to pay £22.8 million...</p>
              <p>My personally opinion is... Pool got shot on both sides of the deal cos they could have got more for Torres last season when City &amp; Chelsea were looking... Some mentioned $60 to $80m having seen Ronaldo go for that price remember? But now it's only $40m for a player of Torres finishing skills... Then on to Suarez... With the uncertainty over the Torres situation, and the closing window approaching, it has forced them to pay almost the full amount Ajax asked  £22.8 million...</p>
              <p>Paying so much for a player from the Dutch league is risky and overpriced... From  £12+ million to almost £23 million... It seems like a panic buy.</p>
              <p>Cos there are many examples of "top strikers" in the recent Dutch league like Alves, <span style="color: #000000;">Huntelaar... all not done that well after moving to bigger leagues... Anyway, even if he does well, it's still overpriced considering he is from the Dutch league and they are trying to get rid of him after disciplinary problems over there...</span></p>
              <p>I guess Torres probably don't belief Kenny can do any better than the last few either... But if Pool got Mourinho, it could be a different matter...</p>

              <p>It could be that Liverpool already knew Torres was leaving so they went in for Saurez.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I reckon Liverpool will take this time to start the rebuilding process by allowing players like Gerrard to leave soon too should Torres really join Chelsea. </p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">LIVERPOOL last night turned down a stunning transfer request from Fernando Torres.</h2>
              <p>The Anfield outfit also threatened to report Chelsea to the Premier League for allegedly "tapping up" the Spanish striker.</p>
              <p>They claim Blues went to Torres and his agents to set up a deal before making their £40million bid. Yesterday's high drama also saw:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <li>Liverpool snub a new offer of £42.5m plus hitman Daniel Sturridge.
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              </li>
              <li>Torres tell Liverpool that he wants a transfer - only for the club to reject his request.
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              </li>
              <li>Kop sources admit a £50m cash offer may change their mind.
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              </li>
              <li>Hitman Luis Suarez join the Reds for £23m from Dutch outfit Ajax.
              <p> </p>
              <p>Liverpool believe that Chelsea have done an 'Ashley Cole' by speaking to the Torres camp without permission.</p>
              <p>A senior Anfield source said: "It's clear Fernando has had his head turned and Chelsea have 'previous' for that sort of thing, don't they?</p>
              <p>"Ashley Cole springs to mind and it looks like they've been at it again here."</p>
              <p>SunSport can reveal Chelsea increased their offer for Torres by £2½m yesterday and threw Sturridge, 21, into the mix.</p>
              <p>And Chelsea intend to keep up the pressure, with a Blues insider saying: "Liverpool don't want to sell but a lot depends on the player's wishes."</p>
              <p>There is also a belief that Liverpool's stand could also be swayed if Chelsea up their offer to £50m.</p>
              <p>Spanish hitman Torres, 26, has told the club he wants to join Chelsea, who are offering £200,000-a-week.</p>
              <p>A pal of Torres said: "He believes it's the best thing for himself and Liverpool. He wants to be part of a team capable of competing at the highest level."</p>
              <p>Liverpool have worked tirelessly to persuade Torres to stay since Chelsea's initial £40m bid.</p>
              <p>And, last night, a club statement insisted: "Fernando Torres submitted a transfer request which has been rejected by Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"Fernando is under long-term contract and the club expect him to honour the commitment he made when he signed the agreement."</p>
              <p>But while the battle over Torres rumbled on, Liverpool finally signed Uruguay World Cup striker Suarez, 24, after Ajax accepted an increased offer following talks in Amsterdam.</p>
              <p>Suarez, who will sign a five-year contract, said: "This is a dream come true for me."</p>
