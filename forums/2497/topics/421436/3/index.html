              <p>Probably only a short term solution because come to think of it,
              should Torres really be sold, Liverpool will be left with Suarez
              (if he signs) Kuyt (if Dalglish decides to put him as a striker),
              N'Gog and Jovanovic up front, hardly a wise decision right?</p>
              <p>And Daniel Sturridge is still unproven, so taking Anelka would
              be a short-term solution, an experienced striker that at least can
              last the 2nd half of the season before yet another replacement is
              purchased (or not).</p>

              <p>Ok so what are the back-up options?</p>
              <p>If Babel hardly gets to start Luis Suarez might not be that lucky though, They should look for more experienced forwards like Loic Remy from OM, Mario Gomez from BM or someone with experience in the Premier League. </p>

              <p>To be honest, I really think he is worth the money but at the end of the day, we need to see his performance to judge, and we shall see. I am not expecting him to bang in goals like Torres in his first half season here (he is no Torres and I am sure Torres is a more prolific  goal scorer than him). But one thing I like about him is that he can play as a main striker or be a supporting striker. And he also can play as a winger as well (he started there). He is a versatile player.</p>

              <p><br>I am not saying he is a poor player... Seen him play before and he isn't a bad player but what I am saying is... Pool shouldn't be paying that much for him...</p>
              <p>I belief they could have got him a lot cheaper if they know how to negotiate like the gunners management...</p>
              <p>For all we know, this Suarez could be at the same level with Marouane Chamakh or Javier Hernandez only and they cost... under $7m. Get what I mean...</p>
              <p>Here is a player whose club can't wait to get rid of him cos of the problem he created for them and he also wants to leave the Dutch league... So it make no sense to go and pay that much when there was no one fighting with them for him... lol.</p>
              <p>And what make you say "he is no Torres and I am sure Torres is a more prolific goal scorer than him" ? Isn't his transfer fee more? Didn't he score more goals than Torres before they join Liverpool? So why shouldn't he?</p>
              <p>He kind of remind me of an Argentina player that played for Barce and Real... But can't remember his name...</p>

              <p><span><strong>Fernando Torres is joining Chelsea after Liverpool caved in to accept an incredible offer in the region of £50million.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The Spanish striker will now join the champions after they smashed the British transfer record. Liverpool have already agreed stunning £35m deal to buy Newcastle's Andy Carroll as a replacement.</span></p>
              <p><span>Torres will be handed a whopping £45m package at Stamford Bridge with the five-year deal earning him £175,000 a week.</span></p>
              <p><span>The Spaniard, whose £110,000-a-week deal at Liverpool ran until the summer of 2013, handed in an official transfer request at the end of last week, and the two clubs have been in negotiations over the weekend.</span></p>
              <p><span>Liverpool, who paid £21m for Torres in July 2007, were tempted to hang on to the striker and let the transfer window close without a deal. However, they feared being left with a disillusioned star who would rather be at another club could be the worst of all worlds.</span></p>
              <p><span>The feeling among some players in the Liverpool dressing-room is the same, with several team-mates thinking that if Torres does not want to be at the club then he should be allowed to leave.</span></p>

              <p><strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/873633/konchesky-joins-forest-on-loan?cc=5739"></a></strong></p>
              <p>Torres
               has signed a five-and-a-half-year contract that puts his earnings on a 
              par with the highest paid players at Stamford Bridge - such as captain 
              John Terry and Frank Lampard.</p>
              <p>Torres joined Liverpool following a 
              £20 million move from Atletico Madrid in 2007 and set a new record for 
              the most prolific foreign goalscorer ever in a debut season in England, 
              beating <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8852/Ruud-van-Nistelrooy">Ruud van Nistelrooy</a>'s 23 goals for Manchester United.</p>
              <p>The
               26-year-old scored 65 goals during his three year stay at Anfield and 
              although he helped Liverpool finish second in the Premier League in the 
              2008-09 season, the club missed out on qualification for the Champions 
              League last term and Torres leaves having failed to win a trophy.</p>
              <p>That
               is something he will be hoping to put right at Stamford Bridge as the 
              reigning Premier League champions look to defend their title and go one 
              better than Chelsea's Champions League final appearance in 2008.</p>
              <p>Speaking
               at Stamford Bridge after finalising the move, Torres, who was also 
              pictured with a Chelsea shirt said: "I am very happy with my transfer to
               Chelsea and I am looking forward very much to helping my new team-mates
               this season and for many years to come. Having played against Chelsea 
              many times since coming to England, and in some very big games I will 
              never forget, I know there are many great players here and I will work 
              hard to win a place in the team. I hope I can score some important goals
               for the supporters to enjoy this season."</p>
              <p>"This is a very 
              significant day for Chelsea, capturing one of the best players in the 
              world with his peak years ahead of him," said Chelsea chairman Bruce 
              Buck. "We have long admired the talents of a player who is a proven 
              goalscorer in English football and Fernando's arrival is a sign of our 
              continuing high ambitious. I hope every Chelsea fan is as excited as I 
              am with this news."</p>
              <p>Blues Chief executive Ron Gourlay added: 
              "Signing a player of the stature of Fernando Torres benefits the club on
               many levels. Carlo Ancelotti was keen to add his talents to the squad 
              as we continue our quest for three trophies this season, we are 
              delighted we have succeed with that wish, and this signing will 
              undoubtedly aid the club in realising our worldwide potential."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile,
               Liverpool have confirmed the loan signing of Coventry midfielder Conor 
              Thomas, 17, with a view to a permanent deal at the end of the season.</p>

              <p>Carroll,
               22, was targeted by Liverpool as a replacement for Fernando Torres, who
               will join Chelsea in a deal worth up to £50 million.</p>
              <p>Liverpool 
              failed with an offer for the Newcastle striker earlier on Monday but 
              persisted with their interest and convinced the Magpies to sell their 
              No. 9, who had drawn favourable comparisons with his predecessor Alan 
              Shearer.</p>
              <p>A Liverpool statement read: "Andy Carroll has tonight 
              completed his transfer from Newcastle United to Liverpool FC and signed a
               five-and-a-half-year deal that will keep him at Anfield until 2016.</p>
              <p>"The
               club agreed a record transfer fee with Newcastle earlier in the day for
               the transfer of the England international striker. The deal was subject
               to the completion of a medical, which the player has now passed. Andy 
              Carroll will wear the No. 9 shirt for Liverpool."</p>
              <p>While Carroll 
              has been in impressive form this season, scoring 11 goals in the Premier
               League and winning his first international cap, the size of the 
              transfer fee has raised eyebrows, exceeding as it does the £30.3 million
               Manchester United paid Leeds for <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/7825/Rio-Ferdinand">Rio Ferdinand</a> in 2002.</p>
              <p>Following
               Torres' exit, Carroll will play alongside Luis Suarez, who completed 
              his £22.7 million move from Ajax to Liverpool earlier on Monday night.</p>
              <p>Torres' move to Chelsea also means that Carroll's transfer is the eighth most lucrative of all time.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, on a day when they signed <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/46525/Stephen-Ireland">Stephen Ireland</a> on loan from Aston Villa and attempted to bing Wigan winger <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/44626/Charles-N%27Zogbia">Charles N'Zogbia</a> back to the club, Newcastle also loaned striker Xisco to Deportivo La Coruna.</p>
              <p>Xisco
               said on the Depor website: "I'm returning to my home. Deportivo have 
              given me everything and I've come here focused on helping the team reach
               their objectives."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">CHELSEA have signed Fernando Torres for a British record fee of £50m from Liverpool.</h2>
              <p>The Spanish striker has signed a deal with the Blues until the summer of 2016 worth a whopping £8m a year.</p>
              <p>The cash-only transfer was given the go-ahead by Kop boss Kenny Dalglish after the Reds reached agreement with Newcastle striker Andy Carroll over a £35m move.</p>
              <p>Torres passed a medical at Chelsea's Cobham training HQ tonight and will be unveiled later this week.</p>
              <p>Blues owner Roman Abramovich hopes Spanish hitman Torres can help deliver the Champions League triumph he craves.</p>
              <p>Liverpool reluctantly let Torres go after he put in a transfer request on Friday.</p>
              <p>The deal exceeds the £32.5m Manchester City forked out to sign Robinho from Real Madrid in August 2008.</p>
