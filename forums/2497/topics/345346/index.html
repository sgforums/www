              <h2>A player who had been honoured by his club because they thought he was dead is actually still alive.</h2>
              <p id="ynw-article-part2">Imagine finding out a minute's silence was
              being held at your former football club to honour your life; reading
              your obituary in your local newspaper; and learning that your death had
              also been noted in a matchday programme.</p>
              <p id="ynw-article-part2">That
              is precisely what happened to Tommy Farrer when Northern League
              Division One club Bishop Auckland FC - who have been established for
              over 123 years - decided to pay tribute to the 86 year-old's
              contribution prior to a non-League game against Newcastle Banfield last
              week.</p>
              <p id="ynw-article-part2">Bishop Auckland have a rich
              history, boasting ten FA Amateur Cups, together with multiple regional
              honours. Farrer played a key part in some of that success as he
              featured in three Wembley finals.</p>
              <p id="ynw-article-part2">Farrer
              is reported to have said he was surprised to hear about his death, but
              preferred to play down the mistake as he wanted to - according to the
              Press Association - "let it die."Â </p>
              <p id="ynw-article-part2">Farrer
              is currently enjoying his retirement in Maidstone, Kent, along with his
              wife of 65 years Gladys. They first heard of the mistake when a club
              official phoned to offer Gladys their condolences.</p>
              <p id="ynw-article-part2">"We are not upset, but we did think it was a bit of a joke at first," Farrer said.</p>
              <p id="ynw-article-part2">He went on though to mention how he was "touched" at being described a legend.</p>
              <p>One memorable career moment for Farrer was when Auckland played a barefoot team from Nigeria in 1949.</p>
