              <div><span><strong>Bayern Munich have already reached an agreement with AC Milan midfielder Gennaro Gattuso, according to reports. The Italy international has been targeted by the Bundesliga club to boost their team for an assault on the Champions League next season while striker Luca Toni has repeatedly stated he would welcome a compatriot in the Bayern team next season.</strong> </span></div>

              <p>According to Italy's Italia 1 television, the Bavarians have been able to convince the 30-year-old to join with a lucrative contract offer and are now set for talks with his club over a fee.</p>
              <p>Earlier this week, Bayern president Franz Beckenbauer claimed Gattuso would be "perfect" for Bayern. With Milan having signed Mathieu Flamini from Arsenal, Gattuso may now be allowed to leave should the club receive the right offer, believed to be around 20million euros.</p>
              <p>The Rossoneri may also ask for unsettled Bayern full-back Willy Sagnol as a makeweight for a deal, according to reports in Italy and Germany.</p>

              <p>If you seen serie A this guy has lost alot of his fire, player of his kind who relies on physical play, loses his power when age comes and his physical level drops. He no longer the player he used to be.</p>
              <p>With average technique and tactical sense with his strongest aspect pf physical play dropping due to age.</p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>For many years Italy always appeared to lack a certain type of centre
              midfielder, a strong and fearless bulldog who would launch himself into
              tackles, get stuck in, fire up his team-mates, and really wear his
              heart on his sleeve.   <br><br>There was never a shortage of technical
              or tactical quality, but if you ever watch over videos from the 1994
              and 1998 World Cups you will notice just how fragile the Azzurri could
              be in the middle-of-the-park. The real strength was located in defence
              and up-front, and it was these two areas that allowed them to have
              successful tournaments.   <br><br>This all changed when Gattuso burst
              onto the scene. When he was recognised as a regular in 2004, Italy
              finally had themselves a player who would offer some real steel in the
              centre of midfield. Tactically and technically he was average, but he
              brought something to the Italy team, a kind of British spirit, that had
              been missing for many years. It is no coincidence that two years later,
              La Nazionale would go on to lift the World Cup.   <br><br>Gattuso was equally crucial to the Milan team who dominated the Champions League for half-a-decade.   <br><br>Like
              Italy, the Rossoneri have not been short of tactical or technical
              quality. Andrea Pirlo, Clarence Seedorf, Kaka, Andriy Shevchenko, Rui
              Costa – these are just a few of the wonderfully gifted offensive
              players that the Diavoli have had at their disposal.   <br><br>However
              without Gattuso, Milan would have been like Italy during the 94 and 98
              World Cups – they would have been fragile and brittle in the centre of
              midfield, and it is debatable, despite all this talent above, whether
              they would have been half as successful as they have been.   <br><br>This
              season Gattuso has been a shadow of his terrier-like self. At the age
              of 30 it appears that his advancing years are starting to take their
              toll. Gattuso’s whole game, as I explained in a Calcio Debate several
              weeks ago, is based around “aggression, stamina, and closing down the
              opposition. In order to do this, Gattuso needs to be in tip-top
              physical shape. His pace, acceleration and energy levels have certainly
              dropped this year, and as a result he cannot make the tackles he once
              was able to.”   <br><br>The heart and determination of Gattuso is
              definitely still there, but the body just will not follow. As ‘Ringhio’
              is not the strongest of players tactically and technically, his game
              really suffers once his physical strengths diminish.   <br><br>It is
              no coincidence, given Gattuso’s importance to Milan over the past six
              years or so, that with the midfielder having a poor season, the
              Rossoneri have also had a disappointing season.   <br><br>There have been strong reports that Milan are looking to begin a new era at the club by selling Gattuso in the summer.   <br><br>Given what has just been explained above - is this be a good idea?   <br><br>Well providing Gattuso can rediscover his physical sharpness, then certainly he must not be sold.   <br><br>However
              it is very debatable, given his age and what the law of physics tells
              us about bodily decline, whether he will ever be back to his old
              levels.   <br><br>Gattuso is not Roberto Baggio, who once he had lost
              his pace, could use his incredible technique and guile to adapt his
              game and still be a top-class player. This is just not possible with
              Gattuso, as is the case with many modern footballers, who are only good
              while their athletic capacity lasts.   <br><br>Perhaps the time is
              right for both sides to go their separate ways. At the age of 30, Milan
              could still command a reasonably good fee, and there is sure to be a
              long-list of suitors. Indeed Real Madrid are rumoured to be prepared to
              table a significant offer.   <br><br>A new challenge may also do
              Gattuso some good. After nine years at Milan, perhaps things have
              become a little stale, and a new experience abroad may revitalise him.
                <br><br>As a replacement Milan surely can look no further than
              Arsenal’s Matthieu Flamini. Arsene Wenger seems resigned to losing the
              midfielder, who has a scarily similar style of play to Gattuso. The
              Frenchman is also available on a free transfer, and if he were to
              arrive at San Siro, there is no doubt that he would be a class act. At
              the age of 23 he has his whole career ahead of him, and would also
              provide Milan with some much-needed young blood.</p>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><p>Thats the reason why Milan has signed Flamini and willing to let him go... Yeah i agree Gattuso isn't the player he used to be, but he still has lots of experience and probably can go on for another 2 yrs... German league would suit him better... as the pace isn't as fast and it could also prolong his career...</p></div>
