              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ARSENE WENGER and Sol Campbell slammed blunder ref Martin Hansson after Arsenal were made to look like lemons.</h2>
              <p class="article">Angry boss Wenger insisted Porto should not have been allowed to take a quick free-kick - after a cock-up between Lukasz Fabianski and Campbell - which led to Falcao's 51st-minute winner.</p>
              <p class="article">Furious Campbell claimed the referee then blocked him as he attempted to defend the free-kick.</p>
              <p class="article">Blunder keeper Fabianski had already gifted Porto their opener from Silvestre Varela's cross before Campbell equalised.</p>
              <p class="article">Swede Hansson was the ref who allowed Thierry Henry's 'Hand of Frog' goal which ended the Republic of Ireland's World Cup dream.</p>
              <p class="article">Wenger said: "It was a massive mistake to allow Porto to take the free-kick. You go from a situation where there is no free-kick, to one taken quickly where there is no chance to defend. The ref gave them a goal.</p>
              <p class="article">"What can you do? I believe first of all it was an accidental back-pass.</p>
              <p class="article">"Sol kicked it back with a toe kick - the ball hit Sol, it was not on purpose. It has to be intentional to be a free-kick.</p>
              <p class="article">"Then, in an indirect free-kick, if you allow a team to take it quickly so near the goal, how can you defend that?</p>
              <p class="article">"It's better than a penalty. I've never seen that and I've been in the game a long time. You cannot defend that, you cannot organise."</p>
              <p class="article">Campbell said: "The ref was 20 yards away. And then from the free-kick he was blocking me from getting to the ball. It was a bit of a nightmare.</p>
              <p class="article">"He was blocking me and that gave them an advantage. It was quick thinking from them but what can I do - shove the ref out of the way?"</p>
              <p class="article">Yet Arsenal skipper Cesc Fabregas slammed his bungling team.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "The goals were schoolboy goals. After the second one, we were too soft. We were not strong enough to stand up."</p>

              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger slated referee Martin Hansson last night and refused to blame his stand-in goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski for giving away both Porto goals in their Champions League last-16 tie.</strong></p>
              <p>‘The referee gave them a goal,’ fumed <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal</span></a> manager Wenger after Hansson<br>allowed a quick indirect free-kick that led to Porto’s first-leg winner.</p>
              <p>Fabianski had earlier pushed Silvestre Varela’s cross into his own net, although the ball was going out for a goalkick. And after Sol Campbell equalised, the Pole blundered again, picking up a back pass from Campbell and then giving the ball back immediately to let Falcao score before Arsenal could react.</p>
              <p>Wenger insisted justice will be done at the Emirates in a fortnight and said: ‘You go from a situation where there is no free-kick to one taken quickly where there is no chance to defend.</p>
              <p>‘It was an accidental back pass. He kicked it back with a toe kick — the ball hit Sol — it has to be intentional. Then, with an indirect free-kick, if you allow a team to take it quickly five metres from goal, how can you defend that? It’s better than a penalty. I’ve never seen that and I’ve been in the game a long time.</p>
              <p>‘We were really disappointed that the referee allowed them to play a quick free-kick. That encourages players to be unfair. If you give the ball back, as Fabianski did, he touches it and they score. It’s difficult to understand, but maybe I’m not intelligent enough.’</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Cesc Fabregas was more critical of Arsenal’s performance and had no issue with the manner of Porto’s winner. He said: ‘After the second one, we were too soft. We were not strong enough to stand up. I have no complaints about the second goal. Maybe I would have done the same. We have nothing to complain about.’</strong></p>
              <p>Wenger refused to be drawn on yet another calamitous performance by Fabianski.<br>‘I do not want to come out on individual performances. I do not want to judge him in front of everybody. We lose as a team and win as a team. Any individual performance has not necessarily to be analysed publicly. We are still in the tie.’</p>

              <p>For me, I feel there is nothing wrong with Porto's second goal... The important thing was on the defence not to go to sleep and it clearly happened with Thomas Vermaelen.</p>
              <p>Anyway, Wenger can't really complain much cos Arsenal under him have done this many times already taking quick free-kicks even when Henry was still there... So all we can say is what goes around comes around i guess... But Gunners still look good enough to get through in the 2nd leg.</p>

              <p><strong>Technically, there is nothing wrong with the goal, nor the actions of the referee Martin Hansson. There has clearly been a transgression of law with Sol Campbell's backpass and, once the referee has awarded the free-kick, the rule is that advantage is immediately given back to the team who have been wronged.</strong></p>
              <p>In the spirit of the law, it can be argued that the defending team should be given an opportunity to regroup before the kick is taken, but that responsibility falls to the players.</p>
              <p>Fabianski could have held on to the ball or thrown it away - as we see so often - thus risking a yellow card but ensuring that Porto would not be able to take a quick free-kick. As for the role of the Porto players, how many times did we see Thierry Henry take a quick free-kick during his Arsenal days under Arsene Wenger?</p>
              <p>Most memorably, in an FA Cup tie against Chelsea - and we didn't hear his manager complaining then.It could perhaps be argued that Hansson's positioning prevents Sol Campbell from making an attempt to get back, but that doesn't make the referee wrong.</p>
              <p>West Ham and Chelsea fans will remember a similar situation involving myself in a Premier League match some years ago, when I was standing between the ball and West Ham's goal, and then stepped aside to allow Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink to take a quick free-kick, which flew past David James into the net. Looking back at it, I admit that my positioning could have been better but, in this case, Hansson hasn't blocked the view of the Arsenal goalkeeper and, by, asking for Fabianski to hand the ball back, cannot be accused of taking the Gunners by surprise.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption">3. Fabianski turns his back to retreat to his goal, while at the same time appearing to protest his innocence to the assistant on the far side. The goalkeeper must be aware that, having handed over the ball, Porto are permitted to take their free-kick immediately, which Ruben does.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption">5. Falcao strokes the ball into the net just as Fabianski finally turns to face the ball. Of the Arsenal defenders, only Vermaelen reacts in an attempt to prevent Porto scoring. The referee is confronted by Arsenal players and Arsene Wenger but he is unmoved by the protest and allows the goal to stand.</p>

              <p><br>I think the Arsenal players only have themselves to blame... They were slow in getting back. Vermaelen was closest and yet he was seen slowly walking back and still pointing to the sky... Falcao was still no where to be seen when he was already at the box... Vermaelen could have prevented it or made it more difficult for Falcao but he switched off and let that guy ran pass him...</p>
