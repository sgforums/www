              <h1>Fabio Capello set to hand Birmingham goalkeeper Joe Hart a starting role against Egypt<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Fabio Capello plans to hand Joe Hart his second England cap against
              Egypt next week amid fears about the quality of the country’s
              goalkeeping options.</p>
              <p>Capello wants to look closely at the 23-year-old who has been in superb form during a season on loan at Birmingham from Manchester City.</p>
              <p>The
              England manager has grown increasingly concerned that the lack of a
              world-class keeper might undermine his World Cup campaign.</p>

              <p>Capello’s No 1 David James is only just back in action after a season interrupted by injuries and contractual issues at Portsmouth.</p>
              <p>West Ham’s
              Rob Green is seen by the England boss only as a back-up and Capello
              made a personal check on Hart when Birmingham lost 2-1 to Fulham at
              Craven Cottage on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Tottenham and
              England winger Aaron Lennon, who was in brilliant form before a groin
              injury in December, has suffered a setback in his recovery. He went for
              a scan on Monday amid fears he needs surgery which could rule him out
              for another six weeks. Capello is considering Manchester City’s Adam
              Johnson as an alternative.</p>
              <p>Arsenal wide
              man Theo Walcott was left out of the Under 21 squad for their match
              against Greece on March 3 meaning he should be involved in the Egypt
              game at Wembley on the same night.</p>
              <p>Wigan striker Victor Moses has won his first Under 21 call-up after turning down the chance to play for Nigeria.</p>
              <p>The
              Egypt match will be refereed by Paraguayan Carlos Manuel Torres so
              England can experience an official from a different continent.</p>
              <p>One player not expecting a call is Michael Owen. He said: ‘You never give up but it’s a long shot.’ </p>

              <p>Sadly that's the case IMO.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>David James has the tendency to produce a calamitous error every now and then, Robert Green has excellent shot-stopping abilities but his positioning is suspect. Ditto for Ben Foster who doesn't command his penalty box well. And former England No.1 Paul Robinson is never the same as he is once was anymore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If Chris Kirkland was not that injury-prone, he would have my pick. But that's the sad case with England keepers. Probably England's best hope would be on Joe Hart.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have seen a few Birmingham games this season, and on few occasions he has single-handed stopped Birmingham from defeats. His reactions are good, has command of his penalty box and is comfortable in the air. But let's not forget that he was helped by playing in a defensive system, helped by his fellow central defenders Roger Johnson and Scott Dann.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It would be interesting to see how he fares in the Egypt friendly. Fingers crossed.</p>
