              <h1>Gareth Barry's blow: World Cup agony as Manchester City star set to 
              miss Finals, but Ledley King IS in squad</h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Fabio Capello’s World Cup plans were plunged into crisis last night 
              after it emerged that Gareth Barry is likely to miss the tournament in 
              South Africa.</p>
              <p>There are growing concerns that the ankle 
              ligament damage he suffered during<br>Manchester City’s defeat by 
              Tottenham is so bad, he may be forced out of the Finals. He has been 
              sent for a scan but has told friends he is ‘in serious trouble’.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/06/article-0-0972775A000005DC-898_468x332.jpg" alt="Crocked: Barry is helped off" width="468" height="332">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Crocked: Barry is helped off</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>With Owen Hargreaves only just returning from a 19-month injury 
              absence, Barry was seen as Capello’s only specialist holding midfielder.
               That leaves the Italian turning to players like Michael Carrick, Scott 
              Parker or the uncapped Tom Huddlestone, or forcing Steven Gerrard into a
               more defensive role.</p>
              <p>It is unlikely he will gamble on 
              Hargreaves, as it may be too soon for the Manchester United midfielder.</p>

              <p>However, Tottenham captain Ledley King has secured a place in 
              England’s provisional squad and will join Capello and his staff at their
               Austrian pre-tournament training camp.</p>
              <p>Capello names his 
              30-man party for Austria on Tuesday — they then leave on May 17. 
              Defender King impressed Capello so much in the 1-0 win against City on 
              Wednesday that he will be included in the party which will be reduced to
               23 ahead of departure to Johannesburg on June 2.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/06/article-0-08863285000005DC-489_468x347.jpg" alt="On the plane: King is in Capello's final 23-man squad for South

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>On the plane: King is in Capello's final 23-man 
              squad for South Africa</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>King’s chronic knee condition is a worry but England’s boss was 
              hugely encouraged by the fact that he performed so well against City 
              four days after playing a part in a 1-0 win over Bolton. King has 19 
              caps — he was named in the squad 13 months ago for the games against 
              Slovakia and Ukraine before withdrawing due to injury — but he could add
               to that with friendlies against Mexico and Japan.</p>
              <p>Capello 
              must then decide if he can take a player whose condition limits how 
              often he can play and train, in view of the fact he also has serious 
              fitness concerns over Rio Ferdinand, Joleon Lescott and Wes Brown.</p>
              <p>The
               manager may make one last attempt to tempt Liverpool’s Jamie Carragher 
              out of international retirement.</p>

              <h1><span>Fabio Capello's World Cup call to 
              Liverpool star Jamie Carragher... your country needs you!</span></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Jamie Carragher is poised to make a sensational return to 
              international football by answering a desperate World Cup plea from 
              England manager Fabio Capello.</p>
              <p>The Liverpool defender quit international football three
               years ago citing the fact that he was tired of being nothing more than a
               squad player and complaining that he was never given the chance to 
              prove himself as a top-level centre half.</p>
              <p>But amid serious 
              concerns over the fitness of Rio Ferdinand, Wes Brown, Joleon Lescott 
              and Ledley King, Capello has turned to Carragher and sources at 
              Liverpool indicated he is ready to answer the call.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/07/article-1274920-04E8D2780000044D-213_468x286.jpg" alt="National service: Carragher is ready to return to the England fold
               three years after retiring" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>National service: Carragher is ready to return 
              to the England fold three years
              after retiring</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Conscious that he might be accused of hypocrisy and opportunism, 
              Carragher, 32, has been agonising over the situation for some time after
               a series of discussions with Capello and his right-hand man, Franco 
              Baldini. </p>
              <p>But Carragher has already been assured that he would definitely be in
               Capello's final 23 for South Africa and could play a major part.</p>
              <p>If
               Ferdinand continues to struggle with back and groin problems and 
              Capello cannot be certain of having King available for every match, 
              Carragher would be the obvious choice as partner to John Terry at the 
              heart of his defence.</p>
              <p>Capello wants to name the Liverpool 
              defender in the provisional 30-man squad he will unveil on Tuesday and 
              then take him to Austria for a pre-tournament training camp.</p>
              <p>There
               Carragher would be able to see for himself if Ferdinand and King would 
              be fit enough to keep him out of the team.</p>
              <p>Once the final squad of
               23 is named on June 1, any subsequent seriously injured players can be 
              replaced up to 24 hours before England's World Cup opener against the 
              USA on June 12. And, crucially, replacements do not have to have been in
               the original 30.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/07/article-1274920-08F0BACA000005DC-49_306x423.jpg" alt="Crock crisis: Fabio Capello has injury concerns over key players" width="306" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Crock crisis: Fabio Capello has injury concerns 
              over key players</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Carragher is a man of principle and only because England need him so 
              much is he even prepared to consider a comeback. It is a selfless rather
               than selfish act and the answer to two problems currently troubling 
              Capello.</p>
              <p>As well as centre-half, Carragher would also provide an 
              alternative to Wes Brown, only just back from a long absence with 
              injury, as cover for Glen Johnson at right back.</p>
              <p>On Friday, 
              Capello also had other issues to deal with. While Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini said he 
              thought Gareth Barry could be back in action in 'three or four weeks' 
              after damaging ankle ligaments against Tottenham on Wednesday, the FA fear he could be 
              sidelined for closer to two months.</p>
              <p>That has forced them to 
              consider another amazing comeback - that of Owen Hargreaves, who is only
               just back in Manchester United's squad after 19 months out with a
               serious knee problem.</p>
              <p>Capello was not prepared to take a chance 
              on Hargreaves, but he realises he might have to now.</p>

              <p>If he has to look elsewhere for a specialist holding midfielder he 
              would prefer Tom Huddlestone to Scott Parker, while Michael Carrick is 
              also expected to secure a place in the original 30.</p>
              <p>But Carragher
               was the main issue for the FA, and they worry that some of the 
              statements he has made, since announcing his international retirement 
              could be used against him.</p>
              <p>He wrote in his autobiography: 'I 
              confess: defeats wearing an England shirt never hurt me in the same way 
              as losing with my club. I wasn't uncaring or indifferent, I simply 
              didn't put England's fortunes at the top of my priority list. Losing 
              felt like a disappointment rather than a calamity.'</p>
              <p>In an 
              impassioned radio interview in 2007, he said: 'I've never really played 
              centre-half for England and, to be honest, I've never really played that
               well for England because I've played a lot of the time at full-back.</p>

              <p>'If Steve McClaren's chosen people ahead of me then I don't think 
              anyone can really complain if I would rather concentrate and save myself
               for Liverpool games.</p>
              <p>'For me, now it's time to concentrate on my Liverpool career.</p>
              <p>'If
               I'm not getting a game for England at 29 there's no chance of me 
              getting a game at 32 in the next World Cup.'</p>
              <p>But the situation 
              has changed, and now England need Carragher so much he is prepared to 
              change his stance.</p>
