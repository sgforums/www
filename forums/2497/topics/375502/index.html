              <p class="author">By Soccernet staff</p>
              <p>Arsenal striker <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=38178&amp;cc=4716">Eduardo</a> has won his appeal over a two-match ban for diving during the Champions League play-off win over Celtic.</p>

              <p>The
              Croatia international was accused of duping the referee into awarding
              the penalty which gave Arsenal the opening goal of the game at the
              Emirates on August 26.</p>
              <p>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger was furious
              with UEFA's decision to ban the player from their opening two group
              games away to Standard Liege and playing host to Olympiakos. He claimed
              there had been a media "witch hunt" against his player to make sure
              action was taken.</p>
              <p>Wenger has now been vindicated by UEFA's decision to over-turn the decision.</p>
              <p>A
              statement on UEFA's website read: "The UEFA Appeals body today accepted
              the appeal lodged by Arsenal FC against the two-match suspension handed
              to striker Eduardo.</p>
              <p>"Following examination of all the evidence,
              notably the declarations of both the referee and the referees'
              assessor, as well as the various video footage, it was not established
              to the panel's satisfaction that the referee had been
              deceived in taking his decision on the penalty.</p>
              <p>"Therefore, the
              decision of the UEFA Control and Disciplinary Body of 1 September, in
              which the player was suspended for two UEFA club competition matches,
              is annulled.''</p>
              <p>Eduardo said: "I certainly feel relieved now. I
              have had great support from my family, friends and of course everyone
              at the club. Now I just want to forget about this and think about our
              match against
              Standard Liege on Wednesday. I was always prepared for the match in
              Belgium
              because I had good feeling and I always remained positive about the
              outcome.</p>
              <p>"Now we have a final result, I can now look forward to helping the team on
              Wednesday night.</p>
              <p>"All I remember of the incident is that as soon as I had possession of the
              ball I headed towards goal at full speed. I was very close to the Celtic keeper
              and felt contact on my foot and then lost my balance. I know perhaps more than
              anyone else that when you have contact at speed it can be dangerous.</p>
              <p>"I just want to say that I'm a fair player. To score goals you must take your
              opportunities and I'm not the type of player who needs to be dishonest to score
              goals.''</p>
              <p>A
              statement on Arsenal's website said: "We are grateful that the appeal
              body focused on the evidence and made the right decision in this case.
              We were able to show that there was contact between the goalkeeper and
              Eduardo and that the decision of the UEFA disciplinary body should be
              annulled.</p>
              <p>"We fully support the drive for fair play in football
              and believe it is important that UEFA provide clear and comprehensive
              standards that will be consistently enforced going forward. We are glad
              to put this incident behind us and concentrate on the games ahead.''</p>

              <p>Maybe UEFA just wanted to show that it can flex it's arms and still be merciful at the same time. Heh.</p>
              <p>But I've never doubted that Eduardo didn't intentionally dive -- being a footballer, its too easy to go down when you're moving at high speed.</p>
              <p>Plus the fact that Eduardo's had a horrific experience last year, I'd expect him to jump away, unfortunately getting caught by the keeper in the process. Heh.</p>

And if this panel thinks and assume that I stamped MR Van Persie with intention of hurting him, I could had stamped on his whole head if I had that in mind, but that was not my intention and never will be.</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsene Wenger</span></abbr> insist FORENSIC EVIDENCE proves Eduardo did not dive for his penalty against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Celtic</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Eduardo, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr>'s
              Croatian frontman, will play tonight against Standard Liege after an
              independent appeal panel overturned UEFA's decision to ban him for two
              games for diving.</p>
              <p>Wenger said: "I thought first during the game that it was no penalty, which is what I said afterwards.</p>
              <p>"But, having talked to him, he told me he was touched.</p>
              <p>"We employed a forensic expert who proved he had been touched.</p>
              <p>"They looked at the replay and proved he was touched on his
              ankle and like UEFA I believe what they tell me and what he tells me."</p>
              <p>Wenger argued making capital out of a foul in the box was part of the game.</p>
              <p>He claimed: "Did Rooney not make the most of it when he dived against us?</p>
              <p>"Sometimes a striker makes the most of it because he wants to
              cheat, sometimes because he wants to protect himself and sometimes
              because he wants to show the referee that he has been touched.</p>
              <p>"So you have to identify what is the right reason behind it. I
              believe sometimes it is a reflex. It doesn't mean the player is always
              cheating."</p>

              <h1>Arsenal boss Wenger: Forensic evidence proves Eduardo
              no diver</h1>

              <abbr><span>Arsene Wenger</span></abbr> insist FORENSIC
              EVIDENCE proves Eduardo did not dive for his penalty against
              <abbr><span>Celtic</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Eduardo, <abbr><span>Arsenal</span></abbr>'s Croatian
              frontman, will play tonight against Standard Liege after an
              independent appeal panel overturned UEFA's decision to ban him for
              two games for diving.</p>
              <p>Wenger said: "I thought first during the game that it was no
              penalty, which is what I said afterwards.</p>
              <p>"But, having talked to him, he told me he was touched.</p>
              <p>"We employed a forensic expert who proved he had been
              touched.</p>
              <p>"They looked at the replay and proved he was touched on his
              ankle and like UEFA I believe what they tell me and what he tells
              me."</p>
              <p>Wenger argued making capital out of a foul in the box was part
              of the game.</p>
              <p>He claimed: "Did Rooney not make the most of it when he dived
              against us?</p>
              <p>"Sometimes a striker makes the most of it because he wants to
              cheat, sometimes because he wants to protect himself and sometimes
              because he wants to show the referee that he has been touched.</p>
              <p>"So you have to identify what is the right reason behind it. I
              believe sometimes it is a reflex. It doesn't mean the player is
              always cheating."</p>

              <p> why not? let say if ade is facing a board of inquiry</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Panel: Mr Ade, is it true that you deliberately stamp Mr Van Persie face when you can alway divert your boot away? Please explain</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ade: No, that's not true, it is only an assumption you all taken from the TV perspectives, I have no intention of hurting my former teammate Mr Van Persie, the incident you saw on the TV was a flip of a second action whereby i had to stamp my feet strongly on thre ground, at that moment, his head swayed inward and I had no time to react, if you noticed my eyes, i was looking at where the ball is going, that is my job, stay focus on the balls. And if this panel thinks and assume that I stamped MR Van Persie with intention of hurting him, I could had stamped on his whole head if I had that in mind, but that was not my intention and never will be.</p>

              <p>really SS angel? i seem footage, forensic method will only justify ade stamp on RVP wor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it is a lost cause, ade knows it, man city knows it. hoping accepting it and close the case fast. the stamp on RVP is clearly a deliberate stomp with extra power putting on it. it is different kind when u step just to keep yourself balance.</p>
