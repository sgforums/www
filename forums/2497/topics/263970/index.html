            <div class='col-md body'><strong>FRESH from becoming only the ninth player in Newcastle United's history to play 400 first-team games Irish goalkeeper Shay Given looks certain to be named as the Magpies new captain.</strong><br><br>The Donegal man who is Irish vice-captain has been named as one of the front runners to captain the St. James' Park club by new manager Sam Allardyce.<br><br>Scott Parker was Newcastle captain last season but the midfielder was injured for large parts of the campaign and Given regularly captained Newcastle in the midfielder's absence.<br><br>Allardyce said this week that while no final decision had been made as to who would be captain next season Given was among the leading contenders.<br><br>He said: "We need a new captain and Shay has the experience but sometimes there is an emphasis on having an outfield player as skipper - but I have made no decision yet.<br><br>"In fact I believe good captains are becoming a rare breed now. Natural leaders both on and off the field are not easy to find."<br><br>Parker recently departed the North East Club for West Ham United leaving Given in pole position to take over as captain of the club where he has become a firm favourite with the fans since arriving on Tyneside eight years ago.<br><br>Other players in contention to get the captain's armband include striker Michael Owen and former Manchester United midfielder Nicky Butt though Given - who is already the club's deputy captain - is the emphatic choice of the Toon Army.<br><br>Shay was seen as a leading contender to succeed Kenny Cunningham as Irish captain but Steve Staunton chose Robbie Keane instead on the basis that the striker is an outfield player.<br><br>Meanwhile one Irish international who looks set to leave Newcastle United is Alan O'Brien.<br><br>The four-time capped Irish international is expected to join Hibernian in the SPL later this week after failing to become a regular at St. James' Park where he was competing for a starting place with his international colleague Damien Duff.</div>
