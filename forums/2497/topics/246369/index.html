            <div class='col-md body'>Flamini set to buy his way out of Arsenal<br><br>Mathieu Flamini has admitted a lack of first-team opportunities could force him to buy out the final year of his contract and leave Arsenal.<br><br>The defensive midfielder was recruited by the Gunners from Marseille in the summer of 2004, but has failed to secure a regular place in the club's starting eleven.<br><br>The 23-year-old is now in competition with a clutch of young midfield talent brought through by manager Arsene Wenger, such as Cesc Fabregas, Abou Diaby and Denilson.<br><br>And Flamini claims he could be approaching the end of his time at the Emirates Stadium.<br><br>'The next three years will be important for me,' he told L'Equipe. 'I want to play, to go to the next level.<br><br>'The Arsenal team is young, it has quality, but I am not playing as much at the moment.<br><br>'It isn't easy to live like this and I am in a situation where all players ask themselves questions.<br><br>'I am coming to the end of the cycle. I have just spent three years at Arsenal and my lawyer has told me that I could leave in June.<br><br>'For that, I must pay the final year's salary to the club.'<br><br>Flamini's stock rose earlier this season when he was drafted into the France squad by coach Raymond Domenech for February's friendly against Argentina.<br><br>But he has hardly been selected by Arsenal since, and over the course of the season he has mainly been named on the bench by Wenger.<br><br>His versatility came to Arsenal's rescue last season when he played at left-back in the absence of the injured Ashley Cole and Gael Clichy.<br><br>He proved a key player for Wenger in the Gunners' run to the Champions League final. However, he lost his place to Cole for the showpiece against Barcelona, who ended up winning 2-1.<br><br>Flamini has now set his sights on European glory - at Arsenal or elsewhere.<br><br>'I want to continue to work, to progress,' he added.<br><br>'I want to score more goals, make more passes and win the Champions League.'<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wenger shouldn't have signed him in the first place afterall Flamini was Marseille youngest captain and he was cherryplucked for free.<br><br>That alone would have caused some bad blood beween both clubs.<br><br>Wenger shoould sell him for some transfer kitty for the next Henry.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cheers.<br>CK</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wenger probably won't be too please... cos if he was to sell him under the normal circumstance today, he would probably get much more than the one yr salary of Flamini... Â£1.1million.<br><br>Flamini has improve alot since the time he arrived... He now even get selected of France at times... Flamini salary is peanuts considering that he signed it 3 yrs ago when he was a trainee... The money receive won't even be enough to buy another decent midfielder.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Flamini ready to quit Gunners</span><br><br>MATHIEU FLAMINI wants to quit Arsenal because Arsene Wenger refuses to tell him why he is sidelined. The France midfielder is ready to buy out the last year of his contract for Â£1.1million. And Juventus are keen to land him Â— although he has not ruled out staying in the Premiership.</strong><br><br>Flamini has played just once since mid-February and his camp insist Gunners boss Wenger will not give him an explanation. Flamini, 23, said: Â“I have arrived at the end of a cycle. Â“The Arsenal team is young and has qualities but I am playing less at the moment.<br><br>Â“That is not easy to go through and I am in a situation where every player asks himself questions. Â“I have just spent three years at Arsenal and my lawyer has told me that I could leave in June.<br><br>Â“For that, I must pay the final yearÂ’s salary to the club.Â”<br><br>FlaminiÂ’s lawyer Alexandra Missirli said: Â“You can imagine how Mathieu feels when his team is going through such a bad time and he cannot get a place in it. Â“ItÂ’s been like this for him since he came back from FranceÂ’s game against Argentina in February.<br><br>Â“So it is both saddening and very frustrating for him to have to witness such bad results as a mere spectator. Â“He is thinking very seriously about his future.<br></div>
