              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>JOSE MOURINHO has agreed to become boss of Inter Milan. And the Special One is eyeing a £35million double swoop for Chelsea’s Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba. Ex-Blues boss Mourinho struck a deal with Inter president Massimo Moratti at the weekend and will take over from Roberto Mancini in the summer.</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The Italian champions have not made an official announcement. But Mourinho has told close pals he is going back into management and has begun drawing up a list of targets. That means more bad news for under-pressure Chelsea boss Avram Grant as he could lose two of his top stars — and his job — this summer.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Midfielder Lampard, 29, enjoys a close relationship with Mourinho after they worked together for three years. Mourinho described him as ‘the best professional I have ever worked with’ when the Portuguese boss left Chelsea last September. Lampard is unsettled under Grant and the pair clashed ahead of Blues’ Carling Cup final defeat to Spurs in February. Contract talks have dragged on and the England midfielder has always been keen to play abroad.</p>
              <p class="article">Mourinho and Lampard have kept in touch and both would be eager to renew their working relationship at one of Europe’s top clubs. But Lamps’ mum Pat is seriously ill in hospital after being struck down with pneumonia last week and he has put his career on hold until she is better.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Mourinho signed Drogba for a club-record £24m from Marseille in July 2004. He later made a bombshell announcement that he plans to quit Chelsea at the end of this season. Grant has been criticised for not getting the best out of Drogba and the striker, 30, has scored only four goals for his club since Christmas.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Inter have been in talks with Mourinho since Mancini announced he was quitting in the wake of their Champions League exit against Liverpool in February. This was despite having four years left on his contract at the San Siro.</p>

              <h2>MORATTI REFUTES MOURINHO TALK</h2>

              <p><strong>Inter Milan president Massimo Moratti has dismissed reports that Jose Mourinho has agreed to become the club's manager next season. The former Chelsea boss has been strongly linked with a summer move to the Nerazzurri outfit to replace current coach Roberto Mancini.</strong></p>
              <p>However, Moratti said on the club's official website: "I don't know how many times I have heard this lately but it's not true and it's no longer the case to continue to deny this story." Mancini is under contract with the Serie A leaders until June 2012 and despite revealing after his side's Champions League exit his wish to leave the club in the summer, he later reconsidered.</p>
              <p>Inter defender Ivan Cordoba hopes Mancini remains at the club. "Mancini has been important to Inter and up to now he has brought results and a lot of work," said Cordoba. "I think it's important to give continuity but after all it's the club that makes the decisions."</p>
              <p>Mancini is the most successful Inter coach of the last 10 years, having won two Coppa Italia titles, two Italian Supercups and two Serie A titles. Inter took a giant step towards their third consecutive Scudetto on Sunday when they beat Torino 1-0 to climb six points clear of second-placed Roma with four league games remaining.</p>
