              </span></p><p>BLAST ... Ian Rush</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">IAN RUSH has accused Liverpool's flops of blaming the club's off-field troubles for their nightmare on it.</h2>
              <p>Kop legend Rushie rapped: "It is easy to use that as an excuse but when I played we just got on with the game."</p>
              <p>Roy Hodgson's side are stuck in the Premier League's bottom three as the battle to control the club goes to the High Court on Monday.</p>
              <p>Owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett have launched a legal bid to stop fellow Yanks New England Sports Ventures' £300million takeover.</p>
              <p>But Rush - the most prolific marksman in the club's history - believes all the uncertainty off the field is not to blame for the team's poor start.</p>
              <p>The ex-Wales striker, who banged in 346 goals in 660 appearances during two spells at Anfield, said: "It's easy to criticise when you are not doing well.</p>
              <p>"You can easily blame everyone but we are all in it together - the owners the management, the players and the supporters.</p>
              <p>"If we are all fighting against each other it is not working, so what we have to do is for everyone to get behind each other and be positive."</p>
              <p>New boss Hodgson is feeling the heat after Liverpool's worst start since 1953-54 - when they were relegated.</p>
              <p>Fans called for former boss Kenny Dalglish to replace Hodgson after Sunday's 2-1 home defeat by Blackpool.</p>
              <p>But Dirk Kuyt is backing Hodgson to come good. The Dutch star said: "If you could see the training sessions, you could see the progress that is being made every day.</p>
              <p>"We believe in ourselves and it's just a matter of time before it comes out on the pitch and the good results will follow.</p>
              <p>"We are working hard on playing with the shape that the manager likes to use and we have been making progress.</p>
              <p>"We didn't have a lot of time in pre-season to work on things but it is definitely starting to come together."</p>
