              <p><span><strong>Andre Villas-Boas is fighting to convince Roman Abramovich he is still the man for the Chelsea job  after an amazing showdown on Saturday.</strong> <br></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>can reveal that Villas-Boas was locked in talks with Abramovich at Chelsea's training ground on Saturday. </span></p>
              <p><span>Abramovich turned up without any warning to watch them train before Sunday's 3-3 draw with Manchester United, when Villas-Boas's side threw away a 3-0 lead. </span></p>
              <p><span>The Russian billionaire, flanked by key adviser Eugene Shvidler and fellow Chelsea director Eugene Tenenbaum, arrived at the training ground in Cobham before the start of training and the players were stunned when Abramovich walked out to watch Villas-Boas's session.</span></p>
              <p><span>He saw 35 minutes of training before spending another half an hour with  Villas-Boas demanding to know tactics for the game against United. </span></p>
              <p><span>After watching Chelsea draw he went into the dressing room and spent about half an hour talking to the players. </span></p>

              <p><span>The club's billionaire backer has become increasingly frustrated with the team's lack of progress this season and was determined to see at first hand the work of his young Portuguese manager. </span></p>
              <p><span>Villas-Boas has been struggling to command the respect of the players in his first season at the club.</span></p>
              <p><span>The squad were given no notice that Abramovich, who has not been seen at the training ground for months, would arrive to watch them prepare for the United game. </span></p>
              <p><span>Abramovich spent four hours assessing the mood at the club. He rarely visits the site he bought to create the perfect environment for Chelsea's expensively assembled team. </span></p>

              <p><span>Abramovich did attend the training ground before becoming involved in a high-profile court case with former associate Boris Berezovsky. </span></p>
              <p><span>According to club sources he was pre-occupied with the case but has turned his attention to Chelsea while awaiting the court judgement. </span></p>
              <p><span>Villas-Boas has always maintained that he has the full support of Abramovich but he has been left in no doubt about the demands of being Chelsea manager. </span></p>

              <p><span>Some players believe dressing-room morale has been fractured beyond repair under Villas-Boas. That is a theory Abramovich put to the test on Saturday and Villas-Boas is understood to have been left shaken by  the visit. </span></p>
              <p><span>Carlo Ancelotti operated under similar circumstances when he was Chelsea manager and told friends life became 'intolerable' because of the pressure on him from above. </span></p>

              <p>Yeah,tink AVB should just look for a new job back on the European continent.If you even offered him a chance to manage in Denmark or Sweden,he would jump at it in order to get away from RA.</p>

              <p><span><strong>Roman Abramovich has warned Andre Villas-Boas that a fourth-placed finish in the Barclays Premier League will not be good enough.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Abramovich stood on the training ground on Thursday to watch Villas-Boas at work for the fourth successive day. Chelsea’s billionaire benefactor wore an orange and black coach’s jacket as Villas-Boas prepared the team for Saturday's trip to Everton.</span></p>
              <p><span>Abramovich has spent five of the last six days on the shoulders of the young manager, monitoring his relationship with the squad.</span></p>
              <p><span>Chelsea are fourth in the table, seven points behind third-placed Tottenham and 14 behind leaders Manchester City, but are still in the Champions League and FA Cup.</span></p>
              <p><span>Villas-Boas, 34, said: 'Finishing fourth will not be honourable for a club of Chelsea’s size. Given their  success, the owner has made it known. He is used to the club finishing first or being runners-up.</span></p>
              <p><span>'The reality is that in the last few years there has been a pattern of managers shifting at this club. I’m not saying they paid with their jobs. </span></p>
              <p><span>It was because Roman decided that they should. End of story.</span></p>
              <p><span>'When we set up at the start of the season, we believed that the team was ready for four trophies. At the moment, we have a Champions League objective because the Premier League objective is not possible.'</span></p>

              <p><span>He said: 'He knows a lot, he is very informed. He follows English and European football, so it’s good to have an opinion.</span></p>
              <p><span>'As for turning up, I don’t always know - sometimes yes, sometimes no. It is legitimate for him to be there. He is a good person to share knowledge with. He asks me questions and I try to give him answers. There is great empathy and motivation for next year’s project. His focus is with Chelsea, that is what he has transmitted to me.'</span></p>

              <p>AVB is going to be sacked, just a matter of when only. I cant see him survive beyond March. I was surprised he is still around in February, from the manner roman sacked past chelsea managers.</p>
              <p>either guus hiddink or fabio capello will take over, as they are free at the moment.</p>

              <p>AVB gone case already... But to be fair he also got a very tough job where all the once great players are in their twilight of their careers therefore it's a bad time to be the chelsea boss.</p>
              <p>The next guy will have a better time i belief. But i think he may find it a little difficult as well as the next guy may not be able to spend like in the past i think. Roman got the money but the fair play rules into its first year will expect chelsea to keep their losses to under $39m pounds each season. Chelsea's last season's accounts post a $66m lost.</p>
              <p>So unless they start to think outside the box on how to increase revenue legally like City... lol. They are in for some unstable times... And what if they fail to qualify for the CL? Will it make Roman give up on them totally with the fair-play rules he has to think of ways to get around? So troublesome, just throw in the towel?</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">UNDER-FIRE Anders Villas-Boas blasted Chelsea's "worst" display this season. </h2>
              <p>The Blues dropped to fifth as Everton's 2-0 win made it four games without victory. </p>
              <p>And boss Villas-Boas admitted Chelsea's low-key performance - with Fernando Torres again struggling in front of goal - was unacceptable.</p>
              <p>Steven Pienaar and Denis Stracqualursi downed the Blues to leave Villas-Boas saying: "I think today was one of our worst games of the season, if not the worst. </p>
              <p>"In our performance today we are short of anything positive. "It is a difficult day for us, we take out a lot of negatives from this game." </p>
              <p>Blues fans chanted 'You don't know what you're doing' when Villas-Boas took off Michael Essien just before Everton's 72nd minute clincher.</p>
              <p>And the Portuguese - whose predecessor Carlo Ancelotti was sacked at the same ground last year - said: "It is part of the job.</p>
              <p>"At the moment we are sitting fifth in the league and it is not enough for us." </p>
              <p>He denied Chelsea's performance was hit by speculation following owner Roman Abramovich twice visiting the club's training ground. </p>
              <p>He added: "We suffered very early in the game. We then had the control of possession until the end of the first half but couldn't create enough chances. </p>
              <p>"In the second half the game was divided between the two teams and we had no clarity. </p>
              <p>"We were not able to create chances. In the end that lack of clarity punished us." </p>
              <p>Villas-Boas insisted £50million striker Fernando Torres - goalless since September - will be given all the time he needs, even once Didier Drogba returns from the African Nations Cup.</p>
              <p>He said: "He is trying a lot to get his chances and to shoot at goal. </p>
              <p>"Whatever time it takes, we will continue to pursue his confidence and full form until he eventually finds the back of the net." </p>
              <p>Everton chief David Moyes, whose side beat Manchester City in their last home match, said: "That was a great result. </p>
              <p>"There were good parts of the performance as well but the strange thing is I think we can play much better. </p>
              <p>"I think we will play better once we get more confidence as the wins take us a long. </p>
              <p>"We got off to a great start with an early goal, which gave us something to hang on to, but we wanted it. </p>
              <p>"We had to ride our luck on a couple of occasions but in the second half we didn't look like we were going to concede." </p>
              <p>Moyes praised Pienaar - back on loan after a poor first year with Spurs. </p>
              <p>He said: "He got clapped by everyone at the end. Some of the stuff he did was terrific. </p>
              <p>"I said to him at the end it was like he had never been away. Sometimes clubs just fit players and maybe that is the case. Maybe this just suits him."</p>
