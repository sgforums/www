              <div>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Given that Lucas Leiva is regarded as a consummate professional at Liverpool, a player who trains with diligence and determination, the Brazil midfield player should be one of football’s least likely scapegoats.</strong> </p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p class="heading"> </p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p>But at a time when some of Rafael Benítez’s signings are being questioned as never before, he has become a lightning conductor for many of the frustrations on Merseyside as his team prepare for a mighty battle against Manchester United at Anfield tomorrow on the back of four defeats.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div id="region-column1-layout2">
              <div id="related-article-links">
              <p>His detractors contend that he lacks the presence to dominate a key area of the pitch in the manner required of a club who set their sights on the biggest prizes. They pray for the swift arrival of the expensive, but unproven and only just fit again, Alberto Aquilani.</p>
              <p>But what of the defence of the £6 million man from Grêmio? Lucas has mostly kept his head down while his critics have had their say.</p>
              <p>But he has spoken this week about his relationship with the Kop, the unswerving support of his manager and the huge expectations that weigh on any footballer from Brazil.</p>
              <p>Twenty-two is no age to judge a midfield player, certainly not one who has spent all but the past two years of his footballing life playing in a Latin American style, before being thrust into the Barclays Premier League when his career is still in the developmental stage.</p>
              <p>And Lucas has not been helped by the fact that the job he performs in Benítez’s team is one of the least glamorous, allowing his more attack-minded team-mates to push forward while he and Javier Mascherano ensure that balance is maintained.</p>
              <p>It is not the kind of stereotypical role expected of Brazilian footballers, with flair being sacrificed for functionality, but as Lucas points out, even the Samba boys require a water carrier.</p>
              <p>It is a job he has performed well enough to have won the Bola de Ouro at 19 as the best player in the Brazilian league (as successor to Carlos Tévez, Robinho and Kaká), to have captained the Brazil Under-20 side and to have been called up by Dunga, the national team coach, last month.</p>
              <p>“Everybody knows I had difficult times here, especially with the people who criticised me,” Lucas said. “What I would say, though, is that the style of football in the Premier League is totally different to Brazil. I know people sometimes expect Brazilian footballers to play a certain way — to have unbelievable skill, to be able to do tricks and be like Ronaldinho or Kaká, but I am in a different position, where you cannot do those things and you have to work for the team.</p>
              <p>“This is my mentality, to try to help my team-mates. I cannot think too much of the criticism. All I can do is try and do my job and hopefully this will be good enough.</p>
              <p>“Me and Javier have to be aware of the counter-attack because we have a lot of offensive players. We have to make sure that we give the defenders our support. Every team needs these kind of players.”</p>
              <p>Opinions are not quite as polarised as they once were and although he is still trying to win over the Anfield crowd, there have been no more incidents such as the one during Liverpool’s home league game against Fulham last season, when he was booed by a section of his team’s fans. He could have had his spirit broken by such an episode, he could have allowed it to create a wedge between him and the supporters, but instead he put it down to experience and vowed to win them over.</p>
              <p>In his darkest moments, Lucas was given the unconditional backing of Benítez, who insisted that he would come good.</p>
              <p>This week, however, roles have been reversed, with player defending manager after Liverpool suffered their fourth successive defeat.</p>
              <p>“We are in a difficult moment, but we are the ones on the pitch and it is up to us to improve,” Lucas said. “Rafa is a really good manager and now we have to try to win for ourselves, but also for him because he has been really good for us and for me in particular.</p>
              <p>“He gave me opportunities and he gave me confidence, so now I want to pay him back by playing well, working really hard and performing as he expects me to.</p>
