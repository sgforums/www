              <p>A good match over all... Villa as usual was very hardworking and made it very tough for United... Michael Owen has done well again, he got United back into the game scoring a well placed equalizer...</p>
              <p>Berbatov also had a great game creating many openings and the 2 goals as well... Valencia, probably one of the best buy this season. And Rooney, what can you say about this guy... Becoming a better player than he already was which was already very good... lol... And i think it's true when they said he is currently one of the top 3 players in the world... </p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Michael Owen</span></abbr> suffered a hamstring injury in an action-packed first half of the
              Carling Cup final that also saw him score to level the match early on.</p>
              <p>The former <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> star started the Carling Cup final against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Aston Villa</span></abbr> on Sunday but had to be replaced just before half-time because of a hamstring injury, which manager <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> described as a ‘blow’.</p>
              <p>The Red Devils went onto to clinch the title 2-1 with Owen’s replacement Wayne Rooney scoring the winner but manager <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> rued the injury to his striker who levelled in the 12th minute.</p>
              <p>"He (Owen) did really well for us and it was a good performance
              from him. It's maybe our fault too. He's not had a lot of minutes
              recently and that soft pitch didn't help him. It's a bad blow for us,”

              <p>bro, why u bother and get ruffled?? in the past, it sets my blood boiling, but now, I just pity them. no need to say much la, just imagine one mad dog coming to the front of your gate, and making a ruckus.. when it is thirsty/tired after barking for a while, it will go away.  meanwhile, for us, we just sit in aircon room, with our coke, and tv, and just enjoy life..</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>For the record, That was Rooney's fifth consecutive headed goal. In fact, seven out of his last eight goals have been headers. Quite a statistic considering he had scored only four headed goals in his career before this season... Suddenly his head became very useful... lol.</div>

              <p>rooney can be a target man, reminds me of alan shearer and christian vieri. He can also be a creator like tevez zidane or cantona.</p>
              <p>it's a matter of time before he wins the world footballer of the year. If man u clinches the champions league this year, that might just do it for him. Still not exactly in the class of messi and zidance yet until he shines on big finals like the world cup and champions league final.</p>
              <p>I also think that valencia has been a very good buy. His accurate crosses down the wing reminds me of beckham in the 90s. He would never have connected those crosses onto the right heads and feet if he had remained at wigan.</p>
