              <p><strong>Xabi Alonso has been told he must make an official transfer request to show everyone how keen he is to leave <span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool </span>and join Real Madrid.</strong></p>
              <p>The 27-year-old has explained to Anfield manager Rafa Benitez in a phone call that he wants to join the new collection of <span style="font-style: italic;">galacticos</span> at the Bernabeu following the recent return of Florentino Perez as president.</p>
              <p>Benitez told his fellow Spaniard to put it in writing.</p>

              <p>But even if he does put his request in writing, Benitez has made it clear that Real must pay the price he puts on his midfielder's head - $35million.</p>

              <p><strong>Xabi Alonso has told Rafa Benítez that he wants to leave Anfield. </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/realmadrid"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Real Madrid</strong></span></a><strong> have made no secret of their desire to sign the midfielder and are hopeful that Alonso will be able to persuade the </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong> manager to sell. Should that fail, they are keen for him to force Liverpool's hand by going one step further and publicly stating his desire to play at the Santiago Bernabéu.</strong></p>
              <p>Madrid are understood to have tabled a bid in the region of €27m (£23m) only to have the offer turned down. Spanish media reported that they had returned with a lower offer in light of the pressure exerted by the player on Benítez. Although Alonso is reluctant to go public, he has privately asked his manager to listen to offers from the Spanish club.</p>
              <p>The Madrid coach, Manuel Pellegrini, admitted that he was keen to sign Alonso. Madrid lack a midfield playmaker and there is a desire to increase the number of Spaniards at the club. The club's president, Florentino Pérez, has talked about the need to "Spanishise" Real Madrid, and Pellegrini said: "We need a midfielder [and] Alonso would fit our system."</p>
              <p>But having spent more than €150m on Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka, Madrid are reluctant to be pushed into paying over £30m for Alonso, because he does not fit into the galactico category of players who generate cash for the club.</p>
              <p>Although Benítez tried to force Alonso out last summer as he pursued Gareth Barry, he missed out on the former Aston Villa player when he joined Manchester City last month. That has left Liverpool with few alternatives in central midfield and Benítez publicly says that Alonso is not for sale. Privately he is understood to be willing to sell – but only for £30m or more.</p>
              <p>Benítez also does not want to appear to be responsible for Alonso's departure after fans reacted angrily to his proposed sale last season. Liverpool supporters made a public display of support for the Spaniard and chanted anti-Barry songs. Alonso then finished the season as the fans' player of the year.</p>
              <p>A public declaration of intent from Alonso would thus suit the Liverpool manager as well as Real Madrid but Benítez remains determined not to be bullied on the price.</p>
              <p>Alonso still has three years left to run on his contract. "It is no mystery that we are interested in him," Pellegrini said, "but we know it will not be easy."</p>

              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1199840" rel="1199840|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1199840/Liverpools-Xabi-Alonso-sets-weekend-deadline-Real-Madrid-move.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Xabi Alonso wants his future sorted out before the weekend but faces the dilemma of whether to go public on his desire to leave </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span><strong> for Real Madrid.</strong></p>
              <p>The Spain midfielder has reportedly already told Anfield boss Rafa Benitez that he wants to be part of the Bernabeu revolution and is said to be frustrated by the lack of progress on a deal.</p>
              <p>Benitez has been determined to hold on to the 27-year-old all summer, privately quoting a prohibitive £40million price-tag, and will not back down unless Alonso forces a move with a transfer request or public declaration.</p>
              <p>Bernabeu icon Raul has stepped up the pressure by enthusiastically welcoming the prospect of playing alongside Alonso.</p>
              <p>'I would like him to come because Xabi Alonso is a great player,' said the Madrid captain.</p>
              <p>'The decision is made by other people at the club and the technical body, who see what the team need.'</p>
              <p>Liverpool are due to fly out for their Asian tour on Saturday and it is unclear whether Alonso will be on the flight.</p>
              <p>Madrid have used various tactics in their pursuit of Alonso since Florentino Perez took over as president at the start of June and made a public pitch to bring him to Spain.</p>
              <p>In recent days they have publicly said the deal looks unlikely without closing the door, though alternatives that have been lined up have proved either as difficult to sign or mere smokescreens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/07/15/article-0-04CCF28C000005DC-975_306x423.jpg" alt="Cesc Fabregas" width="306" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Too difficult: Real's interest in Cesc Fabregas waned over complications to lure the Arsenal captain.</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>They were knocked back immediately when going for Roma midfielder Daniele de Rossi while signing Cesc Fabregas from </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Arsenal</strong></span></a><strong> was seen as fraught with difficulty. <br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Coach Manuel Pellegrini would like to raid his former club Villarreal for Santi Cazorla, but the 24-year-old is seen as more of an attacking midfielder rather than an alternative to Alonso.</strong></p>
              <p>There is also a suggestion that Madrid have been in talks for several weeks with Javier Mascherano with the thinking that if one of Liverpool's midfielders leaves, it must be to them rather than rivals Barcelona.</p>
              <p>Udinese's Gaetano D'Agostino would be relatively easy to recruit, but it is thought Madrid are using their interest in the Italy international primarily to put pressure on Liverpool to lower their asking price.</p>
              <p>The Spanish giants similarly tried to show the Reds they would not be ripped off by actually lowering their bid for Alonso to £20m earlier this week.</p>
              <p>A compromise around £32m may well get their man, but there is still some distance between the clubs' respective valuation and Madrid are desperate to sell at least five players in the next few days to fund further spending.</p>
              <p>Benitez has lined up Roma midfielder Alberto Aquilani as a replacement for either Alonso or Mascherano, according to reports in Italy.<br></p>
