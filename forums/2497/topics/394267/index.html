              <h1><span>Steven Taylor's jaw broken after 
              'bust-up' with Newcastle team-mate - claimed to be striker Andy Carroll</span></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Newcastle defender Steven Taylor has suffered a suspected broken jaw 
              in a training ground incident believed to involve team-mate Andy 
              Carroll.</p>
              <p>Former England Under 21 captain Taylor has only just 
              returned to training after a lengthy lay-off with a serious knee injury.</p>
              <p>The 24-year-old, who was last week named Newcastle's <span style="font-style: italic;">Sport Personality of the Year</span>, has 
              undergone two months of rigorous rehabilitation in a bid to return to 
              the side. But his season is almost certainly over now.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/22/article-1259918-08D3FAAD000005DC-398_468x286.jpg" alt="Newcastle United captain Steven Taylor" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Another injury: Taylor is certain to miss the 
              rest of the season with a broken jaw</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Newcastle United refused to comment on reports that Taylor's broken 
              jaw was a result of a training ground spat with top scorer Carroll, who 
              has played such an important role in the club's promotion campaign.</p>
              <p>Sources
               close to the defender and the Newcastle squad also refused to comment 
              on the speculation.
               </p>
              <p>It is believed the bust-up was the climax of on-going tensions 
              between the pair due to Taylor's £30,000-a-week salary, compared to 
              Carroll's estimated £10,000.</p>
              <p>Carroll is currently on bail and 
              awaiting a Crown Court trial over a charge of assault in an alleged 
              incident in a Newcastle city centre nightclub last year.</p>
              <p>The 
              England Under 21 striker, whose late equaliser at Bristol City on 
              Saturday helped maintain Newcastle's lead at the top of the 
              Championship, is due back in court at the end of April.</p>
              <p>He is 
              accused of assault occasioning actual bodily harm against Michael Cook 
              in the Blu Bambu club in December. It was alleged in Newcastle 
              Magistrates Court last month that Carroll smashed a glass into Mr Cook's
               face.</p>

              </div>
              <p>This latest incident will be an unwelcome distraction for manager 
              Chris Hughton as he prepares to take his side to Doncaster tonight. 
              Carroll, who took his season's goal tally to 15 at Ashton Gate, has been
               included in the squad travelling to the Keepmoat Stadium.</p>
              <p>Also 
              in the squad is controversial midfielder Joey Barton - himself no 
              stranger to a courtroom - who is back in contention for the first time 
              since September after he came through a reserve team run-out last week 
              and suffered no setback with his troublesome foot.</p>
              <p>Before news of
               Taylor's injury surfaced last night, Hughton said the Greenwich-born 
              central defender had a chance of returning before the end of the season.</p>
              <p>Hughton said: 'We said last week that he was probably three or 
              four weeks away and he's had the brace taken off his knee that he had to
               use.'</p>
              <p>Ironically, the Newcastle manager also said a lack of 
              off-the-field incidents at the club had helped his players focus on 
              returning to the Barclays Premier League after the shock of last 
              season's relegation.</p>
              <p>Hughton said: 'The biggest reason is where we are in the league. The 
              fact we've been top for most of the season and the fact we've shown 
              enough good things on the pitch has allowed the fans to have more good 
              weeks than bad.</p>
              <p>'It gives them optimism for next season that 
              we're going in the right direction. The fans are some of the most 
              important people around the club and it's important for them to have a 
              winning team.'</p>

              <p class="article">Striker Carroll, 21, started the day in disgrace when a bust-up with team-mate Steve Taylor left the defender in hospital with a broken jaw.</p>
              <p class="article">And he repaid the faith of boss Chris Hughton by hitting the winner at Hughton's starting line-up for last night's vital Championship clash.</p>
              <p class="article">Owner Mike Ashley and his right-hand man Derek Llambias were furious at the bust-up - exclusively revealed in SunSport yesterday - and could have insisted on axing Carroll. But they decided to stick with Toon's 16- goal top-scorer.</p>
              <p class="article">Carroll, 21, had hospital treatment for damage to his hands and ran out wearing gloves. Taylor, 24, was released from Newcastle General's orthopaedic trauma ward last night after being kept in overnight for observation.</p>
              <p class="article">Northumbria police say they have not been informed of the incident. But Ashley and Llambias have launched an internal investigation and look certain to hit Carroll with a maximum fine of two weeks' wages, around £20,000.</p>
