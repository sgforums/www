              <p><strong>John Terry was breathlaysed after breaking the leg of a security guard he knocked over in his Range Rover after Chelsea's Champions League exit to Inter Milan.</strong></p>
              <p>Attempting to drive away from Stamford Bridge late on Tuesday night, Terry's car was surrounded by photographers, leaving him at a standstill.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's security team eventually managed to clear room for Terry to move forward but as he drove on at a snail's pace, his Range Rover collided with the man's leg.</p>
              <p>A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Police were called at 23.13 on Tuesday March 16 to Stamford Bridge to reports of a collision between a car and a pedestrian. </p>
              <p>'London Ambulance Service and Police attended where a 35-year old male was found with a broken leg. He has been taken to a west London hospital where he is in a stable condition.</p>

              <p><strong>'The driver of a dark coloured 4x4 car failed to stop at the scene. No arrests were made though enquiries into the incident continue.'</strong></p>
              <p>Terry's spokesman Phil Hall confirmed Terry was breathalysed in the early hours of Wednesday morning at his home in Surrey.</p>
              <p>Hall told goal.com: 'John was coming out of the car park and he was surrounded by paparazzi photographers. He was not driving very fast and a security guard waved him through. There were some fans there and they were telling the photographers to get out of the way.'</p>
              <p>Hall claimed that Terry was unaware that he had hit the man until he was called by the club later in the evening.</p>
              <p>He added: 'John volunteered to go to the police station, and was breathalised in his home at 1.30am.'</p>
