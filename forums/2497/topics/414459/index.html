              <p><strong>Liverpool midfielder Joe Cole could miss next Sunday's clash against former club Chelsea with a hamstring injury. </strong></p>
              <p>The 28-year-old, who moved to Anfield on a free transfer in the summer, limped out of the Barclays Premier League win at Bolton just after the hour.</p>
              <p>The club do not feel the problem is serious but his ability to train this week is likely to be affected.</p>
              <p>Manager Roy Hodgson said: "He has a slight hamstring injury and we don't know the extent of it until after he has a scan."</p>
              <p>Without him Liverpool went on to win 1-0 courtesy of a late Maxi Rodriguez strike.</p>
              <p>The experience is a new one to Cole having never suffered such a muscle injury in his career. Having already served a three-match ban this season, it is also another setback as he attempts to establish himself at Anfield.</p>
              <p>The Reds could be boosted for the visit of the champions and league leaders by the return of Dirk Kuyt.</p>
              <p>The Dutchman has made a rapid recovery from an ankle injury sustained on international duty earlier this month.</p>
              <p>Hodgson said: "I think he will be available to be in the squad against Chelsea, but whether he is fit enough to play remains to be seen.</p>
              <p>"I think he will return to training towards the latter part of the week and then it is a question of seeing how well he can cope."</p>
              <p>Another former Chelsea player, Glen Johnson, is also expected to be available after a thigh strain.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">JOE COLE has an outside chance of facing former club Chelsea on Sunday, according to Liverpool boss Roy Hodgson.</h2>
              <p>The Engand midfielder was hit by a hamstring injury during Liverpool's 1-0 win at Bolton last Sunday and it was originally thought he would be out of action for at least two weeks.</p>
              <p>But Hodgson said: "With Cole it's not as bad as feared. It shouldn't keep him out for that long.</p>
              <p>"I would say it's a week to 10-day injury. The scan was positive in that it's a very minor tear he has, but you can't really put a definite date on how long that tear is going to take to repair.</p>
              <p>"But the physical people are very optimistic.</p>
              <p>"It's a question of how quickly he can recover and what progress he can make.</p>
              <p>"At the moment he's not even ruled out for the Chelsea game but we'll see how he goes later in the week."</p>
              <p>Cole will definitely miss Thursday's Europa League group clash with Napoli.</p>
              <p>Right-back Glen Johnson could return after missing four games with a thigh injury and trained with the team today but fellow defender Sotirios Krygiakos was withdrawn as a precaution.</p>
              <p>Hodgson said: "Kyrgiakos is feeling his groin slightly. As a matter of caution we took him out of today's training session half way through to give him a bit of a rest."</p>
              <p>Forward Dirk Kuyt may also figure at the weekend. "He's a possibility if all goes well with the training sessions on Friday and Saturday," Hodgson said.</p>
              <p>As for Daniel Agger, who has been out since September 25, Hodgson said: "It's a question of time and there's not so much more the physios and medical staff can do.</p>
              <p>"We have to be patient."</p>

              <p>It had been suggested that the France international would be fit for the trip to Anfield, but Ancelotti has revealed Malouda will not be in squad.</p>
              <p>"Malouda has a twist on his ankle, not a big problem but he is not able to play against Liverpool, the week after yes," Ancelotti said.</p>
              <p>Malouda is Chelsea's top scorer this season with seven goals in the Premier League, one more than <span style="color: #000000;">Didier Drogba</span>.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Frank Lampard</span> is in contention after overcoming a setback following groin surgery. "We hope Frank can play," Ancelotti said.</p>

              <p>"John Terry I rested because he played a lot of games and I want to maintain the players' fitness," Ancelotti confirmed. "Essien had a little problem on his toe but will be fit for the game against Liverpool."</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Ancelotti said: "Lampard is not available 
              for this game. We have to take our time again. Next week, finally, he 
              will be ready to be available.</strong></p>
              <p>"He has started to train and the 
              problem has moved on. We are taking our time because we want him to be 
              100 per cent fit because it was not an easy problem. We don't want to 
              take a risk.</p>
              <p>"The last thing is for him to train with his 
              team-mates. He has done everything alone, he did a good session, 
              shooting, and everything was OK. Now the next step is to train with his 
              team-mates, maybe the beginning of next week, and I hope he will be 
              ready against Sunderland.</p>
              <p>"We have a little problem with Essien 
              and we are not sure if he will be fit for Sunday. He has a problem on 
              his toe. I hope, because it is a little problem, that he will be 
              available to play. He will travel and we will make a decision on Sunday 
              morning.</p>
