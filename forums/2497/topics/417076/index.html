              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ROMAN ABRAMOVICH was nowhere to be seen as Chelsea continued to implode at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.</h2>
              <p>No doubt he was still celebrating Russia winning their bid to host the 2018 World Cup.</p>
              <p>The Russian triumph has already impacted badly on English football.</p>
              <p>Now it could have serious ramifications for Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Vladimir Putin has made it clear he expects oligarchs like Abramovich to contribute significantly to the country's £30billion costs.</p>
              <p>So how much longer will he fund Chelsea, a financial exercise that has set him back more than £700million?</p>
              <p>Abramovich - whose commitment to Chelsea seems to be flagging - has already instigated huge cost-cutting at the Bridge.</p>
              <p>Instead of an anticipated £100m in summer signings, just £23m was spent on Ramires (£18m) and Yossi Benayoun (£5m). No wonder Carlo Ancelotti is fretting.</p>
              <p>The question now is: where do Abramovich's loyalties lie?</p>
              <p>To a club who are in the middle of their worst run since September 2007?</p>
              <p>Or to his country as they start their countdown to the biggest sporting event they have ever staged?</p>
              <p>Or, to be more exact, to his master Putin, the overlord who allowed Abramovich and his fellow oligarchs to make their fortunes?</p>
              <p>And he can take them away if they don't play ball.</p>
              <p>FIFA could now see their decision to back Russia also help their long-held ambition of breaking the power of the leading Premier League clubs.</p>
              <p>Their jealousy at the success of England's top flight and the way Chelsea and now Manchester City are buying trophies through financial clout has already seen them put in place regulations.</p>
              <p>Clubs must break even by 2013-2014 or risk a ban from the Champions League.</p>
              <p>FIFA's end-game is for the Champions League and all football to be played on a level playing field.</p>
              <p>And as FIFA rein in the top clubs, they themselves grow stronger thanks to awarding the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to countries with the financial clout of Russia and Qatar.</p>

              <p>if he only coaches the team, how he plugs the weakness if there is, with the players that he wants/buy. or he just throw his requirement to the scouting team/board?</p>

              <p>how do you explain why ancelotti plays ramires and mostly starts with ramires despite his awful showing? every match? whenever he plays chelsea concedes a goal. ramires is like a child. his shirts are probably XS from the looks of it. easy to bully around the pitch. he is probably a contender for worst chelsea player ever award</p>
              <p>he has a CB called bruma but does not dare to use him because he is a youngster. ivanovic cannot play CB, ferreria generally is cmi, bosingwa is a lousy RB. if u watched marseille vs chelsea.</p>
              <p>he will die die play either ferreria or ivanovic (or god forbid both) as CBs. if u recall when both of them played as CB sunderland trashed chelsea. it does not matter whether its at stamford bridge or not if your players are lousy no amount of supporters can make them win the game.</p>
              <p>attack wise he will rely on drogba anelka malouda forever even though they are in poor form and age is getting to them. he uses sturridge sparingly, and dont even need to talk about kakuta, etc</p>

              <p>Yes theres an article saying Ancelotti is the coach not in control of the full tean - hence he is not invovled in buying or selecting players to buy. He can indicate his interests(e.g what position), but he might not get them</p>
