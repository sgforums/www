              <p>But Arsene Wenger reckons the reason they are now facing an uphill battle to be Premier League champions is because they cannot deal with ‘money time’.</p>
              <p>That is the phrase the Arsenal manager uses to describe the closing stages of key games in the title run-in.</p>
              <p>Put simply, he believes Manchester United can handle it and City can’t.</p>
              <p>And the evidence of the last month of the championship race would seem to suggest he is right.</p>
              <p>City, five points clear at the top of the table at the beginning of March, travel to the Gunners tomorrow really needing a win to keep their hopes alive.</p>
              <p>That is because after taking five points from their last four matches, Roberto Mancini’s nervy novices now find themselves five points <strong>BEHIND</strong> their neighbours.</p>
              <p>United, renowned championship challengers, closed in on their 20th top-flight crown with a typically solid 2-0 win at Blackburn on Monday.</p>
              <p>Wenger, who has guided his Gunners to three Prem crowns, said: “It’s been difficult for City.</p>
              <p>“They have been outstanding at home. It is away from home they have lost a little bit. Manchester United are surprisingly there in a comfortable position. No one expected them to be.</p>
              <p>“They have not looked absolutely irresistible this year and you could see that again on Monday night against Blackburn. But they managed to win the game.</p>
              <p>“If United make it this year it is really down to experience.</p>
              <p>“What I mean by that is that even the other night at Blackburn, when Ryan Giggs came on in the last 15 minutes, you thought they can only win it now because they know how to deal with the money time.</p>
              <p>“That means the last 15 minutes in football when it is 0-0. They don’t make a mistake and they have that security at the back.</p>
              <p>“They have won so many titles because they are not nervous.”</p>
              <p>It is bound to be another edgy afternoon at the Emirates tomorrow as both teams know defeat could have huge implications on their season.</p>
              <p>Wenger believes City need to win to keep their flickering hopes alight while a defeat for his team could prove ultimately fatal in their bid to fend off Tottenham in the North London duel for third spot.</p>
              <p>Wenger said: “I feel it’s a want-to-win game for us and must-win game for City.</p>
              <p>“A draw for them will not be good enough at this stage of the season. In the last two seasons they have come here to play for a draw.</p>
              <p>“But both teams will be looking for a win this time.”</p>
              <p>United will open up an eight-point gap at the top with victory at home to QPR — a game that finishes around half-an-hour before City kick off against the Gunners.</p>
              <p>While Wenger knows Mancini must go for the win, he does not believe United fans should get too carried away if Arsenal win.</p>
              <p>The Frenchman said: “It won’t be over but it will make things very, very difficult for City.</p>
              <p>“City will fight but I believe we should wait and see what happens over the weekend.</p>
              <p>“Unfortunately we are not involved in the title race and we will let them sort it out between themselves.</p>
              <p>“But, at the moment, Manchester United have the advantage.”</p>
              <p>Wenger has seen his side charge up to third on the back of seven league wins on the spin — a run ended by the 2-1 defeat at QPR last Saturday. He added: “Our job is always to cope with the consequences of the game, but before you just focus on what you want to do well.</p>
              <p>“The momentum is still there because in the last eight games we have won seven, so it was an interruption and a disappointment.</p>
              <p>“We want to come back to what was our recent level.”</p>
              <p>Wenger and Arsenal fans will recognise a few familiar faces in the City camp.</p>
              <p>That is because the red half of North London has become a favourite haunt of big-spending City in recent seasons.</p>
              <p>Emmanuel Adebayor, Kolo Toure, Gael Clichy and, most recently, Samir Nasri have all ventured to the dark side of the Blue Moon.</p>
              <p>City’s backroom team also includes former Gunners Brian Marwood, Brian Kidd, David Platt and Patrick Vieira.</p>
              <p>Perhaps the only surprise is that their Arab owners did not call their home ground the Emirates and change their shirts to red.</p>
              <p>They say imitation is the biggest form of flattery although Wenger said: “I do not know whether to be flattered... or worried!</p>
              <p>“But they have enough former Arsenal players there now. I believe it is eight. Why do they keep coming to us? Because we have good players and young players and that’s it.”</p>
              <p>Nasri has hardly set the Premier League on fire since leaving Arsenal to join City in a £24million switch in August.</p>
              <p>Asked to assess his former star’s performances in light blue, Wenger paused, then smiled before replying: “I’ll leave that to you.”</p>
              <p>It almost reinforced Wenger’s view that players rarely improve after leaving the Gunners.</p>
              <p>He said: “Arsenal is a good place to be because the players are educated to play a certain way.</p>
              <p>“When the players leave very young like Nasri, Clichy and Fabregas, of course, they will continue to develop their game.”</p>
              <p>The likes of Mario Balotelli and Carlos Tevez have given Mancini headaches this season.</p>
              <p>But Arsenal had their own matter to resolve this week when striker Marouane Chamakh was pictured smoking a shisha pipe with Morocco team-mate Adel Taarabt after the Loftus Road loss.</p>
              <p>Wenger insisted the incident had been dealt with but added it was “not the best thing to do”.</p>
              <p>However, he stressed it was too early to say if Chamakh would still be a Gooner come August.</p>
              <p>Wenger joked: “We want him to focus completely, without smoking, until the end of the season.”</p>

              <p><span>Balotelli was deservedly sent off in the final minute after referee Martin Atkinson and assistant Peter Kirkup somehow failed to spot his first-half knee-high tackle on Alex Song, and he could now face a lengthy ban.</span></p>
              <p><span>His eventual dismissal came moments after Arteta's spectacular winner that left City eight points behind Manchester United and sent Arsenal two points clear of Tottenham in third place.<br></span></p>

              Now he a bit off form liao, making yaya toure need to tank some more midfield passing and organising. Then suay suay yaya toure injured earlier into the match.
              
              
              Mancini need to know that to win matches you not only need strikers but more importantly midfielders also.
