            <div class='col-md body'>Hammers training twice a day<br><br>West Ham United's players are being made to train twice a day by Alan Curbishley as the manager tries to haul the team out of slump that has seen them go nine league games without a win and lose in the FA Cup at home to Watford.<br><br>Curbishley introduced the regime following his side's latest defeat to Watford, which left them languishing in the bottom three and facing a battle to retain their place in the Premiership. The Hammers have only managed one Premiership win since Curbishley took over from Alan Pardew in December and the players are reported to be upset by his approach.<br><br>However, West Ham's Christian Dailly said the side would not complain if it helped them beat Charlton Athletic at the Valley on February 24. "The boys are still a bit down after the defeat against Watford but the gaffer has been trying to lift us with double sessions of hard training every day of the week.<br><br>"It is certainly something I have been really enjoying but I can't speak for the rest of the team - I think everybody else is probably hating it."<br><br>The defender said the side had not given up on beating relegation. "We know we are capable of finding the form to turn things around and we will be working hard. One of the problems for a new manager coming in mid-season, especially around Christmas time, is that he does not have enough time to see what the players can do in training.<br><br>"He is basing a lot of his assessments on what he sees in matches and that is nowhere near as good as having the players for a full pre-season. Hopefully, before the Charlton game, we can show the boss what we are really capable of and then turn it into a result."<br><br>Dailly said West Ham's progress had been badly affected by injuries.</div>
