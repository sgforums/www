              <p class="small bold"><em>BALLACK ... double target this week</em></p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">MICHAEL BALLACK says that Chelsea must beat Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday if they are to stay in the title reckoning. But he warned the Blues must first banish their home hoodoo with victory over Middlesbrough on Wednesday night. </h2>
              <p class="article">Chelsea have dropped 14 points in 11 home games this season. And Ballack, said: “We know it’s difficult to win at Anfield but it’s not impossible. </p>
              <p class="article">“If we want to go back to the top, we have to win but Wednesday is the immediate focus. “We have dropped too many points at home and we have to be careful. “We’ve not had good performance this year against the big teams. That has to change if we are to win the title.” </p>
              <p class="article">If Chelsea are to pose a real title threat they must improve on their Achilles heel which is set-pieces. They have not kept a clean sheet in six games and in Saturday’s 3-1 FA Cup win over Ipswich, when Ballack scored twice, they again conceded from a free-kick. </p>
              <p class="article">Ballack, 32, who wants to stay at the club for the rest of his career, added: “Set pieces are a little bit of a weakness right now. It’s a difficult period. “We have to be focused,defend better and improve or we kill our good game.” </p>
              <p class="article">Blues central defender Ricardo Carvalho is set for a fortnight out with another hamstring strain.</p>

              <p>I actually think Pool have a very good chance to win this match... Anfield is not an easy place especially for the big sides... When they come up against strong sides, they really prepare well for it... I am already thinking that Pool will take the lots of running and chasing type of approach to this match... They will close Chelsea's players down so fast that they won't have time on the ball...</p>
              <p>My personally opinion is... Pool have a 35% chance of winning this match, with Chelssea 25% and a draw at 40% chance...</p>
              <p>Don't forget, Chelsea are not exactly in great sharp themselves...</p>
              <p>The biggest disappointment for Pool must be Torres is really far from his last season's form... If people think Ronaldo isn't like what he was last season, then Torres must be much further from his last season's too... </p>

              <p>Save your time and your heart, sleep early.</p>
              <p>I support Liverpool, but, I think they will lose in a miserable way.</p>

              <p>chelsea doesnt like playing with sides who close them down fast denying them time and space on the ball, and benitez is good at playing those games..</p>
              <p>i think it will be a 1-1 draw although im supporting chelsea to win.</p>

              <p>Don't lose heart, looking at the current situation, I seriously belief Pool will get something from this match... 3 points or 1...</p>
              <p>Anfield is a very difficult place to win especially for the big sides when Pool are prepared... And I think Rafa was already preparing for this match when he took Gerrard off in that Wigan match... and maybe rested Keane for this reason too.</p>
              <p>The only one that could give Pool problems is Drogba but he seems like he isn't too interested to play these days... So Pool have a good chance to get 2nd place back...</p>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Rafael Benitez was cool, calm and collected on Friday as he prepared for the showdown with Barclays Premier League title rivals Chelsea. The Liverpool boss admits that January has been a "terrible" month, but insists he feels under no extra pressure as his side have drawn seven of their last 11 Premier League games and allowed Manchester United and Chelsea to leapfrog them in the title race.</strong></p>
              <p>Benitez went to great lengths to explain the contentious decisions to substitute Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard late in the disappointing 1-1 draw at Wigan. And although not wanting to go on the record, it was explained that his "crazy" remark after the JJB stadium game was a reference to the refereeing standards in the last three league games against more physical sides Stoke, Everton and Wigan.</p>
              <p>Benitez clearly believes his players were not given enough protection. Far from 'losing the plot' Benitez was all smiles and full of humour. He said: "We are eight points better off at this stage than last season. We are very positive and if we can beat Chelsea everybody will be talking in a different way about us.</p>
              <p>"We are in our best position for the last 10-15 years. So we have to enjoy it and try to keep doing our best. "There is no extra pressure on me. I can guarantee that I have not read a newspaper, listened to radio or watched TV since the Wigan game.</p>
              <p>"I spent Thursday enjoying some time off with my family because I knew there would be a lot of people trying to talk about things they do not know about." But he accepts that Liverpool must beat Chelsea.</p>
              <p>He added: "We showed character and quality to beat them earlier in the season, and we showed the same things in beating Manchester United here. "Now if we can continue to show those qualities and beat Chelsea again, maybe we will be in the headlines for something positive.</p>
              <p>"It has always been important to beat sides who are at the top, but maybe this year even more because we are very close to them. "We are closer. Last season we were 14 points behind at this stage, but now it is different."</p>
              <p>But Benitez knows Liverpool's situation, despite a 15-match unbeaten run, must improve quickly. Their downturn has come in a month that has seen Benitez launch his rant against Sir Alex Ferguson and end his contract negotiations while becoming involved in a saga over Robbie Keane's future at the club.</p>
              <p>But he said: "It has a bad month but the only thing that I would have done differently would have been to drink more water to maybe avoid the kidney stones trouble I have had. "But on the pitch, no. There have been very fine details that have cost us points. At Stoke in the final minutes Steven Gerrard hit a post. Against Everton we conceded a very late free-kick that should have bee avoided when they equalised.</p>
              <p>"And at Wigan we gave away a late penalty. You cannot control everything, but we should have six more points." He added: "We know our players, we speak to them every day and we know the decisions to make.</p>
              <p>"This has always been a must-win-game. As they all are. After my comments about Mr Ferguson we knew we still had to win at Stoke, those words didn't change anything on the pitch. It doesn't matter what is being said off the pitch."</p>
              <p>And on the controversial substitutions of Torres and Gerrard, Benitez said: "Torres was tired. We changed the wingers because we needed fresh legs, and Torres and Gerrard were the two players who were the most tired.</p>
              <p>"Gerrard has heart and he can keep working hard on the pitch, but even he was looking tired. "A player like Torres has to be fresh and quick, and he was not that so you have to make a decision. You have to consider the next game and you do not need to have the problem of a tired player getting injured, because that is what can happen.</p>
              <p>"When you have an injury (hamstring) like Fernando has had, you have to do a lot of strength work in the gym to build his power.</p>
              <p>"Then you have to give him different work to make him quicker and faster, because that is his strength.</p>
              <p>"Now they will both be better to play against Chelsea, and the massive difference is that we must beat the other top sides.</p>
              <p>"I changed Torres because he was tired and I wanted someone on the pitch who could keep the ball.</p>
              <p>"Then we conceded a penalty, and I had already decided to change Gerrard. But then we needed a fresh striker on to try to win the game, so I sent on Robbie Keane. Maybe he could have made the difference."</p>

              <h1>Chelsea will beat Liverpool and rejoin title hunt, says Salomon Kalou</h1>

              <p><strong>Salomon Kalou last night vowed to plunge Liverpool into further gloom on Sunday - and then put the pressure on Manchester United.</strong></p>
              <p>Chelsea go to Anfield having overtaken the Reds for the first time in two months, and the frontman is convinced the title momentum is with his side.</p>
              <p>Kalou, whose double saw off Boro on Wednesday, said: "Things have turned over the last few weeks and we'll go there in a different frame of mind. Liverpool broke our unbeaten home record, but now we can put the record straight.</p>
              <p>"If we win it would be a statement of intent to United because they probably thought we were out of it after we lost there. We will be right back in it."</p>

              <h1>FRANK LAMPARD TALKS TO MARTIN SAMUEL: On Chelsea's title ambitions and <span style="font-style: italic;">that </span>feud with Xabi Alonso.<br></h1>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/01/30/article-1132624-01F6368A0000044D-8_306x327.jpg" alt="Xabi Alonso and Frank Lampard" width="306" height="327"></p>
              <p><em>Previous: Xabi Alonso broke his leg in this challenge with Frank Lampard on New Year's Day 2005</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Lampard returns to Anfield, the last ground he played at while Pat (Mom) was alive. Emotion, however, will be tempered by the professional reality that is Chelsea’s continuing search for supremacy over their title rivals. Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal have each inflicted defeats on them and a second loss to Liverpool in one season would be viewed by many as the critical blow to the Premier League ambition of Luiz Felipe Scolari’s men.</strong></p>
              <p>It is a grudge match, too. None of the elite care to lose their duels, but games between Liverpool and Chelsea have added spice, the way that meetings of Arsenal and Manchester United once did.</p>
              <p>There is rivalry and then there are the teams that really don’t like each other. Lampard offers a diplomatic response, but a knowing smile.</p>
              <p>‘It is strong, I can’t deny that,’ he admits. ‘The players feel an extra edge. You’ll see it on Sunday. We’ve played them so many times in big games so lots of individual tensions build up. There is always something between me and Xabi Alonso, for instance.’</p>
              <p>But you broke his leg.</p>
              <p>‘Yes, I know, and it was a foul and I got booked, so I am not trying to plead innocence, but it was a tap, it wasn’t anything nasty; the sort of tackle that happens all the time, both ways. That night, when I heard how it had worked out, I felt very bad and phoned to apologise but he wouldn’t really have it and ever since he has that look in his eye when we meet, and there is always a bit of jostling and shoving.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/01/30/article-0-03384499000005DC-943_306x534.jpg" alt="Frank Lampard" width="306" height="534"></p>
              <p><em>Alex Ferguson mentioned our age as a mind game pre-season and it caught on</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also soon to be heading for the knackers yard, Lampard hopes, is the suggestion that Chelsea’s team is a spent force, old men on their last legs, exposed by United at Old Trafford and there for the taking at Anfield, if Liverpool get their act together.</p>
              <p>‘I know it was being talked of as the end of an era after the United game,’ Lampard recalls. ‘I can understand it because coming off that pitch felt terrible and not like us. But sometimes you have to touch the bottom to come back up and recapture what you really are. Now we can attempt to disprove the criticism and I think we have turned that corner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/01/30/article-1132624-03057800000005DC-614_468x396.jpg" alt="Frank Lampard and John Terry" width="468" height="396"></p>
              <p><em>Down but not out: Frank Lampard and John Terry trudge off the Old Trafford after the demoralising 3-0 defeat to Manchester United on January 11</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are not too old to win the League. Yes, we’ve got players who are 30, but they are top players. Sir Alex Ferguson mentioned our age as a mind game pre-season and it caught on, but I am 30 and feel better than I’ve ever felt, fitter and more experienced. Look at boxing, these days 30 can be your peak.</p>
              <p>‘Gianfranco Zola won Chelsea’s player of the year at 37. He was unbelievable. And how did Ryan Giggs play for Manchester United against us? Fantastic. </p>
              <p>‘There have been two over-reactions this season. We were never going to be the runaway champions that people talked about and I don’t think the crisis was as bad as it was made out to be. Maybe we were winning games too comfortably and some players started taking things for granted.</p>
