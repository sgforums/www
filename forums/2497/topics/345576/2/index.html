              <p><strong>Robbie Keane could make a dramatic return to Spurs amid reports suggesting that he is not in Liverpool's squad to play Chelsea on Sunday.</strong></p>
              <p>The striker has reportedly again been left out of Rafa Benitez's 18-man squad to face the Blues at Anfield and could be on the verge of an amazing return to Spurs in the next 24 hours.</p>
              <p>The Reds boss left Keane out of the squad last Sunday for the 1-1 draw against Everton in the FA Cup but he insisted on Friday that the Republic of Ireland star had been training well and he "thought" he remained a part of the long-term future at the club.</p>
              <p>However, fresh reports that he has again been overlooked by the Spaniard have fuelled talk that Spurs boss Harry Redknapp will sign the striker for around £15million after he made it clear in the week he was a big fan of the 28-year-old.</p>
              <p>Keane only moved from White Hart Lane, for a fee of £20.3m, in the summer, but Redknapp is keen to bolster his strikeforce after news that <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7975"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Jermain Defoe</span></span></a> will be out for four weeks.</p>

              <p>I think Alonso made too much of it by grabbing his leg and rolling in pain... I guess Alonso really don't like Lampard and wanted to get his revenge for breaking his leg a few yrs back...</p>
              <p>Yeah on Bosingwa and Gerrard, I think the FA should take another look... I think Gerrard was very lucky as I thought he could have been sent-off in the first few mins when after the referee had blown his whistle, Gerrard continue to proceed and smash the ball against Malouda's balls from close range... I thought he deserve a direct red there and then but he got away strangely... Then another incident he went in worst than Lamp's he also got away, not even a yellow card or he would have been sent-off as well when he dived and got his first yellow... I guess playing in Anfield has its benefits... Although I have to say Pool were already playing well even before Lampard got sent-off...</p>
              <p>Anyway, I kind of expected this result... I knew it would be hard for Chelsea to win at Anfield. Honestly speaking from a United's fan point of view... This result is better than Chelsea winning cos Pool could drop points against smaller clubs, while Chelsea hardly do... So not the worse result for United fans but I think it could kill Chelsea's as I feel this match was not just about 3 or 6 points... But it could kill off their morale for this season and ending their title ambition...</p>

              <p>I think Alonso made too much of it by grabbing his leg and
              rolling in pain... I guess Alonso really don't like Lampard and
              wanted to get his revenge for breaking his leg a few yrs
              back...</p>
              <p>Yeah on Bosingwa and Gerrard, I think the FA should take another
              look... I think Gerrard was very lucky as I thought he could have
              been sent-off in the first few mins when after the referee had
              blown his whistle, Gerrard continue to proceed and smash the ball
              against Malouda's balls from close range... I thought he deserve a
              direct red there and then but he got away strangely... Then another
              incident he went in worst than Lamp's he also got away, not even a
              yellow card or he would have been sent-off as well when he dived
              and got his first yellow... I guess playing in Anfield has its
              benefits... Although I have to say Pool were already playing well
              even before Lampard got sent-off...</p>
              <p>Anyway, I kind of expected this result... I knew it would be
              hard for Chelsea to win at Anfield. Honestly speaking from a
              United's fan point of view... This result is better than Chelsea
              winning cos Pool could drop points against smaller clubs, while
              Chelsea hardly do... So not the worse result for United fans but I
              think it could kill Chelsea's as I feel this match was not just
              about 3 or 6 points... But it could kill off their morale for this
              season and ending their title ambition...</p>

              <p><br>Yeah whoever, but the fact is Gerrard did smashed somebody's balls from close range... and he looks like he was doing it on intention... I won't necessary say he went for his groin on purpose, cos only he will know that but he still looks like he intended to hit the player... deserved a red for that despicable action... Its worst than diving which he also did last night...   </p>

              <p><em>Frank Lampard was controversially sent off for his challenge on Xabi Alonso</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1133703" rel="1133703|3| nofollow" href="/sport/football/article-1133703/You-just-cost-title-Chelsea-boss-Scolaris-fury-Lampard-red-card.html"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Luiz Felipe Scolari accused referee Mike Riley of derailing </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea’s</strong></span></a><strong> title challenge with the controversial sending-off of Frank Lampard in yesterday’s 2-0 defeat at Anfield.</strong></p>
              <p>The Chelsea manager urged Riley to review Lampard’s 60th-minute challenge on <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool</span></a> midfielder Xabi Alonso and to rescind his straight red card.</p>
              <p>Scolari, who conceded Chelsea’s Jose Bosingwa should have been dismissed for<br>slamming his studs into Yossi Benayoun’s back, admitted the loss had all but counted Chelsea out of the title race - two late goals from Fernando Torres securing a win that lifts Liverpool back into second place.</p>
              <p>Chelsea are third, five points behind leaders Manchester United, who have a game in hand. ‘I have not spoken to the referee, but I hope he will perhaps look at a video of the incident and say in his report he made a mistake,’ he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/02/02/article-0-03439E46000005DC-357_468x375.jpg" alt="Frank Lampard" width="468" height="375"></p>
              <p><em>Frank Lampard was given his marching orders on a miserable afternoon for Chelsea at Anfield</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>‘It was a foul by Alonso, not Lampard, so I just cannot understand the decision. If it is not overturned, Lampard has to miss three games because of a mistake and that cannot be right.</p>
              <p>‘It changed the game one million per cent, because they had so much more of the ball after that and created more. I would have accepted a red for Bosingwa but not Lampard.</p>
              <div class="clear">
              <p>'Whatever happens, we cannot change the result or its effect on our title chances. We will fight to the end but it is more distant for us now.’</p>
              <p>Lampard and Alonso have clashed before but the Chelsea midfielder insisted:<br>‘I had no intention of injuring the player. It was obvious I touched the ball and there is no way it was a red card offence.’</p>
              <p>Torres scored his first League goals since October, the first a brilliant near-post header in the 89th minute, the second an easy finish four minutes into added time that left Liverpool two points behind United.</p>
              <p>He said: ‘We knew that this was a massive game. Every player knew that. From the beginning until the very end, we worked really hard with intensity and determination. We are very happy with the 2-0 scoreline.</p>
              <p>‘We know that games in England, more than any other league, go for 90 minutes and you can score in any minute and you have to keep going until the end.</p>
              <p>‘It is a long race. We know that Manchester United are top of the table but we are going to fight with them until the end.</p>
              <p>Chelsea had one player less so they needed to defend. A draw was good for them but we needed to win. Once we had one extra player we kept creating more chances.</p>
              <p>‘It has brought back some belief and confidence. These were my first two goals since coming back from injury. I have scored at home for the first time this season and to do that against Chelsea was fantastic.’</p>

              <p>If Bosingwa's own manager said this, Then how on earth can the FA now not look into this matter?
