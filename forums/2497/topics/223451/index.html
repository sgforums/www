            <div class='col-md body'>Larsson pocketing over Â£100,000 a week for his Man Utd stint<br><br>Henrik Larsson will make over a million pounds for just ten weeks work when he joins Manchester United in January.<br><br>The Swede will reportedly bank between Â£100,000 and Â£125,000 (150,000 - 185,000 euros) every week he is with the club, a wage that will mean he is the highest paid player in the dressing room.<br><br>The loan deal will see the striker play for the English club for three months before returning to his current team, Swedish side Helsingborgs, when their season begins in March. The two sides confirmed the plans for the transfer on Friday.<br><br>However, in the English newspapers there are opposing reports as to the actual fee he will be paid.<br><br>The Sunday Express reports Larsson has a guaranteed Â£500,000 (740,000 euro) signing on fee and can then double that depending on his success with the club.<br><br>However, The Mail on Sunday contradict that by saying he will simply receive Â£125,000 a week as his basic wage, topping Rio Ferdinands reported Â£120,000 a week.<br><br>United are happy to pay as much as necessary if it helps them win the title, having gone six points clear at the top of the table on Saturday with a win over Middlesborough.<br><br>Larsson is expected to make his debut on New Years Day when the Red Devils travel away to Newcastle United.<br><br>He is expected to stay until March but reports differ as to the exact date for his final match.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually even 1.25m is not much in todays price for a striker of his standard...<br><br>Just to buy one ordinary striker will already cost &lt;10&gt; million already...
