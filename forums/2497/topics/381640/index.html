              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">THE FA face a £900,000 bill after skimping on an economy jet for England stars.</h2>
              <p class="article">Frank Lampard could be out for six weeks with a thigh injury after seven hours cramped on a plane on the way to Qatar for tomorrow's Brazil friendly.</p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea are furious and will claim his £151,000-a-week wages in compensation from the FA.</p>
              <p class="article">Lamps and his Three Lions team-mates were forced to spend the long-haul flight to Doha on a charter plane designed for short-haul only.</p>
              <p class="article">The superstar players are used to having flat beds for long journeys and were shocked to find seats that barely reclined. Several players complained of cramp and muscle pain after the flight.</p>
              <p class="article">The squad had their first training session yesterday morning. After an initial warm up, Lamps, 31, burst into a sprint and strained his left thigh.</p>
              <p class="article">Last season, the midfielder missed six weeks with a similar injury. He could now be ruled out of crucial league games against Arsenal, Manchester City, Wolves and Everton plus Champions League clashes with Porto and Apoel Nicosia.</p>
              <p class="article">The FA decision to book a cheap charter looks like it will backfire on them as they are only receiving a match fee of £400,000 for the Brazil friendly.</p>

              <p>yes it is pence wise, pounds foolish. all organisations, big or small are like that, trying to save up some little money, that they lose the big picture. its the boss mentality lar. any money dun spend is profits maximised. then they are drawing a huge salary every month, not to mention on the big bonuses they received. maybe they can volunteer to cut their salary by half and their bonuses.</p>

              <p>I would understand if they made them fly economy, but on a plane only meant for short hual flights is ridiculous.</p>
              <p>Of course on the other hand, a fit athelete straining his tigh just because of that is rather weird too.</p>

              <p>Reports are circulating today that <a id="ec2a8d94-d493-4784-b098-1d2cfe3ef0a2" href="http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Chelsea-s-Frank-Lampard-could-be-out-for-eight-weeks-after-England-training-knock-article219881.html"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Frank Lampard's thigh injury</span></span></strong></a> could actually have been caused by the FA skimping on the travel arrangements for England's trip to Qatar.</p>
              <p>Apparently the squad flew to Doha on a charter plane designed for short-haul only, with England's stars forced to squeeze into seats that 'barely reclined', let alone laid flat like the luxury first class berths they're used to.</p>
              <p>As crazy as that seems, it's still not enough to earn Lamps a place on MirrorFootball's all-time Top 10 freak football injuries list.</p>
              <p>And if we've missed out any of your favourites, let us know by leaving a comment in the box below.</p>
              <p><strong>1) The dog (domestic)<br></strong>Stoke's Liam Lawrence damaged his ankle after tripping over his dog, ruling him out for three months at the start of the 2008-09 season.</p>
              <p><strong>2) The remote control<br></strong>England goalkeeper David James once pulled a muscle in his back when reaching for the TV remote control.</p>
              <p><strong>3) The dog (on pitch)<br></strong>Brentford goalkeeper Chic Brodie's career came to an abrupt end in October 1970 when he collided with a sheepdog which had run on to the pitch. Brodie shattered his kneecap while the dog got the ball.</p>
              <p><strong>4) The golf clubs<br></strong>Kasey Keller knocked out his front teeth while pulling his golf clubs out of the boot of his car.</p>
              <p><strong>5) The accelerator<br></strong>Diminutive Aston Villa full-back Alan Wright once strained his knee by stretching to reach the accelerator in his new Ferrari. He subsequently swapped the sports car for a Rover 416.</p>
              <p><strong>6) The moose!<br></strong>Norway defender Svein Grondale had to withdraw from an international during the 1970s after colliding with a moose while out jogging.</p>
              <p><strong>7) The toddler<br></strong>Leeds and Blackburn midfielder David Batty managed to re-injure his Achilles tendon when he was run over by his toddler on a tricycle.</p>
              <p><strong>8) The pool of puppy pee<br></strong>Barnsley midfielder Darren Barnard was sidelined for five months with a torn knee ligament after he slipped in a puddle of his puppy's urine on the kitchen floor.</p>
              <p><strong>9) The loudmouth<br></strong>In 1975 Manchester United keeper Alex Stepney screamed so hard at his team-mates that he broke his jaw.</p>
              <p><strong>10) The stampede of pigs<br></strong>Indonesian footballer Mistar was killed aged just 25 by a stampede of pigs which overran his team's training pitch in 1995.</p>
