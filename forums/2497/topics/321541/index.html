              <p><strong> Sun Jihai has insisted he does not plan to quit international football despite being handed a five-game suspension by FIFA.</strong><br> <br>The
              30-year-old Manchester City defender was sanctioned after being sent
              off from the bench during China's 1-0 defeat to Qatar in Tianjin
              earlier this month.<br> <br>Sun was also fined 7,000 Swiss francs
              (Â£3,450) for verbally abusing Lebanese referee Talaat Najm as China
              went down to a controversial penalty to scupper their hopes of reaching
              the final round of the Asian qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup.<br> <br>"I
              was surprised when I heard of the suspension," said Sun. "I just said
              some words, which are usually heard in the Premier League. I did not
              verbally abuse him or insult him.<br> <br>"I do know I did something wrong at the time. But in the past, China has been disadvantaged by the referee's whistle.<br> <br>"I
              have nothing to say as China is a constant underachiever in soccer. But
              I still believe the referee at that match had problems with his
              whistle."<br> <br>The ban rules him out of the forthcoming
              Olympics in Beijing, where he could have played as one of three
              over-age players, but Sun is adamant he has no intention of retiring
              from the international game yet.<br> <br>"Yes, it will be a long time before I show up for the national team again, but anything is possible," he said.<br> <br>"I am not quitting yet and I still have the ambition to play for the national team."<br> <br>Sun
              looks set to leave Manchester City following the arrival of new manager
              Mark Hughes but intends to continue playing in Europe next season.<br> <br>"I still hope to play in European leagues," he said.<br> <br>"The 2008 Euros shows they are playing the best soccer in the world."</p>

              <h2>Chinese international Sun Jihai has opted to join Championship side
              Sheffield United after being released by Manchester City earlier this
              week.</h2>
              <p>The 30-year-old, who is considered China's most successful football
              export, arrives on transfer-fee free two-year deal after City decided
              against renewing his contract after six years at the club.<br><br>Sheffield
              United manager Kevin Blackwell will be privately pleased that the
              five-match ban that Sun picked up while on international duty recently
              means he cannot compete for China's Olympic team at the Beijing Games,
              thus meaning that the Blades' first permanent signing of the summer
              will not be absent for the month of August.</p>
