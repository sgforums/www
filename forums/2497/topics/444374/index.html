              <p><strong>The laws of the football Gods dictate that Andy Carroll will miraculously return to his swash-bucking, goal-scoring former self against his old club Newcastle on Friday night.</strong></p>
              <p>But I doubt handing the club he loves, the club that banked £35million in return for handing him over 11 months ago, a black eye (to use a topical metaphor) will actually delight the die-hard Geordie.</p>
              <p>Carroll's attachment to his native Tyneside is still strong. Some claim he's even homesick (if that's possible when he's living only 180 miles away).</p>
              <p>But a goal, or at the very least a bullish performance, will certainly be a way of signaling to Merseyside, and the army of Liverpool fans, that he can make a meaningful contribution to the Anfield cause over the next few years.</p>
              <p>The latest Carroll joke goes like this:</p>
              <p>Breaking news.... Andy Carroll has been handed an eight-game run in the Liverpool team by the FA. Anfield chiefs are set to appeal.</p>
              <p>The Geordie fans prefer to look at the raw stats.</p>
              <p>Carroll at Liverpool - five goals in 29 appearances.</p>
              <p>Demba Ba, his replacement (on a free transfer) at Newcastle - 14 league goals in his last 14 games.</p>
              <p>Let's get one thing straight. Carroll was never worth £35m (£30m of which went straight into Newcastle's bank account) 11 months ago. And he never will be worth £35m.</p>
              <p>That inflated fee came about only because of the (now also ludicrous looking) £50m Chelsea were prepared to pay Liverpool for Fernando Torres.</p>
              <p>And it came about because of the supreme, hard-nosed, taking-the-**** business brinkmanship of Newcastle owner Mike Ashley.</p>
              <p>Ashley is maligned for many things, but he screwed Liverpool out of an amazing fee for a 21-year-old with just one decent Championship campaign and half a good season in the top flight to his name.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, Carroll (who despite his wild-boy reputation, is, when sober, a quiet lad with a gentle smile and modest outlook) is now stuck with the accolade of being Britain's most expensive footballer. One who is struggling to find his niche at Anfield.</p>
              <p>On Wednesday, it will have been a year since Carroll played his last game for the Geordies, against Spurs. He was on a run of four goals in five games. He had bagged 11 in 21.</p>
              <p>After being flown to Liverpool on transfer deadline day in Ashley's personal helicopter, he netted two in nine appearances last season after shaking off his thigh injury and has added only three in 20 this term.</p>
              <p>Why is that?</p>
              <p>Sceptics can point to his fondness for a drink - how long can that last before the athletic sharpness is blunted, we ask? No amount of going to Boyzone concerts with Kenny Dalglish will cure the lad's thirst.</p>
              <p>A bigger problem is that Liverpool are not set up around Carroll's strengths.</p>
              <p>The Newcastle of last season were - long balls were thrown up to him, he bullied, chased and battered defenders and scored some great headed goals.</p>
              <p>Liverpool's play is far more subtle (as is the evolving Newcastle side's this season, by the way) and he has fewer chances to use his physical attributes.</p>
              <p>That is the puzzling thing about the fee Liverpool paid. Should they really have forked out so much if they did not have a plan for getting the best out of Carroll?</p>
              <p>Maybe we will see those tactics emerge now he has the chance of a run in the side.</p>
              <p>It all begs the question: Would Newcastle want Carroll back?</p>
              <p>From what we hear, he would love to be back there. One day. He has not given up on being a Geordie No9 in black and white stripes. One day.</p>
              <p>The fact is, he'd be welcomed home with open arms by most fans - as long as he kept the off-field troubles that were a bane at bay.</p>
              <p>True, he quadrupled his salary in going to Liverpool (wages Newcastle were, and still are, unable to match), and he was going to a club with a superb heritage and more trophy-winning potential.</p>
              <p>But this was not a money-grabbing move on the player's behalf.</p>
              <p>I believe he was caught up in the business of football - a commodity to be traded between Newcastle (desperate for the cash), Liverpool (desperate to show ambition with Torres gone) and agents (desperate for their cut).</p>
              <p>Of course Carroll has benefited financially from that. It has set him up for life.</p>
              <p>But I reckon that had it been a simple question of where he <em>wanted</em> to play, Carroll would have soldiered on very happily as his hometown club's No9.</p>
              <p>And that is why I'm sure Andy Carroll will get a warm reception from the travelling support at Anfield on Friday.</p>
              <p>They'd have him back in a flash.</p>
              <p>And what a team Newcastle would be, with him spearheading the attack (instead of barren Leon Best), Ba looking slippery beside him and Hatem Ben Arfa coming back to form.</p>
              <p>Yes, Newcastle have missed you, Andy.</p>
              <p>But probably not as much as you have missed Newcastle.</p>

              <p>Newcastle will be missing Ba to African Cup next month.</p>
              <p>So, Newcastle will have goal crisis soon.</p>
              <p>The focus will be on Ponytail again.</p>
              <p>But, he will not be inspired like Downing. (The Villa match in which Downing started is the only match he play hard)</p>
              <p>He is still trying to find his sharpness and goal form.</p>
              <p>I dunno what or who can motivated him to work hard and get involved in the game like Luis.</p>
              <p>After all the mocking and support from all direction, he still look lazy and clumsy to me and a liability to the team.</p>
              <p>Maybe he can prove me wrong, I dun know.</p>

              <p><span>Luis Suarez has been banned again after picking up a one-match suspension for his finger gesture at Fulham fans.</span></p>
              <p><span>The striker, who has already been banned for EIGHT matches for racially abusing Patrice Evra, gave the bird to home fans at Craven Cottage earlier this month.</span></p>
              <p><span>The Reds have also been fined £20,000 for failing to control their players in the fiery clash at Craven Cottage.</span></p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><span>Suarez will now miss Friday's match at home to Newcastle, with Andy Carroll now expected to face his old club.</span></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><span>It is the first time manager Kenny Dalglish has been unable to select Suarez since the player arrived from Ajax for £22.8million in January.<br></span></div>
              <p><span>An FA statement read: 'Liverpool Football Club have been fined £20,000 by The FA and warned as to their future conduct for failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion during the league fixture at Fulham on 5 December 2011. </span></p>
              <p><span>'The club admitted the charge, which was in relation to the dismissal of Jay Spearing, but did not accept the standard £20,000 penalty for the offence. However, at an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing today [Wednesday 28 December] the fine was imposed. </span></p>
              <p><span>'Meanwhile, Liverpool player Luis Suarez will begin a one match suspension with immediate effect after he admitted an FA charge of improper conduct in relation to the same game.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Suarez was also fined £20,000 and warned as to his future conduct following a gesture he made towards the Fulham fans at the end of the fixture.'</span></p>

              <p><span>Suarez was given a torrid time by the home support throughout the 1-0 defeat in west London on December 5 as he was subjected to chants of 'cheat' for what Fulham supporters perceived to be his constant diving.</span></p>
              <p><span>He cracked after the final whistle by making an explicit hand gesture towards the stands.</span></p>
              <p><span>However, in the days after the game Dalglish was so incensed by some of the treatment the 24-year-old was subjected to by Fulham players he used his pre-match press conference to show a DVD of incidents he felt supported his claims.</span></p>
              <p><span>He also argued against the Jay Spearing dismissal, when the midfielder won the ball but his follow-through caught Mousa Dembele, which prompted the protest to Friend by a number of his players.</span></p>

              <p><span>Last week, Suarez was given an eight-match ban for racially abusing Manchester United’s Evra.</span></p>
              <p><span>An FA statement said the 24-year-old Uruguay striker had used words that ‘included a reference to Mr Evra’s colour’ when United and Liverpool met at Anfield on October 15, which amounts to a serious breach of the governing body’s rules.</span></p>
              <p><span>After having spent a further four days considering evidence from last week’s disciplinary hearing, the three-man Independent Regulatory Commission also fined Suarez £40,000.</span></p>
              <p><span>Liverpool, whose players and manager Kenny Dalglish wore T-shirts supporting Suarez in the warm-up to their match at Wigan, are set to appeal the eight-game ban once they have assessed the commission's detailed report.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool striker Luis Suarez is unavailable as he serves a one-match suspension.</strong></p>
              <p>That could give Andy Carroll the chance to make back-to-back league starts for the first time since the beginning of November.</p>
              <p>Captain Steven Gerrard returned from a two-month absence with a substitute appearance on Boxing Day, but is likely to start on the bench again.</p>
              <p>Newcastle striker Demba Ba will be fit to take his place in the side for the game.</p>
              <p>The Senegal international, who scored his 14th goal of the season at Bolton on Boxing Day, suffered a knock to his knee but will be fit.</p>
              <p>Full-back Davide Santon, who missed out at the Reebok Stadium with a knee problem, is fit and Dan Gosling has completed his three-match ban, but Danny Guthrie (groin), Peter Lovenkrands (calf) and Steven Taylor (Achilles) remain on the sidelines.</p>
              <p>Liverpool (from): Reina, Johnson, Agger, Skrtel, Enrique, Kuyt, Adam, Henderson, Downing, Carroll, Bellamy, Doni, Kelly, Carragher, Coates, Shelvey, Gerrard, Spearing, Rodriguez.</p>
              <p>Newcastle (from): Krul, Elliot, Harper, Simpson, R Taylor, Santon, Ferguson, Perch, Coloccini, Williamson, Kadar, Tiote, Cabaye, Obertan, Ben Arfa, Gutierrez, Sammy Ameobi, Gosling, Abeid, Vuckic, Smith, Ba, Best, Shola Ameobi.</p>
