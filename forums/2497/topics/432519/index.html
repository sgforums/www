              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">CHELSEA are ready to offer Luka Modric £130,000 a week to defect to Stamford Bridge.</h2>
              <p>That is almost triple the Croatian's £50,000-a-week White Hart Lane wages.</p>
              <p>And the Blues are hoping that their mega-money deal will convince the £15million -rated playmaker to cross the capital.</p>
              <p>Chelsea want to add some much-needed flair and creativity to a squad that ended the season empty handed.</p>
              <p>The Spurs star, who still has three years on his current contract, is one of their top summer targets along with a right-back and a flying winger.</p>
              <p>A Chelsea insider said: "Not having a manager yet won't slow anything down.</p>
              <p>"There's a hitlist of players to sign and Modric is right at the top of it."</p>
              <p>Blues skipper John Terry is confident new faces will give his side a lift.</p>
              <p>Terry said: "We made two fantastic signings in January in Fernando Torres and David Luiz. They have really freshened the club up, and hopefully there will be some more new signings."</p>

              <p>Well, in Spain and Italy the manager is there just to coach anyway... Nevertheless, it's much better to have an owner who is willing to pour his own millions into the squad than an owner who doesn't want or can't afford to spend right?</p>

              <p>I highly believe Hiddink will continue with the 4-3-3 formation...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is 3 midfield spaces to fight for...so it probably looks like this:</p>
              <p>Lampard/Modric/McEachran, Mikel/Essien, Ramires/Essien.</p>
              <p>So Essien IMO is the one who really need to fight hard with Ramires and Mikel to obtain a space in the starting 11.</p>
              <p>Lampard is ageing, I think his legs are really getting old, not sure how long more can he last... Hence there is a Modric here to replace him. McEachran the next "Wilshere" is still young and Chelsea probably dont want to put too much pressure on him.</p>

              <p>Spurs manager Harry Redknapp has always insisted Modric will stay at Spurs and that his worth is way in excess of £25m.</p>
              <p>But Abramovich is determined to press ahead with his first signing of the close season despite the fact he is yet to appoint a replacement for manager Carlo Ancelotti.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's formal bid was rejected by Spurs within two hours but Abramovich is desperate to add more creativity to Chelsea's midfield.</p>
              <p>He also wants to reduce the average age of the club's squad and Modric's extra flair and pace have established him as the Blues' No 1 target.</p>

              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Luka Modric dropped a bombshell on Tottenham when he told <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>he wants to leave White Hart Lane and sign for Chelsea.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The midfielder took the stunning decision to declare his reasons for wanting to join Chelsea, who are  preparing a second offer for the Croat in the next 48 hours. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">It is an action that will enrage his employers and Spurs supporters, but Modric says he wants to move to a club with ambitions of winning the Barclays Premier League title and is going  public to force the issue.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Last night the 25-year-old spoke to <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>from his holiday boat and said: ‘I want to leave Tottenham as friends. I have enjoyed my time there, but now it is right for me to look at another club. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I have an arrangement with the chairman. When I signed my new contract, he said that, if another club came to sign me, they would consider the offer.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">
              </span></p><p> </p>
              <p></p>

              <div class="floatRHS"><em> </em></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>A second Chelsea offer is due - and this time the price will rise from their opening £22million bid to closer to £30m. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">And Modric said: ‘Chelsea are a big club with an  ambitious owner. They have great players and they have ambitions to fight for the title and win the Champions League. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘I want to stay in  London. I am very happy here and so are my  family. I like the city.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The news will explain why Manchester City and Manchester United have been monitoring and talking, rather than formally bidding. They have clearly got wind of Modric’s desire to stay in London in the last 24 hours, which puts  Chelsea in pole position.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘I don’t want to have an argument with Tottenham,’ said Modric. ‘The supporters have been very good to me and I have enjoyed my time playing for the club, but it is for football that players leave clubs and move. It has happened to Tottenham before. It is normal for a player to dream about playing for a bigger club.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Modric will speak to Spurs chairman Daniel Levy about arranging the transfer but insists the desire to leave is not about money. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘If somebody comes to the club and the offer is good for me and  acceptable to them, then I want to leave,’ he said. ‘It has to be good for my ambition. It has to be a club who are winning titles and playing in the Champions League.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>‘This is not about money, it is about  ambition. When I came to England, I was dreaming about winning titles. That is still the same.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘Tottenham are a big club, with good players and a good manager, but I want to fight for the championship. Spurs will always have a place in my heart. My experiences in the  Champions League have left me with the desire for more.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">When asked what  happens next, Modric said: ‘I need to talk with the chairman. I won’t ask for a transfer, no. That would be disrespectful. I hope they can reach an agreement (with another club) that is satisfactory for everyone. I am on holiday, but I need to speak and to see if I can find a solution to this.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Spurs fans will expect Levy to offer Modric a new contract and keep his word. The chairman has said that he will not allow the player to go, while manager Harry  Redknapp described the original Chelsea offer as ‘ridiculous’. <br></span></p>

              <p>To be fair, who wouldn't want to go if you are only earning £40,000 a week currently and on offer just across the road so to speak is £130,000 waiting for you doing exactly the same thing as what you are doing now? Maybe got better chance of winning things somemore...</p>
              <p>To borrow Joe cole's words... It's really a no-brainer not to want to go...</p>
              <p>I think he should be a good fit at Chelsea and Torres will be a lot happier too...</p>

              <p>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Spurs fans understandably described Chelsea's £22million bid for Luka Modric as laughable.</strong></p>
              <p>And fee-wise it was. But the timing suggests the Croatian is Roman Abramovich's number one summer target and this was merely an opening gambit. Factor in December's quote from Dynamo Zagreb vice-president, Zdravko Mamic, that his close friend Modric would be heading to Chelsea in the summer, and there's a good chance those Spurs laughs could turn to tears when the bid gets closer to £40million.</p>
              <p>If it does, another person to stop smiling could be Frank Lampard. He's already struggling to hang on to his England shirt, is 33 on Monday, and appears to be past his peak. Despite being injured last season he still played 31 games in which he managed only six assists. In the previous two seasons he made 20 and 19.</p>
              <p>Chelsea is an ageing team in need of some ruthless decisions. Just as Alex Ferguson had to to let Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes know they had no automatic right to a shirt when they hit 33, so might the next Chelsea boss tell Lampard.</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>Spending £40milllion on Modric might make the decision a lot easier.</p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>However, Levy said in a statement: 'I wish to make it absolutely clear, as I have said previously, that none of our key players will be sold this summer. We are building a team for the future to consistently play at the highest level and retaining quality players is crucial to that.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'In respect of Luka Modric, we are not prepared to sell, at any price, to Chelsea Football Club or any other club. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'We made our stance on this issue abundantly clear in writing to Chelsea. They chose to ignore it and then subsequently made the offer public.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'For the avoidance of any doubt, let me reiterate that we shall not enter into any negotiations whatsoever, with any club, regarding Luka. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'We now consider this matter closed.'</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp has repeatedly said his prized midfielder is not for sale and would be unwilling to even entertain offers of less than £30million.</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I want to leave Tottenham as friends. I have enjoyed my time there, but now it is right for me to look at another club.</span></p>
