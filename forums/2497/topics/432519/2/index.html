              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Harry Redknapp has insisted </strong></span><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html"><span style="color: #003580; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Tottenham</strong></span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong> cannot afford to sell Luka Modric and must instead strengthen their squad if they want success.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Croatia midfielder exclusively revealed in Saturday’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span> that he wished to join </span><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580; font-size: x-small;">Chelsea</span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;">, but Tottenham boss Redknapp has urged the club to convince Modric he can fulfil his ambitions at White Hart Lane.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Tottenham failed to qualify for the Champions League after reaching the quarter-finals last season and Modric has insisted he wanted to sign for a ‘bigger club’, play in Europe’s premier club competition and win titles.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘If Tottenham are looking to go anywhere, we can’t be selling Luka.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘We have to do something to keep him at the club. We can’t afford to sell Luka Modric if we want to be a successful club.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘We have to show him our ambition, which we will do. If we can add one or two good players to our squad there’s no reason we can’t have another great season. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Tottenham could be a great club for him to stay with for the next few years. That’s what we’re hoping for. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘He’s a fantastic lad. You’ll never meet a better lad than Luka. I suppose he’s seen a massive contract and the chance to win the Premier League and play in the Champions League and that’s what he wanted.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘But we want that as well. We want to get back in the Champions League and we need him to help us do that,’ the Spurs boss told BBC Radio 5 Live’s Sportsweek. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Daniel Levy issued a strongly worded statement on Saturday saying Modric was not for sale ‘at any price’ and that none of his key players will be sold this summer. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘We are building a team for the future to consistently play at the highest level, and retaining quality players is crucial to that,’ he added.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Redknapp said it was vital the chairman kept his word. ‘If Daniel’s saying “no”, he can’t be seen to be going back on that now. He’s made a very strong statement. I wouldn’t see Daniel backtracking on that at any price.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Spurs boss also said Chelsea are not alone in their interest in Modric, for whom they have made an initial £22million bid. Manchester City and Manchester United have also been tracking the midfielder, but the  25-year-old is keen to stay in London.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">A Spurs source said the club are ‘monitoring’ Chelsea’s public pursuit of Modric, having made their stance ‘abundantly clear’ in writing. But Sportsmail understands an official complaint had not been made to the Premier League this weekend.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Redknapp admitted Chelsea’s interest in the midfielder was ‘difficult to understand’, when the west London club have yet to appoint Carlo  Ancelotti’s successor after sacking the Italian on the last day of the season.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Tottenham boss said: ‘Chelsea are not the only club that have been in for him. There have been other clubs — top clubs. But (the Chelsea interest) is very strange and difficult to understand. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'This has been going on for quite a while, not just this week.It’s been going on for the last three or four weeks, since Carlo Ancelotti lost his job. Somebody else at Chelsea is choosing the players — not the new manager.’ </span></p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">LUKA MODRIC'S relationship with Spurs was in meltdown last night.</h2>
              <p>The Croatian, who craves a move to Chelsea, informed Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy he wanted out in a stormy meeting.</p>
              <p>But Levy told Modric, 25, he would let him rot on the bench rather than sell him to the Blues, who have made a £22million bid for his services.</p>
              <p>Levy dug his heals in and told Modric he would not be sold at any price.</p>
              <p>The Spurs chief insisted he would not entertain any increased bids insisting it would "make no difference".</p>
              <p>An insider said: "The gloves are off. Luka reminded Levy that when he signed a new contract there was an agreement he could go if he felt it was better for his career.</p>
              <p>"But Levy wasn't interested and told Luka he had to tell the papers he was staying.</p>
              <p>"Luka refused and said he would never do that and told Levy he was appalled he was reneging on their deal."</p>
              <p>Modric is back in training at Spurs today and will meet boss Harry Redknapp and emphasise his determination to quit.</p>
              <p>After meeting Modric, Levy claimed: "Everything was fine. We had a very good conversation and, as I said previously, Luka Modric will not be sold.</p>
              <p>"It's the end of it. As I said a few weeks ago there's no further discussion on it.</p>
              <p>"I'm sure once he's back with his team-mates everything will be fine. This is not about money, we're not selling our best players."</p>
              <p>It is understood Chelsea are prepared to pay Modric £150,000 a week which is almost four times what he is on at Spurs. </p>
              <p>Earlier in the day he was asked about his chances of joining Chelsea as he boarded a flight from Zagreb. He said: "Anything is possible."</p>
              <p>Redknapp admitted: "It's difficult when crazy sums of money are being bandied about. But we need to keep Luka and all our best players if we are to improve.</p>
              <p>"We simply have to get stronger, not weaker."</p>

              <p>Well, eventually he will come round to it if he does stay. Cos if he wants to play and also not let those playing around him to despise him for a lack of professionalism... he will put it to a side, at least fo a while...</p>
              <p>The ball is clearly in Spurs court with him still having a long contract with them (maybe 3 to 4 yrs)... If Spurs really want to make it difficult, they can make him sit on the bench for the whole of next season especially when his salary is so low it won't really hurt them much...</p>
              <p>Levy is the guy that is probably the most difficult to deal with in the premier league and Chelsea will find this out very soon... Anyway, given the money on offer, £22m, it's really not that much. Levy could make Modric sit for another 2 yrs than still sell him for that price or maybe even higher considering he is still 25 only.</p>

              <p><strong>The Tottenham midfielder </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Luka Modric" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/luka-modric"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Luka Modric</strong></span></a><strong> has reiterated his desire to leave for </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Chelsea" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chelsea"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span></a><strong> this summer and accused his chairman, Daniel Levy, of going back on a gentleman's agreement between them that he would be allowed to move if a bigger club came in for him.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chelsea have already had a £22m offer for Modric turned down by Spurs at the end of June, and the Croatian midfielder immediately sought talks with Levy on his return to pre-season training this week.</p>
              <p>Levy confirmed after those talks on Thursday that Modric would not be leaving White Hart Lane and that the player understood the club's stance and was happy to remain at the club.</p>
              <p>However, Modric told the Croatian newspaper, Sportske Novosti, that he had not considered the possibility of Spurs not allowing him to leave.</p>
              <p>"I haven't thought about it at all because [not letting me go] would definitely not be good for anyone. I have already told the chairman that last summer he said we would find a mutually satisfactory agreement if a club like Chelsea came in.</p>
              <p>"I hope that eventually he will understand the situation and that we will reach an agreement and go our separate ways in an appropriate manner."</p>
              <p>Modric also revealed that in his meeting with the Spurs chairman Levy had said he was happy to let the midfielder spend the season rotting in the reserves if he did not honour his contract.</p>
              <p>"A lot has been published in the press about the meeting with Levy, who gave the public a twisted account of what happened. I must say that I am genuinely disappointed about what Levy said to me. He didn't care about what I was telling him. It all only convinced me further that I was right to consider moving on to another club.</p>
              <p>"I reminded the chairman of our gentleman's agreement when we were in Dubrovnik last summer and I agreed a contract extension with Tottenham. Then I had an open chat with Levy – that if a bigger club came in with a concrete offer, we would consider it and agree the best solution for all concerned.</p>
              <p>"The chairman said, 'OK, we'll sit and talk [about any offers]'. Now Levy doesn't want to talk to me and said there is no possibility that I can leave Spurs.</p>
              <p>"He threatened me – he said if I didn't accept the club's stance, they would make me sit on the bench or in the stands."</p>
              <p>Modric knows he is highly sought after by the Stamford Bridge club and their new manager, André Villas-Boas.</p>
              <p>"There is no doubt that Chelsea want me – they sent a concrete offer to Tottenham. I know that the new Chelsea boss said he wants me in his team. Of course I am flattered by this interest in me, it's a club that all players dream of joining, fighting for every competition available.</p>
              <p>"It wasn't a snap decision, I talked a long time with my family and people whose opinions I respect. I thought about it, weighed it all up, and finally decided this was the best option."</p>

              <p><strong>People around Luka Modric claim his predicament is similar to Sami Nasri's and Ashley Young's. </strong></p>
              <p>That he wants to move to a "bigger stage" so it's only right to let him. No it's not. They had (or have) one year left on their contract, Modric has five.</p>
              <p>Which is why Daniel Levy is showing him that contract and asking where it says he can walk out after honouring 17% of it. Levy isn't thinking of anything other than Spurs, but if he sticks to this stance he will strike a blow for managers and fans everywhere.</p>
              <p>Modric's agent is now saying all he and Luka want to do is sort things out by sitting down and talking, presumably about how Spurs can win back his loyalty  with another pay rise.</p>

              <p>I hope Levy does allow his agent to sit down. On an uncomfortable chair he's pointed at the wall.</p>
              <p>And tells him to talk away.</p>

              <p><br>Well, basically he wants to move to a club with a better chance of winning something I guess... Of course the salary is also another big pulling factor.</p>
              <p>He definitely can make it at Chelsea especially with this new boss who is more keen to play the ball on the ground more than up in the air to Drogba kind...</p>
              <p>If he does join them, Lampard's days as a starter could be over...</p>
              <p>And why Chelsea? I guess there is nothing to do with traditions and pedigree... Just a better chance of winning and earning more $$$. Also, I guess he wants to move clubs but not move everything else like his house, kids school etc... In other words, he wants to stay in London that's why Chelsea is the best fit for him...</p>
