              <p>He told <em>talkSPORT</em>: "They [the FA] have got a manager and until 
              he's not the manager it's difficult to talk about it. But I'm English, 
              who wouldn't want to manager England?</p>
              <p>"There's not an Englishman - whether it's me, Roy Hodgson or Sam

              <h1>Fabio Capello to keep his job as England manager despite World Cup 
              debacle</h1>

              </div>
              <p>Fabio Capello is to remain as England manager.</p>
              <p>The Football 
              Association confirmed the news this afternoon, bringing a swift end to 
              speculation about the Italian's future.</p>
              <p>'I am more determined than
               ever to succeed with the England team,' said Capello.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/02/article-1291495-0A3A5687000005DC-148_468x309.jpg" alt="Still the boss: Capello will remain in charge of the England team" width="468" height="309">

              </div>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The decision was taken following a meeting of the four-man 
              Club
              England board, which decided unanimously to keep Capello, despite the
              Three Lions' woeful performance at the World Cup.</p>
              <p>The full Football Association board subsequently ratified the
              recommendation, which means Capello will now continue in his 
              £6million-a-year role until the end of Euro 2012.</p>
              <p>'Sir Dave Richards has called me to tell me everyone at the FA wants 
              me to continue,' said Capello.</p>
              <p>'I explained it is very important we use the disappointment as a 
              motivation in the future.</p>
              <p>'I can assure the fans I am now fully focused on our European
              qualifying fixtures, starting with the friendly against Hungary in
              August.'</p>

               Germany" width="468" height="305">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Crushed: England players come to terms with the 
              4-1 hammering from Germany</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>In the immediate aftermath of England's record 4-1 defeat by
              Germany in Bloemfontein last Sunday, it was felt Capello would have to
              go, even though it had not been four weeks since he signed a revised
              contract, removing a break clause that would have taken effect after
              the World Cup.</p>
              <p>Yet, within 24 hours, Capello was signalling his intention to
              continue, leaving the FA in no doubt they would be forced into a costly
              compensation exercise should they decide to part company with the
              64-year-old.</p>
              <p>Crucially, while many former players, including Alan Shearer,
              demanded Capello's sacking, those far closer to the action adopted a
              different approach. Bolton chairman - and senior FA figure - Phil
              Gartside, threw his weight behind Capello, which was seen as crucial
              given he is a long-time ally of Club England chairman Sir David
              Richards.</p>
              <p>Another member of the FA hierarchy, David Sheepshanks, urged
              caution at virtually the same time as Roy Hodgson, the overwhelming
              favourite to replace Capello, was being installed as Liverpool manager.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/02/article-1291495-0A406A29000005DC-102_468x335.jpg" alt="Tails between their legs: Players and staff arrive back after the

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Tails between their legs: Players and staff 
              arrive back after the tournament</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The FA did have alternative options in Harry Redknapp and Stuart 
              Pearce. But given how much it was going to cost them, Capello's 
              admittedly impressive record prior to the entire World Cup finals 
              campaign, which started badly with the ill-fated 'Capello Index' and got
               worse virtually by the day, and the need to end the uncertainty, 
              Richards feels the FA have reached the correct conclusion.</p>
              <p>'We 
              are all still extremely disappointed at our performance in South Africa,
               and we believed it was important that we took some time to reflect on 
              everything in a calm and considered manner back in England,' said 
              Richards.</p>
              <p>'After fully discussing our performance we remain 
              convinced that Fabio is the best man for the job.</p>
              <p>'He went 
              into the World Cup with a reputation as one of World football's finest 
              managers and we are confident Fabio will benefit from his first 
              international tournament experience and this will undoubtedly make us 
              all stronger for the Euro 2012 campaign.'</p>

              </div>
              <p>Although it had been suggested some members of the FA board were 
              unhappy at the way the Club England offshoot had taken full 
              responsibility for the post-South Africa period, acting chairman Roger 
              Burden expressed his support for the move.</p>
              <p>He said: 'The FA 
              Board supports this decision. It is the right decision and will allow us
               now to rebuild for the future with Fabio leading us forward.'</p>
              <p>Capello can now continue with the holiday he went on within hours of his
               arrival back in London, and start preparing for the friendly with 
              Hungary on August 11 and then the Euro 2012 qualifying programme, which 
              starts with a home game against Bulgaria on September 3.</p>
              <p>He 
              has already offered a list of players who were not in South Africa who 
              can hope to be involved, including Manchester City winger Adam Johnson, 
              Arsenal trio Theo Walcott, Kieran Gibbs and Jack Wilshere and Fulham 
              forward Bobby Zamora.</p>
              <p>'We will look to introduce new players 
              to give the team new energy and I will use all my experience to take 
              England forward,' said Capello.</p>
              <p>'I am extremely proud to be 
              the England manager, it means so much to me and I am determined to 
              succeed.'</p>

              <p>Dun think Capello can bring England to greater heights with the style of kick and rush and hustle and bustle football. this type of football is really unpretty to the eye as compared to Brazil's samba or Spain's passing and possession football.</p>
              <p>england need to change the way they play, from kick and rush to a passing and possession football style. they need to teach kids from young to emphasise on technical skills, like back to the basics, like dribbling, passing, trapping of the ball etc.</p>
