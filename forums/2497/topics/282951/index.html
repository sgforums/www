            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://bluechampions.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/arsene.jpg"><br><br>Arsene Wenger has amazingly claimed that winning the Champions League is an "overrated" achievement.<br><br>The Arsenal boss - who has never won European football's most prestigious club trophy - believes it is a far greater achievement winning the Premier League instead.<br><br>The Gunners head for Romania to take on Steaua Bucharest on Tuesday with Wenger playing down the significance of the competition.<br><br>"It is overrated," said Wenger. "It is a cup, it is not a championship - how many games do you need to win?<br><br>"If it was a European championship over 38 games then it would be different and you can say the team who wins that is really the best in Europe. Were AC Milan the best team in Europe last season? I'm not convinced.<br><br>"I think it is harder to win the Premier League than the Champions League because you do not have to win as many games to be crowned champions of Europe."<br><br>Wenger insisted it does not worry him that, unlike managers such as Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, Rafa Benitez at Liverpool and former Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho who won it at Porto, he does not have the Champions League trophy on his CV. He said: "I want to achieve it because I want this club to win it, but for my ego it is less important. I judge a manager on what he has achieved in his whole career, not on this one trophy.<br><br>"I am not saying I wasn't interested in that glory 10 years ago, but I am much less so now. When you are very young you want to win it to say: 'I am the best'. But when you have more experience you know you can be the best one day and less good the next, it is all a game.<br><br>"I want to achieve it for the players and the club but less so for myself to say: 'Look how good I am'. Your ego is less when more experienced."</div>
