              <p><strong><span>The extraordinary scale of Roman Abramovich's bid to make </span><span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span><span> the best team in Europe was laid bare yesterday, as accounts revealed the Russian has ploughed nearly £1billion into the club. </span></strong>
              </p><p><span>Since 2003 Abramovich, 44, has provided interest-free loans of £740million as well as spending £30m last summer and £73m on David Luiz and Fernando Torres in January. </span></p>
              <p><span>Yet Chelsea's wage bill - which rose by £19.5m for the period ending June 2010 - still represents 82 per cent of turnover, far higher than the 70 per cent UEFA's financial fair play rules will allow. </span></p>
              <p><span>But Carlo Ancelotti insisted his position at Stamford Bridge does not hinge on winning the Champions League this season. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>The Chelsea boss said: 'No, I don't think the decision on my future at the club rests on the Champions League. The club knows me, my behaviour, and they will take their decision on that.' </span><span><br></span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Ancelotti also said he may choose to drop £50m signing Torres for the second leg of Chelsea's quarter-final at Manchester United on Tuesday. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Chelsea must overturn a 1-0 deficit but Torres, 27, has yet to score in 617 minutes in a blue shirt. </span></p>
              <p><span>Ancelotti said: 'Fernando might not start against United, of course. This is my job. I have to choose the players, not comparing the players with the money the club paid for them. Fernando knows this very well (and) Roman's so intelligent he'd never ask me to do this.' <br></span></p>
              <p><span>The Chelsea manager would not confirm if Torres will start against Wigan today, but continued to back the out-of-form striker. </span></p>
              <p><span>Ancelotti said: 'I have seen a lot of players - (Hernan) Crespo, (Filippo) Inzaghi, (Andriy) Shevchenko - go through these moments. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>'Crespo went his first six months in Milan without scoring a goal. He started in November and it finished with two goals in the final of the Champions League, but it was not enough. This is the life of a striker. </span></p>
              <p><span>'I supported Crespo, Inzaghi (and) Sheva. It's the same with Fernando. I have faith in him. This is not a good moment for Fernando. But he has the support first from himself - his confidence - and from his manager and team-mates.' </span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think Torres pace and acceleration is affected by his injuries during the last few years, but he  is still pacy. once he reach 30 in 3 years time, his speed and pacy will not be as good as now. considering how injury prone he is recently, he will continue to beset by injuries and lay off, so he may or may not live up to the 50m price tag. for all we know, he may be a 50m flop if he continue to be like this next season.</p></div>

              <p>Well... It is their latest accounts mah... </p>
              <p>Anyway, Joe, $80k, Ballack $130k, Deco maybe $90k and Belleti peanuts only...makes it bout $300k.</p>
              <p>Torres and Luiz arriving could very well replace those $300k with Torres already reported at $170k at least or maybe higher... Luiz could very well be near the $100k mark, then there is another $70k for Benayoun... Not to forget the improve contracts of A Cole to prevent Jose from taking him away to Real at the start of the season along with Essien's... and perhaps Drogba &amp; Anelka as well being discuss at the moment... And all this still doesn't take into account <span style="color: #000000;">Ramires's salary either...</span></p>
              <p>So I think maybe they added more than they reduced... But next season, they may have to cut a lot of deadwoods like... <span style="color: #000000;">Bosingwa, Ferreira, Zhirkov, </span><span style="color: #000000;">John Mikel Obi</span><span style="color: #000000;">, Kalou and </span><span style="color: #000000;">Hilario or Turnbull to cut the wage bill as well as make space for new arrivals...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Lastly, not to forget, Joe Cole, Ballack, Deco, Belletti all left for about free or totally free... But Torres, Luiz, Benayoun and Ramires all came for an almost $100m transfer fee on top of their salaries which isn't in the account period ending June 2010...</span></p>
