              <p><strong><span>David Beckham could make his astonishing return to English football against </span><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span><span style="color: #000000;">, the club where he made his name. </span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">When Beckham left Old Trafford seven and a half years ago, he vowed never to play for another club in the Premier League. But Beckham's return to the English game has edged closer after </span><span style="color: #000000;">Tottenham </span><span>manager Harry Redknapp revealed: 'David has let me know that he'd like to come here.' </span></p>
              <p><span>And to deepen the massive interest that would surround Beckham's reintroduction to the Premier League, his Spurs debut in the competition could be made in a fortnight when United meet Tottenham at White Hart Lane in a game that will have a bearing on the title race. <br></span></p>

              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>On Saturday night Spurs chairman Daniel Levy was seeking agreement with Beckham's American club, LA Galaxy, to secure the midfielder's services until the end of March. </span></p>
              <p><span>Redknapp said: 'There is no time frame but, clearly, we'd want David here as soon as possible to get the most out of him. People at the club are talking to representatives of LA Galaxy.' </span></p>
              <p><span>Beckham, the 35-year-old former England captain - and arguably the best-known player in the world - grew up just a few miles away from White Hart Lane in Leytonstone. As a boy, he played for Spurs but he was lured to Old Trafford by Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson after he had been recommended by Sir Bobby Charlton. </span></p>
              <p><span>Now Redknapp's passion for the game and his own East London roots have proved persuasive in the scramble for Beckham's signature on a three-month loan. For the previous two years, Beckham has spent the close season of America's Major League Soccer with AC Milan. </span></p>
              <p><span>'David could fulfil an important role for us,' said Redknapp after Spurs' 1-0 victory over Fulham 1-0 moved them to fourth place in the League. 'I only have Aaron Lennon who can play on the wide right because David Bentley keeps picking up injuries on Friday mornings.</span></p>
              <p><span>'If we'd had Beckham today, he could have come off the bench and kept the ball when we came under pressure.' </span></p>
              <p><span>Redknapp is a master at drawing the best from players in the autumn of their careers, having revived Portsmouth's fortunes by signing men such as Teddy Sheringham, Paul Merson and David James. </span></p>
              <p><span>'At Portsmouth, I used to tell the others to watch Teddy train. He had pride in everything he did and always gave 100 per cent,' said Redknapp. 'David's like that. If you have someone like him around a club, it's better than all the training in the world. It's a no-brainer to want him, even if it's only for three months.'</span></p>
              <p><span>After he left United, Beckham enhanced his reputation with Real Madrid before he signed for LA Galaxy in a deal estimated to be worth $120million. Yet Redknapp is dismissive of those who claim Beckham's signature would be motivated by money. </span></p>
              <p><span>'It's not a commercial thing, because I'm not interested in selling shirts,' he said. 'And if David came here, he would be doing so for one reason: to play football at a high level. He doesn't need the money, that's for sure. </span></p>

              <p><span><strong>'He could sit around a swimming pool in LA for the next three months, but it tells you all you need to know about him that he would rather play football.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>'He's a fantastic professional, a great role model, a class act. He would be great around the dressing room, a brilliant influence on all the players.' </span></p>
              <p><span>Beckham is believed to command a basic salary of £80,000 a week from LA Galaxy, a figure that would not be prohibitive for Tottenham. More crucially, he admires the football Spurs are playing under Redknapp. </span></p>
              <p><span>Earlier this year, Beckham ruptured an achilles tendon playing for AC Milan, which meant he was unavailable to LA Galaxy at their start of their season in the spring. That has made the American club nervous about allowing him to come to London on loan. </span></p>
              <p><span>But Beckham will argue that the benefits of him acquiring maximum fitness in the hardest league in the world is a risk LA Galaxy should be prepared to take. Redknapp said: 'We still don't know if Galaxy will let him come.' </span></p>
              <p><span>Even though Redknapp has created the best Tottenham squad of modern times, he is also actively seek</span><span>ing to make further improvements to the playing staff during this month's transfer window.</span></p>
              <p><span>He is willing to sell Bentley and Robbie Keane to raise funds, but Tottenham's board back Redknapp's effort to breach the elite of the English game and have a war-chest of around £40m at his disposal. <br></span></p>

              <p>I have no idea why he wants to sign beckham on a short term basis?</p>
              <p>clearly becks has lost his pace. he has for a long time been out of EPL game, he will need time to adjust to the hustle and bustle. surely he will come on from the bench, unless rednapp is mad enough to start him in the starting 11.</p>
