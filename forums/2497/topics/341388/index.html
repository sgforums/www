              <p><strong>Manchester City boss Mark
              Hughes has been given assurances by the club’s hierarchy that he
              will be at the club to splash the cash in January. </strong></p>
              <p>Moneybags City slipped into the bottom three following a 2-1
              loss at rock bottom West Brom with Roman Bednar applying the killer
              blow.</p>
              <p>The axe now appears to be sharpened for Hughes but he has been
              told by the owner Sheikh Mansour and chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak that
              he will be around to oversee the likely transfer window spending spree.</p>
              <p>“Am I confident I will be given the money myself to spend? That
              is the intention. That is my view and I’ve had assurances from Sheikh
              Mansour and the chairman,” Hughes said.</p>
              <p>“They have been very positive. They understand where we are in our development. They are pragmatic people.</p>
              <p>“They understand things will not happen overnight. Some people expect it to but they understand that won’t happen.”</p>
              <p>Hughes believes a 'naive' approach exhibited by his side has caused their freefall down the table. </p>

              <p>anyway, i highly doubt that man city will stay long in the relegation zone. after the transfer window period, who knows, they may shoot up to mid position. those arabs so rich, $$$ makes the world go round, or the ball go round in their favour.</p>

              <h1>EXCLUSIVE: Manchester City give Hughes a £40m rescue package as boss lines up Santa Cruz and Bellamy<br></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/12/22/article-1100531-02E0D302000005DC-554_468x390.jpg" alt="Wayne Bridge" width="468" height="390"></p>
              <p><em>Top targets: City boss Mark Hughes wants Senna, Bridge, Santa Cruz and Bellamy</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Mark Hughes is closing in on at least four new signings after being given the ammunition to lead <span style="color: #003580;">Manchester City</span> up the Barclays Premier League table. Rather than sacking Hughes, the club's new owners will show impressive support for their manager. <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>has learned of a list of players Hughes hopes will save his job, including two strikers - <span style="color: #003580;">Blackburn</span> centre forward Roque Santa Cruz and <span style="color: #003580;">West Ham</span>'s Craig Bellamy.</strong></p>
              <p>City hope they will be joined by <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span></a> left back Wayne Bridge and Villarreal's midfield general Marcos Senna. The total outlay will not leave much change from £40million. Hughes appears to have been able to select the players himself, despite it previously being believed that the club's owners were insisting on high profile signings to boost their image.</p>
              <p>Instead, Hughes is bringing in his own men - three of whom he has worked with before and who therefore know his methods. Hughes said after Sunday's 2-1defeat at West Bromwich, which left City in the Premier League relegation zone: 'It's clear we need help. We are working hard to adjust things in the transfer window.</p>
              <p>'We will bring in quality players to ensure that the club moves forward in the transfer window. There are no guarantees as to how many we will bring in, but we have to sign players who will make an immediate impact.'</p>
              <p>Hughes has been given a vast transfer budget- as well as assurances about his job from the highest level - but wants players he knows and can trust for the next phase of City's rebuilding plan.</p>
              <p>'Right now, Mark needs players he knows, players who will bring pace and quality to the team,' a top level transfer source reported last night. 'He needs to start building his own team.</p>
              <p>'He wants players who know the ropes and who can make an instant impact in the English league.' City are 'disappointed' to have lost out on Lassana Diarra, who signed for Real Madrid from Portsmouth on Sunday night.</p>
              <p>City refused to pay what they considered 'ridiculous money' to go-betweens to secure the service of the former Chelsea and Arsenal player. Instead, powerhouse Senna - who inspired Spain to their Euro 2008 victory in the summer, is expected to fill the midfield holding role.</p>
              <p>City's poor performance at West Bromwich, which left them three points off the foot of the table, showed Hughes how quickly he needs to make changes. 'He knows he needs more firepower,' said the source. 'Santa Cruz and Bellamy up alongside Robinho will at least give City a cutting edge with pace.'</p>
              <p>Hughes has been given assurances about his position and will be judged on how his January purchases perform as City aim to move away from danger and up the Premier League table.</p>

              <p class="story_panel_text"><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Manchester
              City manager Mark Hughes has told his players to stand up and be
              counted as he prepares to strengthen in the transfer window.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Hughes has substantial funds for investment thanks to the financial muscle of owners the Abu Dhabi United Group.</p>
              <p>On the flip side, a number of his squad will be nervously
              looking over their shoulders in the next few weeks and Hughes wants a
              positive response.</p>
              <p>"There should not be an issue but maybe players are possibly being affected by that," he said.</p>
              <p>"I have not seen it in their play but as a professional footballer you've got to put that situation to the back of your mind.</p>
              <p>"You need to be strong mentally and take up the challenge. If
              you do that then the future at Manchester City will be there for you.</p>
              <p>"But it is difficult for everybody at the moment. We need to
              get back to winning ways as quickly as possible because this run has
              gone on for too long."</p>
              <p>City have dropped into the relegation zone after winning only one of their last nine games in all competitions.</p>
              <p>Next up is a home game against Hull on Boxing Day and Hughes is anxious for his side to regain that winning mentality.</p>
              <p>"We're losing players and that continuity of selection, which
              all the teams that have a reasonable amount of success seem to have,"
              he told the club's official website.</p>
              <p>"But we've got to keep on making sure that we're doing the right things on a daily basis.</p>
              <p>"In the end with a little bit more quality added to squad then things will turn for the better."</p>
