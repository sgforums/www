              <p><strong>France internationals Franck Ribery and Karim Benzema are set to face trial for allegedly soliciting an underage prostitute.</strong></p>
              <p>The duo are set to face the charges along with eight others after judicial papers were submitted by investigating magistrate Andre Dando this week.</p>
              <p>According to reports some of the defendants will be prosecuted for "aggravated pimping".</p>
              <p>The long-running case began in 2010 when Zahia Dehar claimed Real Madrid striker Benzema paid for sex with her in 2008, when she was 16.</p>
              <p>Dehar also alleged Ribery flew her to Munich for sex a year later.</p>
              <p>Prostitution is not illegal in France, however, it is with persons aged under 18.</p>
              <p>Prosecutors requested in November last year that the case against Ribery and Benzema, who have repeatedly denied the charges, be dropped because they were unaware that Dehar was underage.</p>
              <p>Dehar, who is now 20 and has become a celebrity in France since the story broke, has admitted both players did not know her age at the time of the alleged meetings.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>If found guilty, Ribery and Benzema could face three years in prison or a £35,000 fine.</strong></p>
              <p>Lawyers for both players today revealed their confidence that they would beat any charge against their clients.</p>
              <p>Benzema's legal counsel, Mr Sylvain Cormier, told Le Parisien: "There is other material in the record to prove the innocence of my client. I feel it pays to be young and famous."</p>
              <p>Ribery's advisor, Sophie Bottai, told the same publication that she was surprised that Mr Dando had chosen to begin proceedings given the advice of the prosecutors' office.</p>
              <p>"This decision is unjust and also surprising in view of folder contents and submissions of the prosecution," she said.</p>
              <p>"But I remain confident for the rest of the procedure."</p>
              <p>Ribery and Benzema have both been included in France's squad for their friendly against Uruguay in Le Havre tomorrow.</p>
              <p>Le Bleus coach Didier Deschamps, who is set to lead the national team for the first time, refused to comment on the matter today.</p>
              <p>"I won't be commenting on it as it has a private aspect," Deschamps told reporters.</p>
              <p>"It's in the court's hands. It will not change my demands about players' behaviour on and off the pitch with respect to the French team.</p>
              <p>"I am concentrating on the essentials so tomorrow (Wednesday) we see a France team that wants to go forward and wants to win."</p>
