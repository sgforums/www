I had an open mind on it.<br><br>"I thought you keep performing on the pitch and maybe that'll be enough to get you in. But, I made a decision to not go.<br><br>"I respect the decision he [McClaren] has made. You can't have a player drop out of the squad and then put him straight back in.<br><br>"It's up to me to go out week in week out and prove myself again.<br><br>"If I keep doing that and being honest and trying to play well and giving it my all then hopefully I can get back into the setup.<br><br>"I stick by my decision and hopefully come the end of the season it will be the right decision."</div>
