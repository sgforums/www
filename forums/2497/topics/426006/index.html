              <p><strong>Arsenal and Bayern Munich have fired the starting gun for a scramble to sign £18million-rated England defender Gary Cahill after making a check on his form at Old Trafford on Saturday. </strong></p>
              <p>Bolton manager Owen Coyle’s recent admission that Cahill ‘will outgrow this club and will go with my blessing’ sent out a signal to the centre back’s elite list of admirers, and Arsenal and Bayern were first to react by sending scouts to watch another commanding performance in a last-gasp 1-0 win for Manchester United. </p>
              <p>Cahill, 25, is nearing the final year of his contract and there will be no shortage of<br>takers with United, Liverpool, Tottenham and Aston Villa also interested.</p>
              <p>Bolton may find a replacement in Real Mallorca defender Ivan Ramis, as they have joined Fulham, Celtic and Rangers in monitoring the 26-year-old. </p>

              <p>I think his improvement only came during this last 2, 3 years when he started to play for Bolton. During his Villa days, he wasn't really that great a defender yet and Villa also had good centre backs at that time like club captains Laursen and Melberg who would not only score goals playing as centre-backs but was the inspiration of the team as well...</p>
              <p>Of course time have changed but it doesn't mean Cahill was the same player as he is today 3 to 5 yrs ago... At the time O'Neill made the decision, it was right to let him go as Cahill wanted first team while Villa had better players in that position ahead of him...</p>

              <p>O'neill's mistake started when he bought zat knight and then curtis davies...here's a guy voted burnley's player of the season while he was on loan there and did well everytime he came on....who wouldn't want to leave when you're behind knight and davies??</p>

              <p>Nobody said you say... When I said you expect him to be ahead of a more experienced Knight then (04/05) I meant it as a general point not just specifically to Villa. I was the one asking this question and not implying you asked it...</p>
              <p>Even in 2007, a young 21 yrs old Cahill was still not develop yet... He was promising but there was many young promising defenders in the premier league too like Steven Taylor, Ryan Shawcross, <span style="color: #000000;">Leighton Baines</span><span style="color: #000000;">, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Michael Dawson</span><span style="color: #000000;">, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Ledley King</span>... Like I said, he only came good these last 2 yrs at Bolton and not during his Villa days.</p>
              <p>During his Villa days, he was just another promising young defender that may or may not make it that many big clubs didn't really fancied... If he was really half as good as he is now, you can be very sure the big clubs would have been after his signature like they are now with someone like say... Everton's Jack Rodwell wouldn't they? But no one seemed to be too interested with him back then right?</p>
              <p>Knight arrived Villa in the 2007/08 season... and played more than 3/4 of their season... Ironically, it was also the start of O'Neill's 3 successful top 6 premier league finished.</p>
              <p>Gary Cahill may be a good defender today in 2011. But the same can't be said of the 2007 Gary Cahill to be honest...</p>

              It's not so simple as just by the media alone... But clubs do actually send their scouts to assess players they are interested in way before making bids and such actions are pick up by the media.
              
              Of course, not being link doesn't mean you are not a good players, it just usually mean you are still not good enough at that point in time in most cases... There are many other young players some younger than Cahill when they left their clubs for bigger ones cos they were consider more promising by these bigger clubs therefore they were linked to them... Wilcott, Ramsey, Smalling, Sturridge... and now Rodwell, Henderson... Some like Kieran Gibbs and Jack Wilshere are already doing the job at a big club... Back then, Cahill was linked to clubs like Sheff United, Bolton kind... Those in the lower half of lower division... 
              
              No one could say Cahill wouldn't be as good as he is today had he stayed with Villa since 2007. But one thing we all knew is he wanted to play in the first team after getting a taste of it while filling in for injured players and he won't be getting that once the injured players return. 
              
              Being impatient can sometimes be a good or a bad thing. He wanted to play weekly, he had to go down to a lower club which he did 4 yrs ago... And that is most probably where his improvement came playing weekly and gaining the experienced at a lower club. Lots of mistakes was probably made in the last few years but it isn't as costly at a lower club... 
              
              Like I said, Villa finishing 6th after he left justify O'Neill's choice of centre-backs during those years... Remember, we are talking about years ago and not the current Cahill... Going permanent with an inexperienced 21 yrs old probably won't see them finishing at that place.
