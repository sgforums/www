              <p><strong>Manchester City face the prospect of a £30million wage bill next season for players that manager Roberto Mancini no longer wants.</strong></p>
              <p>Mancini is desperate to ditch Emmanuel Adebayor, Craig Bellamy, Roque Santa Cruz, Wayne Bridge, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Jo and Nedum Onuoha from his first-team squad, but has found his plans hamstrung by the astronomical salaries that players are banking at Eastlands. City are ready to take huge losses on a group of players recruited by former boss Mark Hughes who cost the club a staggering £85m in transfer fees alone.</p>
              <p>But so far there have been no takers, with clubs unwilling to meet either City’s cut-price valuations or the big-money deals currently being paid at Eastlands.</p>
              <p><strong>Adebayor, who cost £25m when he arrived from Arsenal two seasons ago on a deal worth £130,000-a-week, is being touted around Europe for £14m.</strong></p>
              <p>The striker is refusing to contemplate a move to Zenit St Petersburg, while Marseille want City to slash their asking price and subsidise his wages.</p>
              <p><strong>Bridge and Bellamy, who cost a combined figure of £24m, are both on £90,000 a week, while £18m misfit Roque Santa Cruz, who earns slightly less, is wanted back at Backburn only if he slashes his £80,000-a-week earnings.</strong></p>
              <p>Jo, the Brazilian signed for an initial £6m in a deal that would have cost City £12m more if it had been a success, is also surplus to requirements as are homegrown pair Wright-Phillips and Onuhoa.</p>
              <p>The salaries of unwanted players add up to a mindblowing £550,000-a-week – or close to £30m over the course of a season without bonuses.</p>
              <p>City have the resources to manage these luxuries thanks to the riches of their Abu Dhabi-based owners but they are looking to balance their books ahead of the forthcoming implementation of UEFA’s Financial Fair Play Regulations.</p>
              <p>A City insider said: “Unless there is some movement of players out of the club in the next 10 days this promises to the biggest test of Roberto’s management skills that he has ever faced.</p>
              <p>“There is a group of players set to report back to the club who have been made aware that he doesn’t rate them and he doesn’t want them around the place.</p>
              <p>“The big question is how will he manage players? What will he do with them because they aren’t part of his plans and he won’t want them in and around the first-team squad?”</p>

              <p>They now have the same problem as Chelsea once have... Last time when Roman first came, Chelsea spent like nobody's business, but later they realise the problem it creates... Unwanted players on high salaries won't take a pay cut and are hard to offload... Cos which player is so silly to take a huge pay cut when they still have an existing contract to run for like 2, 3, 4 yrs?</p>
              <p>In the end, i think City will have to follow Chelsea's method... Loan them out while having to pay half of their salaries... Otherwise, they will have to gift wrap them and send them on their way without a transfer fee to recover...</p>
