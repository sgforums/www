              </div>
              <p>Harry Redknapp is monitoring the progress of a clutch of promising goalkeepers, chief among them Scott Loach of Watford,
              as he considers whether to sign a replacement for Carlo Cudicini and he
              encounters difficulties in striking a deal for David James.</p>
              <p>The Tottenham Hotspur manager had wanted James, the Portsmouth and England goalkeeper, to move to White Hart Lane at the end of the summer transfer window
              only for his chairman, Daniel Levy, to intervene. Levy told Redknapp
              that in Heurelho Gomes and Cudicini he already had two good-quality and
              expensively paid goalkeepers and he would have to make do with them.</p>
              <p>Cudicini,
              who Redknapp signed from Chelsea last January, is now a long-term
              absentee with the career-threatening wrist and pelvis injuries that he
              suffered in a motorcycle accident in November and, with Redknapp having
              little faith in Ben Alnwick, Gomes's current deputy, the manager has
              cast his eye for fresh blood.</p>
              <p>James would welcome a transfer to
              Tottenham – he is on record as saying that "it would be good for my
              England chances to join an upwardly mobile club". But Redknapp knows
              that any move for James would most likely shatter the confidence of
              Gomes, who can blow hot and cold and, at present, is hot.</p>
              <p>James's
              substantial weekly wage is another stumbling block while Levy is
              unwilling to pay Portsmouth's likely asking price of £1m, particularly
              as James will be 40 in August.</p>
              <p>The goalkeeper has struggled with injuries recently but now feels fit enough to return to the Portsmouth team for Saturday's Premier League
              match at Fulham. He has played only one match since injuring his calf
              in the warm-up before the Stoke City defeat on 22 November.</p>
              <p>Redknapp admires Loach, Coventry City's Keiren Westwood and Joe Lewis of Peterborough
              United. Loach played for the England Under-21s in the European
              Championship final against Germany last June and, although he suffered
              an evening to forget in the 4-0 defeat, has impressed at club level.
              Lewis, who at 22, is a year older than Loach, was also part of that
              Under-21 squad. He played well in Peterborough's FA Cup defeat at
              Tottenham on Saturday, preventing the 4-0 scoreline from becoming a
              humiliation and Redknapp said that Barry Fry, the Peterborough director
              of football, had come into the Tottenham dressing room afterwards to
              grant him first option on Lewis.</p>
              <p>"Harry and I go back 30 years so
              we always have a bit of this," said Fry, with a smile. "We paid a
              club-record £510,000 to sign Joe [from Norwich last January] and he is
              on a five-and-a-half-year contract.,"He will only get better by playing
              regularly with us. He is on everyone's list, everyone has had a look at
              him but there have been no bids. We have no interest in selling him."</p>
              <p>Westwood,
              25, has forced his way into Giovanni Trapattoni's Republic of Ireland
              squad and he has been on Redknapp's radar for some time.</p>
