              <div>Manchester United defender Gary Neville believes that footballers should learn to live without having to contact their agents for every little thing in their lives.</div>
              <p><br>This
                  comes in the light of Sir Alex Ferguson launching an attack against
                  stars who rely heavily on their agents, branding the players as being
                  "cocooned".<br><br>"I completely agree with his [Ferguson's] sentiments," Neville said in his column for the <em>Times of Malta</em>.<br><br>"It is one 
                  of my pet hates when I see players who have agents that do everything for 
                  them.</p>
              <div id="TixyyLink" style="border: medium none; overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; text-align: left; text-decoration: none;"><br>"They don't know how to set up their own bank account, they don't know what 
                  they're spending their money on and they can't make their own decisions.
              <div id="TixyyLink" style="border: medium none; overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; text-align: left; text-decoration: none;"><br>"Not every player is like that but some are totally dependent on agents and 
                  advisers."
              <div id="TixyyLink" style="border: medium none; overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; text-align: left; text-decoration: none;"><br>He continued: "For me, life is an education and you learn things as you go through it.<br><br>"I think a footballer should sit down and negotiate with a club, even if
                  his agent is sitting with him. It is in a player's best interests to be
                  there and see what is going on."<br><br>The
                  34-year-old revealed that players sometimes pay up to 15 per cent of
                  their weekly wages to their representatives, although he maintained
                  that there are times when a footballer would require an adviser.<br><br>"The idea of allowing someone to look after your financial and 
                  professional existence is something I cannot agree with," he said.
              <div id="TixyyLink" style="border: medium none; overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; text-align: left; text-decoration: none;"><br>"Some agents do a good job but there are others who stifle and mollycoddle 
                  players.
              <div id="TixyyLink" style="border: medium none; overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; text-align: left; text-decoration: none;"><br>"Some agents will come into a player's life when he is 20, leave his life at 
                  34 and never want to know him again.
              <div id="TixyyLink" style="border: medium none; overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; text-align: left; text-decoration: none;"><br></div>

              "Every footballer needs an adviser at some point. But a player doesn't need to 
                  pay between five and 15 per cent of his wages to a guy to set up a bank 
                  account, buy him a new fridge, or ask his club's chief executive for a pay

              True story, Rooney9. There was a player at Fulham about ten years ago who kept complaining to the club that he always woke up with a wet head. The club were very concerned, thinking that it was some kind of bizarre medical condition, but they couldn't find anything wrong with him. Eventually, they sent a liason officer to his house to check things out.
              
              It turned out he was sleeping underneath an open window and getting rained on in the night. They cured his problem quite quickly by simply shutting the window. 
              
              Not all footballers are stupid, I've met quite a few clever ones, but some of them are so staggeringly dense that you wonder if they could ever have survived in the outside world without assistance.
