              <p><strong>Bobby Charlton</strong><br><br>England's
              record goalscorer puffed away on a cigarette at half-time in the World
              Cup final. His brother Jack and striker Jimmy Greaves were also smokers
              while 1966 captain Bobby Moore fronted an ad campaign to drop in at
              your local pub.</p>
              <p>And England still wonder why they haven't won the tournament since.
              Someone tell Wayne Rooney to smuggle his Bensons along with his
              flip-flops past Don Fabio pronto.<br><strong><br>Johan Cruyff</strong><br><br>The
              Dutch master was a 20-a-day man during his playing career and continued
              to light up on the Barca bench until he had a double heart bypass in
              1991. After his surgery Cruyff literally kicked the habit for a TV
              anti-smoking campaign where he juggled a pack of ciggies with trademark
              skill. Check out his, erm, box control <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtfcGLHPgbI">here</a>.</p>
              <p>Rumors
              that he boycotted the World Cup in 1978 because Argentina coach César
              Luis Menotti wouldn't share his ciggies have yet to be denied. <br><strong><br>Socrates</strong><br><br>A
              star performer in Brazil's brilliant 1982 side, the bearded ace puffed
              his way through two packs a day and continued to light up after
              quitting the game. Now a medical doctor and member of the Workers'
              Party he suggested in a masters thesis that football should be reduced
              to nine a side to improve skill levels. In other words, so Brazil would
              win all the time. <br><br><strong>Gianluca Vialli</strong><br><br>If you grow up
              in a 60-room 15th century castle you feel like you can get away with
              pretty much anything. Vialli famously lit up on the bench after being
              substituted during Italia '90 and kept smoking away when he managed
              Chelsea at the start of decade. Quite how he got past the ID checks
              wearing his schoolboy jumper is anybody's guess. <br><strong><br>Robert Prosinecki<br></strong><br>Talented
              beyond doubt, he played for Barcelona and Real Madrid while concealing
              a habit rumored to be 50-a-day at its peak. Starred at France '98
              alongside another smoker Slaven Bilic, he cut to 20 a day when he
              joined Portsmouth in 2001.</p>
              <p>Was all set to form a smoking superteam with Paul Merson before Harry Redknapp perhaps wisely sold him after one season. <br><br><strong>Preben Elkjaer</strong><br><br>The
              great Dane sparkled during Mexico '86 and remains an icon in Verona
              where he played a key role in their only Scudetto title. Amazed coaches
              with his fitness levels while continuing to smoke at half-time and
              according to Danish legend, smoked during a penalty shoot out, flicking
              his fag away just before burying his spot kick home.</p>
              <p>Now prefers restrained fare as a Champions League pundit on Danish TV. <br><br><strong>Zinedine Zidane</strong><br><br>After
              making a fool of Ronaldinho during Germany '06 the hero in Les Bleus'
              1998 World Cup glory prepared for France's semi-final with Portugal by
              puffing on a ciggie. Perhaps the nicotine had caused amnesia as Zizou
              had fronted an anti-smoking campaign four years earlier. Merde!<br><br><strong>Osvaldo Ardiles</strong><br><br>Inspired
              by their chain-smoking manager César Luis Menotti, Ardiles was a solid
              40-a-day man during the Argentineans' home triumph in 1978. At least
              that's according to his former Spurs team-mate Glenn Hoddle, who
              revealed this nugget when defending Paul Gascoigne's smoking habit
              prior to France '98.</p>
              <p>"It didn't bother Ossie and it doesn't bother me," said the then coach.</p>
              <p>Something did bother Hod as he soon dropped Gazza from the World Cup squad and England were home before the postcards. <br><br><strong>Trifon Ivanov<br></strong><br>Bulgaria's
              hairy defender loved a Davidoff before kick-off, half-time and, er,
              anytime at all. The dead ball specialist wasn't the only member of
              Bulgaria's squad who enjoyed the good life as the team were spotted in
              public drinking and smoking in their run to the semi-finals at USA '94.</p>
              <p>After being beaten by Italy in the semi-finals the Bulgarians lost
              interest and got trashed off the pitch before doing the same on it
              against Sweden in the third place play off. <br><strong><br>Fabien Barthez</strong><br><br>Les
              Blues' victorious squad from 1998 boasted at least three smokers with
              Zidane, Franck Lebeouf and Fabien Barthez between the sticks.</p>
              <p>Enraged Southampton's then-manager Gordon Strachan by leaving
              several cigarette butts stubbed out in the health conscious manager's
              office after he was taken off injured while playing for Manchester
              United in 2003. After making the discovery Strachan quipped the balded
              one must have been taken off for a smoker's cough!</p>
              <p>Barthez was
              recently quoted as charging €70 a minute for his goalkeeping coaching
              services which should pay for his habit quite nicely. Cough, cough...</p>
