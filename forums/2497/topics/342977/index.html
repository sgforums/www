              <h2>With all the speculation surrounding the future of the Boro winger,
              could he finally be leaving the club and making his expected move to
              North London.</h2>
              <p>Reports have just broken from the Riverside, where it seems that
              Middlesbrough winger Stewart Downing will hand in a transfer request to
              manager Gareth Southgate tomorrow.<br><br>Sky Sports sources have
              suggested that the winger will hand in an official written request
              after much speculation about his future at the club.<br><br>The
              24-year-old midfielder has been a repeated transfer target for
              Tottenham Hotspur over the last three years and it now looks as though
              he may finally be making the move to North London.<br><br>Spurs boss
              Harry Redknapp has made it clear that he would like to bring in at
              least three or four players to club after he discovered the lack of
              depth the club had, and Downing looks set to be one of those players to
              be brought into White Hart Lane.<br><br>Only yesterday reports
              suggested that Downing was the subject of a £12 million bid from Spurs,
              and now it looks as though his much speculated move to Spurs will
              finally happen after three years of speculation.<br><br>The reasons for
              Downing's decision to hand in a transfer request are unclear, but it
              seems certain that the England international will not be a Boro player
              for much longer, and he looks set to leave the Riverside before the end
              of the transfer window.</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool have reportedly joined the race to sign Middlesbrough winger Stewart Downing, who it was today revealed, is ready to hand in a written transfer request to Boro manager Gareth Southgate tomorrow.</strong><br><br>Reds manager Rafael Benitez is reportedly ready to offer Boro £12 million for the services of the talented left winger.<br><br>Tottenham Hotspur are also interested in acquiring the 24-year-old's services, and have had several bids for the player turned down by Boro, but Downing is now apparently ready to move on from the Riverside, and the list of clubs interested in him is growing by the day.<br><br>Spurs have already failed with bids during this transfer window and have now seen Downing's transfer request as their opportunity to pounce for the England international.<br><br>Liverpool bought Albert Riera during the summer transfer window and already have Ryan Babel in their squad, but Benitez seemingly wants Downing as a squad player, which he will inevitably be should he move there.<br><br>Downing has been playing for Boro for his entire professional career, only playing seven games for another team, at Sunderland during a loan spell in 2003.<br><br>Since he was promoted from the infamous Middlesbrough youth team, the 24-year-old has made a total of 154 Premier League appearances and scored 17 times in the process.</p>

              <p>Ngog is from youth academy lah! Rafa signed Degen on free transfer, Riera was signed for £8m...and he is a flop? Are you watching English or American football? Keane for £20m is alot of money but I think he is better considering Manure signed Berbatov for £30m and so far scored 3 goals?</p>
              <p>Rafa needs to sell before he can buy...the American got no money for him. They don't even have money for the new stadium!</p>

              <p>Anyway, I am not sure why Rafa needs Downing there...maybe it's a back up for Babel, in case he leave Liverpool? Or he is ready to move Babel to his natural position, a striker??</p>

              <p>Aiyo, read properly lah... When people mention flop it means Andrea Dossena lah... You sure N'gog is from Pool's youth academy or not? or PSG's academy? How can from Pool's when they just got him? </p>
              <p>I honestly believe Berbatov is a far better player than Keane. And Keane is a straight forward striker while Berbatov is a play maker, creator and a second striker... Keane's job is mainly to get the goals, Berba's is to make it happen... You saw last night's match against Southampton or not... He was the star of the match with his passing skills.</p>
              <p>You comparing buying one or two players to building a stadium?</p>
              <p>Hey there is still Peter Gulacsi and Diego Cavalieri leh... So cannot said Rafa got no money lah... He still want to buy Heskey leh... Maybe he plan to sell that flop to buy lor...</p>

              <h1>Boro reject Downing demand</h1>
              <p><strong>Middlesbrough have confirmed
              they have rejected a written transfer request from Stewart Downing
              after turning down an improved offer from Tottenham for the want-away
              winger.</strong></p>
              <p>Boro chief executive Keith Lamb claimed the club had turned down the
              request after giving it due consideration and would not welcome any
              further interest in the player from Tottenham.</p>
              <p>Lamb told the official club website: “We received a written transfer
              request from Stewart this morning. It was considered before being
              rejected.</p>
              <p>“Prior to receiving the request, we received an improved offer for Stewart from Tottenham.</p>
              <p>"We immediately rejected this offer and informed Tottenham that
              Stewart Downing is not for sale and any further interest they have in
              the player will not be entertained.”</p>
              <p>Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp confirmed earlier that Spurs had made
              a 'big offer' for Downing, but were powerless to force Boro to do
              business.</p>
