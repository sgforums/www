              <h1>Liverpool are ready to reveal Rafa Benitez's successor, but can they
               keep Kenny Dalglish?<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Liverpool should be able to announce their new manager this week - 
              and his first challenge will be to keep Kop legend Kenny Dalglish at the
              club after he was overlooked for the top job.</p>
              <p>Former Real Madrid boss Manuel Pellegrini and Fulham manager Roy 
              Hodgson are the two clear front-runners to succeed Rafa Benitez at 
              Anfield.</p>
              <p>Dalglish is waiting to see who is appointed before he commits his 
              future even though, bizarrely, he is part of the selection panel.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/19/article-0-05DC39FF000005DC-738_306x452.jpg" alt="Kenny Dalglish" width="306" height="452">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Overlooked: Kenny Dalglish will not get the 
              Liverpool job</em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He made it clear when Hodgson became favourite that he felt 
              his own 
              credentials to do the job were as good as the Fulham boss's.</p>
              <p>If Hodgson is chosen, he will hope his long-standing relationship 
              with Dalglish will keep the Scot at Anfield, where he holds an 
              ambassadorial role and oversees the club's academy.</p>
              <p>Pellegrini's relative youth and recent experience of managing a big 
              club like Real gives him the edge and would make a partnership with 
              Dalglish easier.</p>
              <p>Dalglish's friends and former Anfield players ran a strong campaign 
              to get him to be the next Liverpool manager. But he won little support 
              within the boardroom despite his legendary status.</p>
              <p>Considered 
              Liverpool's greatest-ever player, Dalglish was their player-manager when
               they won the Double in 1986.</p>
              <p>However, he quit because of 
              pressure midway through the 1990-91 season and also resigned as 
              Blackburn boss after winning the Premier League title in 1995. His last 
              job ended in 1998, when he was sacked by Newcastle.</p>
              <p>Fulham are 
              still confident of keeping Hodgson, predicting he will not want to join a
               club with a £350million debt and uncertainty over the futures of 
              Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard. But Liverpool are adamant Torres, in
               particular, will stay. More likely is the departure of midfielder 
              Javier Mascherano.</p>

              <p>Seems like Dalglish don't quite like Hodgson and went out to find Pellegrini to fight him for the job... In other words, if he is not getting the job, he might not want Hodgson to get it either...</p>
              <p>For Roy, I don't think he should take the job even if they offer it to him cos the England job will soon become available and he stand a very good chance to get it...</p>
