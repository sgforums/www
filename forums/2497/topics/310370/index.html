              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>ARSENE WENGER has launched an amazing tirade against rival bosses who “cheat” their way to trophies.</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">And the angry Arsenal boss insists he would NEVER sacrifice his morals just to land a title.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">With his team top of the Premier League and through to the Champions League quarter-finals, Wenger is determined to succeed with style and integrity.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">He made no attempt to hide his contempt for some contemporaries and said: “I know people who have won trophies and I don’t rate them.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“I can give you examples of people who have won the Olympic 100 metres and they have cheated. I know people in football who have done exactly the same. But for me, sport is more than just winning trophies. Winning cannot be everything.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“What is important for me is to play in a fair way and in a way that people will enjoy. Of course winning is important — but so is moral integrity.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“A trophy is something you can show only for the moment. But what remains after that is the way you have played and the way you have behaved. These are also important.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Wenger was responding to Jose Mourinho’s latest jibe in which the former Chelsea chief claimed: “Arsenal are a unique team. Their coach hasn’t won anything for years but he is still an idol.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">But the Frenchman was adamant he was not talking specifically about Mourinho or his achievements at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Wenger has never forgotten how, during his time as Monaco coach, he was robbed of the French title by a corrupt Marseille team.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">He has also seen Italian football torn apart by match-</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">fixing scandals.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Yet it was clear Mourinho’s outburst had got under his skin, just days after Arsenal’s historic Champions League win against AC Milan.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Asked about Mourinho’s comments, he said: “I let other people talk. I will talk for myself. I try to do my job as well as I can. If it’s not good enough, people will let me know.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Wenger knows he might never have a better chance to finally make his mark in Europe.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">He added: “I’m convinced that this is an era of dominance by English clubs.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“We will find an English club in the final this year.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">But Wenger’s first priority is to win at Wigan on Sunday.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">He said: “It’s easy to be up for a game in the San Siro. But are we up for a cold day in Wigan? We are.”</p>
