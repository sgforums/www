            <div class='col-md body'>Southgate happy to win first perform second<br><br>Middlesbrough boss Gareth Southgate made no apologies for a grinding victory over West Ham as his side won for the first time in three attempts. The 36-year-old saw Italian striker Massimo Maccarone come off the bench to seal a drab affair with a 75th-minute strike as Boro returned to winning ways in the Barclays Premiership. It was far from pretty at times and downright awful at others, but the result was all that mattered to Southgate.<br><br>He said: "I am not going to sit here and say I am not bothered about the way we played because I want us to play well, and at times today when we were positive and we did run at them and we did get our front players into the game, we looked a threat. I want to do both. I want to win and play well. Today we got the win, but we did not play well."<br><br>Successive defeats at Manchester City and Watford had left Boro in 16th place, and three points were the only requirement in front of a crowd of just 25,898 at the Riverside Stadium.<br><br>Southgate said: "It was a big win for us. I knew it would be a bit tense after the last two performances because the performances in the last two matches as much as the results had left us a bit short of confidence, and that showed early on. But we were brave enough to play our way through that. We did not give them too many opportunities. It was an afternoon when we felt we needed to be solid and try to pinch something. It was important we ground a result out. I am not going to sit here and say it was enjoyable to watch, but sometimes when you are on the back of two defeats, it is important you show the character we did today."<br><br>Southgate was delighted with Maccarones response to being left out of the starting line-up after the defeat at Vicarage Road.<br><br>He said: "I am delighted for him. He waits for his chance - he will not have been pleased not to start today, but it was the perfect response to come on and score. It was a great finish. He is a good kid. You want him to do well. He gives the crowd a surge of energy when he comes on, and he gave the team a surge of energy and was very effective in that role today."<br><br>Hammers boss Alan Pardew was philosophical after seeing his side beaten following back-to-back wins in the Premiership.<br><br>He said: "The one break in the game fell for them and unfortunately for us, they took it. It was a really tight game. They were obviously a little bit nervous. They set up to stop us playing in terms of the 4-5-1, so there was not a lot of fluidity to the game. It was a bit bitty. But the disappointing thing for us - apart from the result - was the last 10 minutes when we looked a little bit like we were rushing things when we needed to be patient to put them under a bit more pressure. We have come off the back of two wins and it is a shame it has ended in defeat here. I was not displeased with the performance. It was a really tight game. We put in maximum effort, but there was a little bit of quality lacking, perhaps on both sides.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Latest Football News<br><br>November 12 2006<br><br>Roeder expects Newcastle to improve soon<br><br>Newcastle boss Glenn Roeder is convinced his team will not be hanging around at the foot of the Premiership for long. Although the Magpies picked up a point from their goalless visit to Manchester City, it was their eighth league game without a win and keeps them down among the relegation strugglers.<br><br>It was hardly a situation which could have been predicted at the start of the season, even when star striker Michael Owen was ruled out with knee-ligament damage. But Roeder retains enough confidence in the players who remain to believe Toon will eventually surge back up the table.<br><br>"We have not done well enough in the Premiership so far," said Roeder. "But there is enough determination, courage and motivation in this squad to mean we will be fine in terms of getting ourselves out of the position we are in."<br><br>The one bit of good news for Roeder was the return of Kieron Dyer, who finally appears to have recovered from the hamstring problems which have plagued him in recent years. Dyer was introduced as a substitute and might even have won it for the Tynesiders during a late assault which represented the visitors only concerted pressure of the entire game.<br><br>"Kierons fitness is probably the best it has been for quite a long time," said Roeder. "We have decided to give him a longer break and he seems to have the confidence that he can now press the accelerator without injuring himself."<br><br>If Dyer had become Newcastles match-winner it would have been tough luck on City, who dominated for long periods but could not get the goal they deserved. Steve Harper made two good saves to deny Joey Barton and Bernardo Corradi before referee Graham Poll controversially ruled out a close-range Georgios Samaras header.<br><br>Poll, who has come under fire from all sides this week following the dismissals of John Terry and James McFadden, ruled that Corradi had fouled Stephen Carr in the tussle to reach Bartons corner. But, while his initial reaction told him the goal should have stood, Blues boss Stuart Pearce opted not to stick the boot in to Englands World Cup referee.<br><br>"It was a disappointing decision but the referee has given it and I support him in that," said Pearce, whose side are still to concede a goal on home soil this term. "Overall, I thought Graham did well. He has been under a bit of a cloud this week. But, to be fair to him, he is not a shrinking violet. He makes decisions and if you ask a question of him he will come over and give you an honest answer, which you have to admire him for."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>O'Neill dismisses Villa's Champions League chances as an 'impossible dream'</strong><br><br>Martin ONeill dismissed thoughts of Aston Villa reaching Champions League as an "an impossible dream." But the manager who claims he does not look at league tables took a copy offered to him after the 1-0 win at Everton, studied it keenly, then carefully folded it and put it into his pocket for safe keeping. Villa are third having achieved their first away league win of the season, and it may well be a league table he will frame soon.<br><br>ONeill had seen 33-year-old Chris Sutton grab the winner and said of the veteran he plucked almost from retirement: "He was fantastic, he is a really astute centre forward and he can only get better. It is fair to say that during the summer he was in two minds over whether he was going to carry on. He needed a groin operation in the summer and he had not been right last season out on loan to Birmingham. He probably tried to play when he shouldnt have, and he was no doubt feeling that it may have been all over. But eventually he probably convinced himself there was something else to give."<br><br>Sutton joined Villa a month ago after youngster Luke Moore was injured, having been without a club after his Celtic contract finished. And ONeill, who took the former Blackburn striker to Parkhead, said: "He had a tremendous game and there is a lot more to come from him when he really gets fit."<br><br>The game turned on a leg injury to Evertons Tim Cahill who was carried off. Evertons physios treated the midfielder at Goodison Park, and there are fears that he has acquired knee ligament damage. A further assessment will be made on Sunday. Everton boss David Moyes was bitterly disappointed with the result, their first home league defeat of the season to end a week that has seen them lose at Fulham and knocked out of the Carling Cup by Arsenal.<br><br>He said: "We never got going, we were never up to speed. It was probably the worst we have played all season in terms of passing and our movement. Up until now the passing has been very good but there was a general flatness about our play. I do not see too much difference between ourselves and Villa, but they got the goal and it gave them something to hold onto. We didnt score and it was always a struggle."<br><br>And Moyes accepted that Andrew Johnson was going through a poor spell just at the time when his goals are needed by Everton. Moyes said: "It is not running for us and not running for Andy. Of course he must be worried about a run of games like this without scoring, hes a goal scorer and things like this are bound to worry a player like that."<br><br><strong>Warnock praises Kazim-Richards</strong><br><br>Bolton boss Sam Allardyce was left "dejected and disappointed" after seeing his side throw away a two-goal lead at Sheffield United. The Trotters appeared poised to end a three-match losing run as they led 2-0 at Bramall Lane courtesy of goals from El-Hadji Diouf and Kevin Davies.<br><br>But Allardyce was forced to settle for a point as the Blades hit back with two goals in 133 seconds from Rob Hulse and Colin Kazim-Richards. "We should have been home and dry," insisted Big Sam.<br><br>"A comfortable game from our point of view has left us with only a point and has left everybody completely and utterly dejected and disappointed. At 2-0, life was easy for ourselves and it could have been easier given the other chances we had, although two goals away from home in Premiership match should be enough anyway. But then the need for ordinary, good, basic defending went out of the window in the space of just two and a half minutes. They scored two goals by throwing balls up as far and as long as they could, and then by winning the knock-downs on the edge of our box. Our defenders and goalkeeper just could not cope with it, which is surprising when our two centre-backs are 6ft 3ins and 6ft 4ins."<br><br>United manager Neil Warnock was understandably elated, and believes Kazim-Richards is a player for the future. "I dont think anybody expected Colin to do what he did," commented Warnock.<br><br>"When the ball came to him I thought he would just control it, but he is one of the coolest men on the pitch. He has that little bit of arrogance about him - in fact it was probably too much when he first arrived. But he has changed and he had learned you cannot be an individual, that you have to be part of team."<br><br>The result was enough to life the Blades back out of the bottom three, although Warnock concedes the rest of the campaign is likely to be a yo-yo affair.<br><br>"I think we have done well so far this season apart from all those penalties we have failed to convert. I think we should have had 15 or 16 points by now, but then most managers will feel they should have more than they actually have. But this was a great result - a tremendous fight back and think we have spoiled a few headlines."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Bennett got it wrong says Coleman</strong><br><br>Fulham manager Chris Coleman shook hands with referee Steve Bennett after his contentious decision gave Portsmouth a point from a 1-1 draw at Fratton Park, but insisted the official got it wrong. Andy Cole came off the bench to scramble home Pompeys 74th-minute equaliser after Zat Knight had put Fulham ahead 18 minutes earlier, but the visitors claimed heroic goalkeeper Antti Niemi had the ball in his grasp before Cole struck.<br><br>Coleman said: "Referees have had a lot of stick lately and I didnt talk to him afterwards. I just shook his hand but I was disappointed he gave the goal. All we ask is a little bit of consistency but we were denied a penalty earlier this season against Chelsea when our player, Michael Brown, went for the ball in the same sort of challenge against Petr Cech and was pulled down. Chelsea got a free kick instead. Ive said before we need some technology to help decide these big decisions because they mean so much. When we went 1-0 up today, Portsmouths fans got louder and all credit to them for that. We had to defend a lot of corners and a lot of pressure and I felt we went too deep too early, but the biggest disappointment was with the decision to give the goal."<br><br>Cole, 35, scrambled home his second goal for Portsmouth - the 280th club strike of his career - against the team with whom he had two spells earlier in his career.<br><br>Coleman added: "I didnt want Coley to come on because I know what he can do from his Fulham days - especially in the last 20 minutes. He thinks so quickly and that was the last possible place we wanted him to get the ball when he scored."<br><br>Pompey manager Harry Redknapp said: "We battered them but it was just one of those days when things dont go for you. Their keeper Antti Niemi, who I tried to get for Portsmouth when he left Southampton, was superb and we hit the post or bar three times. Kanu missed a good chance early on and I felt when we went behind to a set-piece it would be hard to come back. But I think we deserved the goal and it was the right decision. Antti told me he didnt have both hands on the ball but there was also a challenge by Kanu, Im told. There were so many bodies in there going for the ball. It would not have surprised me if the referee gave a scrum-down in the end."<br><br>Fulham maintained their unbeaten run away from home since the opening-day 5-1 thrashing at Manchester United - where Pompey lost 3-0 last week. Redknapp said: "We had a lot of injury problems going in to today but we still played well. It would have been a travesty to finish with nothing. We needed three points really, but we got one and thats okay. We were solid at the back, but Fulham play a 4-5-1 or whatever you want to call it, and it is hard to break down. Andy Cole got another goal but he was doubtful with a groin strain right up to today and we needed late tests on Gary ONeil and Noe Pamarot, who have hardly trained this week."<br><br>ONeil was ominously stretchered off with his legs strapped together just before the end, but Redknapp revealed: "It is just a dead leg. He should be all right in a few days."<br><br><strong>Camara celebrating triple whammy</strong><br><br>Wigan boss Paul Jewell saluted Henri Camara for helping his side to a fourth straight Premiership win. Jewell insisted he had no doubts about picking the Senegalese striker for this home match with Charlton, despite the players mind being on other things following the birth of his son last night.<br><br>And Camara responded with a 41st-minute goal, with Lee McCulloch and Matt Jackson also netting in the 3-2 JJB Stadium success.<br><br>Jewell explained: "I found out this morning and texted Henri to see if he was all right to play and he said he was fine and looking forward to the game. I told him to get a couple of goals to celebrate and at least he got one. Its certainly been a nice weekend for him with a new arrival, a goal and three points."<br><br>The Latics chief insisted there is still plenty of room for improvement despite his sides winning streak - and questioned the quality of some of their defending in poor conditions.<br><br>He continued: "We should have got home easily but they came back at us and we gave a bad goal away. Weve been tighter in our last few games but I have to be delighted with three more points. In conditions like that there are always going to be mistakes - you cant be too critical. But to get 12 points out of 12 is a great achievement and now we have to build on it next week."<br><br>Addicks manager Iain Dowie admitted he was "starting to hurt" after seeing his side blow their chance to get back in the match. Dowie was left rueing Darren Bents 55th-minute miss, which came just four minutes after the Premierships bottom club had got themselves back in the match.<br><br>Dowie said: "Darren had the best chance in the match from our point of view but we couldnt defend those high balls and going two behind gave ourselves a mountain to climb. We never made their keeper do anything in the first half. To come away from home and score two and not get anything from the game is ridiculous really."<br><br>Dowie said he saw signs of encouragement in the second half when his side pressed for an equaliser, before more bad defending enabled substitute Jackson to clinch victory. "There was plenty of spirit in the second half when we could have brought it back to 2-2. But it wasnt to be and we went to sleep again at a set-piece."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Ferguson praises Saha after matchwinner</strong><br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson praised matchwinner Louis Saha as a solid display by Manchester United secured a hard-fought 1-0 win at Blackburn to keep their three-point advantage over Chelsea. Saha scored in the 64th minute to make it eight goals this season for the French striker and bring United their sixth consecutive victory in the Barclays Premiership.<br><br>Ferguson said: "Louis is in good form, hes a threat with good pace and power and hes a good balance to the team. Its a very difficult place to come and win, theres always an intensity in the match as we are stern rivals. It was a feisty match with a lot of challenges and tackles, and a good result and a good performance by us because in the past we have come here and played better and lost - last season we scored three times and lost 4-3."<br><br>United had much the better of a goalless first half but though Blackburn started to threaten, it was the visitors who struck.<br><br>Ferguson added: "In the second half they had a few terrific crosses into the box and Edwin van der Sar had to make a couple of good saves. There were moments where we had to dig in but the most important thing was getting that goal. Just before we scored we started to get some good possession and create some chances, and [Cristiano] Ronaldo was getting in behind them. You just hope the goal comes and fortunately Ryan Giggs did really well to get to John OSheas cross and turn it back for Louis to score."<br><br>It was a frustrating game for Wayne Rooney, who missed two sitters and was booked for dissent, but Ferguson refused to blame the England striker for his missed chances.<br><br>"You worry about that but you hope you can keep creating the chances and in the second half Wayne did exceptionally well, on one occasion turning the defender inside the box and the goalkeeper made a fantastic save," he said.<br><br>"We operated with Ryan in central midfield to try to snuff out Tugay but in the second half we moved back to Wayne through the middle and he became effective for us."<br><br>There was one moment of controversy when Tugay appeared to flick a boot at Ronaldo - and Ferguson thought the Turkish midfielder could have been sent off. "I thought so but there you are, with all the controversy about referees it just adds to it," said the United manager, who revealed that Gary Neville will be out for a fortnight - and miss Englands midweek friendly in Holland - with a calf injury.<br><br>Blackburn manager Mark Hughes had no complaints about the result or his sides performance - and said his players had asked questions of United.<br><br>He said: "I dont think we could have done any more. We are hurting a little bit with the injuries we have to senior players but we asked questions of United and did more than most teams have this year. Overall the level of performance was good, we hit the crossbar in the second half and had some good half-chances. The goal was disappointing, we could have done more to cut out the ball across goal but I have nothing to say against the players."<br><br>Hughes believes United are looking stronger now than at any time over the last three seasons. He said: "They are playing very well, have the individual talent and they always come stronger in the second half of the season. They have had a great start and it will take a good side to stop them winning it this season.<br><br><strong>Mourinho lavishes praise on Drogba</strong><br><br>Jose Mourinho praised Didier Drogba as the best striker in the world at the moment after the Ivory Coast forward scored a hat-trick in a 4-0 Premier League win over Watford on Saturday. "At the moment hes at the top of his game. Hes playing amazing stuff," Mourinho said.<br><br>"Hes improved at every level. Hes great in every aspect of his game... physically he is strong... in the air he is great and defensively he is very, very strong." the Portuguese coach said. "At this moment I dont see another striker playing like him, scoring like him."<br><br>Drogba, who also hit a Champions League hat-trick against Levski Sofia in September, has now scored 14 goals in all competitions this season and Mourinho said he was working better now with new strike partner, 29-million-pound Ukrainian Andriy Shevchenko who scored Chelseas third goal.<br><br>"We keep working on this. Its important they understand the quality of one another." Shevchenkos goal prompted a team baby-rocking celebration after the strikers wife Kristin gave birth to a second child earlier this week. Mourinho said Drogba and Shevchenko were enjoying an easy life, however.<br><br>"I know they scored four goals between them but the way our midfield players are playing its not very difficult to be a striker," he added. Mourinho also countered criticism by Alex Ferguson of his planned meeting with FA referees chief Keith Hackett following controversial decisions last weekend during Chelseas defeat by Tottenham Hotspur. Referee Graham Poll sent off captain John Terry and Drogba had a goal disallowed.<br><br>Ferguson suggested on Friday Mourinho was receiving special treatment but Mourinho countered that Hackett had invited all managers to get in touch with him if they had any concerns. "Every manager in the Premiership was invited to do it," he said.<br><br>Mourinho used Carlo Cudicini in goal in the absence of long-term injury victim Petr Cech but said former Sweden goalkeeper Magnus Hedman who has been on trial with Chelsea could be signed until the end of the season.<br><br>Hedman, who is a free agent after retiring from the game, would be a reserve behind Cudicini and Portuguese Hilario.
