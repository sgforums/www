              <p> </p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Chelsea central defender Ricardo Carvalho is poised to make a £15million switch to Inter Milan. Inter's new boss Jose Mourinho is confident he can win a tug of war with Luiz Felipe Scolari over Carvalho's future. The rivalry between the two bosses is obvious.  <br></strong>  <br>Mourinho was the man who groomed Carvalho for stardom at Porto where they won a bundle of trophies together, including the Champions League. After his appointment at Stamford Bridge Mourinho quickly returned to Porto to recruit Carvalho in a £19.8m deal. Together they enjoyed the Chelsea glory days.  <br>  <br>Scolari, who will take charge at the Bridge next month, also knows the 30-year-old defender well. Carvalho has been the defensive backbone of the Portugal team managed by Scolari for the past four years. The Brazilian boss rates Carvalho highly, and hopes he can persuade him to turn his back on a reunion with Mourinho.  <br>  <br>But sources close to Carvalho now believe he has set his sights on a move to the Italian champions. He is well aware that Mourinho needs to launch a successful Champions League campaign if he is to eclipse the three years of domestic success enjoyed by Roberto Mancini with Inter.  <br>  <br>Winning Serie A wasn't enough to keep Mancini in the job - and Inter president Massimo Moratti has made it clear he will fund whatever is required to make his club the kings of Europe. Moratti is a petro-chemicals billionaire. His buying power has never been doubted. It's his club's choice of superstar signings that has been questioned.  <br>  <br>Mourinho has presented him with a summer shopping list specifically designed to fulfill the president's mighty ambitions. And Carvalho is at the top of it, with Chelsea team-mate Frank Lampard. Carvalho still has four years left on his contract at Stamford Bridge.  <br>  <br>With Portugal's elimination from Euro 2008 after their 3-2 defeat to Germany last Thursday, Carvalho can now focus on his club career - just as Scolari will plan for Chelsea's future, too. Carvalho may relish the prospect of a lucrative move to a club where he would be reunited with his Portuguese mentor.  <br>  <br>Lampard, however, still looks likely to stay put. He was hugely impressed with the sensitivity with which the Chelsea hierarchy handled the situation of the death of his mother Pat last season, and is reluctant to show any form of disloyalty to the club which helped him so much at a difficult time in his personal life. </p>

              <p>I agree that 30 is already consider old in football but I guess its still ok for Italian football where the pace and running isn't a 90 mins match...
