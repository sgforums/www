We said Â‘If it embarrasses you, get used to it because it will comeÂ’.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s well known Chelsea wanted Theo badly and the deal with them would have been more lucrative for everyone.<br><br>Â“But we knew TheoÂ’s career path would be best served by going to Arsene Wenger.<br><br>Â“We chose Arsenal because IÂ’ve never met a more genuine and decent man than Arsene.<br><br>Â“We got well paid Â— weÂ’re not a bloody charity Â— but there would have been more money at Chelsea.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looking at SWP at chelsea, he is already 26 and not some 20, 21 yrs old kid anymore... He don't even have 50 caps for England don't even expect to reach near 100.<br><br>At the rate things are going for SWP at chelsea, i think Theo joint the right club. He has started playing in gunners first team and showed he is able to perform in the first team now.<br><br>Had he gone to Chelsea, we probably won't see much of him in the first team and his chance to develop will be much slower if he don't get real games for experience.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>France Under-21 international Yohann Gouffran claims he rejected a move to Chelsea in the summer.<br><br>The Caen youngster is regarded as one of the best talents in Europe after impressing for club and country over the last 12 months.<br><br>A number of top clubs have been keeping tabs on Gouffran with Chelsea hoping to lure him to Stamford Bridge.<br><br>The 20-year-old claims Chelsea made a firm bid for his services, but he decided to reject their overtures to continue his football education at Caen.<br><br>In France, Auxerre, St Etienne and Monaco wanted to sign me. "Chelsea also came with a concrete offer. But I wasn't interested."<br><br>Just look at their policy - they buy so many stars, there is no place for me. They would have loaned me for a year, and I don't want that. If I leave, it is to invest myself in a real project. I need implication.<br><br>Gouffran also revealed that he now models his game on Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo after being converted from a striker to a winger.<br><br>"My model use to be Thierry Henry, when I was a striker. "But now, as I have become a right midfielder, I try to copy Cristiano Ronaldo's moves. "I use their gestures during my matches."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah theo made the right choice to come to arsenal,going to chelsea will just make the talent graveyard bigger there and he will just end up as someone who had great potential but nowhere to develop it as compared to arsenal which is famous for developing young players to there best potential</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So far from what i have seen from his games for the gunners, he looks like what Aaron Lennon is doing on the right for England &amp; Spurs only thing he is on the left... which is more valuable considering that there are hardly any good left side players for england.<br><br>I would say Wenger has got himself a very good player and I belief he will be the England left winger very soon rather than Richardson.</div>
