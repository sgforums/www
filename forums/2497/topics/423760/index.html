              <p><strong>Didier Drogba will quit Chelsea if he is dropped again for Tuesday night’s Premier League showdown with Manchester United, according to sources close to the player.</strong></p>
              <p>The 32-year-old Ivory Coast striker, who was signed for Chelsea by Jose Mourinho in 2004, has become increasingly disillusioned since being axed in favour of £50million signing Fernando Torres and would favour a move back to Marseille in the summer.</p>
              <p>The potential stumbling block would be the fee Chelsea would require — possibly as much as £20m — and the inability of Marseille to match his wages of £130,000 a week.</p>
              <p>But Drogba is said to be so angry at having been cast aside since Torres arrived on transfer deadline day that he is now determined to leave.</p>
              <p>The striker is said to suspect that even a change of manager at the end of the season, when Carlo Ancelotti is expected to depart, will not help his cause as Torres is perceived to be the personal signing of Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich.</p>
              <p>Nicolas Anelka was picked ahead of Drogba for last week’s 2-0 Champions League win in Copenhagen.</p>
              <p>He scored both goals to boost his claims for a regular starting place and was then singled out for special praise by John Terry.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Drogba was one of the players Mourinho insisted on signing when he joined the club and the forward was instrumental in winning Chelsea’s first league title for 50 years.</strong></p>
              <p>He has won two further Premier League titles, the League Cup twice and three FA Cups with the club and has become one of the key players in Stamford Bridge history.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti paired Torres and Drogba against Liverpool but since Chelsea’s defeat in that game, Drogba has started only last weekend’s FA Cup tie against Everton, for which Torres was suspended.</p>
              <p>Being dropped for Tuesday’s clash with United, traditionally one of the biggest fixtures of the season, would be a further humiliation for the striker who is clearly unhappy</p>

              <p>he publicly welcomed torres in the past....saying that chelsea always has room for the best players. Well, that was when he's in his prime and playing fantastically. Now that he's 32 and on the bench, he sings a different tune.</p>
              <p>Maybe that's the problem for big players when you are at a club suddenly famous with an impetuos injection of cash. Many players don't talk about leaving the club if they really love their club. Think beckham. If he were still a utd player...i don't think he'd say something like this if he were in drogba's shoes.</p>

              <p>Drogba must understand and learn to accept that at his age, he can't be top Dog anymore... Realistically, most players start to go downhill once they reach 30 and he is already 32 now...</p>
              <p>Not to say he is a bad player nowadays, but he has to play lesser and selectively to keep his form... At his age, playing too much may be difficult for him to produce the high level of game Chelsea expects...</p>
              <p>But of course, if he wants to be playing all the time, then he has to leave for a lesser club...</p>
              <p>I think he will be easier to offload than Terry and Lampard cos those 2 are on very high salaries...</p>
