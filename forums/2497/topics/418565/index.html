              <p><strong>Angry Feyenoord are threatening to report Chelsea to FIFA after losing a highly-rated teenage star to the Premier League champions.</strong></p>
              <p>Fifteen-year-old defender Nathan Ake has agreed to quit Holland for the Blues when he turns 16 in February.</p>
              <p>Feyenoord will receive just £230,000 in compensation for the youngster - who can also play in midfield - and the club’s top brass were last night fuming.</p>
              <p>A spokesman for the Dutch club said last night: “You must wonder if this is in the interests of football.</p>
              <p></p>
              <div class="news_mpu_article"></div>
              <p>“As a club it is difficult for us to do anything about this. That lies at world football association FIFA or the European association UEFA. But it is a discussion to be had, that is clear.”</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Hands off: Feyenoord sporting director Leo Beenhakker is furious with Chelsea</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Feyenoord sporting director Leo Beenhakker last night lambasted what he described as the predatory tactics of Premier League clubs.</strong></p>
              <p>He said: “What can you do? English clubs are the great white sharks of football. Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea, they are all in the game.</p>
              <p>“We had a wonderful deal for Nathan, but the lad wanted only one thing: Chelsea. It's game over for us.”</p>
              <p>It is not the first time frustrated Feyenoord have developed promising players only to see them defect to Premier League clubs.</p>
              <p>They previously lost current Dutch international Jeffrey Bruma to Chelsea in similar fashion, while they saw Kyle Ebecilio leaving Rotterdam for Arsenal.</p>
              <p>Beenhakker added: “It’s driving me crazy that hot prospects are walking away from us like this.</p>
              <p>“The Premier League clubs spoil the market with their behaviour. Other clubs in Europe aren’t doing this kind of things, but the English sides just don’t care.”</p>
              <p>“I’ve discussed this matter with Nathan and his parents. He told me that he really wanted to move to England and his parents were okay with his decision.</p>
              <p>“I was impressed with Nathan’s determination at such a young age, but it’s obviously bad news for Feyenoord. We can’t do anything about it if a foreign club comes up to sign one of our youngsters.”</p>
              <p>A Chelsea spokesman said last night: “We have kept Feyenoord well abreast of our interest and as such we have reached an agreement with them.”</p>
              <p>Three years ago, Chelsea were handed a transfer ban - later lifted on appeal - from FIFA after Gael Kakuta joined the club from Lens.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Meanwhile, Nicolas Anelka could become the latest Premier League star to end their playing days in Major League Soccer.</strong></p>
              <p>The 31-year-old Blues striker is under contract at Stamford Bridge until 2012.</p>
              <p>Once that happens, his brother Claude believes the former Real Madrid and Arsenal marksman could be tempted away to America.</p>
              <p>Claude said: “Nicolas said, ‘When my [Chelsea] contract is over, what will I do?’ The United States would interest him, he told me.</p>
              <p>“There are more and more players who want to go and play there. It would be a dream for him.</p>
              <p>“The United States represents something. Players say, ‘I’ll try and play there, even if I earn less money than in Qatar’ for example.’”</p>
              <p>Anelka has scored 52 goals for Chelsea since moved to west London in 2008, including 10 this season.</p>
