              season.</p>
              <p>While pushed by <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> last season, Ancelotti admitted 
              he was wary of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr>'s threat domestically.</p>
              <p>He said: "They will do better than last season. They have fantastic 
              players and will be an important opponent for us."</p>
              <p>But he is also targeting a big prize elsewhere. He said: "Our aim is to 
              do better than the last year in the Champions League. We went out too 
              early last season."</p>

              <p>I don't think it takes a rocket scientist to know City could do better than last season... Just someone with half a football brain will expect them to be in the top four if not seriously challenging for the title...</p>
              <p>The way it's going, Liverpool and United are in decline... Just look at the players they are signing this last 2 years and it's very clear... United probably slower than Pool cos of a certain man called Sir Alex... His know how and his experienced have help them a great deal so far... But with the way City are going, they could land the title very soon...</p>
              <p>Mancini have a more difficult task than Lotti cos he has to rebuild a squad that has never won anything yet and also don't have the experienced of doing it unlike Lotti... Where most of the players have been playing together for 4 to 5 yrs and are experienced at winning as well...</p>
              <p>Of the top 4 positions, I feel Chelsea are the safest... United, Arsenal and Spurs have to really battle it out to stay up there as not only City will be in with a strong chance to replace one of them but Liverpool as well if Roy manage to keep all his star players... To me, Pool are still a good side only Rafa made them poor... Even his tactics and sub used were rather weird... So Roy will eradicate that area...</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, I am one of those who is glad City is coming up... And I belief Manchester will very soon have 2 power clubs in the top 4 if United don't fall off...</p>

              <p>the key to City's is how fast they gel and get going.</p>
              <p>of course, the expectations. given the outlay,minimum they have to get is top4th, as per Giggs.</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Man Utd ace Giggs questions if Man City will gel:
               Can they handle pressure?</h1>
              <div class="story-image"><img class="imagecache imagecache-medium" src="http://images.tribalfootball.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/medium/stories/giggs_bg_6.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250"></div>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> veteran <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Ryan Giggs</span></abbr> insists big-spending <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> are no major threat.</p>
              <p>Giggs believes the disappointment of relinquishing the title and the 
              emergence of young talent will inspire a stronger challenge next term. 
              Although he anticipates increased competition for the four Champions 
              League places, the 36-year-old thinks City have still to discover the 
              consistency required to advance under <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Roberto Mancini</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>"Until we play them I don't take any notice of what City are doing, like
               any other team really," said Giggs, who has extended his Old Trafford 
              contract until the end of this coming season. "If they get a run 
              together, if they get the consistency, they'll be a force, and no one 
              knows if they're going to do that.</p>
              <p>"It's a similar scenario to last season really. They've got so many 
              talented players that, if they gel as a team, they'll be a force. If 
              they don't then obviously it could be a frustrating season for them and 
              they'll probably get a little bit of stick. But, if they gel as a team, 
              like they proved in games last year, they can beat anyone."</p>
              <p>Giggs also agreed that City's owners view a topâ€‘four finish as a minimum
               return for their investment.</p>
              <p>"I think with the players they've acquired over the last two years, that
               is probably the case."</p>
