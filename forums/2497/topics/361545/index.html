              <h1>Twente confirm Blues are stepping up to the Mark</h1>
              <p><strong>FC Twente have confirmed Chelsea’s interest in Marko Arnautovic but
                      Jose Mourinho’s Inter are also in the equation for the highly-rated
                      forward.</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://diepresse.com/images/uploads//a/e/2/420578/u_Marko_Arnautovic.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="300"></p>
              <p><strong>It has been rumoured for a number of days that the 20-year-old is a
                      summer target for the Premier League side and Twente chairman Joop
                      Munsterman has now confirmed the interest from Stamford Bridge.</strong></p>
              <p>But after scoring 12 goals and claiming 5 assists in 28 Eredivisie
                      games this season, the Austria international is a wanted man and Serie
                      A champions Inter, amongst other clubs, are also following Arnautovic.</p>
              <p>Munsterman admits that should a suitable offer be received, it would
                      be very difficult to hold onto the player who is believed to favour a
                      move to Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>“We are negotiating with Inter, Chelsea and other clubs,” Munsterman told Voetbal International.</p>
              <p>“If they make a formal approach then FC Twente will be too small for Arnautovic.”</p>
              <p>Arnautovic played a key role for Twente this season as the Enschede
                      club finished as runners up in both the Eredivisie and the Dutch Cup.</p>

              <div id="div_article_main_content">
              <p><strong>The agent of Marko Arnautovic
              has confirmed English interest in the striker, but revealed that talks
              with Inter are due to take place.</strong></p>

              <p><strong>Twenty-year-old FC Twente striker Arnautovic has been one of the
              Dutch league’s revelations this term under English boss Steve McClaren.</strong></p>
              <p>The Blues are believed to be after the Austrian, and his agent Peter
              Baars has confirmed that Premier League clubs are following his client.</p>
              <p>But Chelsea must be quick if they do not want to see Arnautovic join
              another club, as Inter have offered his representative the chance to
              hold talks about the player, who is currently injured.</p>
              <p>The Nerazzurri have sent medics to assess the forward’s stress foot fracture.</p>
              <p>“I think that I will make the trip to Italy on Monday or Tuesday
              [next week], it also depends on the medical staff’s assessment,” Baars
              told Calcio Mercato.</p>
              <p>“Only after that we will evaluate the situation with Inter’s
              directors. Nevertheless, I am very confident. I understand that Inter
              want to sign Marko because they are aware of his talent.</p>
              <p>“Chelsea? I do not know, English teams are following him. You must wait for seven days to know what his future is about.”</p>

              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>FC Twente striker Marko Arnautovic has agreed terms with Inter Milan ahead of a proposed move to Italy. </strong></p>
              <p>The player's agent confirmed on Monday that a five-year deal has been put in place with the Serie A champions.</p>
              <p>Robert
              Groener did, however, admit that the move is not guaranteed to go
              through, with the 20-year-old currently carrying a serious ankle injury.</p>
              <p>Arnautovic picked up the problem in May, with initial reports suggesting he could be sidelined for up to six months.</p>
              <p>An
              impressive 14-goal haul last season brought him to the attention of
              Europe's top clubs, with Premier League giants Chelsea believed to have
              expressed an interest.</p>
              <p>A move to England now looks unlikely, but a switch away from Holland this summer remains a distinct possibility.</p>
              <p>Inter
              representatives are due to meet with their Twente counterparts this
              week in an effort to thrash out a deal, but Groener accepts those
              discussions could prove fruitless.</p>
              <p>"No-one knows for how long he will be injured," he said.</p>
              <p>"Inter, of course, want to buy a player who is 100 per cent fit."</p>
