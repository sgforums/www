              <h2>WHEN Arsenal star Justin Hoyte gave his lover Jill Demirel a free 
                            transfer out of his life, she went on the attack and vowed: "I'm 
                            Gunner get revenge."</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/1506_kiss_01.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>So 
                            with shameless man-to-man marking and a very forward pass, she bedded 
                            Tom Huddlestone because he plays for <strong>SPURS</strong>, her 
                            ex's bitter rivals.</p>
              <p>Jill,
              32, revealed: "I was heartbroken when Justin left me for another girl.
              I knew he hated Tottenham and I thought, ‘I'm going to show you'."</p>
              <p>But the plot backfired when sex with the not-so-Hotspur
              Huddlestone left her cold—and desperate for the good old days with a
              Red in her bed.</p>
              <p>Jill sighed: "I was praying Tom could help me get over Justin
              with great sex. Fat chance of that. Justin was ten out of ten in bed,
              miles better than Tom, who was a wham bam, thank you ma'am kind of
              guy."</p>
              <h3>Arsenal 1, Spurs 0</h3>
              <p>Even when it came to kissing, Tom wasn't in her champion's league.</p>
              <p>"When we kissed it was terrible. He kept dribbling all over my
              mouth. I'd rate Tom a zero out of ten," said former Harrods salesgirl
              Jill, from Chigwell, Essex.</p>
              <h3>2-0 to the Arsenal</h3>
              <p>She fell for Justin, 23, after meeting him in the Jacuzzi at the gym
              in his apartment block in Woodford Green, Essex. She was engaged to
              another man at the time but was immediately smitten. She grinned: "I've
              never been so attracted to a guy in my life."</p>
              <p>With immense self-restraint, she held out until their third date before having sex with the Gunners' right-back at his flat.</p>
              <p>She said: "I kept telling Justin it was wrong because I was engaged. 
                            But the fact we weren't supposed to made it more horny. That night 
                            we had sex from midnight until 6am. He's incredibly well endowed—at 
                            least 12 inches. Dirty talk got him going the most. He liked to 
                            know I was enjoying myself."</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/1506_kiss_02.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>After 
                            that, they met up regularly for sex—even getting it on in the gym's 
                            Jacuzzi. "The bubbles hid so much naughty stuff. It was the best 
                            foreplay for mad sex," said Jill.</p>
              <p>She fell deeper and deeper for Justin and was devastated when he 
                            chucked her after a year and changed his mobile number. "I was in 
                            love with him. It wasn't about the football. I would have been with 
                            him even if he'd worked for McDonalds," she said.</p>
              <p>In
              January 2007, a few months after the split, Jill saw Justin on ITV2
              show WAGs Boutique, and was gutted when Madeleine Bowden was introduced
              as his girlfriend. "I couldn't believe he'd left me for her," said
              Jill.</p>
              <p>She set out to get revenge and targeted Huddlestone, who lived
              in the same apartment block. But she soon began to regret it. She said:
              "I'd seen Tom in the Jacuzzi—the spot where I'd met Justin—and I knew
              he fancied me. It wasn't reciprocated, but I was on a mission to bag
              him to make Justin jealous."</p>
              <p>Within days Jill was at his apartment, parking her blue Mercedes CLK in full 
                            view of Justin's flat. But it didn't worked out as she planned.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/1506_kiss_03.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>She 
                            said: "All I could think about was Justin. Tom was such a boring 
                            fart. He didn't talk about anything apart from commenting on the 
                            girls in the R&amp;B videos on the telly." Even so she went ahead and 
                            had sex with the Spurs midfielder, who now dates Big Brother star 
                            Chanelle Hayes. "It was crap and I pity Chanelle, she must be having 
                            the worst sex of her life," Jill hissed. It only lasted two minutes 
                            before it was over thankfully."</p>
              <h3>Gunners 3, Tottenham 0</h3>
              <p>Now she is hoping to win back the love of her life—Justin.</p>
              <p>"If I could get him alone I know he wouldn't be able to resist
              me," she said. "I just hope he reads this and realises how much I love
              him."</p>
              <p>Sorry, Jill. But we'd say it's more likely to be a case of: Think 
                            it's all over? It <strong>DEFINITELY</strong> is now.</p>
