              <p>that's the creativity problem that i've mention alot of times.</p>

              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword">
              </span></p><p><strong></strong></p>
              <p>Steven Gerrard's fifth and Yossi Benayoun's<a href="http://www.goal.com/en-gb/people/israel/1690/yossi-shai-benayoun"> </a>seventh goal of the season gave Liverpool a much needed home victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Anfield, and saw them climb up a place to sixth in the Premier League table.<br><br>The
                  first half began with Liverpool dominating possession but they were
                  unable to open the scoring, the home side did have two early chances
                  but they failed to test Marcus Hahnemann in the Wolverhampton Wanderers
                  goal. <br><br>In the fifth minute Alberto Aquilani won the ball in the middle of the pitch and fed Lucas Leiva who in turn found Fernando Torres, the Spaniard laid the ball off to Steven Gerrard whose 25 yard strike was easily saved by Marcus Hahnemann in the Wolves goal.<br><br>Two
                  minutes later it was Torres’ turn to test Hahnemann, Emiliano Insua
                  broke away but his pass pushed Torres very wide in the Wolves area.
                  Torres twisted and turned inside the area before firing his shot at
                  goal but Hahnemann was able to tip the ball over the bar.<br><br>The
                  visitors began to grow in confidence and started to have good
                  possession of their own, and created the three best chances of the
                  half. In the 21st minute Matthew Jarvis broke away down the left wing,
                  he took on Glen Johnson before crossing into Sylvain Ebanks-Blake who
                  turned and shot at goal but Jose Reina was able to gather it
                  comfortably.<br><br>A couple of minutes later Wolves had the clearest
                  opportunity of the match, Nenad Milijas curled a free kick goalwards
                  but Reina tipped it over the bar. From the resulting corner an unmarked
                  Kevin Doyle headed wide from three yards.<br><br>Wolves’ third
                  opportunity in five minutes fell to Serbian Milijas; Kevin Doyle
                  flicked the ball over his head into the middle of the pitch where the
                  unmarked midfielder scuffed his shot wide of Reina’s goal.<br><br>In
                  the 29th minute Liverpool had the ball in the net, Gerrard threaded a
                  pass through the Wolves defence to Torres who clipped the ball over
                  Hahnemann only to be flagged offside. Despite a late chance for Glen
                  Johnson both sides went into the break goalless.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/55806_hp.jpg" border="0" alt="" align="baseline"><br><strong>Easy does it</strong>| Yossi Benayoun seals the win</p>
              <p>The first chance of the second half fell to Yossi
                  Benayoun, the Israeli midfielder was picked out superbly by Aquilani
                  but he failed to control the ball and the ball was cleared by Stephen
                  Ward.<br><br>In the 49th minute Liverpool had their best move of the
                  match which resulted in Insua finding Gerrard unmarked on the edge of
                  the box; but the England midfielders shot was well saved by Hahnemann<br><br>Two
                  minutes later Wolves fullback Stephen Ward fouled Lucas on the edge of
                  the visitors’ penalty area, the referee Andre Mariner gave the free
                  kick but bizarrely issued a yellow card to Christophe Berra. <br><br>However
                  after consulting with his linesman the referee corrected his decision
                  and gave Ward his second booking and his marching orders. <br><br>A
                  much more confident Liverpool then grabbed the game by the scruff of
                  its neck and in the 61st minute they took the lead. Insua slipped free
                  from his marker and delivered an accurate cross to the centre of the
                  goal where <strong>Steven Gerrard</strong> rose highest to power a header into the net.<br><br>Liverpool doubled their lead in the 69th minute, a deep cross from Fabio Aurelio found <strong>Yossi Benayoun</strong> unmarked on the right of the penalty area. The midfielder brought the
                  ball under control brilliantly before turning onto his left foot and
                  firing goalwards. The shot took slight deflection off Karl Henry which
                  took the shot away from Hahnemann and into the top of the net.<br><br>Benayoun
                  could have scored his second in the 77th minute, after a neat passing
                  move Aquilani found Johnson on the right wing but from the cross
                  Benayoun headed over the bar.<br><br>Wolves never gave up in the
                  remaining 13 minutes but they were unable to create any clear chances
                  to test Reina in the Liverpool goal.<br><br>Liverpool ended the game as they started it, in control of possession, and although they created a chance for Fernando Torres they were happy to retain possession and hold onto their victory.</p>
