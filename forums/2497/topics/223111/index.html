            <div class='col-md body'>MANCHESTER UNITED have made a shock swoop for Henrik Larsson.<br><br>The ex-Celtic ace is joining United on a three-month loan in January. Helsinborgs striker Larsson will sign from New Year's Day until March 12 before the Swedish season kicks off.<br><br>Larsson said: Â“Alex Ferguson called me last night and greeted me to Manchester United. Â“They have been after me before - after the first or second season with Celtic. It feels nice to come and play for such a big club.<br><br>Â“I probably wonÂ’t play every match from the start, but for me it feels like a very fun thing to contribute at such a late stage in my career. My family are okay with it.<br><br>Â“I know the players at Manchester United. They are really good players. Â“I have played against many of them, so itÂ’s not a new thing. I hope the situation will be easier, knowing the faces and names.<br><br>Â“I will go over there to play as much as possible - but I have no idea of how Ferguson wants to use me. We will see how much playing time there will be.<br><br>Â“Am I a back-up? Yes, at the beginning. Then you will see what I can contribute and how things are going.Â”<br><br>United are short on strikers and Wayne Rooney and Louis Saha are the only recognised forwards available to boss Sir Alex Ferguson.<br><br>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is out injured, Alan Smith is finding his fitness and young Italian Giuseppe Rossi is on loan at Newcastle.<br><br>Larsson, 35, turned down a contract extension with Champions League winners Barcelona last season to move back to Sweden to finish his career.<br><br>He was one of Europe's most prolific scorers at Celtic, where he netted 174 goals in 221 games in between 1997 and 2004.<br><br>He scored 36 goals in 93 international matches before retiring from the national team after the World Cup this summer.<br><br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/Lar.jpg"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SAF got this thingy for old &amp; tested players &amp; most of the time, can manage them &amp; integrate them into his team to great effects.<br><br>Like he signed Laurent Blanc when ppl say he is over the hill, he adores Teddy Sheringham &amp; Solksjaer - and both of them won him the Champions League.  I think its a practical move for him, this will ease his pressure to secure a striker comes January, Larsson can come in with 25 - 20 minutes in a match and to hold off the game / seal up the game (if Man U is leading) or to turn it around (if Man U is drawing / losing) - hopefully this does not happen too often.<br><br>I think he'll try to sign a striker but if he doesn't, its not that bad.  Moreover, Larsson has been through and done that, so its good to have an experienced veteran. Most importantly, he is eligible for CL.  I am sure SAF would have loved to have him on loan now if he could so that Man U is better for the hectic December period.<br><br>Nonetheless, I think he will be a good cover to have for Man U's final push for honors.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>New Manchester United signing Henrik Larsson admits the option of a move to Aston Villa was never an issue.<br><br>Larsson has agreed to head to Old Trafford from Helsingborgs on loan when the transfer window reopens in January. Reports had claimed he also had the chance to sign for Villa, who are managed by his former Celtic boss Martin O'Neill.<br><br>But the ex-Sweden international revealed he had not been in contact with O'Neill and only had thoughts for United. "Man U took contact with me and wanted to borrow me," Larsson told Sky Sports News.<br><br>"I did not have contact with Aston Villa, with the gaffer there who was at Celtic when I was there. "We haven't spoken about a loan deal, so it was never really something that I had to think about."<br><br>The 35-year-old is now waiting to learn what role Sir Alex Ferguson has lined up for him when he links up with the Premiership leaders. He added: "I'm very happy, obviously, as it's one of the biggest clubs in the world, if not the biggest.<br><br>"I've been fortunate enough to play for big clubs in my career. I was at Celtic, Feyenoord, Barcelona and now a loan period for 10 weeks in Man U. "I know what I'm good at and the players they have there are world-class players, quality players.<br><br>"I hope I can contribute with something, then wait and see what's going to be."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I did consider putting them together actually but since the subject tho seem the same person but were rather different in substance... This was a thread that confirmed they have bought him and how... and by now i guess most people will probably know about it already and consider it old news as its even reported in today's ST...<br><br>That on the other hand was a new topic altogether... on how will he be use and what role Ferguson intend to use him on... Will he be or is he good enough for that purpose... could be discuss over there.<br><br>Anyway, just having Ben posted there i am very pleased already as he seldom comes here. Thanks for the feedback dragg. I will take note of it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
