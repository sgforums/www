              </div>
              <p>Barcelona and AC Milan are preparing last-ditch bids to sign Manchester City misfit Robinho - but both are looking for a bargain deal.</p>
              <p>City
               were prepared to let the Brazil forward go to Fenerbahce for a fee 
              which could have reached £26million, only for Robinho to reject the move
               and hold out for interest from Spain and Italy.</p>
              <p>Both Milan 
              and Barcelona have been in touch with the player’s representatives for 
              several weeks, biding their time while working on other targets.</p>
              <p>Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s loan move from Barca to AC Milan has left the
              Catalans light of a forward and Milan with money left to spend because
              they aren’t laying out as much as they expected on the Sweden striker.</p>
              <p>Nou Camp insiders have lined up several options to strengthen the
              left-side of attack and the final say will lie with coach Pep Guardiola.</p>
              <p>The Spanish champions started the season with an impressive 3-0 win
              against Racing Santander, but their first-team squad has just 19 senior
              players and there is a perceived weakness down the left side,
              exacerbated by Thierry Henry’s departure.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Loan ranger: Robinho spent time in his native country on loan last season</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>As well as Robinho, they are eyeing Valencia’s Juan Mata and Ajax 
              star Luis Suarez, but the coach may decide to stick with what he’s got 
              and put more faith in promising youngsters Pedro, Thiago Alcantara and 
              Jonathan dos Santos.</p>
              <p>Mata would be difficult to sign because 
              of strained relations dating back to Barca’s signing of David Villa, 
              while Suarez is cup-tied for the Champions League. That makes Robinho 
              the preferred option, but Barca president Sandro Rosell is constrained 
              by his own pledge that only £15m is left to spend on players this 
              summer.</p>
              <p>City would want more - at least in add-ons - for a 
              player who was a British-record signing when captured from Real Madrid 
              for £32.5m in September 2008.</p>
              <p>The signing of Javier Mascherano
               from Liverpool was supposed to complete Barca’s summer recruitment, but
               Ibrahimovic’s departure after weeks of the club insisting he would stay
               has caused a rethink.</p>
              <p>Asked about more signings before the 
              transfer window closes on Tuesday, Guardiola said: ‘Everything is 
              possible. I am satisfied with the squad, with their ability and with the
               back-up that we have. Today I am satisfied with the squad made 
              available to me by the board.’</p>

              </div>
              <p>Milan president Silvio Berlusconi has admitted his side could still 
              be in for Robinho, but the Italians are likely to test City’s resolve by
               demanding an initial loan with a view to a permanent deal next summer.</p>
              <p>The
               insistence worked in signing Ibrahimovic from Barca and Berlusconi, 
              when asked if the Swede was the last arrival, said: ‘If a player we are 
              interested proves affordable, then we could also do it.’</p>
              <p>When pressed about Robinho, he said: 'It doesn't depend on us, if it depended on us ... Milan's intentions are there.</p>
              <p>'Where could he (Robinho) play? We have so many possibilities and then it's better to have three players for two roles.'</p>
              <p>Milan
               are likely to lose Klaas-Jan Huntelaar to Schalke and Marco Borriello 
              may go to Juventus, leaving the San Siro giants with room to improve up 
              front. They will also free up funds by selling defender Kakha Kaladze to
               Genoa for £3.3m.</p>
