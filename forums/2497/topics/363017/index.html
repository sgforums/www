              <p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>AC Milan star Kaka has 'already signed for Real Madrid', according to Zinedine Zidane. </strong></p>
              <p>An announcement on Kaka's future is expected on Monday as reports continue to suggest he is set to leave the San Siro.</p>
              <p>Real
              are said to be the favourites to land the Brazilian's signature,
              although Chelsea are rumoured to have made a record-breaking offer for
              his services.</p>
              <p>France legend Zidane, who played at Santiago
              Bernabeu for five years, believes a deal has been agreed to secure
              Kaka's move to Spain.</p>
              <p>"Kaka has already signed for Real," Zidane said.</p>
              <p>"I would be happy if he were to take my number, the No.5, I would not be jealous."</p>

              <p>eh? at least chelsea can go to semi-final/final of champion league.. and please don't categorize chelsea with mancity and madrid</p>
              <p>madrid is rich since the start.</p>
              <p>chelsea is a good investment, is playing in the champion league before roman came in the picture</p>
              <p>mancity i still no idea why the arabs buy over them.</p>

              I think Kaka has already sign for Real lah... He just don't want it to be announce before he finish packing his bags and made all the other arrangements... Otherwise, these last few days could be hell for him and his family in Milan... The fans are angry already but... right now, its still not fully known, so they still won't go overboard... 
              
              I think he and his family will be on a plane out of Milan by the time they make it official...
              
              If he really go... Then all that talk of wanting to stay in Milan are all... rubbish.

              keep awake all day as Kaka's move to Madrid will not be made official

              <p>Kaka's move from AC Milan to Real Madrid is likely to be announced by the end of the day at the very latest, according to <em>Sky Sport Italia.<br></em><br>According
              to reports emerging overnight in Spain and Italy, everything seems to
              be in place for Kaka to finally complete his move to the Spanish
              giants. <br><br>However, new details suggest the announcement is
              likely to come at around 19:00 Brazilian time and, given the time zone
              difference between South America and Europe, it means the news will
              make European headlines at midnight.<br><br><em>Sky Sport Italia</em> claim the move is hinging on a phone call which Kaka will have with

In addition,
              voices claim both Milan and Real Madrid will release a statement at
              exactly the same time to confirm the move.<br><br>Milan chief Silvio
              Berlusconi claimed he would keep Kaka, but the latest developments
              suggest he will find that difficult to get right.</p>

              *Kaka passes initial medical tests as Real Madrid close in on Â£56m capture of AC Milan star*
              .
              .
              Kaka is set to complete a Â£56million move from AC Milan to Real Madrid after passing a medical the first stage of a medical with the Spanish giants.
              
              Madrid doctor Juan Carlos Hernandez and a club lawyer arrived yesterday with a contract in Recife, where the playmaker is based with the Brazil national team.
              
              It is reported that he passed preliminary tests last night and will be released by the Brazilian federation to undergo a fuller medical with Hernandez at 9am local time today (1pm UK time).
              
              Dr Jose Luis Runco, head of medicine at the Bernabeu, confirmed to Spanish newspaper AS that Hernandez had met Kaka and suggested an official announcement would follow soon.
              
              Madrid's ambitious new president Florentino Perez hopes to announce the coup soon after but will allow Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi dictate the timetable out of respect for the Italian. Berlusconi hopes to talk to the 27-year-old today and insists the deal is not yet done. 
              
              Kaka scored a penalty in Brazil's 4-0 demolition of Uruguay on Saturday night - his country's first competitive victory in Montevideo - which put them top of the South American World Cup qualifying section going into Wednesday's home match against Paraguay.
              
              Kaka would talk only about the match afterwards, but said: 'I'll talk soon about my future.'
              The former Sao Paulo player, previously a target for Chelsea and Manchester City, will not be unveiled at the Bernabeu until the end of the month, after Brazil's participation at the Confederations Cup in South Africa.

              <h1 class="sIFR-ignore">Kaka's Madrid medical confirmed</h1>
              <div id="div_article_main_content">
              <p><strong>The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) have confirmed that Kaka has undergone a medical at the request of Real Madrid.</strong></p>
              <p>Reports on Monday morning suggested that delegates from Madrid would
              fly to Brazil to carry out the necessary tests with a view to
              completing a move for the Milan playmaker.</p>
              <p>The CBF have now confirmed that news amid speculation that the
              player will hold a press conference late on Monday evening to confirm
              his transfer.</p>
              <p>“Kaká has undergone medical examinations in Recife with the
              Brazilian doctor, Jose Luiz Runco,” read a statement on the CBF’s
              official website.</p>
              <p>“The technical committee of the Brazilian national team attended at
              the request of Kaká and the board of Real Madrid and released the
              player to perform the routine examinations in a clinic in Recife.</p>
              <p>“CBF had to make all the logistics for the test, through its head of
              medical department, Jose Luiz Runco, who accompanied the player to the
              tests.”</p>
              <p>Even if the deal is verified on Monday, no deal is likely to go through until June 30.</p>

              *Kaka is in the bag*
                      .
                      .
                      
              *KAKA has sealed his world-record Â£62million transfer from AC Milan to Real Madrid. SunSport told you last week that the Spanish giants would nab the Brazil superstar, 27.* 
                      
              He said: "Everything I've always done for Milan has been by mutual agreement, from the moment I arrived until my departure today - I'm leaving by the front door. 
                      
              "I've won everything that I wanted as a player and this is a new motivation for me. "I'm sure Real Madrid will build a competitive team which can start winning titles again." 
                      
              Kaka passed a medical after Madrid's doctor flew to Recife where Brazil are preparing for their match with Paraguay. A statement from Real said: "Kaka has successfully passed all the medical tests. He has signed a six-year contract." 
                      
              An AC Milan statement said: "We thank the great champion for his contribution to the many victories achieved in the past six years. "It will be very difficult to fill the void that will be left by Kaka, a shining example of commitment and professionalism. "We offer him the most cordial and affectionate wishes for the continuation of his sporting career." 
                      
              Brazil refused permission for the player to be presented by Madrid before June 30 - when the Confederations Cup in South Africa is completed.
