              *Kaka Hits #2 Slot On World's Most Expensive Transfer List
              The new Blanco is second only to Zizou in the list of transfers...*
              .
              .
              
              Kaka's move to Real Madrid from AC Milan this evening gives the Bernabeu yet another slot in the top five most expensive transfers of all time.
              
              However, Florentino Perez's latest capture has fallen short of being the most expensive football deal ever:
              
              Zinedine Zidane (Juventus - Real Madrid) 2001 - â‚¬76m
              Kaka (AC Milan - Real Madrid) 2009 - â‚¬65m
              Luis Figo (Barcelona - Real Madrid) 2000 - â‚¬58.5m
              Hernan Crespo (Parma - Lazio) 2000 - â‚¬53.6m
              Gianluigi Buffon (Parma - Juventus) 2001 - â‚¬49.2
              
              The Power Of Purchasing
              
              By some measures, Kaka is even more expensive than Zidane. To give a rough guide, back then â‚¬76m was worth Â£46m, while Kaka's transfer of around â‚¬65m this year is worth a mammoth Â£56.3m.
              
              However, as both the Zizou and Kaka moves took place between Italian and Spanish clubs, working off euros makes more sense. The euro, in fact, has not fluctuated quite as much as the weakening pound has since 2001, meaning that Kaka will, to most observers, be the second-most expensive transfer of all time.
              
              Zizou may have given up his No. 5 shirt for the Brazilian, then - but he still keeps his record!

              *Madrid land Kaka in record deal...and will even pay the tax on $200k-a-week wage*
              
              Kaka completed his record $56million move from AC Milan to Real Madrid late on Monday night after passing a medical in Brazil. Real doctor Juan Carlos Hernandez put Kaka through three hours of tests yesterday at a clinic close to the Brazil team's hotel in Recife. 
              
              Real released a statement saying: 'Kaka is a Real Madrid player after an agreement with AC Milan. The Brazilian footballer has now successfully passed all medical tests. Kaka has signed a contract for the next six seasons with Real Madrid.' 
              
              The mammoth sums involved in Kaka's purchase underline club president Florentino Perez's determination to return Real to the pinnacle of Spanish and European football.
              
              On top of the $56m fee, Real will make Kaka the best-paid player in the world at $200,000 a week over the six years of his contract - a total of more than $62m. In addition, Real will pick up his tax bill, taking advantage of Spanish laws on foreign nationals which mean it will be paid at 24 per cent. 
              
              The deal is also fantastic news for Kaka's father and agent Bosco Leite. Some sources claim Leite will pocket as much as $8.7m for his part in the negotiations, while others claim it will be nearer $3.9m. 
              
              However, it is not all expensive news for Real as they have agreed to spilt Kaka's image rights down the middle. Similar arrangements in the past with Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo and David Beckham saw Real recoup their outlay, according to Perez. 
              
              A statement on the Milan website read: 'From next season, Kaka will play at Real Madrid. AC Milan thanked the great champion Kaka for his decisive contribution to the many victories achieved in the six years of his commitment. 
              
              'The loss, while serious, can be remedied. It will be very difficult to fill the void that will be left by Kaka, a shining example of professionalism and commitment. 
              
              'AC Milan offer him the most cordial and affectionate wishes for the continuation of his sporting career.'

              he has joined Real Madrid for £59million in order to help AC Milan to

              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>"I can officially say I'm a
              Real Madrid player. My professional link with AC Milan finishes now,
              but my sentimental link will never end," he said.</p>
              <p>"Real Madrid intend to build a great team, with historic
              players such as Raul and Casillas. We will make history again, both in
              Spain and Europe. I guess the sport project is very good.</p>
              <p>"Manchester City and Real Madrid are two different clubs with
              different situations. At that time (January), it was mid-season, I had
              a strong emotional impact due to the Italian fans requesting me to
              stay, and I decided to stay.</p>
              <p>"Now another chance came up and AC Milan is in a big crisis
              (financially). For me, the sporting project (at Madrid) is interesting
              and will be an important boost to continue my career in the highest
              level."</p>
              <p>"I wanted to stay on at Milan, but the world (financial) crisis
              affected a lot of clubs, especially those like Milan which are
              businesses," he continued.</p>
              <p>"So then, I spoke with the Milan directors and we reached the conclusion that the best thing for everybody would be to sell."</p>

              Err... if you compare the pounds and the euro back then and today... You will get the answer... lol
              
              Ok lah, I do the maths for you...
              
              Zinedine Zidane - Juve to Real in 2001 â€“ â‚¬76m but Â£46m...
              
              Kaka - Milan to Real in 2009 â€“ â‚¬65m but Â£56m...
              
              So, if you base it on Pounds, he is more expensive lor... But if you base it in Euros... Zidane more expensive lor... lol

              Now they want to buy Villa too ??? 5 strikers already for 2 berth. They are probably going to have to sell saviola

              1) W Sneidjer
              2) Van Der Vaart
              3) Guti
              4) Gago
              5) M Diarra
              6) L Diarra
              7) Robben 
              
              And now they already bought KAKA, and still want ronaldo ???
              8 Midfield for 4 berth
