              <p>That guy probably because at that time, his contract like about to finish or finish so they took him for very little lor...</p>
              <p>Real madrid that time got a habit of taking players on the cheap like those contract about to finish or finished ones then sell them back more expensive after the player have signed a longer contract with them...</p>
              <p>They signed that Saviola for free after his Barcelona contract expired, on a three-year deal then after keeping him in their storeroom for one year, they were ready to sell him... I recalled there was some story about Wenger asking and was interested on him then they quoted something like $15m... Frighten Wenger until he run until dunno where... lol</p>
              <p>Michael Owen also mah... His contract left about 6 months and they took him for only about $8m then sold him back for $18m to Newcastle after 1 year...</p>
              <p>Then there was also Pennant... knowing his contract at Pool was soon to be over, they also wanted him for free. I guess they know they could easily sell him after 1 year for anything from $6 to $10m when he is only 26 and English. But lucky he wasn't that silly lah... He rather signed for another club as a free player and get a huge salary increment for himself rather than let the Real earn the transfer fee.</p>
              <p>But of course not all are so smart lah... Rafael Van Der Vaart was another one... His contract also about to finish with less than 6 months with Hamburg then Real bought him on the cheap... Now want to sell him for more...</p>
              <p>Real are using this method to earn extra money...</p>
