              <p><strong>Everton chairman Bill Kenwright says he would consider a possible ground share opportunity with Liverpool after Anfield legend Kenny Dalglish claimed the two clubs should ''look at every possibility''.</strong></p>
              <p>English football has so far shied away from ground sharing between the biggest Premier League clubs and Liverpool have always been opposed to the possibility of ground sharing with their Merseyside rivals. But with both now desperate to build new stadia, sharing a newly constructed Stanley Park could be a solution that would suit both parties.</p>
              <p>Dalglish opened the door to the idea this week with comments in his <em>Mail on Sunday</em> column and Kenwright responded in a positive way when asked about the proposals.</p>
              <p>"In the past Liverpool have always been opposed so I am intrigued about what Kenny Dalglish has had to say about ground sharing,'' Kenwright told <em>ESPNsoccernet</em>. "It is more than likely we would sit down and have a descent discussion about ground sharing in Stanley Park with Liverpool."</p>
              <p>Dalglish had claimed that a ground share would not be the ''ideal'' situation for either club, but maintained that in the current financial climate, it would be something that would be ''worth looking at''.</p>
              <p>"It's probably true that more people are becoming sympathetic to a ground-share with Everton if a third party came forward able to build it, with the two clubs renting,'' he wrote in the <em>Mail on Sunday</em>. ''Again, it is not the ideal situation: that would be to keep the two clubs in two separate stadiums with vibrant atmospheres of their own.</p>
              <p>"But this is not an ideal time for either club and I'm sure they would sit down and have a conversation with each other about it if there was a feeling it would be beneficial. It's not anyone's personal views that is important - it is about what is best thing for the club.</p>
              <p>''I don't know if it will ever happen but maybe you need a few people to sit down and say that, although it's not what they want in a perfect world, it's worth looking at.</p>
              <p>''Whoever is in a position of responsibility at Liverpool and Everton are only custodians for the next generation of supporter. They owe it to the fans to look at every possibility to help their respective clubs."</p>
