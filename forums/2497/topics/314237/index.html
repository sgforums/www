              <p><strong>Ronaldinho has agreed initial terms with AC Milan and the Serie A club will now speak to Barcelona about a deal, Milan and the player's agent have said. The 28-year-old Brazilian has had a difficult few months at the Nou Camp because of injury and loss of form and a move has long been mooted. The forward is out for the rest of the campaign with a leg injury and a transfer can not officially go through until the end of the season.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'In general Ronaldinho and Milan are in agreement,' his agent and brother Roberto de Assis was quoted as saying on the Gazzetta dello Sport website on Saturday. Gazzetta said a deal up to 2012 worth eight million euros ($12.6 million) a year was in the pipeline with a few clauses to be agreed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Milan chief executive Adriano Galliani said: 'There is a general agreement with the player. Now a deal has to be reached with Barcelona. Give us time.' Spanish and Italian media reports have speculated about a transfer fee of between 20 and 30 million euros while some newspapers have talked about Ronaldinho buying up the rest of his contract at Barca.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Milan are fifth in Serie A and in danger of missing next year's Champions League after a poor season. They were dumped out of this year's Champions League as holders by Arsenal in the first knockout round. Carlo Ancelotti's men have struggled to score and create goals with Brazilian Ronaldo playing just a handful of games before being ruled out long term with a knee injury.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fellow striker Alberto Gilardino has been lacklustre and world player of the year Kaka has been far from his best. Despite their troubles, Ancelotti has been assured of his job next term.</p>

              <p>should they even be called supporters. though i don't really like him for his attitude when he wanted to sign for man utd but came to barca because of better wages, i still support him even when he's injured and trying to find his form back.</p>

              <h1>Inter join chase for Ronaldinho</h1>
              <p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/44564000/jpg/_44564286_ronaldinho_b203.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="152"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="first"><strong>Inter Milan are considering trying to hijack AC Milan's pursuit of Barcelona and Brazil forward Ronaldinho.</strong> <strong>AC Milan chief executive Adriano Galliani and Ronaldinho's brother and agent Roberto de Assis have said initial terms have been agreed. But Inter president Massimo Moratti says his club could join the hunt.</strong></p>
              <p>"We will asses the possibility next week," Moratti told Italian television. "We have good relations with Barcelona and Ronaldinho's agent. We will see." De Assis has said AC Milan is the only club he has spoken to but Moratti does not think that means the deal is done. "It depends a bit on our decision," he said. "It is a deal that Milan is conducting well and it is like the transfer market is open. Therefore it is open for us, too."</p>
              <p>Inter are likely to lose Luis Figo to retirement at the end of the season and another creative player is on their wishlist. The two clubs clashed last year when Milan tried to sign striker David Suazo from Cagliari at the last minute after he had already held talks with Inter. The Honduran chose Inter.</p>
              <p>Ronaldinho, 28, has had a difficult few months at the Nou Camp because of injury and loss of form and a move has long been mooted. The forward is out for the rest of the campaign with a leg injury and a transfer can not officially go through until the end of the season, unless he buys himself out of his contract.</p>
