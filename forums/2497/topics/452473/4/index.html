              <p class="body ">Reina says he and several of his team-mates would have preferred to see Benitez return and the Spaniard was also the choice of many fans.</p>
              <p class="body ">The Liverpool goalkeeper rates Benitez as “the best”, and the likes of Maxi Rodriguez, Lucas and Daniel Agger would also have welcomed him back.</p>
              <p class="body ">Reina said: “For many of my colleagues and me, Rafa Benitez would be the ideal candidate.</p>
              <p class="body ">“It’s that I’m not objective about it, but he is the coach who shaped me most. He is the best.”</p>

              <p class="body "><strong>Reina’s admission presents Rodgers with the first challenge of his Anfield reign and the former Swansea boss must get the Benitez brigade behind him.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">Benitez still has his supporters among the Liverpool family, and Robbie Fowler claims he would have been his choice for the job.</p>
              <p class="body ">Benitez, who has never moved his family away from their Merseyside home on the Wirral, would have jumped at the chance to return to Liverpool.</p>
              <p class="body ">He threatens to overshadow Rodgers in the same way that Roy Hodgson was undermined by Dalglish’s presence at the club and the Spaniard could be a rallying point for disaffected fans if the Ulsterman falters.</p>

              <p class="body "><strong>Another major issue for Rodgers is Luis Suarez, and the striker will have been unsettled by the events of the last couple of weeks.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">Suarez was very close to Dalglish, who resolutely backed him during his race row with Patrice Evra, and respected the Scot as a legend that the fans idolise.</p>
              <p class="body ">Rodgers will not have the same standing in Suarez’s eyes and will have to win over the Uruguayan against the backdrop of the player's contract negotiations.</p>
              <p class="body ">The Reds are keen to tie down the coveted striker this summer with a four-year deal worth around £100,000-a-week.</p>
              <p class="body ">Suarez has made conflicting noises about his future and, while claiming he is happy at Liverpool, has also stated his desire to play in Spain.</p>
              <p class="body ">His Uruguayan team-mate and Juventus defender Martin Caceres claims he has also asked him about the Turin club.</p>
              <p class="body ">“It’s true that Luis and I have talked about Juventus,” said Caceres. “He has asked me about the club, without going into any details.</p>
              <p class="body ">“I told him that Juventus are a team that always want to win. He liked what I told him about the club, but he’s happy at Liverpool at the moment.”</p>
              <p class="body ">Rodgers must also speak to Dirk Kuyt, who is talking to clubs about exercising the £1million escape clause in his contract to join a foreign side.</p>

              <p class="body ">Rodgers can count on the full backing of Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher, who have always given their total support to whoever is in the Reds dug-out.</p>
              <p class="body ">They will be looking forward to working with Rodgers and will be right behind him.</p>

              with a full year loss and about 100 million spent last season and no CL the coming season the owners are hoping for something like what newcastle did last season - little spending but a shot at CL qualification.
              
              its a gamble.  but a good one.

              <p>When Pep Guardiola took over Barcelona, What sort of proven exp he 
              had? The only team he managed b4 was Barceloan B team, Did Barcelona 
              want to become Barceloan B? Before AVB manage porto, what proven record
               did he possess?</p>
              <p>If your team play attractively, most likely u will win more. Man City, Barcelona, Napoli, Tottenham are good examples.</p>
              <p>Swansea
               is playing thrid-tier english league football just a few season ago. 
              Now they finished 11th at epl. I dunno what others think, to me, this is
               a huge huge achievement.</p>
              <p>Of cuz unproven managers are risker, but many seem to conceive it as a guarantee failure. Furthermore, Rodgers has more proven exp compard with AVB(before porto) and Pep(before Barc).</p>

              <p><span>At his unveiling Rodgers said: 'I'm very proud, it's a club with wonderful tradition and I feel very blessed with the opportunity to manage the club.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Once I had found out I was the number one target from the important people at Liverpool it was quite an easy decision,' he said.</span></p>
              </div>
              <p><span>Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre also explained there would be a new set-up on the football side.</span></p>
              <p><span>He said: 'The structure, and Brendan is aware of this, is a more continental director of football type structure, a collaborative group of people working around the football area.</span></p>
              <p><span>'We don't expect at this moment in time to have a director of football per se but a group of people working with Brendan to deliver the football side of it.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Rodgers added: 'That [a director of football] was something I made clear I couldn't work with.</span></p>
              <p><span>'What you need is an outstanding team. We will form a technical board that will have four or five people that will decide the way forward.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Liverpool is a step up for Rodgers from his previous jobs at Watford, Reading and Swansea.</span></p>
              <p><span>He also worked under Jose Mourinho at Chelsea and insisted claims he was too inexperienced for the role were unfair.</span></p>
              <p><span>'My pathway as a young coach has been different to most managers,' he said.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I have actually been coaching and working in football for 20 years. At Chelsea I had experience of working with big players.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I look at Kenny Dalglish, he was the manager (of Liverpool in 1985) at 34 and resigned at 39. I arrive here at 39.'</span></p>
              <p><span>But it seems he will not be allowed to boost his Anfield ambitions by taking players with him.</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>'When those opportunities come, and they may come only once, you have got to make a decision.'</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Liverpool chairman Tom Werner claimed Rodgers would bring 'attacking, relentless football' to the club.</span></p>
              <p><span>'In Brendan we have acquired a very exciting and talented and young manager,' the American said. 'He's a forward-thinking coach at the forefront of a generation of young managers and will bring to Liverpool attacking, relentless football.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Werner added: 'We did speak to a number of people in the last few weeks, but I want to say Brendan was the only person we made an offer to. He was our first choice and the right choice.'</span> </p>
              <p><span>Rodgers had agreed a three-year deal to succeed Dalglish, although negotiations looked set to be held up by a wrangle over compensation. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>However, the Carling Cup winners have agreed to pay the £5million that was in Rodgers’ contract.</span></p>
              <p><span>Rodgers is confident he will get time to introduce his methods at Anfield.</span></p>
              <p><span>'This is long-term, that was important to me, to come into a project over a number of years,' he said.</span></p>
              <p><span>'For me (the attraction), is to defend the principles of this great club, offensive football with tactical discipline, and to retain the values of the club. That was the attraction, the history of the club.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Also the frustration. It has been over 20 years since they won the title.</span></p>
              <p><span>We might not be ready for the title but the process begins today, it's a new cycle, and that is something that we will work towards in the years to come.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Liverpool's search for a new manager has been criticised in some quarters for being too wide-ranging, but Ayre was satisfied with how the club dealt with filling the vacancy.</span></p>
              <p><span>He said: 'There was a process and it was right to have a process. Brendan was at the forefront of that thinking, evidenced by the fact we asked Swansea very early on.</span></p>
              <p><span>'He was the only person we made an offer to. We got the person we wanted.'</span></p>
              <p><span>He added: 'The process is a private process (but) it's fair to say we considered many people because that's what you should do. You try to understand how any individual fits with the profile.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Wigan boss Roberto Martinez was another to have held talks with Liverpool before they plumped for Rodgers.</span></p>
              <p><span>Ayre said: 'Roberto was one of the people in that process. We went through that with a lot of people.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Some people decided to say they were in the process but they weren't. It was all about understanding individuals and matching their skill-sets with the profile.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Brenden was at the forefront of that and at the outcome of it and that was exactly what we wanted.'</span></p>
              <p><span>He has been told he can spend this summer and <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>can reveal that, as well as attempting to hijack Swansea’s £6.8m move for Hoffenheim’s Icelandic midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson, Rodgers wanted his old club’s highly-rated Wales playmaker Allen, whom he sees as the type of player he needs to transfer his pass-and-move style of football to Anfield.</span> </p>
              <p><span>But Jenkins' comments about the 12-month period means it is unlikely Allen will go be allowed to go to Liverpool. </span></p>
              <p><span>Rodgers is already taking three members of his backroom staff to Anfield.</span></p>

              the swansea owner is very smart to include the 1 yr clause in the manager's contract.
              
              all clubs may follow suit from now.

              <div id="article-body-blocks">
              <p>The Northern Irishman was unveiled as Kenny Dalglish's successor at Anfield having signed a three-year contract that includes an agreement not to raid Swansea City for players in the next year. He will be accompanied by three members of his back-room team from Swansea, his assistant, Colin Pascoe, the conditioning expert Glen Driscoll and the chief match analyst, Chris Davies, and those plans have prompted the departure of Dalglish's former assistant, Steve Clarke.</p>
              <p>Ian Ayre, Liverpool's managing director, explained: "The structure – and Brendan is aware of this – is a more continental director of football-type structure, a collaborative group of people working around the football area." But it is one with Rodgers at the head and with control over football operations and transfers.</p>
              <p>Liverpool's new manager said: "The owners probably spoke to one or two people about certain roles but I wanted clarity on it [the structure] and I didn't agree until after three discussions with them. I wanted to make sure it was going to be the case that I would be in charge of football matters. That I would control the team, control the work and then what we have underpinning that is a team all with one vision and one mentality – that is to make the first team better. If it was anything other than that then I couldn't have said yes because that's not my strength.</p>
              <p>"I am better when I have control. I am not a power freak. But my point is that I need to feel that I can manage the team and have a direct clear line through to the owners. Once that becomes hazy, for me there is a problem. I don't think it was a model the owners were set on, by any means. I think it is one that people have come to them and suggested. They are still learning about the game.</p>
              <p>"One of the items I brought up when I was speaking to the club was that I wouldn't directly work with a director of football. I feel that if you are going to do that as a club you have to do that first. That was my recommendation. If you want to have a sporting director, get him in and then you can pick your manager from there but if you do I won't be the manager."</p>
              <p>Asked if he had 100% confidence that Liverpool will only sign players he identifies, Rodgers said: "Yes. It's absolute madness if you are the manager of the club and someone else tells you to have that player. It doesn't work. I've had total clarity with that from the guys so I've got confidence that will remain. It was for this reason that I didn't want to be sat up there, say what I've said and then in three weeks time Louis van Gaal walks in the door."</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Been impress with Brendan Rodgers so far, carry himself well and seems to be a very confident person. An individual with good football philosophy, fluid passing tiki taka style. Quick pass and move...to prevent dispossession from opponent..at the same tire out the opponent, which make a lot of sense. Football is a team game..although individual brilliance can make difference but when the player switch off, the team is fuck! The team must be allowed time to adapt to this style..the owner gotta be patient, if not it will be the same shit all over again. He has 20 yrs of management experience, been coaching since 20...but think he wont take liverpool to top 4 in his first season...need to clear some players as well..he likes to play 4-3-3 with quick winger...liverpool has none...prob bellamy and suarez..</p></div>

              <p>He can have total control of an empty squad if all the key players leaves.</p>
              <p>I cannot comment as he have not started his work in Anfield.</p>
              <p>But, I dun see the rest of players in staying around to get stuck in mid-table for next three years.</p>
              <p>Whether he can do a newcastle on Liverpool is hard to see at the moment as he will be stressed to deliver or unless the fan have given up on the club and just boycott every game.</p>

              </strong>But the young manager whose appointment last week heralded a new Liverpool dawn, insisted he won’t let that distract him from the long term aim of taking the club to the top again.</div>
              <p class="body ">Following his surprise arrival after just one season as a boss in the Premier League, there were complaints from some fans that Rodgers doesn’t have the experience to lead such a massive club.</p>
              <p class="body ">Add to that the sympathy for a genuine Anfield legend in the form of predecessor Kenny Dalglish, and an overwhelming level of support for another previous boss Rafa Benitez, and Rodgers knows he will be under intense scrutiny from sceptical Reds.</p>

              <p class="body "><strong>Yet on his appointment he revealed he won’t be losing any sleep... because he knows that for a certain group of fans, nothing can ever be good enough.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">“There are three types of supporters at every club. Number one is those who, no matter who the manager is, they love their club and will love their manager whoever it is,” he explained.</p>
              <p class="body ">“Here, Liverpool is their life and their passion, and that is who they are.</p>
              <p class="body ">"The second group is those supporters who will accept you but to earn their real respect you will have to be successful - and that’s fine by me.</p>
              <p class="body ">“The third group are the critics, and you never change them. Ever. If you win 4-0 it should have been five, if you win the league you should have won three.</p>
              <p class="body ">“But I will never worry about that group, because you can never affect them. If you do a good job you are proving them right, but they can’t be proved wrong so they will kill you even more.”</p>
              <p class="body ">Realism was a word Rodgers used a lot on his arrival at Anfield, because he knows it is a massive task to make Liverpool a top four contender again.</p>
              <p class="body ">For the Northern Ireland born boss though, simply rejoining the Champions League elite at the top of the table isn’t good enough in the long term.</p>
              <p class="body ">He wants to turn the Reds into title contenders again - though he accepts it could take years to do that... and even if he does, there will be some fans for whom it is not good enough.</p>
              <p>As part of the plan, Rodgers has already explained he will need to bring at least three or four players into the club, to help facilitate the style of play he wants to impose on Anfield.</p>
              <p>Yet he also passionately believes he has inherited the foundations of a squad that is good enough to aim much higher than the eighth place finish in the Premier League that ultimately cost Dalglish his job.</p>
              <p>“We are talking about a project, and it will take time, but we are not aiming just to get in the top four. At a club like Liverpool, the aim has to be for the very top,” he said.</p>
              <p>“We know we have to be realistic, and it will take time for that to happen, but there are some top class players here who can make a difference.</p>
              <p>“For a start, there’s a world class goalkeeper in Pepe Reina. He came through at Barcelona, so he will know this way I’d like to bring in and the principles of the game.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>“You’ve got Glen Johnson, who can be the world’s best right-back. Jose Enrique will only get better.</strong></p>
              <p>"You’ve got your two centre halves, Martin Skrtel and Daniel Agger, who’ve done really well, and a legend in Jamie Carragher who will always provide great challenge and motivation for the group.</p>
              <p>“Then there are other players like Luis Suarez who is a great talent and scores great goals, and Steven Gerrard who - when he’s fit - is the ultimate.</p>
              <p>“I am excited about everything about this city. It’s a city of folklore and football and I am proud to be a part of it.”</p>
              <p>And Rodgers also revealed predecessor Dalglish will find a welcome for him at Anfield.</p>
              <p>“I have the ultimate respect for Kenny and my door is always open for him. This is his home - he is the heart and soul of this club.</p>
              <p>“He is the best player in the history of this club and his love for it is unrivalled. I am not here to win any race or competition, this guy is a legend in the game and here at Liverpool Football Club.”</p>
