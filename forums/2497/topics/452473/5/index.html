              <p>Rodgers is really trying very hard to pleased the Anfield crowd and their fans. Saying so many things that even i would feel red face just to hear it let alone say it... The guy is ready to go so low to get his leverage which i feel he don't need to. Just prove himself on the pitch can already which i think he will. I believe he will do better than Kenny.</p>
              <p>But i can already see some pool fans have taken to his grovelling... But so far not those here yet lah... lol.</p>

              <p>haha im one of them that only hope that he can bring back confidence to both players and fans alike. i believe he can make it provided that he is given time. It will take at least 2 seasons to stable the ship and then gradually climb back up the ladder i feel. i hope fans do not ask for his axing even if next season liverpool doesnt get champions league spot, but i do hope to see improvement in our games. ie winning against ''lesser'' teams as a start. </p>
              <p>quite excited for a new style of play under him though i dont see how some players can fit in to his system. player such as carroll who is decent enough but hard to utilise imo. the british players that came in under daglish is another lot that needs to be settled asap.</p>
              <p>when lucas comes back i believe he will bring back stablity into the midfield. let henderson play his natural position in the centre. we do need more mobility and i dont see downing and adam can fit that. give aquaman and joe cole the chance back into the team i believe they are better than the former. if it were up to me i would already start looking at our youth and reserve team where i believe there are gems ( sterling, suso ) whom can start playing cup matches. </p>

              <p>The progress would begin with winning the team at lower tier.</p>
              <p>He need to be given more time to lose and form his team.</p>
              <p>I expect more players to leave the club.</p>
              <p>No point giving him too much pressure or else we end up with same situation as Ah Roy.</p>
              <p>No manager would want to apply if Ah Rod is being sacked after one season.</p>
              <p>It is lose-lose situation for every one.</p>
              <p>Liverpool still have decent players to win a game and stay in mid table.</p>
              <p>I am not expecting them to beat any of the big five next season.</p>
              <p>I just hope Ah Rod have fielded more players who played like Bellamy.</p>
              <p>Joe Cole want to be back.</p>
              <p>Aquaman was never given any chance to shine.</p>
              <p>Hope he can re-consider staying in Anfield.</p>
              <p>As for the owner, they are expecting to sell Liverpool once they found another buyer with some profit margin.</p>

              <p>He make his point with WBA and now with England.</p>
              <p>As for Ah Rod, he is just taking the opportunity to make a name for himself.</p>
