              <p><span><strong>Liverpool fans have rounded on the club's decision-makers for considering Wigan's Roberto Martinez as a managerial successor to Kenny Dalglish.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Supporters abused managing director Ian Ayre at a race meeting at Aintree on Friday night and chanted the name of previous Anfield boss Rafael Benitez.</span></p>
              <p><span>The general response from the club's followers to the prospect of Martinez being appointed has been underwhelming, and that is a concern after Roy Hodgson's ill-fated time at Anfield.</span></p>
              <p><span>Liverpool fans never accepted Hodgson and his reign was the shortest in the club's history, lasting just 31 games. </span></p>
              <p><span>The club have been widely criticised for their scattergun approach to replacing the sacked Dalglish. </span></p>
              <p><span>Anfield owner John W Henry insists they will appoint a young up-and-coming manager to replace the Scot, fired on Wednesday despite reaching two cup finals this season. </span></p>
              <p><span>That means Martinez, Swansea manager Brendan Rodgers, former Chelsea boss Andre Villas- Boas and Dane Michael Laudrup could be in, but Benitez and former England manager Fabio Capello are out. </span></p>
              <p><span>Liverpool would have to pay Wigan only £1million compensation for 38-year-old Martinez, who had renegotiated his contract last summer after turning down Aston Villa. </span></p>
              <p><span>Villas-Boas, sacked by Chelsea in March, is free to take the job. Spaniard Martinez, also coveted by Villa again, has still not spoken formally to Liverpool but is believed to be keen on starting a new challenge after saving Wigan from relegation with seven wins in the club's last nine games.</span></p>
              <p><span>He relationship with Dave Whelan was one of the closest chairman-manager bonds in the league but it became strained when the owner questioned his manager's team selection following a home defeat by Swansea in early March. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/05/19/article-0-132E8A10000005DC-925_468x181.jpg" alt="sg" width="468" height="181"></div>
              <p><span>Liverpool have been rattled by the fans' reaction to Martinez.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span><strong>They have been left open to ridicule for failing to make a quick appointment after Dalglish was sacked in Boston during a review with his bosses into a Premier League season in which the club finished eighth, 37 points behind champions Manchester City. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>By discussing so many possible managers, the club have risked alienating candidates unhappy with having to take part in a 'beauty parade' and risking returning to their current clubs having failed to land the job. </span></p>
              <p><span>Swansea boss Rodgers has said he does not want to take part in the process and Jurgen Klopp, manager of Bundesliga champions Borussia Dortmund, has also made himself unavailable. </span></p>
              <p><span>Having felt Dalglish's approach was old-fashioned, the Anfield hierarchy do not view Capello as a serious contender given his difficulties getting the best out of England players at the last World Cup. </span></p>
              <p><span>Benitez, who took Liverpool to Champions League finals in 2005 and 2007, is hurt he is not being considered given the lack of experience among the other candidates but Henry does not want a manager who is almost a cult figure among the fans, as Dalglish was. </span></p>
              <p><span>With Henry and chairman Tom Werner in America, under-fire Ayre has had to bear the brunt of the fans' frustrations. </span></p>

              <p>Sadly..nowadays is not what Liverpool want...Can forget about those unrealistic target mourinho, pep, klopp, hiddink, etc...brendan rodger made a right decision to snub the job...the only person that is available, keen on the job and has european experience is rafa and probably AVB..but dont think the owner will hire rafa though..</p>
              <p>It is not a very wise decision to hire martinez..he wont be able to attract star players..if martinez come, he will most probably be off next year...</p>

              <p>The way the American are managing the manager selection show how much they do not know soccer.</p>
              <p>They are assuming that if they can employ the wigan manager, that manager will also be able to handle the same stage as europa league since they think soccer is the same everywhere.</p>
              <p>But, they have basically sacked most of the advisors around and they are on their own on this important issue.</p>
              <p>They will most probably appoint AVB to be the next manager if he want to take the hot seat.</p>
              <p>It will a task worse than Chelsea as he have to fend off the fans, the players and coaching team if AVB continue his hard core approach.</p>
              <p>If it dun work out till the end of the year, Henry can prepare to be in the same situation with the previous owner.</p>

              <p>Liverpool is a ticking time bomb as a lot of their fans is just too demanding and harbour too much hope on Kenny until they have become totally unreasonable.</p>
              <p>My guess is the next guy won't have it easy if he is a not so famous manager... It's best to get the Kenny hopes out of the window then they can return to becoming a normal club.</p>
              <p>Maybe the next guy won't last long as the fans won't accept him just like Hodgson... But the guy after the next may get a fairer chance.</p>
              <p>Liverpool are in this state the fans have themselves to blame seriously... They should have just stick with Hodgson a little longer and maybe they would have been much better off today.</p>

              <p class="body "><strong>Roberto Martinez heads for Boston on Wednesday aware he faces intense opposition in his quest to become Liverpool manager.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">Andre Villas Boas and Brendan Rodgers have emerged as livewire alternatives to the Wigan boss, despite his scheduled meeting with the Anfield club's owners in the States tomorrow.</p>
              <p class="body ">And that is not the only hurdle that stands in the way of the Spanish coach, with Reds fans already mounting a growing campaign against the idea of him becoming the successor to Kenny Dalglish.</p>
              <p class="body ">With Martinez set for a second round of talks after owners John Henry and Tom Werner initially made contact at the weekend, it is assumed he heads the Americans' shortlist.</p>
              <p class="body "> </p>
              <p class="body "> </p>

              <p class="body "> </p>
              <p class="body "><strong>Yet Villas Boas is a far stronger candidate than most fans realise, as Fenway have moved on swiftly with the process of whittling down the original list of candidates.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">With the likes of original target Pep Guardiola always a fanciful pipedream, Liverpool have made discreet contact with the likes of Jurgen Klopp, Frank De Boer and Didier Deschamps, only to be rebuffed.</p>
              <p class="body ">Now they are in talks with Martinez and Villas Boas, and even though Rodgers indicated he wasn't interested in joining such a public circus by having an interview himself, it is understood he is still in the frame.</p>
              <p class="body ">The 39 year old manager has made it clear if he were on the short list then he would listen to what Fenway Sports Group have to say, and sources within Anfield suggest he remains one of their targets.</p>
              <p class="body ">Unlike Martinez, Rodgers does at least have big club experience after previously playing an important role in Jose Mourinho's backroom team at Chelsea.</p>
              <p class="body ">Villas Boas is also thought to be heading to Boston for talks, after making clear his desire to return to the Premier League despite a nightmare spell as Chelsea boss.</p>
              <p class="body ">Yet that current list of candidates will disappoint and enrage Liverpool's fanbase in equal measure.</p>

              <div class="body "> </div>
              <p class="body "> </p>
              <p class="body "><strong>There is a groundswell of opinion in favour of former boss Rafa Benitez, who has yet to be approached despite indications from Fenway he would also get a call as they trawled through their list of candidates.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">Benitez has made clear his desire to return, and has also revealed he would have no problems working under the proposed new structure at Anfield, after operating under a director of football for most of his managerial career in Spain.</p>
              <p class="body ">The supporters' growing unrest as they await news of an approach to Benitez offers haunting echoes of the situation when Liverpool made their move to replace him with Roy Hodgson two years ago.</p>
              <p class="body ">Back then, there was a refusal to accept the veteran boss, and that led to long term unrest within Anfield which threatened to rip the club apart. Fenway are now facing a similar situation as they press ahead with their plan to replace Kop legend Dalglish.</p>

              <p>AVB is better and he is jobless now.</p>
              <p>I am not impressed with Wigan's league position either. I appreaciate that Roberto
                                          Martinez(made wigan) plays attractive passing game but no improvement in league position over three seasons. I understand he is under financial constraints at Wigan, but in Liverpool, he will still be handicapped(financially) when compared with Chelsea, Man City, Man Utd.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, Swansea(his ex club) finished higher this season.</p>

              <p>Martinez jetted to Miami for talks with Liverpool’s American owners John W Henry and Tom Werner. But the pair will still fly to England next week to speak with Swansea boss Brendan Rodgers. </p>
              <p>Whelan said: “Liverpool would have to buy out Roberto’s contract. You’re into £3million but I am sure Liverpool would honour that. I gave him my permission to talk to Liverpool and he’s just carrying that out. </p>
              <p>“He has to listen to what they say and tell them what he wants but a bit will depend on the owners because I don’t think they fully understand football in England. </p>
              <p>“We have to see what they are offering and what control he’d get because Roberto likes total control from the youngsters to the first team. </p>
              <p>“If he doesn’t get that, I don’t think he’d take it — but we will have to wait and see.” </p>
              <p>Whelan has set a deadline of one week from 38-year-old Martinez’s return from holiday in Barbados next Tuesday for a decision to be made. </p>
              <p>Rodgers remains right in the frame to replace Kenny Dalglish, despite knocking back an earlier chance to talk because he did not want to merely add his name to a long list. </p>
              <p>The Irishman won huge credit for taking Swansea into the top flight and finishing just five points adrift of Liverpool.</p>
              <p> Rodgers, 39, also has big-club experience having worked as part of Jose Mourinho’s backroom team at Chelsea. </p>
              <p>Former Dutch national boss Louis van Gaal, 60, is in the running to be sporting director at Anfield, with a young manager working under him.</p>

              <p><span>The former England chief, who quit as national team manager in a row over John Terry's captaincy, is not interested in an audition for the job.</span></p>
              <p><span>Capello, who has won league titles with four top European clubs during his managerial career, is still keen on one last challenge, but it will not be at Anfield.</span></p>
              <p><span>Ajax coach Frank de Boer and Swansea boss Brendan Rodgers have also turned down the chance to be interviewed by Fenway Sports Group.</span></p>
              <p><span>Capello has been linked with a number of roles since he left England, but he would prefer to remain in London.</span></p>
              <p><span>The Italian coach, who has been spending time in Marbella this week, still hopes that Chelsea will offer him a one-year deal.</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Liverpool are no closer to making Roberto Martinez their new manager despite Dave Whelan claiming the Wigan boss has been offered a deal.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Martinez met Liverpool’s Principal owner John W Henry in Miami on Thursday for talks and that prompted Wigan chairman Whelan to declare on Friday that an offer has been made.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘In the meeting, I think they made him an offer,’ said Whelan, who has set a deadline of next Thursday for Martinez to inform him of his intentions.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘Roberto has asked what his responsibilities are because they are American owners and the rules and regulations they set down are a little bit different to what we English set down for football.’ Whelan also suggested Martinez will hold more talks with Fenway Sports Group next Tuesday but Liverpool are mystified by Whelan’s pronouncements.</span></p>
              <p><span>Liverpool maintain their recruitment process is continuing and that means candidates such as Swansea boss Brendan Rodgers remain firmly in the frame to succeed Kenny Dalglish. Former Bayern Munich manager Louis van Gaal is in line for the position of Liverpool’s Sporting Director.</span></p>
              <p><span>Martinez is very much in demand and is also now the clear favourite to land the Aston Villa job.</span></p>
              <p><span>Villa have not offered the job yet to the Spaniard, despite holding talks with Martinez’s agents on Thursday, but he was owner Randy Lerner's first choice 12 months ago.</span></p>
              <p>But Wigan owner Dave Whelan reckons Martinez will stay at the DW Stadium even if the Reds make a move for his man.</p>
              <p>Martinez, 38, is used to having a free hand at Wigan but Liverpool owner John W Henry wants the Spaniard to work with a director of football.</p>
              <p>Whelan said: “I spoke to Roberto after he went to Miami and had a constructive meeting.</p>
              <p>“I couldn’t say that he is going there for sure.</p>
              <p>“I think he said: ‘Thank you but I only work when I’ve complete control.’</p>
