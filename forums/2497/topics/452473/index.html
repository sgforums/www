              AVB? later he come in fight with Gerrard how.....
              
              
              Pardew is good. he buy de player all really got standard one, and also can help Carroll get his form back. but i dun think he will leave newcastle considering the success he got there.
              
              
              I dun think rafa is good for the current liverpool. Rafa come in confirm want to spend big money to buy player de. But i dun think FSG will let him spend too much after the wastage of last season.

              <p>Barcelona’s former boss tops a Kop list that also includes Wigan chief Roberto Martinez and Swansea manager Brendan Rodgers.</p>
              <p>Kop owners Fenway Sports Group accept their chances of tempting Guardiola are slim. But they feel it would be a huge mistake not even to sound him out.</p>
              <p>Guardiola walked away from Barca insisting he planned to take a year off and spend time with his family.</p>
              <p>Newcastle chief Alan Pardew and shortlived Chelsea boss Andre Villas-Boas are also being linked to Anfield.</p>
              <p>But Martinez has been given a headstart as the Kop have been given permission to approach him.</p>
              <p>Wigan owner Dave Whelan revealed: “Roberto asked was I in agreement that he could talk to them and I told him ‘Of course’. Now we have to see what he decides.</p>
              <p>“If Liverpool are serious, we may lose him.”</p>
              <p>The man who could be first into Anfield is Juventus sporting director Fabio Paratici, who Liverpool want in a similar position.</p>

              <h3>THE manager’s job at Liverpool has increasingly become a poisoned chalice.</h3>
              </div>
              <p>Now activists among the fanbase — including members of a powerful Scouse media cartel — are warning of dire consequences for the poor unfortunate who replaces Kenny Dalglish. </p>
              <p>How, following the dethroning of King Kenny, the new man had better be prepared for a hot and sceptical reception. </p>
              <p>And how he had better get it right from the start or else. </p>
              <p>Or else what? Or else the chants of “Dalglish” will come tumbling out of the Kop. </p>
              <p>And how he will be gone before you can say Roy Hodgson. </p>
              <p>And what of the identity of this candidate for the ducking stool? </p>
              <p>First out of the blocks yesterday was Wigan’s Roberto Martinez with chairman Dave Whelan indicating the Spaniard would be the ideal manager of a club that, according to Whelan, was “functioning without a heart.” </p>
              <p>Martinez is certainly a passionate individual but also extremely personable, good on TV, a natural communicator with the media and an all-round good egg. He also gets his teams playing the sort of football everyone likes. </p>
              <p>But he’s just the first of a shortlist that could include Didier Deschamps, Holland boss Bert van Marwijk, Fabio Capello, AVB (gulp), Alan Pardew (who ticks most of the boxes), Brendan Rodgers and Paul Lambert.</p>
              <p>Like Martinez, the last two have been told that the club is too big for them. </p>
              <p>And, anyway, what have they achieved? </p>
              <p>Apart, of course, from the near miracle of Rodgers and Lambert getting their clubs into the Premier League and keeping them there while Martinez, the original architect of Swansea’s attacking style, has again defied the odds to maintain Wigan’s status among the elite. </p>
              <p>Yet you get the feeling that a number of Liverpool supporters will only be happy when the new manager fails and they can <strong>REALLY</strong> start to get into the ribs of another set of American owners. </p>
              <p>The anti-anyone-but-Kenny brigade are also on their high horse about how the game is now all about filthy lucre and the Champions League rather than the fabled Liverpool tradition of winning trophies. </p>
              <p>One posting on a Liverpool fans’ website read: “Tears in my eyes. Soul of this football club is being ripped apart by people intent on seeking money rather than success.” </p>
              <p>Now let’s hang on a minute. </p>
              <p>Yes, the Fenway Sports Group are keen to make a return on their investment — like any other businessmen. After all, they are not a charity, although many fans believe club owners should be. </p>
              <p>But FSG believe they can make money <strong>AND</strong> have success. </p>
              <p>And the best way of doing this is by qualifying for the Champions League. That is what modern football is about. </p>
              <p>We know sentimentality is a strong currency on the Kop but it sometimes clouds reality. </p>
              <p>We should ask ourselves one question: just how did Liverpool get to their position of omnipotence in the 1980s and 90s? </p>
              <p>By the skilful use of money to buy the players to win the league and so qualify for the European Cup. Which, in turn, generated even greater funds with which to top up the team. Dalglish benefited hugely from this during his first stint as Liverpool boss. </p>
              <p>Now suddenly money has become a dirty word to some Liverpool supporters. </p>
              <p>As for Dalglish’s dismissal, the pros outweigh the cons. </p>
              <p>Yes, the Carling Cup became Liverpool’s first trophy in seven seasons and in both this tournament and the FA Cup they produced memorable displays against the two Manchester clubs. </p>
              <p>But when it came to the FA Cup final, the manager made a fundamental error in not playing Andy Carroll from the start. </p>
              <p>Then there was the excruciating Luis Suarez affair where Dalglish’s old school mentality, chippiness and failure to see the bigger picture embarrassed the club. </p>
              <p>Then come the stats... Liverpool’s lowest league position since 1993-94, their second fewest home wins (six), finishing 37 points behind the champions and 17 off fourth place. </p>
              <p>Yes, Dalglish could have been given a dozen games at the start of next season. Except, if things had still failed to improve, where would they have gone for a manager then? </p>
              <p>Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre summed it up well yesterday when he said: “No one is saying we didn’t enjoy winning the Carling Cup and getting to the FA Cup final but, ultimately, the backbone of football now is the Premier League and European football at the highest level.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Deep down, even Dalglish knows that.</p>

              <p>If he is a bigger name manager, maybe they will give him some respect and time. But if he is a nobody like Brendan Rodgers or Paul Lambert, hell will come very soon if you don't do well fast.</p>

              <p><br>Suarez is a cheat and a racist. Do you know during the last world cup when his country knocked Ghana out, he last min handballed... then received a red card, then pretend to cry... then realize Ghana the penalty miss... he celebrated instantly no more crocodile tears.... then poor Ghana was knocked out during the penalty shootout and suddenly the cheater Suarez was celebrating like a hero for handballing... what a football disgrace... and when he was branded a racist, obviously he kept denying... but who would believe a cheater anymore...</p>

              <p><span><strong>Liverpool have suffered their first snub in the
              search for a new manager - and it has astonishingly come from
              Brendan Rodgers.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The Swansea boss was one of the contenders to replace
              sacked Kenny Dalglish at Anfield but he has decided to reject the
              opportunity to talk to owner John W Henry.</span></p>
              <p><span>It is the first setback for Liverpool, who have</span>
              <span>approached at least four high-profile names, including former
              Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola.</span></p>
              <p><span>Anfield officials cast their net as wide as possible in
              their search to replace Kenny Dalglish by sounding out Guardiola
              and former England boss Fabio Capello. They have also made formal
              moves to speak to Roberto Martinez of Wigan, and are considering
              Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp.</span></p>
              <p><span>A Swansea statement read: 'Swansea City can confirm that
              an approach from Liverpool FC to speak to manager Brendan Rodgers
              was officially received by club chairman Huw Jenkins this
              morning.</span></p>
              <p><span>'The club is pleased to confirm that Brendan has declined
              the current opportunity to speak to the Anfield club about the
              vacant position.</span></p>
              <p><span>'The Swansea manager is currently working hard to
              strengthen the squad in readiness for the new Barclays Premier
              League campaign.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Rodgers, 39, signed a new three-and-half-year deal in
              February, made a huge impression by guiding Swansea to an
              11th-place finish in their maiden Premier League
              campaign.</span></p>
              <p><span>The Welsh club rounded off their season by beating
              Liverpool 1-0 at the Liberty Stadium, a fixture which proved to be
              Dalglish's last in charge of the Reds.</span></p>
              <p><span>Swansea's attractive possession style of play also won
              former Reading and Watford manager Rodgers plenty of admirers, and
              chairman Huw Jenkins has admitted the Swans will have to become
              used to their boss being linked with other clubs.</span></p>

              he knows if he takes the job he will be without one very soon.
              it doesnt make any sense for a small club manager to accept the liverpool job.  hodgson is a good example.
              
              martinez should arrive at the same conclusion.

              <p>For managers that are from Wigan, Swansea and Newcastle, learn the lesson from Roy and Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Henry will not be happy with another season out of Champion League.</p>
              <p>As for Jose, his pattern of winning game will pissed Liverpool fan off.</p>
              <p>But, he will go to a club with cash and good players.</p>
              <p>Have not seen him go to one club and re-build it from square one.</p>
              <p>As for Pep, he want a one year break so that he can go to BPL as manager.</p>
              <p>Dun think he would risk his reputation and salary if he dun make it in Liverpool.</p>
              <p>As for Ah Ben, he is the guy who will know how to tackle the situation in Liverpool now as he have went through the same crap before.</p>
              <p>But, he have a weakness of buying some crap players along the way.</p>
              <p>He is actually the best candidate as the other candidates have to get used the players and fans and owners.</p>
              <p>He is old bird with all there elements.</p>
              <p>As for the rest of the candidates, they have no experience in BPL and will crash in their 1st season.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Andre Villas-Boas has become a leading candidate to replace Kenny Dalglish after it emerged he will hold talks with Liverpool  next week.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The former Chelsea boss has been a target for Roma but his name was swiftly added to the list of eight candidates to replace Dalglish.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Fenway Sports Group had admiration for the job Villas-Boas, 34, did at Porto and he has many of the characteristics Liverpool are looking for in their new man.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The news that Villas-Boas is happy to meet Anfield officials is a boost to the club after both Swansea manager Brendan Rodgers and Jurgen Klopp, boss of German champions Borussia Dortmund, ruled themselves out of contention.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Liverpool approached Swansea on Thursday to ask for permission to speak to Rodgers but they were refused by chairman Huw Jenkins.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Rodgers, who signed a new  three-and-a-half-year contract only in January, issued a statement on Friday insisting his focus was on matters at the Liberty Stadium.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>He said: ‘My professional life is great here and, importantly, my personal life is great. Being in command as a manager is sometimes a lonely place because you are having to develop a structure, but I have never felt that in Swansea.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">‘I have plenty of time to do whatever I need to do as a coach and a manager. But my only concentration is here because the job I came to do is not complete.’ </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">However, Liverpool may attempt to persuade Rodgers to reconsider. <br></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Roberto Martinez remains the bookmakers’ favourite to succeed Dalglish but, after having spoken to Aston Villa on Thursday, he did not have talks with Liverpool on Friday.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Marseille’s Didier Deschamps, Ajax chief Frank de Boer and Holland coach Bert van Marwijk are also on Liverpool’s list. Former boss Rafa Benitez may also be considered.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The lack of a manager has not stopped the club from continuing contract talks with three of their most important players.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Leading scorer Luis Suarez and defenders Martin Skrtel and Daniel Agger are all discussing new terms but, inevitably, clubs around Europe are monitoring their position.</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span><strong>According to reports, Liverpool plan to interview a dozen different  candidates for the manager's job to ensure every viable contender is considered. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Insiders tell me the American owners are actually closer to  making an appointment than many believe but have been busy  deciding precisely which scientific method they will use to whittle those 12 names down to that all important one. A tombola or a dartboard? </span></p>
              <p><span>What on earth is happening at Liverpool? Having sacked pretty much everyone in a position of authority over the past couple of weeks barring their beleaguered chief executive, the club appear to have resorted to drawing random names out of a revolving drum and then cold calling them to see if they fancy moving to Merseyside. </span></p>
              <p><span>In no particular order, the 12 names currently being considered for the Liverpool manager's position are - Pep Guardiola, Jimmy Corkhill from Brookside, Alan Pardew, the Anfield Cat, Roberto Martinez, Derek Acorah, Fabio Capello, Rick Astley, Andre Villas-Boas, club PA announcer George Sefton, Didier Deschamps and Ken Dodd. </span></p>
              <p><span>Veteran Dodd emerged as a surprise second favourite behind Martinez because, as one correspondent pointed out, it means the club won't have to replace the initials on Dalglish's old tracksuit. </span></p>
              <p><span>The truth is almost as ridiculous. The official Liverpool Twitter account - yes, the club's official feed - asked its million or so followers to nominate Kenny Dalglish's successor. This came three-and-a-half hours after stories announced the club had hired a new director of communications.</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Naturally, having been bombarded with all sorts of inventive nominations, someone at Anfield then tried to backtrack, saying: 'The context of our last tweet seems to have been misunderstood.' And it was really a 'fun feature'. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Unfortunately, everyone is having fun at Liverpool's expense right now. More so because this naïve episode fitted in with the general perception that, ever since the Luis Suarez T-shirt debacle, Liverpool are lacking in leadership and groping in the dark for solutions. </span></p>
              <p><span>Of course, this job lottery scenario could all be a great diversion designed to distract us from the real managerial target. It might be like the night comedian Dodd went to watch a topless female ventriloquist perform and 'nobody ever saw her lips move'. </span></p>

              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/05/18/article-2146585-1312E079000005DC-429_468x317.jpg" alt="Better off in Swansea: Brendan Rodgers has turned down Liverpool's approach" width="468" height="317"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br><br></span>
              <p><span><strong>But it is more likely that Liverpool have no idea who they want as their new boss. This means if you've been mentioned over the last 12 months in anything approaching a vaguely complimentary fashion (that rules out Acorah) you have a chance of being called to an interview. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Swansea's Brendan Rodgers wisely took himself off the wishlist, declining the official approach with gracious words about unfinished business at his present club. The Northern Irishman is smart enough to know there will be other attractive opportunities ahead, where the fact he is 'Not Dalglish' won't be held against him either. </span></p>
              <p><span>Equally, Borussia Dortmund's Jurgen Klopp, winner of back-to-back Bundesliga titles, rebuffed a Liverpool approach, cruelly depriving national newspapers of their pre-prepared 'Klopp of the Kop' headlines in the process. </span></p>
              <p><span>Naturally, Guardiola was the top target. He is everybody's top target and that's the trouble. My local pub has a vacancy for a bar manager and Pep is their ideal choice too if he'll take it. And they have about as much chance as Liverpool of luring the former Barcelona boss out of his year-long sabbatical. </span></p>
              <p><span>Does anyone seriously think he would step down from the 'stress' of coaching a team including Messi, Xavi and Iniesta, widely considered to be the best in the world, to swap tactical chit chat with Jordan Henderson and Stewart Downing on how they can knock it long to Andy Carroll? </span></p>
              <p><span>Besides, how does Guardiola even appear on a 'shortlist'? If someone at Anfield genuinely believes he can be persuaded to betray that declaration to Barca that he was 'exhausted' and needed a year off, then you just go and get him. You do not scribble the name Guardiola alongside a boss who has just avoided relegation. </span></p>
              <p><span>One wonders why the Americans would expose th</span><span>eir naivety like this. When John W Henry and Co arrived the fact that they lacked any knowledge of the game was ignored because anything was better than Tom Hicks and George Gillett. </span></p>
              <p><span>Their appointment of Dalglish was always a compromise and the Scot's crabby plea that judging Liverpool by league position alone was 'disrespectful' was the beginning of the end. As I pointed out at the time, his employers were precisely the sort to use that measure. </span></p>
              <p><span>Henry doesn't deal in sentiment. His commodity trading business boasts of making decisions that 'lock out human emotions'. And so it proved when he closed the door on Dalglish. </span></p>
              <p><span>But what do Liverpool have to offer someone like Guardiola? A side that finished eighth, level on points with Fulham, and behind a very skint Everton. Before that, they were seventh and sixth. They have won a Carling Cup, beating a Championship side on penalties, their only trophy in six years. Their future is uncertain, since no plan has been announced on the future of the stadium. </span></p>
              <p><span>But they have so much to offer if the right man can rebuild them. For Wigan manager Martinez that all amounts to a step up and a great challenge. For Guardiola, it is a reason to soak up the sun and wait for United, or Chelsea or  anyone else who comes calling  next year. </span></p>
              <p><span>But 11 other candidates remain. Luckily, Liverpool have agreed to allow Fox Sports to film a behind-the-scenes documentary at the club and maybe that's the plan? Maybe they'll stage the ultimate football reality show, where one candidate is voted out every week. They can call it Kop Idol. </span></p>
              <p><span>And after a dog won Britain's Got Talent, what price is the Anfield Cat?</span></p>
