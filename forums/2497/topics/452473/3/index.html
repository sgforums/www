              <p><strong>There are, though, complications as to whether the Dutchman’s methods match the way the Fenway Sports Group are seeking to restructure the club. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>Van Gaal has been spending the summer at his house near Albufeira in the Algarve and it is understood that Ian Ayre, <span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span><span style="color: #000000;">’s</span> managing director, flew out to meet him last week.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>There are very few available candidates that possess Van Gaal’s pedigree. He has been out of work since falling into dispute with Ajax and Johan Cruyff.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>While Van Gaal wants to be a head coach or manager, and has had plenty of offers, he recognises that Liverpool is a unique opportunity for him, even if it means working in a different role.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>He has won titles in the Netherlands, Spain and Germany with Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich respectively and wants to test himself in English football.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="tmg-related-links" class="related_links_inline">
              <div class="headerOne styleFour">The difficulties lie in Van Gaal being able to adapt to how Liverpool want their new structure to work. The first issue will be how comfortable the new manager would be working with Van Gaal, especially if it is a young manager like Brendan Rodgers or Roberto Martínez.</div>
              <div class="headerOne styleFour">.</div>
              </div>
              <div class="body">
              <p>Rodgers and Martinez are the leading contenders to succeed Kenny Dalglish. Martinez met John W Henry, the principal owner, in Miami last week while Rodgers is thought to be back in serious contention after intially declining a meeting with Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Such is FSG’s admiration for Martínez that, after sacking Damien Comolli in April, they considered approaching him for the role of director of football. At Wigan he has had a lot of control about the way the club works and he will be reluctant to cede too much influence to a sporting director at Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Van Gaal has a reputation for setting the highest standards and being forthright to the point of arrogance. When he was technical director of Ajax in 2004, his demands caused him to fall out with head coach Ronald Koeman. Van Gaal ended up resigning.</p>
              <p>Another issue is that, in all his previous jobs, Van Gaal has taken a substantial staff with him, made up of coaches and analysts. It is understood that he would want to bring key people with him to help infuse his football philosophy.</p>
              <p>Andries Jonker, his former assistant at Bayern, has announced that he will be leaving Munich this summer, giving rise to speculation that he will be joining up with Van Gaal again. Van Gaal would also want to bring Frans Hoek with him, the innovative goalkeeping coach who Pepe Reina credits with developing his distinctive style at Barcelona.</p>
              <p>Liverpool, though, have apparently refused to accept Steve Clarke’s resignation as first team coach, and only appointed Kevin Keen as a coach last summer, so may seek some continuity in this area. Then, of course, any new manager is surely going to want to bring some trusted coaching staff along with him.</p>
              <p>To add to this complicated picture, FSG are also contemplating appointing a technical director as well as a sporting director. They felt that Comolli was taking on too much as director of football and want to divide the responsibilities into two jobs. Pep Segura, the technical manager of the Liverpool academy, is the favourite for the technical director role.</p>
              <p>The next step for the owners is to decide whether to meet Van Gaal personally and find a way to resolve the issues that his appointment would bring, or whether to look for a candidate who, while not having Van Gaal’s track record, would prove a more straightforward fit for the way they want to run the club.</p>

              <p class="body "><strong>Roberto Martinez will announce on Tuesday whether he will become Liverpool's new manager.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">The Spaniard has been heavily linked with the Anfield job since Kenny Dalglish was fired a fortnight ago.</p>
              <p class="body ">Wigan boss Martinez met Liverpool owner John Henry in Miami last week and has jetted to the Carribbean for a family break.</p>
              <p class="body ">Wigan will hold a press conference this week in which Martinez is expected to announce whether or not he will stay at the club.</p>
              <p class="body ">The 38-year-old met Liverpool's owners in Miami on Thursday to discuss the managerial vacancy and was not put off by the huge challenge that would face any new manager.</p>
              <p class="body ">However, it is understood Martinez has not made up his mind completely whether to accept that challenge and has given himself until Tuesday to do so.</p>
              <p class="body ">Wigan chairman Dave Whelan claimed on Friday the Spaniard had received an offer from Liverpool's principal owner John Henry after their meeting in Miami on Thursday.</p>
              <p class="body ">Doubts emerged over Whelan's interpretation of the situation, with the Reds refusing to comment amid the general belief no formal offer had been made.</p>
              <p class="body ">Martinez's appointment would doubtless divide opinion among Liverpool supporters, some of whom may have been expecting a bigger name to be recruited to replace the sacked Kenny Dalglish.</p>

              <p class="body "><strong>But captain Steven Gerrard has already pledged his full support to Martinez should he get the job.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">Gerrard, was a big supporter of Dalglish but cautiously welcomed the idea of Martinez taking charge.</p>
              <p class="body ">"We'll have to wait and see," said the midfielder.</p>
              <p class="body ">"My focus has been on the game. I'm aware Roberto Martinez has been talking to the club but all I've heard about him is positive.</p>
              <p class="body ">"If he is going to be the manager, he's got my full support."</p>
              <p class="body ">Throughout the process, Whelan has insisted it was not a foregone conclusion he would lose his manager to the club's north west rivals, claiming there were still some issues - mainly surrounding working under a technical director - to be overcome before Martinez would even be in a position to accept.</p>
              <p class="body "> </p>

              <p class="body ">"They're going to talk again on Tuesday. They've made Roberto an offer and he has agreed to consider it.</p>
              <p class="body ">"He's said, 'What are my responsibilities?' These are American owners and the rules and regulations are a bit different from what we English set down.</p>
              <p class="body ">"Roberto is a seven-days-a-week, 12-hours-a-day worker and I don't know whether they realise how hard he works.</p>

              <h3>DAVE WHELAN will today announce Roberto Martinez is STAYING on as Wigan manager.</h3>
              <div class="clear-left">
              <div id="bodyText">
              <p>And that has opened the door for Swansea’s Brendan Rodgers to become Liverpool’s next boss.</p>
              <p>Martinez was hot favourite to replace Kenny Dalglish at Anfield and met Kop owner John W Henry last week for talks.</p>
              <p>But Latics owner Whelan has pulled off a sensational coup in talking the Spaniard into remaining at the DW Stadium, with the promise of a huge cash injection.</p>
              <p>That will see Martinez being given a new contract, a serious transfer kitty and fresh terms for his backroom team.</p>
              <p>Yet while it is a huge boost for Wigan, the news is another embarrassment for Liverpool whose managerial search has seen Henry’s Fenway Sports Group widely ridiculed.</p>
              <p>Whelan broke cover a week ago to reveal he had given Martinez the green light for talks with the Reds’ American owners.</p>
              <p>But he always insisted he had not given up on keeping the 38-year-old and yesterday turned his guns on the Kop by claiming they had no idea who they actually wanted.</p>
              <p>With Martinez out of the running, Rodgers will be strong favourite to land a job seen by many as a poisoned chalice.</p>
              <p>Borussia Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp was also heavily backed yesterday but German sources insist he will not be moving.</p>
              <p>Frank de Boer declined the chance of an interview, while fellow Dutchman Louis van Gaal claims he is close to landing a senior management role at Anfield.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>If pool ends up with Brendan Rodgers, it must be one of the biggest joke in recent years in football... Martinez was quite an good choice as he is young and quite proven in the premier league... Who the hell is Rodgers seriously? He has only been in the premier league for one season. If like this also can, then those clubs who were previously promoted and stayed in the league for one season are also good enough i guess. The Steve Coppell kinds...  Martinez was a good choice but the fans have made it difficult. I think their fans have scored an own goal again if Martinez turns down the job just like that time they were all so sure Kenny was going to take them back to the glory days...</p></div>

              his managerial career also not glamorous.
                  
                  swansea first, then now wigan.

              <p><strong>Liverpool plan to make the announcement of their new manager on Friday, ESPN understands. They have whittled their list of candidates down to Wigan's <span style="color: #000000;">Roberto Martinez</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and Swansea's</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Brendan Rodgers</span><span style="color: #000000;">, after a thorough search for the right man to replace </span><span style="color: #000000;">Kenny Dalglish</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins met Rodgers on Tuesday to discuss his future at the club, with Rodgers believed to be interested in discussing the Anfield job with the Reds' owners.</p>
              <p>Wigan chairman Dave Whelan told ESPN that his manager is back in England but he is yet to speak to him. Informed that Liverpool are keen on Rodgers, Whelan said: "I hope they sign him but I have not heard from my manager yet."</p>
              <p>Martinez had looked the clear favourite to be named Liverpool manager but his concerns over the mooted appointment of Louis van Gaal as sporting director, and his expected control over transfers, have swung a two-horse race back towards Rodgers.</p>
              <p>However, Jenkins has shown marked reluctance to even grant Rodgers permission to speak to Liverpool, whereas Whelan has fulfilled his pledge to Martinez to allow him to go to a big club, should he wish to do so.</p>
              <p>Amid growing speculation, Jenkins said of Rodgers on Monday: "We would like to confirm that there has been no contact from Liverpool and nothing has changed since our previous statement on the issue."</p>
              <p>Fed up with the procrastinations of Liverpool, Whelan has given Martinez until Thursday to make his decision. Liverpool will take the next 48 hours to finalise their plans and an announcement is expected to be delivered on Friday.</p>

              rodgers is smart to accept the liverpool offer.
              
              if he 'succeeds' he will become even more famous.  if he doesnt he will get the sack and a good compensation.  its a win-win situation.
