              <div class="KonaBody"><span>@<strong>thestrettyender</strong>: What do they mean by not spending more than they earn? Does that mean we'l never see a transfer for more then 80 mil quid?<br><br><strong>Wayne Veysey</strong>: No, not at all. e.g, if Real Madrid negotiate a series of bumper commercial &amp; media contracts, or sell a few £20m players, it can happen.<br><br>A club can technically spend £100m on a player if they earn enough revenue to do so (e.g from commercial sources or transfers)<br><br>@<strong>faizarsyadw</strong>: so clubs are still allowed to do crazy signings unless it's not from the chairman's investment but from revenues?<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: Yes, that is right. If Real Madrid earn £200m a year from bona fide commercial deals, they can go transfer mad.<br><br>Some of the rich clubs have considerably larger revenue than others. Real, Barca &amp; MUFC stand out.<br><br></span><span>@<strong>philim88</strong>: so in other words you can only spend what you bring in have i got this right??<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: Nearly. You can lose an aggregate €45m between 2011-14 &amp; €30m between 2014-17 if funded by a lender (eg Sheikh Mansour)<br><br>@<strong>NourAgha</strong>: What if two clubs announce a transfer deal for a certain value, and exceed it secretly where one club continues to pay the other.<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: All financial accounts are audited by independent experts &amp; have to be available to Uefa experts too<br><br>@<strong>obumosigwe</strong>: How will Chelsea and City be allowed to play in the Champions League next year with their crazy spending?<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: FFP is phased in from next month over a period of 3 years. The first possible exclusions from CL or Europa League will be in 2014/15 season<br><br>@<strong>mohza</strong>: what punishments do clubs face if they do not meet the rules? and won't most clubs just find 'loop holes' around these rules?<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: The ultimate sanction is exclusion from Euro competition. Uefa admit there are loopholes but team of Swiss accountants have drawn up rules<br><br>@<strong>swagadore</strong>: Apparently there are 29 loopholes around it.. Someone read the full document. how robust does he think it'd be &amp; How is it robust<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: I believe it is robust but might need adjusting as market conditions change &amp; clubs find loopholes you suggest. Uefa can't be too draconian.<br><br>@<strong>I_Am_Tzar</strong>: how does it affect the likes of City and Chelsea? Wage budget and transfers<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: Considerably. There's no way either will be spending £100m on players this summer unless they have something up their sleeve or a fire sale<br><br>@<strong>wandile32</strong>: the FFP is targeting foreign bosses then tell us what the motion behind this initiative? City are the ones who will suffer most.<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: Uefa strongly deny FFP is targeting PL clubs. They want to curb football's financial excesses - £1bn losses across 660 top div clubs in 2009<br><br>@<strong>BennetDladla</strong>: do you honestly think uefa would exclude teams like man u, chelsea,barce, madrid, inter if they ALL didnt comply with the FFP?<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: As an absolute last resort, yes I do. Otherwise, the rules are meaningless &amp; Uefa lose all credibility<br><br>@<strong>jonnyno1</strong>: can you explain how this rule influences wages<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: Top players will still get top wages but there will be less money swimming around football pool so there will be -in effect- a soft wage cap<br><br>@<strong>andyh_75</strong>: is Uefa legally allowed to impose financial limitations and spending on clubs?<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: Uefa is the governing body. It makes the rules. 27 clubs have not been given a licence to play in Euro competition in last 5 years<br><br>@<strong>raeez7</strong>: How does a debt-laden club affect the FFP?<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: Clubs must (nearly) break even. If lender (eg Abramovich) fund club, then €45m aggregate losses allowed over next 3 yrs. €30m loss 2014-17<br><br>@<strong>TimSmith18</strong>: will small clubs or big clubs benefit more from the rules in the long term?<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: The well-run clubs will benefit, large or small. I predict a small narrow of gap between rich &amp; poor. But MUFC, Real etc will still rule<br><br>@<strong>andyh_75</strong>: also what stops say Man City owners buying their own products, VIP tickets etc to increase revenue?<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: Uefa have a panel of experts to investigate this. Anything much above market value (eg naming rights) will set alarm bells ringing.<br><br>@<strong>MHD_Rashed</strong>: can clubs reject these rules ? and isn't it possible they can create their own rich clubs' league?<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: The rules have been unanimously approved. Uefa say all the clubs want this. No chance of breakaway league at this point<br><br>@<strong>mekus_b</strong>: What punishment awaits clubs who do not adhere to the new Uefa rules?<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: Ultimate sanction is clubs will not be given a licence to play in Champions League or Europa League<br><br>@<strong>Frank_Bear</strong>: this is just a Bosman for the CL. All that'll happen is transfer fees will come down and wages go through the roof?<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: Interesting thought but I don't agree that transfer fees will go down. Wages will only go up for tiny elite<br><br>@<strong>ScouseFutbolCS</strong>: I can see a massive loophole already, City's owners could use their company to give City a mega shirt sponsorship deal<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: Yes, but FFP rules say it cannot be above 'fair value'. Thus, there will be no £40m a yr deal (more like £10m), which means FFP is working<br><br>@<strong>Gbeng10434</strong>: wat happens if a team that spends so much is unable to generate enough,will they be allowed to take loans to buy players<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: This is one possibility, yes. A ban on buying players is certainly one sanction the FFP panel can enforce<br><br>@<strong>borgeh1</strong>: why not uefa introduce wage and transfer cap instead.so that no transfers exceed a certain fee and wages.to be reviewed annually?<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: Uefa say the whole point is not to punish players or teams but just introduce more financial discipline<br><br>@<strong>aleem21010</strong>: how will it affect new signings? Will top players take pay cut to move to new clubs?<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: Very possibly. I expect squads will be trimmed and there will be a greater spread of talent<br><br>@<strong>mdescotes</strong>: Will this not also greatly affect mid and lower table teams who are trying to grow without CL and huge media deals?<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: If they're living within their means, they should benefit. e.g a Stoke will be playing a Chelsea who have had to rein in spending<br><br>@<strong>todanik</strong>: dont you think this will only bring back the idea of the breakaway series mentioned some few years back?<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: Because the Champions League is the king. It would require quite a few top clubs failing FFP for parallel league to happen<br><br>@<strong>Vescucci</strong>: Will the repercussions be enforced at all or there's likely gonna be compromises? Has such a breach and due punishment ever occured?<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: Yes. Uefa have refused licences to 27 clubs over last 5 years eg. Mallorca in Europa League this season<br><br>@<strong>saminda14</strong>: what does the new rules means for Man Utd debts??? will Utd be able to spend in summer.....<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: Yes, MUFC will be able to spend. Their debts must be reined in l-term &amp; a no. of methods could do this (e.g Glazers sell or put cash in)<br><br>@<strong>reubenevans</strong>: why can't Sheik Mansour give his mate 100m to put towards advertising... on city's shirt. No reason to disclose the money trail?<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: Yes, there is. Uefa experts will inspect such wrongdoing and demand evidence to justify such a deal. If none, then punishment<br><br>@<strong>DON_SMILEY</strong>: is there an actual limit to what a club can spend now ? Is there a limit on the players wages?<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: There are no limits on spending or wages. If Real or Barca can justify buying Fabregas for £80m, via revenue stream then no problem<br><br>@<strong>Swagadore</strong>: It doesn't take into account all finances though, I heard. So If Roman wants to build a new stadium for the club he can do that.<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: Yes, that is correct. Stadium expenditure &amp; youth development do not count towards FFP<br><br>@<strong>jackwidnell</strong>: are there any English clubs that would have failed over the last three years?<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: Loads. 14 out of 20 PL clubs, I believe, would have failed over last 3 yrs if the rules had been in operation<br><br>@<strong>agscuderia</strong>: don't you think ultimately fans will suffer. Higher prices for tickets, merchandise, membership and almost everything.<br><br><strong>WV</strong>: There is that fear, yes, and in many ways it is justified. But if fans are taken for granted, they stay away eventually.<br><br></span></div>
