              <p class="first"><strong>A football transfer is to be decided by an internet vote of thousands of supporters for the very first time.</strong></p>
              <p>Members of myfootballclub.co.uk (MFC), who own Ebbsfleet United,
              will decide if they should accept a £140,000 offer from an unnamed club
              for John Akinde.</p>
              <p>"It's quite historic," MFC founder Will Brooks told BBC Sport.</p>
              <p>"The summer has been full of talk about Gareth Barry and
              Cristiano Ronaldo, but this transfer allows fans to have a say in
              whether it is right for the club."
              </p>
              <p>The 30,000 plus members have 48 hours to decide
              whether they should sell the highly rated 19-year-old striker, who has
              played fewer than 20 games for Ebbsfleet.</p>
              <p>He has already been watched by Chelsea scouts and the club have
              turned down an offer for Akinde from League One side Peterborough.</p>
              <p>The non-league side's manager Liam Daish and board has recommended the
              striker should be sold to allow him to play at a higher level.</p>
              <p>Players who have recently turned professional like Akinde are unlikely to be earning more than £200 a week.</p>
              <p>"The fans are legal owners of the club," added Brooks. "Whereas
              transfers at other clubs are decided by a few board members this
              decision will be taken by 30,000 board members."</p>
              <p>Earlier this year over 20,000 MyFootballClub members, who had
              each paid £35 to provide a £700,000 takeover pot, took control of
              Ebbsfleet, to give each fan an equal share in the club.</p>
              <p>Since then members have voted on a number of major decisions
              affecting the club, including the price of season-tickets to watch
              Ebbsfleet, but this is the first time a transfer will be decided by the
              team's fans.</p>
              <p>MFC's membership now stands at over 30,000 people, with members living in 122 countries.</p>
              <p>"It has become very apparent that members are taking the
              responsibility of ownership very seriously and considering decisions
              made so far."</p>
              <p>In July MFC members helped raised £20,000 to enable Daish to buy striker Michael Gash from Cambridge.</p>
