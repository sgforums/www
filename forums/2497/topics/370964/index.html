              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Guardian writers' prediction: 5th Odds to win league: 8-1</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong></strong> </p>
              <p><strong>Last season was only one game old when </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/arsene-wenger"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Arsène Wenger</strong></span></a><strong> felt the first jabs of the pressure that would follow him throughout what turned out to be his most punishing campaign. The post-match inquisition evidently wasn't too interested in the details of a mundane </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/aug/17/arsenalnasriwestbrom"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>1-0 win over West Bromwich Albion </strong></span></a><strong>and went straight to the heart of the matter: how many more seasons can you go without a trophy, Arsène? How can you sell some of your best players and seriously expect to win a trophy, Arsène? Can you really go four years at a club like this without a trophy, Arsène?</strong></p>
              <p>The man's expression stiffened. The season's record at the time was played one, won one. It seemed a bit harsh to be under the cosh and talking about bloody trophies already.</p>
              <p>Then came game No2. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/aug/25/premierleague.arsenal"><span style="color: #005689;">Fulham 1-0 Arsenal</span></a>. Wenger's team were abominable. Robin van Persie remembers sitting on the coach afterwards feeling completely shell-shocked. In a sense, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/arsenal"><span style="color: #005689;">Arsenal</span></a>'s campaign never really recovered. The basic frailties in the squad, the ones you don't need to be Alan Hansen to pinpoint, always had the capacity to trip them up.</p>
              <p>As the new season comes over the horizon, Wenger finds himself in a similar position to a year ago. He knows the trophy question is even more pressing. He is perfectly aware that Manchester City's new collection puts a top four position at greater risk than ever before. But if you think that will drag him into buying a job lot of monsters to do the team's dirty work, you underestimate his exceptional bloody-mindedness.</p>
              <p>And, to an extent, his optimism. He is relying on those returning from long-term injuries, Eduardo and Tomas Rosicky, to be de facto new signings. Banking on them staying fit, and playing better than ever before, is a major gamble. So too is his faith in the likes of Denilson, Alex Song, Abou Diaby and Aaron Ramsey to be a year older and wiser in midfield. But that seems to be the plan. Incidentally, there is an interesting statistic in the Gooner fanzine's annual survey: some 93% of fans polled don't think the current squad can win the title without any major signings.</p>
              <p>Wenger has made one fairly important adjustment to his strategy for 2009-10. He appears to have had a Eureka moment. It didn't come from a team who do what Arsenal can't – such as the power play Chelsea rediscovered under Guus Hiddink, the clean sheets ground out by Manchester United's impeccable defensive partnership, or the dynamics Javier Mascherano and Xabi Alonso brought to Liverpool's midfield. It came from the team who do what Arsenal think they can do, only they do it much better: Barcelona.</p>
              <p>Wenger has come to the conclusion that shape, not personnel, will be the key to a big improvement. Once a strict 4-4-2 man, he has been dabbling increasingly with a 4-5-1 over the past couple of years, but that was always with five midfielders strung across the pitch. Throughout pre-season Wenger has shifted it to a 4-3-3. He has plenty of options for his attacking trio, with Van Persie, Nicklas Bendtner, Andrey Arshavin, Eduardo, Theo Walcott and Carlos Vela all in contention. A Barcelona-style passing game, with a bit more bite up front than Wenger's usual deviation from 4-4-2, is the new formula.</p>
              <p>The irony is that the two players he has sold to Manchester City, Emmanuel Adebayor and Kolo Touré, offered outlets that could give Arsenal variation from their tippy-tappy possession game, either through a high ball to Adebayor or one of Touré's cavalier runs upfield from the back.</p>
              <p>But it's hard to argue that the sales are anything but magnificent business financially, and Wenger genuinely believes those two will barely be missed - both inside the dressing room, where they were part of a clique - as well as on the pitch, where last season neither performed as well as they had in the past.</p>
              <p>Regulars at Emirates Stadium back the manager on those departures, provided the money is invested back into the team pronto. They pay for the most expensive tickets in football, and want to see a competitive team, not a competitive balance sheet. They do not want to see more of the defensive vulnerability that is Arsenal's undoing but they ought not hold their breath.</p>
              <p>For the time being, they just have to wait to see if Wenger will use the Manchester City money on some Mongolian wunderkind or if he will surprise them and lay out for the finished article. Will he buy a massive, ugly defender? Might he bring in an experienced, midfield destroyer to dovetail with Cesc Fábregas? Could he inject a little more of the calibre of Arshavin that made such a difference to the team?</p>
              <p>They will almost certainly have to wait until the closing seconds of the transfer window, Wenger's usual trading time, to find out.</p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Guardian writers' prediction:</strong> 8th <strong>Odds to win league:</strong> 100-1</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Could this be the first season when </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Aston Villa</strong></span><strong> go backwards under </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Martin O'Neill</strong></span><strong>? For the past two they have finished sixth but unless there is a flurry of transfer activity it is difficult to believe that the Irishman can manage it for a third time. From the poor form at the end of last season to the departure of two of the club's most influential players and a worrying lack of new signings, the portents are not too promising.</strong></p>
              <p>O'Neill is aware of the shortcomings and acknowledged last week that he needs five players to "give us a chance". The Villa manager is renowned for prevaricating in the market but even by his standards business has been slow. Stewart Downing is the only new recruit hitherto and the former Middlesbrough winger is not available until December due to injury. Furthermore his favoured position is left-wing, where Ashley Young has excelled.</p>
              <p>Central defence and central midfield are the biggest areas of concern, however, with Gareth Barry's transfer to Manchester City and Martin Laursen's retirement leaving huge holes to fill. There are no like-for-like replacements either, with neither Steve Sidwell nor Nigel Reo-Coker blessed with Barry's composure. Further back Carlos Cuéllar, the former Rangers defender, is still taking time to adapt to the English game after an unconvincing first season.</p>
              <p>O'Neill hopes to strengthen the defence by agreeing a fee with Portsmouth for Sylvain Distin, and there is little doubt that the Frenchman's experience would be invaluable alongside Curtis Davies, whose performances last season were markedly better when partnered by Laursen rather than the also departed Zat Knight. That leaves central midfield still to be addressed; a problem that could be exacerbated if Stilian Petrov faces an extended spell on the sidelines after dislocating a shoulder.</p>
              <p>Villa's squad is so threadbare that the merest sign of an injury must send a shiver down O'Neill's spine. Having operated with fewer players than any other <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span></a> club last season, they have become lighter still. Thus it must come as a relief to the manager that a promising group of young players is emerging including Marc Albrighton, a teenage winger who caught the eye during the Peace Cup in Sevilla.</p>
              <p>The one area where O'Neill does have options is up front. He is expected to play two from Gabriel Agbonlahor, Emile Heskey and John Carew, although Villa were arguably at their most effective last term when playing in a 4–5–1 formation. Agbonlahor adapted to that role superbly but his form tailed off badly during the second half of the season, a period that coincided with the arrival of Heskey, who also struggled.</p>
              <p>There is little doubt that Villa have the pace and power going forward to unsettle opponents, particularly when Young is supplying the ammunition. O'Neill might have been guilty of hyperbole when he likened the England international to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo last season, but no one at Villa underestimates his value to the team. Had Young departed this summer, Villa's hopes of finishing in the top six would have disappeared, too.</p>
              <p>As it is, they have an outside chance of establishing themselves among the top order, as long as O'Neill can significantly add to his squad. Even then, though, it cannot be taken for granted. He believes Manchester City are now part of a "genuine top five" and has even gone as far as to suggest that Mark Hughes's side should be favourites for the title, leaving Everton and Tottenham as Villa's main rivals for sixth.</p>
              <p>Maybe the alarm bells should have been ringing at the end of last season when Randy Lerner, Villa's owner, suggested "more modest" spending this summer. It is difficult to criticise the American, who has invested heavily since he took control three years ago, but if the club are to compete at the top then big money needs to be made available again. O'Neill is among the Premier League's top managers but he is not a miracle worker.</p>
