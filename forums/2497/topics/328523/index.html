              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">CHELSEA are taking a £70million hit in their bid to snatch the Premier League title back from Manchester United. Billionaire owner Roman Abramovich has given the go-ahead to seal the £27m signing of Real Madrid striker Robinho this week. And he is writing off £43m just to get rid of Andriy Shevchenko and Shaun Wright-Phillips.</h2>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Sheva returned to AC Milan on a 12-month loan last night, two years after joining Chelsea for a British record £30.8m. While SWP is heading back to Manchester City for £9m. That represents a £12m loss on the England winger, who cost Chelsea £21m when they bought him in July 2005.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Talks have opened between the clubs and City boss Mark Hughes has been given the all-clear by owner Thaksin Shinawatra despite his current problems. The former Thai Prime Minister has had his £800m fortune frozen by the Bangkok authorities after fleeing bail to avoid fraud and corruption charges. But Shinawatra is assuring Hughes that funds are still available for signings.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea boss Phil Scolari has made it clear SWP, 26, does not figure in his plans and the player did not even make the bench for Sunday’s 1-0 win at Wigan. While Scolari has been told the Robinho deal is just a matter of hours away.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">With Shevchenko gone and Didier Drogba out for another month with a knee injury, Nicolas Anelka is currently Chelsea’s only fit striker for Sunday’s game with Tottenham.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">But Real are finally ready to sell Robinho. Despite being an unused sub, he was booed at the Bernabeu during Sunday’s 4-2 win against Valencia in the Spanish Super Cup.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The Brazilian was called a “mercenary” and abused by a group of fans as he left the team hotel. Real president Ramon Calderon said: “Nobody is going to be kept at the club against their will.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea’s latest financial figures revealed the club are £736m in debt with £578m of that owed to Abramovich in an interest-free loan. Since those figures were released, they have paid a further £24m for Deco and Jose Bosingwa.</p>

              <p>Calderon had indeed managed to get at least a section of Real's fans to go against Robinho..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SWP is not even worth the 9m pound IMHO, Roman paid 21m a couple of years back was just stupidty at its best.. anyway Chelsea made far too many inflated purchases in their quest for the title.</p>
              <p>anyway, this season if big phil is as attacking minded as their 1st game suggested then i'll bet ManU wouldn't even be close to them come end of the season, with or without that Spurs striker... as for Liverpool, Arsenal, Spurs, Portsmouth and the rest.. with no disrespect to all of them, these teams can probably just take pride in getting a place for next season Champion's league, but being a fan i would certainly hope i've gotten this one badly wrong, cause if i've gotten it correctly then i'll have problem staying awake to see EPL this season...</p>
