              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>ARSENE WENGER insists Arsenal can still win the Premier and Champions League double. On the eve of tonight’s Euro clash at Liverpool, he said: “I still believe we’ll be champions in this league. Manchester United’s result at Middlesbrough on Sunday helped a lot. “If they had won, I’d have thought we couldn’t do it but now I still believe we will. We have belief we can win everywhere.”</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The Gunners are six points behind United in their Premier battle. And they have an Anfield mountain to climb if they are to save their European dream. Arsenal managed just a 1-1 draw against the Reds in their quarter-final first-leg clash at the Emirates last week. And <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Liverpool have never failed to progress when they have avoided a first- leg away defeat in 17 European Cup campaigns</em></span>.</p>
              <p class="article">Yet boss Wenger is in the mood to make history — despite bagging just two victories in 11 games. He added: “We’ll try to play the game to win it, rather than go to penalties. “I’d like to score early goals, as many as we can. But if we need to be patient, we will be.</p>
              <p class="article">“Yes, we did have a dip recently, it’s true. We can’t deny that. But football is strange sometimes. “We feel it’s possible we can win the last five games. “Of course, I said that before the Liverpool game as well but I said five games and one draw would make it. It is compulsory that we win at Old Trafford on Sunday.</p>
              <p class="article">"Defeat is not unthinkable. You have to accept you might lose but what is important is you believe you can win. “If I didn’t believe we could win the Champions League, I wouldn’t be here.” Wenger’s touchline histrionics in Saturday’s league draw with Liverpool suggested the pressure is beginning to get to the Gunners chief.</p>
              <p class="article">Yet the Frenchman maintains he would still be the same even if he had led his side to a clean sweep 12 months ago. He said: “I must say I’m physically agitated more because I want to score the goals, rather than because I’m really nervous. “Sometimes, I’ve had periods in the season when I’ve been really nervous and angry. This is more to help the team, not because I’ve not won anything for a long time.</p>
              <p class="article">“If I’d won every trophy last year, I’d be the same. What I’ve done or not done is not important.” Tonight’s clash draws parallels with Arsenal’s quarter-final showdown with Chelsea four years ago, when the Gunners crashed out to Wayne Bridge’s last-gasp goal at Highbury.</p>
              <p class="article">Wenger added: “There are similarities to 2004 when we drew at Chelsea 1-1, then lost at home in the last minute. “I believe we have to go into it with a positive attitude.” Hitman Emmanuel Adebayor insisted: “We have to fight because it’s going to be a big battle. “But we are ready for that. The most important thing is to give everything in your heart.”</p>

              <p>given how they are trying their best, I applaud them and their efforts. At least, they are willing to attack and do it with their style.</p>
              <p>Not like some, who rotates and rotates, just to get 4th and hopefully, worm themselves into a CL.</p>
