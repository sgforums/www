              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Alexander Hleb moved a step closer to leaving Arsenal yesterday, but talks over teammate Emmanuel Adebayor’s move to AC Milan reached deadlock over his £36m price tag. Although AC Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani confirmed he has spoken to Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger about a deal, the Italians are unwilling to meet Arsenal’s demands for the Togo striker.</strong></p>
              <p>‘I have had contact with Wenger and right now we are divided on an important difference in terms of value of the player,’ said Galliani. Of his two striking targets, he added: 'They are both great forwards. But they could both remain where they are.'</p>
              <p>Barcelona will continue to compete with Milan for Adebayor — regardless of whether president Joan Laporta stands down on Thursday — but the Spaniards are facing competition from Bayern Munich for Hleb</p>
              <p>The former Stuttgart midfielder has already said he would be interested in a return to Germany, and Bayern will decide in the next few days whether to meet Arsenal’s £18m asking price following talks with the 27-year-old’s advisers.</p>
              <p>It is understood Hleb has already left his London apartment, and yesterday he said: ‘There are 10 top clubs in the world, and when a couple are interested in you and offer better terms, surely others would do the same as I have.’</p>

              <h1 class="storyTitle" style="margin-bottom: 0pt; font-size: 2.8em;">Galliani: It's Ronaldinho or Adebayor for Milan</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p>AC Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani insists the Italians will
              sign only one of Emmanuel Adebayor and Ronaldinho - which could spell
              good news for Manchester City.</p>
              <p>The pair have been linked with switches to the San Siro this summer, with
              Galliani claiming Arsenal have sent him a letter saying they are willing to
              discuss a deal for Adebayor but remaining tight-lipped regarding Barcelona's
              Ronaldinho.</p>
              <p>However, the 64-year-old insists any deal for one would end interest in the
              other, with the possibility of two big-name new signings having a negative
              effect on the Rossoneri - and Adebayor, who scored 30 goals in 48 games for
              Arsenal last season, appears to be Galliani's first choice.</p>
              <p>If Milan do turn to the Togo striker, it would therefore leave City as the only
              bidders for Ronaldinho.
              'Let's be clear about this: Adebayor is the alternative to Ronaldinho and
              vice-versa,' Galliani said in a statement.
              'We consider Kaka and (Alexandre) Pato first-team players.</p>
              <p>Having two players
              of the calibre of Adebayor and Ronaldinho would create a lot of problems in the
              dressing room.'
              On Adebayor, who the Gunners value at around £36million, he added on Tuesday:
              'If Adebayor decides to leave Arsenal, we are certainly interested.
              'The English club have told us they are available to be contacted to negotiate
              for the player. This is a step forward, but the road is still long.'</p>

              <h1>London's tiring me out . . . I want somewhere quiet like Barcelona, explains Hleb</h1>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/07/09/article-0-010340AE00000578-423_306x335.jpg" alt="Alexander Hleb" width="306" height="335"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Arsenal midfielder Alexander Hleb was set for a £14.5million move to Barcelona - after complaining he was tired of living in London. With the clubs edging towards a deal, the Belarus international has made no secret of his desire to swap The Emirates for the Nou Camp.</strong></p>
              <p>His representatives were in Barcelona to thrash out the details of his personal terms just as Hleb went on the offensive, claiming his dislike of the stresses and strains of living in this country were behind his desire to move to Spain.</p>
              <p>'I am not happy with my life in Britain, to be honest,' said Hleb. 'Elements of day-to-day life may prevent me in future from playing a full part with my team here. 'I can't get used to the chaotic way of life in London, where everyone is racing around 24 hours a day. It is uncomfortable and I'm mentally tired.'</p>
              <p>The tactics Hleb has used to push through his move are sure to infuriate Arsenal fans as well as Arsene Wenger, the manager having been instrumental in developing the player he bought from Stuttgart for £11.2m three years ago into a talent capable of attracting interest from the likes of Barcelona.</p>
              <p>On Monday Hleb claimed he and his French boss 'didn't coincide at all' when it came to determining his best playing position, also suggesting that Wenger would not be sorry to see the back of him. He then turned his fire on Spanish team-mate Cesc Fabregas, claiming the European Championship winner was selfish in front of goal - although Hleb later insisted his comments had been misinterpreted.</p>
              <p>While Hleb my have cited his dislike of the pace of life in London, finding out that Barcelona is hardly a backwater is unlikely to require much time, while the media glare which goes with playing for one of Europe's biggest clubs will soon become apparent.</p>
              <p>But he clearly feels he can have an easier life playing for Pep Guardiola's side as he admits the demands of playing for Arsenal are further reasons for his unhappiness. He said: 'I feel I can't keep squeezing enough out of myself to satisfy a team like Arsenal. As a professional I honestly told Wenger that at our two recent meetings. 'I was seeking his advice on whether I should leave. I also made no secret that some leading European clubs were interested in me. Wenger wasn't happy about that.'</p>
              <p>Hleb can surely add the names of many Arsenal fans to that of his manager, although the harsh reality for supporters is that Hleb could soon be joined at Barcelona by Emmanuel Adebayor.</p>
              <p>Even if under-pressure club president Joan Laporta is persuaded to fall on his sword following a directors' meeting today, it will not affect the Nou Camp pursuit of Adebayor. As yet there is no agreement on a price for the Togo striker, with Arsenal holding out for £38m and Barca offering £8m less.</p>
              <p>But like Hleb, Adebayor has spoken of his desire to move - either to Barcelona or AC Milan - after it became clear that Arsenal were unwilling to match his £80,000-a-week wage demands. Arsenal team-mate Bacary Sagna has spoken of the impact the departures of Hleb and Adebayor could have, especially after the loss of Mathieu Flamini to AC Milan.</p>
              <p>The France full back said: 'If Emmanuel was to go, it would be a big loss. The uncertainty around Hleb and Adebayor is all part of football. Flamini has left and he was an important part of our midfield.</p>
              <p>'It's a shame, but I'm not too worried. Samir Nasri is joining us from Marseille and there are also a lot of young players knocking on the door. It could be a good opportunity to give them their chance.'</p>
