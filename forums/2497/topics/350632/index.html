              <p><strong>Fulham boss Roy Hodgson has defended Cristiano Ronaldo against recent allegations of arrogance and cheating. </strong></p>
              <p>The Manchester United winger's reputation has come under fire
              recently, with a booking in the Carling Cup final for simulation and
              Arsene Wenger suggesting that his 'arrogance' can draw fouls from
              opposition defenders.</p>
              <p>However, ahead of Fulham's FA Cup tie at home to United on Saturday, Hodgson has refused to condemn the player.</p>
              <p>“I don't think these days, in the situations I've seen, there's been a lot of blatant diving,” he said.</p>
              <p>“Of course, he goes at such speed that, when he loses control of the
              ball and when people are in there making challenges, the referee's got
              a difficult task on his hands.</p>
              <p>“I don't know whether he's arrogant. I don't know him well enough. He's confident, isn't he?</p>
              <p>“Someone who's very confident in his play would always run the risk of being called arrogant.”</p>
              <p>Ronaldo has also faced criticism for kicking out against opponents
              on recent occasions and, while Hodgson says retaliation is always
              wrong, he sympathises with the motives.</p>
              <p>“If someone finds themselves fouled a lot and has a flick out to
              show his displeasure, he's the one who gets sent off and the guy who's
              been knocking him over left, right and centre gets away with it,” he
              said.</p>
              <p>“Never forget that football players are human beings.</p>
              <p>“We expect football players to be saints. They're not – they're human beings.</p>
              <p>“You're walking down the street and all a sudden, out of the blue,
              someone comes and throws a right-hander and smacks you right in the ear
              – your first reaction is to hit them back, isn't it?</p>
              <p>“It's not to say, 'Well, hold on here – I might get a yellow card. Thanks very much!'</p>
              <p>“On the other hand, you can't ever justify someone kicking out. You sympathise, but you know the rules.”</p>
              <p>Asked if the situation was unfair, he added: “I'm pretty sure that's what he and Sir Alex [Ferguson] would be saying.</p>
              <p>“You're trying to flag him up as some sort of arrogant, unpleasant
              sort of person; I suppose what I'm trying to do is put on Sir Alex's
              mantle and defend the fella.</p>
              <p>“I don't know what the hell I'm doing that for – he's not even my
              player! I hope Alex does the same thing for me one day! He owes me a
              drink for this one I think.”</p>
