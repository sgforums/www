              <p>Gomes, a fans' favourite at PSV, had requested a transfer shortly after the club claimed their 21st league title last season, citing differences with managing director Jan Reker.</p>
              <p>Gomes, who made his name at Cruzeiro, was an ever-present in PSV's title-winning campaign, conceding only 24 goals in 34 league games. It was his fourth successive Dutch league win since joining the club in 2004.</p>

              <p><strong>Tottenham have taken their summer spending to £27.5million after agreeing a £7m fee with PSV Eindhoven for goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes. <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail online </span>revealed on Monday that Spurs were going to complete the signing of Gomes this week, and they reached a settlement with the Dutch club last night. His arrival should hasten Paul Robinson's departure to Aston Villa in a £5m deal, which was also revealed by <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail online </span>this week.</strong></p>
              <p>The Gomes deal is a major victory for Spurs, as PSV had initially rated the goalkeeper at £10m but then had to drop their asking price as the Brazilian goalkeper had made it clear he wanted to leave. Gomes is expected to be in the country within the next 48 hours to discuss terms as well as undergo a medical and he is expected to sign a four-year contract.</p>
              <p>The deal is subject to him receiving a work permit. The 27-year-old asked for a transfer after falling out with PSV general manager Jan Reker, who failed to convince him to stay after talks last week. Reker said: 'Gomes told me he wanted to grab this chance. He wanted to move his career forward.'</p>
              <p>PSV are confident they will benefit from the deal by securing Tottenham left back Young-Pyo Lee for a modest £800,000, but Spurs head coach Juande Ramos will be happiest having also signed Luka Modric and Giovanni dos Santos this summer. <br></p>
