              <h1>He'll walk alone: Steven Gerrard so fed up with Rafa Benitez he's 
              ready to quit his beloved Liverpool</h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Liverpool fear that captain Steven Gerrard’s frustration with life 
              under Rafael Benitez<br>will see him leave Anfield this summer if he 
              gets the right offer.</p>
              <p>Gerrard has been a Liverpool player for 
              more than 11 years, making more than 400 appearances for the club that 
              he almost led to Barclays Premier League glory a year ago.</p>
              <p>But
               <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>understands that 
              the Anfield hierarchy are concerned by the lack of a relationship 
              between the midfielder and manager Benitez and fear he will look at 
              other options this summer.</p>
              <p>With Benitez’s game of bluff and 
              counter-bluff with the Liverpool board over his future at an impasse, it
               seems likely that the Spaniard will still be at the club next season.</p>

               eroded " width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Rock bottom: Steven Gerrard's relationship with 
              Rafael Benitez has eroded</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>It is feared, however, that this will heighten Gerrard’s sense of 
              gloom with regard to the future and many people at the club are thought 
              to feel it unlikely that the next campaign will begin with both manager 
              and captain on board.</p>
              <p>Having missed out on Champions League 
              qualification with a dismal seventh place League finish this season, 
              Benitez and his players are aware that there is little money to spend on
               new talent, something that is a big worry to Gerrard as he looks to win
               the title at his beloved club.</p>
              <p>With Manchester United, 
              Chelsea and Arsenal cemented as the top three teams in the country and 
              Tottenham and Manchester City ready to challenge again next season, 
              Gerrard is aware that his chances of winning the title with Liverpool 
              are remote.</p>
              <p>It is understood that he feels Benitez has been 
              given the chance to take Liverpool<br>forward but, having failed to 
              build on 2005’s amazing Champions League win, has not been able to take 
              it. </p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/20/article-0-026FAE6600000578-929_468x340.jpg" alt="This is a low: Gerrard has become disillusioned with life at 
              Liverpool under Benitez - and may consider pastures new" width="468" height="340">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>This is a low: Gerrard has become disillusioned 
              with life at Liverpool under Benitez - and may consider pastures new</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Benitez and the Liverpool board are aware that star striker Fernando 
              Torres is wondering whether his career could benefit from a move, but 
              there is now a feeling that Gerrard is the player more likely to leave.</p>
              <p>The
               29-year-old remains frustrated that he has not won a League title and 
              knows that<br>time is running out. A move abroad is most likely to tempt
               him and Real Madrid will certainly be interested if Jose Mourinho takes
               over this summer.</p>
              <p>Twice, in 2004 and 2005, Gerrard almost left 
              Liverpool to join Mourinho at Chelsea<br>and a move to Spain would be 
              the perfect way out for the Liverpool skipper.</p>
              <p>At home, 
              Manchester City made their own tentative interest but realise Gerrard 
              will not<br>go to Eastlands despite not having to uproot his family. </p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/20/article-1280028-098093CB000005DC-327_468x323.jpg" alt="Hero status: Gerrard is surrounded by fans after the last game of

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Hero status: Gerrard is surrounded by fans after
               the last game of the season at Hull</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>A fee in excess of £25million for Gerrard would at least give Benitez
               room to manoeuvre in the transfer market.</p>
              <p>But it is 
              understood that support for Benitez in the dressing room is far from 
              unanimous.</p>
              <p>With Liverpool losing 10 League games last season, 
              there is a feeling among some players that his tactics have lost 
              direction and what will surprise many fans is that Torres has 
              reservations about this, too. </p>
              <p>The Spain striker has been a 
              sensation in the three years he has
              spent at Anfield and is recognised as one of the best centre forwards
              in the world.</p>
              <p>However, City and Chelsea have firm interest
              in him, too, and the 26-year-old has failed to declare that his future
              remains on Merseyside.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Tough times: Torres (left) and Gerrard are two 
              of Liverpool's superstars</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Behind the scenes, tension 
              continues to exist between Benitez and the Liverpool chief<br>executive 
              Chrsitian Purslow.</p>
              <p>Purslow is aware of the theory that 
              Benitez was trying to strengthen his own position by allowing interest 
              from Italian club Juventus to be known as the season reached its 
              underwhelming climax.</p>
              <p>He is also aware of how many important 
              games last season were prefaced by comments from Benitez about his own 
              position or future at the club.</p>
              <p>With Italian champions Inter 
              Milan the latest club to be linked with a move for Benitez,<br>it 
              appears that the furore over his future will not die down.</p>
              <p>If
               he does stay then he will do so knowing that his transfer budget will 
              be small. This will further frustrate a manager who is known to feel 
              that he has not had sufficient cash to spend during his time at 
              Anfield. </p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Rejected: Juventus saw their offer for Aquilani 
              declined</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Liverpool have rejected a £9.5m offer from Juventus for midfielder 
              Alberto Aquilani. The club are still unsure about Aquilani’s role with 
              the squad next season but would want double that offer to consider 
              selling.</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old joined last summer from Roma in a £20m 
              deal and Benitez would want to recoup that money to strengthen his 
              squad.</p>
              <p>Juventus know Liverpool’s budget is tight and Benitez 
              must generate cash but a swap deal involving Brazil midfielder Felipe 
              Melo has also been mooted.</p>
              <p>Aquilani’s agent Franco Zavaglia 
              said: ‘It is not easy to bring him to Juventus. In this season, when he 
              did not have ankle problems, he has always played and never had any 
              problems with Benitez. So they won’t part with Aquilani unless they 
              receive very heavy offers.’</p>
              <p>Liverpool may raise cash by 
              selling winger Albert Riera, who is wanted by German club Stuttgart.</p>
              <p>Bradford
               City’s 14-year-old striker Callum Pilkington is poised to sign for 
              Liverpool for an undisclosed fee.</p>

              <p><br>Even if Red Devils won the Title, Owen needs to start at least 10 games... to secure a medal. (Premiership rules)</p>

              <p>What is there to pity? He made his bed therefore he should lie on it now... Don't forget, prior to Rafa coming, he and Owen were very close to leaving Liverpool that same year...  He even handed in a written transfer request something that Owen didn't do...</p>
              <p>Rafa manage to persuade him to stay back not before increasing his salary to the same amount Chelsea were offering him...</p>
              <p>So what is there to pity him? He made his decision then and later said he never want to leave Liverpool... He even won the CL medal as a reward that year and said he was glad he stayed back... He has to take the pros and the cons that come his way now cos he made the call when it matters.</p>
              <p>To leave Liverpool now when he is so close to becoming a one club man... and the fans and the city adore him till he can commit a crime where 6 of his follower all got jail time while he the ringleader is unbelievably found innocent... will be very disappointing for the fans and especially so to those who reside in Liverpool...</p>
