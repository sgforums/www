              <p>From the beginning, i've never been a fan of AVB's style of managing Chelsea. He has no football playing experience and his age is a true test to his credentials. Was totally different from the Ancelotti era, where he emphasised much defensively and brought Chelsea the double. :)</p>
              <p>Villas-Boas brought his Porto style of management which has brought only 4 draws as a coach of Porto while remaning unbeaten for the whole season and winning the Europa league. Porto style of management in Chelsea does not fit the club, with the defence falling apart like during the 5-3 rout when  Arsenal visited Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Won't be surprised to see AVB getting the sack and Hiddink replacing him soon after.</p>

              <p>AVB is too young and inexperienced to the premier league.</p>
              <p>Chelsea won't go very far with him in charge.</p>
              <p>But having paid $13m to "buy" him from Porto, it would take another $20m to send him packing... Roman would have done better to have kept Lotti in my opinion. Cos the Chelsea of today isn't frightening anymore unlike yesteryears...</p>

              <p>And they will have to visit Newcastle and Spurs and entertain City in Dec. They are not in great shape at the moment and could lose more games before the Jan transfer window opens for them to get Cahill from Bolton.</p>
              <p>Who thinks AVB could still be in charge come mid Jan? I see a Scolari happening all over again. Hey, Hiddink is currently free too... hmmm...</p>
