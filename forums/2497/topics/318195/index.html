              <p><strong>For Petr Cech, it is a constant reminder of the moment when Stephen
              Hunt's boot impacted with the side of the Chelsea keeper's head. </strong></p>
              <p>Pictured
              here are the MRI scans — published for the first time — which were
              taken before Cech underwent emergency brain surgery following the
              sickening collision with the Reading midfielder on October 14, 2006.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/05/19/article-0-014E18DF00000578-613_468x286.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="286"></p>
              <p>Cech, who will be in goal for Chelsea in Wednesday night's Champions
              League Final against Manchester United in Moscow, remembers nothing of
              the incident that kept him out of the game until the following January.</p>
              <p>The Chelsea keeper, interviewed by Des Kelly on the BBC's Inside
              Sport programme, revealed: "It's the first time anyone has seen these.</p>
              <p>"The
              pictures are pretty impressive because you can see the skull in detail
              as if you are holding it in your hand. You can see the metal plates
              hold the big part of the fracture in place.</p>
              <p>"Two holes were
              made in the skull by the surgeon to lift the major piece of bone back
              into place as it was depressed inside from the impact.</p>
              <p>"The
              little pieces around it were just broken so they put them back together
              and this will all fuse back together over the years. On the scan you
              can see where the bone ends. And either side of that there are just
              tissue fibres. They are strong enough to hold off some impact, but you
              never know. And that is why I wear the helmet to make sure it's not
              going to split again.</p>
              <p>"When you hear that someone has a
              depressed skull you imagine a lot of things. But when you see it, it
              looks very different to how you might expect. It's still healing so I
              can feel how the muscles around the fracture are protecting the area
              and the whole area is stiff.</p>
              <p>"When you touch it you can feel
              the metal plates. I still have things to do and they try to release the
              pressure on the side of the skull a little but it's fine."</p>
              <p>Cech,
              who celebrates his 26th birthday on Tuesday, recently returned to the
              team after a training-ground accident with Tal Ben Haim that left him
              needing 50 stitches in an open facial wound.</p>
              <p>The goalkeeper was
              told by medical staff he would be out for the season, but he made a
              magnificent recovery. Cech added: "I keep collecting scars. The clash
              in training tore my face open and when I saw the reaction of the other
              players, I knew it was serious.</p>
              <p>"When I looked in the mirror, I
              was shocked. The bottom half of my face had come away. But the surgeon
              did a good job and it shows I haven't changed my style of play.</p>
              <p>"When
              I need to dive in at people's feet, I only have one goal, to save the
              ball whatever it takes. The downside of football is injuries, but you
              cannot control that."</p>
