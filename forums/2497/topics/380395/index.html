              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">CARLOS TEVEZ has been told it is time he learned to speak English. </h2>
              <p class="article">Tevez, who is rumoured to have said 'que' when told this, has been in England for more than three years. But the Manchester City striker still needs instructions in team meetings and games translated to him. </p>
              <p class="article">His Argentine countryman and Eastlands team-mate Pablo Zabaleta is already fluent after just 12 months in this country. And he has told Tevez it is time to start having lessons with him. </p>
              <p class="article">Zabaleta, 24, said: "It is important. I get English lessons once a week so my language is getting better. I try, I try. "I didn't speak English before I got here but I got lessons. </p>
              <p class="article">"I have told Carlos he needs to come to me for lessons. "He sometimes does try to speak English. But it is important to learn because we need to speak with team-mates and managers and everyone. "Plus we are living in England for the future." </p>
              <p class="article">Zabaleta's English is excellent for someone who could not speak a word when he joined from Espanyol in a £6.5million move in August 2008. Tevez, meanwhile, has still not done a single interview in English. </p>
              <p class="article">Many people were stunned at his Press conference when he joined City he was still speaking in Spanish despite two seasons with Manchester United. </p>
              <p class="article">The understanding on the pitch does not seem to have been hugely affected with Tevez, 25, having hit five goals in 11 games since his controversial switch across Manchester. Zabaleta added: "People are happy with Carlos because he always gives 100 per cent. </p>
              <p class="article">"He is playing really well and he is very important for Manchester City." While Tevez has been first choice, Zabaleta has had to fight for his first-team place. The arrival of Kolo Toure and Joleon Lescott meant Micah Richards was moved permanently to his preferred right-back spot this season ahead of Zabaleta. But Richards' poor form has allowed Zabaleta back in and he aims to stay there.</p>
