"I loved my time here at the club and I am sad that it looks like I am leaving.<br><br>"I wish Big Sam all of the best for the future, as well as Newcastle and their fans."<br><br>However, the player's agent, Willy McKay, believes there is still a chance the player could secure a longer deal.<br><br>McKay says the player's decision is in no way motivated by money, and he is still holding out hope a two-year contract could be agreed.<br><br>"Antoine does not want more money, he simply wants to sign a two-year deal and does not feel it is worth uprooting his children from their current school just for one," he said.<br><br>"He did leave Manchester City in disappointing circumstances, but he is still regarded as a top, top player and has been during his career.<br><br>"Antoine is very disappointed to leave Newcastle - but it is not too late for him to sign a two-year deal."</span></div>
