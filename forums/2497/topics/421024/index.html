              <p><img style="width: 280px; height: 390px;" src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01235/main_1235196a.jpg" alt="DREAM DEBUT ... Darren Bent"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">DARREN BENT instantly repaid a huge chunk of his £18million transfer fee by downing title contenders Manchester City.</h2>
              <p>Bent struck the only goal on a dream debut as Villa grabbed a vital victory that eases the pressure at the bottom of the table.</p>
              <p>Hitman Bent slotted home from close range on 18 minutes after Joe Hart could only parry Ashley Young's curler straight into his path.</p>
              <p>Bent said: "It was a difficult game, they always say the first goal is the most important and we got it early. "It's been a hard week but I'm going to enjoy it tonight."</p>
              <p>Villa boss Gerard Houllier added: "I am pleased for Darren because it's his first goal for us and his first game.</p>
              <p>"The finish was that of a natural-born finisher, something you cannot teach somebody.</p>
              <p>"That is what he is here for, to score goals. "Roberto Mancini told me before the game that I'd signed a great player and that is a tremendous start for him.</p>
              <p>"I thought the boy handled the pressure very well. He had settled in well during the week, knows a lot of players from the international scene, and I felt he was ready to play."</p>
              <p>Defeat for City left them three points behind neighbours Manchester United at the top, who have two games in hand. And assistant boss Brian Kidd admitted only United themselves can throw away their strong position.</p>
              <p>He said: "United are going very well. They are undefeated. I always thought it was United's title to lose many weeks ago. "But this is only a blip. It is already history and we will put it behind us. "We didn't show enough urgency in the first half but in the second period it was a different story.</p>
              <p>"We put Villa under severe pressure and full credit to them for a great defensive performance. "Our aim at the beginning of this season was to get in the top four. "We lost at Everton and responded very well and I'm sure we will respond in the right fashion in the coming games."</p>
              <p>City looked the more threatening early on although Kolo Toure could not keep down his volley from the edge of the box. But after 18 minutes Villa Park erupted when Bent scored with his first chance for his new club.</p>
              <p>Gabby Agbonlahor found Young in space down the inside left channel and his curling effort was parried aside by Hart. But Bent was first to react to the rebound and slotted it underneath the keeper.</p>
              <p>City retaliated and Brad Friedel produced a fine save to tip Vincent Kompany's header over the bar from an Aleksandar Kolarov corner.</p>
              <p>Former Villa star Gareth Barry went close to bringing City level after 37 minutes when his glancing header slid past the far post from Jerome Boateng's threatening ball into the box.</p>
              <p>Hart then made back-to-back saves to keep out long-distance shots from Young and Stewart Downing. City continued to press and James Collins blocked a shot from Edin Dzeko after he had cut inside following good play by David Silva.</p>
              <p>Dzeko got on the end of a corner from Kolarov but could not keep his header down. Roberto Mancini made his first change after 57 minutes with Adam Johnson replacing Barry who was jeered by the home fans as he left the pitch.</p>
              <p>Collins again did well to block a drive from Carlos Tevez. But Friedel knew little about keeping out a powerful low drive from Boateng which bounced off him away to safety.</p>
              <p>Dzeko looped a header past the post and the pressure increased from the visitors. Hart was called into action to turn a dipping drive from Young for a corner.</p>
              <p>Kolarov had a 20-yard attempt deflected wide, before Carlos Cuellar threw his body in front of a drive from Dzeko to typify Villa's fighting spirit.</p>
              <p>Downing cut in from the right but his rising effort did not extend Hart, then Collins produced another superb block to keep out Tevez's volley.</p>
              <p>Villa got a huge let-off on 84 minutes when Nigel de Jong's 25-yarder was diverted on to a post by a grounded Ciaran Clark.</p>
              <p>Then Dzeko headed wide from close range when it seemed easier to score.</p>

              <p>Seems that joe hart is quite prone to errors these days. Buckling under the pressure? He looked really solid in the first half of the season......so he's just human after all. Bad news for england too.</p>

That's why I said selling Given would be a big mistake... Lucky they didn't and Given also seem to think his chance could be coming...

              <p>I thought Abrighton was kinda crap for some parts of the match. Some crosses are good, some crosses are bad. Losing poession sometimes as well.</p>
              <p>It surprised me that Abonlahor had such a great dip in form. He is no longer that instrumental to Villa's sucess :/ He just seemed like some average player in the Villa teamsheet.</p>
