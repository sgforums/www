              <h3>FURIOUS Yossi Benayoun today accuses Rafa Benitez of making his life a misery at Liverpool. In an exclusive interview, the Israeli midfielder blasts Benitez for forcing him out of Anfield and insists the Spaniard:</h3>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>*NEVER treated him with any respect.</strong> </p>
              <p><strong>*DESTROYED his confidence.</strong> </p>
              <p><strong>*TRIED to break him.</strong> </p>
              <p><strong>*ORDERED him to find another club.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Manager Benitez left Liverpool at the end of the season after a disastrous trophyless campaign which ended with the Reds failing to even qualify for the Champions League. </p>
              <p>And Benayoun, 30, reveals the truth about his volatile relationship with the man who has now replaced Jose Mourinho as boss of European Cup winners Inter Milan. </p>
              <p>"Everyone asks me why I left Liverpool," said Benayoun, who joined Premier League champions Chelsea in a £5.5million move earlier this month. </p>
              <p>"There is only one reason - Rafa Benitez. </p>
              <p>"I agreed to join Chelsea before Roy Hodgson was appointed Liverpool's new manager. </p>
              <p>"It's a dream for me such a fantastic club have given me this opportunity. </p>
              <p>"But I want Liverpool fans to know the truth and for them to know I made up my mind to leave a long time ago because of Benitez. </p>
              <p>"He never treated me with the respect I deserved. If I played well, I never felt he gave me credit. </p>
              <p>"When I scored, I still expected to be out of the team the next game. </p>
              <p>"And when the fans wanted me to play, Benitez told me he couldn't understand why."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4><strong>Booed</strong></h4>
              <p>Benayoun, who scored nine goals for Liverpool last season, added: "There are many examples of him treating me badly. </p>
              <p>"On two occasions early last season, against Fulham and Lyon, the fans booed when I was subbed. </p>
              <p>"They thought I was playing well but Benitez told me he was surprised the fans booed because I was not good enough. </p>
              <p>"It was as if the fans' reaction worked against me. The situation got worse afterwards. </p>
              <p>"He told me I was a better player as a substitute instead of starting in the team. </p>
              <p>"Then, when we played Birmingham after I hadn't started a game for a month, he didn't tell me I was starting until two hours before the game. </p>
              <p>"He tried to destroy my confidence. You can't treat a player like this and expect him to be happy. </p>
              <p>"I felt so unhappy but, out of respect to the club, I never spoke out. The players and the people at the top of the club knew how I felt. </p>
              <p>"I don't want to speak on behalf of other players at Liverpool, but people know what happened to Albert Riera and Xabi Alonso. </p>
              <p>"It was the same for me. Benitez tried to break me like he broke Riera. </p>
              <p>"I was sure he wanted me to attack him in the Press during the season so he could turn the fans against me, so I kept quiet. </p>
              <p>"I felt he was waiting for me to make a mistake so he could use it against me.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <h4><strong></strong></h4>
              <h4><strong></strong></h4>
              <h4><strong></strong></h4>
              <h4><strong>Deal</strong></h4>
              <p>"On the day before the final game of last season at Hull, Benitez pulled me to one side after training and said: 'You will not be in the squad for this game. Thank you for your three years of service, now you can call your agent to do a deal with another club.' </p>
              <p>"That's when Chelsea made an offer and the deal was done before Benitez left." </p>
              <p>But Benayoun admits his relationship with Benitez deteriorated on the FIRST day of last season. </p>
              <p>"The previous season when we finished second in the Premier League, I was happy with my performance in the final months but I was not sure if the manager thought I was a good player," he added. </p>
              <p>"I told Benitez I would go if he wanted, but he told me I was important and he would give me a new contract, which I signed. </p>
              <p>"But then for the first game of the new season I wasn't in the team again. The manager ignored me when I wanted to know why. </p>
              <p>"After he ignored me for a long time, he needed me for Europe when Ryan Babel was suspended. </p>
              <p>"I said: 'You need me now and I will always do my best.' </p>
              <p>"I scored against Atletico Madrid in the Europa League semi-final. It was a really emotional moment for me. The fans could see what it meant to me. </p>
              <p>"I couldn't say at the time, but I knew this was my last season at Liverpool and I wanted a special end. </p>
              <p>"I thought: 'No matter how the manager is treating me, I'm showing the fans the club is in my heart.' </p>
              <p>"I knew I had to get away from Benitez. A lot of people at Liverpool treated me well and asked me to stay, but I could not turn down such a massive club as Chelsea. </p>
              <p>"I could not risk waiting to see if Benitez kept his job. </p>
              <p>"The club said they understood why I was unhappy and promised they'd let me leave in the summer if an offer came while Benitez was manager.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4><strong>Privilege</strong></h4>
              <p>"It is good for Liverpool Benitez has gone, but it was too late for me. </p>
              <p>"I know everyone working there will be a lot happier and I believe Roy Hodgson is a good choice. </p>
              <p>"It was a privilege for me to play for such a great club in front of great fans. I thought I would be staying for a lot longer." </p>
              <p>Benayoun realises he faces as tough a time forcing his way into the Chelsea side.</p>
              <p>He said: "I'm not stupid. I know Chelsea have many great players and it will be hard to play in the team every week. </p>
              <p>"But what's important for me is I know I will be treated with respect. </p>
              <p>"Carlo Ancelotti is a fantastic manager and he knows how to treat players."</p>

              <p>It is sad that small ben that saved Ah Ben for so many occasion actually hate him so much.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben's method of player management will not be good for Liverpool in the long run.</p>
              <p>It is a good thing for him that he finally leaves.</p>
              <p>As for Ah Roy, it is still early to judge him and give him some time to show his results.</p>
              <p>No one is in his sane mind will take over Liverpool now, considering that the players are leaving and no new players can be bought.</p>
              <p>So, my expectation is more of Liverpool to play united as a team 1st.</p>

              <p>I dun think Ah Ben can survive half a season in Inter given his track record of fielding certain of his pets and deploying players out of position.</p>
              <p>The inter fans and players are more vocal about their opinions and views.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben will get the more crap than Jose as he will not be able to focus with so much outside stress.</p>
              <p>He will be forced to resign if Inter start to lose 5 games under his charge.</p>
              <p>He will then understand how Liverpool was kind with him.</p>
