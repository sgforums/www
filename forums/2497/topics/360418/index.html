              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez says </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span><strong> will struggle to compete with </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span><strong> and their others rivals at the top of the league until they have a new stadium.</strong></p>
              <p>The project to build a new 60,000-seat stadium in Stanley Park has stalled because the American owners, Tom Hicks and George Gillett, have been unable to borrow the £350million required to construct it owing to the credit crunch.</p>
              <p>Benitez, whose team play at bottom-club <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/west-bromwich-albion.html"><span style="color: #003580;">West Bromwich Albion</span></a> knowing second place is the best they can hope for after United clinched the title yesterday, believes Liverpool will have to work extra hard to make up for the financial gap between themselves and the other teams in the so-called 'big four'.</p>
              <p>The manager said: 'On an economic level we cannot fight with the other big teams, at least for now, in particular because of the stadium. Old Trafford has 76,000 seats, the Emirates has 60,000, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span></a> can count on Abramovich. Until we have a new stadium, we will not be able to compete economically. In the meantime we'll have to do things very well to be competitive.'</p>
              <p>Benitez believes that his decision to sign a new five-year contract will give him and the club the opportunity to build on their improvement this season and challenge on a regular basis for the Premier League and other trophies.</p>
              <p>He added: 'Believing in your manager, in his project, allows you more success as you can see when you look at Arsene Wenger at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal</span></a> and Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United.</p>
              <p>'However, there are new owners arriving in England and they don't necessarily understand that tradition so well. For them, clubs are just businesses and the risk is that there is less stability. The role of the manager can give you that stability.</p>
              <p>'We have to first consolidate the level we have reached. We have a better squad now, a structure that works better with very capable people that have a huge amount of desire. That will bear fruit in the future. I have a five-year contract with the power to take decisions, to do things the way I think they should be done, which guarantees, despite the difficulty of the English league, the possibility to be in the race for titles.'</p>
              <p>Despite pushing United almost all the way this season, Benitez warns the Premier League is the toughest competition to win. He said: 'As for winning things, it's very easy to say that Liverpool have to win things but very complicated to do it, because the best teams in the world and the richest, as we've seen this year in the Champions League, are here in England.</p>
              <p>'Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal are among the four best European teams, which shows that the Premier League is the toughest league to win. But we have an obligation to be among them and to be a team always looking to win things.'</p>

              <h1>Rafa Benitez: Liverpool Must Compensate For Manchester United's Money</h1>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Having earlier opted not to congratulate rival Sir Alex Ferguson, Liverpool gaffer Rafael Benitez has continued to list the differences between newly-crowned Premier League champions Manchester United, and his own Reds.</strong><br><br>Finance is one crucial difference, the Spaniard feels, as he admits that he needs to spend wisely in the summer in order to assemble a squad which can challenge United's in its depth and quality of personnel.<br><br>"Clearly [Man Utd] have spent big, big <a id="KonaLink0" class="kLink" style="position: static; text-decoration: underline! important;" href="http://www.goal.com/en/news/9/england/2009/05/18/1272280/rafa-benitez-liverpool-must-compensate-for-manchester"><span style="color: #0464d1;"><span class="kLink" style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; color: #0464d1! important; font-family: Verdana,Arial; position: relative;">money</span></span></a> on top class players, so they can make mistakes and change players and you don't notice," Benitez told <em><span style="color: #333332;">Sky Sports</span></em>.<br><br>"If you remember when we played them they had [Ryan] Giggs, [Paul] Scholes and [Dimitar] Berbatov on the bench; we can't do this.<br><br>"We are talking about [Steven] Gerrard and [Fernando] Torres all the time, and they can play any combination, it doesn't matter.<br><br>"They can also hold 35,000 more fans in their stadium, and that means <a id="KonaLink1" class="kLink" style="position: static; text-decoration: underline! important;" href="http://www.goal.com/en/news/9/england/2009/05/18/1272280/rafa-benitez-liverpool-must-compensate-for-manchester"><span style="color: #0464d1;"><span class="kLink" style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; color: #0464d1! important; font-family: Verdana,Arial; position: relative;">more </span><span class="kLink" style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; color: #0464d1! important; font-family: Verdana,Arial; position: relative;">money</span></span></a>, which is a big difference."<br><br>Rafa then turned his attention to the near future, and his summer strategy.<br><br>"On the pitch we are reducing the gap which is very important," he said. "Now, we have to do the right things during the summer.<br><br>"It is impossible to keep this level if you don't have a big squad. You notice the difference at the end of the season.<br><br>"[We] need to bring in new players, with everybody working hard and trying to be positive, because there is a big difference every year in terms of money."</p>

              <p>well, to be neutral, If U are the big boss, and this manager comes out and say, he lost the war,  cause other companies got bigger $$ to spend, they got better offices, so what do you say after supporting him and giving him $$ to burn for the past few seasons?</p>
              <p>to be fair, Liverpool is a great team, they showed with the 4-1 win over MU. And till date, I give them credit for that, cause it just ass-kick MU to greater heights. But after a few good runs, Rafa suddenly wishes for all other teams to beat MU so that they can win the title.</p>
              <p>Why the battle cry now when the war is almost over? We all know the league is 38 games, surely, any fool can see Liverpool did not perform earlier, if they have turn that 11 draws into wins, MU and rest won't even see their backlights. So what's fault is that? Instead of taking it on his chest, this Rafa comes out and condemn the rest, and that's irked me. No self-reflection, nothing.</p>
              <p>And when the war is over, dust settled. a simple "well-done" would have mend things but he turn around and say harsh words. Just imagine, if SAF were to do it, what would happen? Before U even condemn MU, just know that Lpool were not that good either..</p>
              <p>just my two cents.</p>
