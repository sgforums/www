              <p><strong>Mark Hughes is on Aston Villa's radar as a potential successor to Gerard Houllier, according to <em>ESPNsoccernet</em> sources.</strong></p>
              <p>Hughes' contract expires on July 1, as the former Manchester City boss took on the Fulham post on a year-long rolling deal.</p>
              <p>The Welshman was linked to the Villa vacancy when Martin O'Neill unexpectedly quit on the eve of the 2010-11 season, but by that time Hughes had accepted the Fulham job, and the vacancy eventually went to Houllier. With Houllier expected to leave Villa shortly after ill-health curtailed what had been an unsuccessful spell at Villa Park, Hughes will again be high on owner Randy Lerner's wish-list.</p>
              <p>The source said: "Mark Hughes will be wanted by Villa, that seems a certainty.</p>
              <p>"A big club like Villa would also certainly be a huge temptation for Mark, and it it was offered to him, it would be no surprise if he accepted it."</p>
              <p>It would be a big shock to Fulham if Hughes walked out for another club, with the Cottagers trying to tempt Hughes to sign a new more long-term contract and a Europa League campaign beckoning.</p>

              <h2>VILLA FAN CHIEF BACKS HUGHES</h2>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>The chairman of the Aston Villa Supporters Trust believes it is "almost certain" that manager Gerard Houllier will leave the club this summer, and has called for Fulham's Mark Hughes to replace him. </strong></p>
              <p>Villa are currently assessing Houllier's position after he was forced to miss the last month of the season because of heart problems - the second time the Frenchman has suffered from such ill health in his career.</p>
              <p>It has been reported that Villa are awaiting test results to determine if the 63-year-old is fit to return to work, but Peter Warrilow, head of AVST, believes the conclusion is inevitable.</p>
              <p>He said: "It's almost certainly the case that Gerard Houllier will depart, and his departure would be in the best interests of both his health and Aston Villa.</p>
              <p>"It's all very unsettling at a time when what we really need is some stability."</p>
              <p>The Villa fans have not been convinced by Houllier ever since his appointment last September, and a flirtation with the relegation zone earlier this year did not help that.</p>
              <p>He still polarises opinion despite the club eventually finishing ninth, but Warrilow does not believe the club will use Houllier's health as an excuse to remove him from his post.</p>
              <p>"My knowledge of (owner) Randy Lerner and (chief executive) Paul Faulkner doesn't suggest that they would be that cynical," he said.</p>
              <p>"But if you look at Aston Villa's long-term future then it would be quite wrong to go into the new season having committed a lot of money to a man to go out and rebuild the squad, then two months into the season find themselves in the same situation of his health being in decline and him not being able to continue.</p>
              <p>"In terms of practicality, his departure would be sensible so that Villa can secure a new manager for the longer-term future."</p>
              <p>Should Houllier leave, Warrilow feels the club could find the perfect replacement in the shape of Hughes.</p>
              <p>The former Wales and Manchester City manager enjoyed an excellent first season with Fulham and has an option to extend his deal at Craven Cottage.</p>
              <p>Warrilow, though, feels Villa should strike before he exercises that option.</p>
              <p>"Everyone knows that Mark Hughes has the opportunity to break his contract today at Fulham," he said.</p>
              <p>"I think Mark Hughes would be an ideal choice.</p>
              <p>"He has demonstrated that he can work well with a limited squad and I think that he won't have the personnel issues that Gerard Houllier seems to have had where he's fallen out with people and we've had expensive players on the books who weren't available for selection for one reason or another.</p>
              <p>"I think Hughes would come in and he'd sort those kinds of issues out."</p>
              <p> </p>

              <div>Hughes was able to leave Craven Cottage as he has a clause in his contract which meant he could walk out of the club this month.</div>
              <div>.</div>
              <p>"Fulham Football Club can confirm that Mark Hughes has provided notice, under the terms of his contract, to leave the club at the end of June," the club said in a statement.</p>
              <p>"After discussions with Mark the club has agreed to accept this notice."</p>
              <p>Despite being heavily linked with Villa, the Welshman insists he has neither been approached or approached any other club.</p>
              <p>Hughes said: "I hope the supporters and all those connected with the club will understand I wish to move on to further my experiences.</p>
              <p>"I would also like to take this opportunity to clarify that neither myself nor my representative have approached or have been approached by another club.</p>
              <p>"This decision to leave Fulham has not been influenced by any outside party."</p>
              <p>The 47-year-old guided the Whites to an eighth-place finish in his first season at Craven Cottage, and the club has secured a spot in the Europa League via their position in the Fair Play table.</p>
              <p>His tenure at Manchester City came to an end after the team recorded too many draws under the Welshman, and he drew 16 and won just 14 of his 43 matches in charge last season.</p>
              <p>He has also been linked with the vacant position at <a href="/football/chelsea/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chelsea</span></span></a>.</p>

              <p>Sparky quit Mohamed Fayed's club a day after Gerard Houllier had stepped down as Aston Villa boss. But Villa insist he is not in the running for their job.</p>
              <p>A Fulham insider told SunSport: "On Wednesday evening there was a fully negotiated two-year contract with a substantial pay rise just needing to be checked over by lawyers and to be signed by Mark Hughes.</p>
              <p>"Yet less than a day later it's all over and he's resigned. </p>
              <p>"But if a manager can't give commitment or loyalty to the chairman then it's best they move on now and not in August with a new season looming. </p>
              <p>"There's already been a huge amount of interest from other coaches to take over."</p>
              <p>Hughes insists his decision to leave after less than a year has nothing to do with chasing a new job at Villa.</p>
              <p>He said last night: "I would like to take this opportunity to clarify that neither myself nor my representative have approached or have been approached by another club. </p>
              <p>"This decision to leave Fulham has not been influenced by any outside party."</p>
              <p>Sources close to Hughes claim a new deal was still some way off after two months of talks - but that the main reason he has gone is a massive breakdown over transfer funds.</p>
              <p>Hughes was growing frustrated with what he felt was Fulham's sluggish response to his demands for more firepower and the ongoing pursuit of £10m Espanyol striker Pablo Osvaldo.</p>
              <p>The source said: "Hughes had spent hardly any money since taking over. </p>
              <p>He sensed much dithering over moves to buy new players and simply decided enough was enough and resigned."</p>
              <p>Hughes' contract had an escape clause which kicked in on June 1 allowing him to join another club or be sacked with no compensation.</p>
              <p>Fulham chairman Fayed must now choose a new boss with Martin O'Neill, Steve McClaren and Alan Curbishley among the early contenders.</p>

              <p>Martin Jol has 2 brothers.</p>
              <p>One's nickname is called Cock a short version of his full name.</p>
              <p>And the other brother's name is Dick.</p>
              <p>I read it somewhere... lol.</p>

              <p>Martin Jol don't understand why his brothers' names are hilarious. What’s so funny about that? It's stupid.</p>
              <p>Jol demonstrated his flimsy grasp on English humour in saying, "Yes, my brother’s called Cock. What’s so funny about that? It's stupid. Cock is just a nickname - a short version of his name. I mean, what's so funny about that? It's his name and my other brother's name is Dick."</p>
