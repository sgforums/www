            <div class='col-md body'>Keane commits to Spurs<br><br>Robbie Keane has been rewarded for the most prolific season of his career with a new five-year contract at Tottenham Hotspur.<br><br>The Republic of Ireland international scored 22 times for the North London club as they battled on four fronts, eventually clinching a place in next season's Uefa Cup after finishing fifth in the Premiership.<br><br>Spurs have already signalled their ambition for next season by recruiting Welsh prodigy Gareth Bale from Southampton, and now Keane has committed himself to Martin Jol's ongoing project at White Hart Lane.<br><br>"I have felt really settled and happy at Spurs and that is probably one of the reasons I have played the best football of my career here," Keane told the club's official website.<br><br>"It is an exciting time to be at the club and I am looking forward to even better seasons ahead."<br><br>Keane made his 200th appearance for the club on the final day of a season in which he struck up a deeply promising partnership with Dimitar Berbatov.<br><br>Spurs are believed to be preparing a new contract for the Bulgarian star, and chairman Daniel Levy is pleased that the club have already managed to secure Keane to a new long-term deal.<br><br>"Robbie has been an influential part of our club for five years and this further commitment, on the part of both him and the club, is a recognition of that," said Levy.<br><br>"He is an individual who is loyal and professional and we are delighted he will be with us long term.<br><br>"The key to retaining top players, who want to compete for the club at the highest level, is to agree long-term contracts.<br><br>"We have now done so with several of our existing squad players, extending the contracts of players such as Aaron Lennon, Michael Dawson and Tom Huddlestone, as well as having contracted newer players on long contracts, such as Dimitar Berbatov and Didier Zokora."<br></div>
