              <p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Frank Lampard’s long-term future at Chelsea is in jeopardy after he was dropped and appeared to storm away from the Stamford Bridge pitch.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The 33-year-old midfielder was an unused substitute in Chelsea’s 4-1 win against Swansea and seemed to react badly as new manager Andre Villas-Boas begins to make his mark on the club’s old guard. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Lampard disappeared into the dressing room before the end of the second half after teenager Josh McEachran was preferred to replace Raul Meireles in the 83rd minute.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The victory could have marked Lampard’s 350th Premier League appearance for the club he joined in 2001 in an £11million move from West Ham. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But this is the latest chapter in what already looks like becoming a sorry season for him. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Lampard has now been left on the bench for three of the past four Chelsea games — and he was taken off at half-time in the other, the 3-1 defeat at Manchester United. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Villas-Boas insisted Lampard should not be concerned but it is starting to look like the beginning of the end for the midfielder at the club. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The manager said: ‘I don’t know but this is nothing to speculate about. They are team players and the players want the team to perform, and Frank is like that. He is a fantastic player, a magnificent player and soon he will be back to the team, sooner than you expect.</span></p>

              </span></p><p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'The decisions today were mainly based on the fact we played 120 minutes (in the Carling Cup) on Wednesday and these players were fresh, apart from John Terry and Petr Cech. In a tight calendar like we have, it’s important to have squad rotation.’</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But Lampard losing his place in the Chelsea pecking order will add to his disappointment at international level, with England manager Fabio Capello apparently deciding the midfielder will no longer be a regular starter. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The Italian prefers Scott Parker and Jack Wilshere, among others, when they are fit and the Chelsea stalwart came off the bench late on in the European Championship qualifying win against Bulgaria earlier this month. </span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The pace and direction of Lampard’s passing has been questioned by some observers, while Villas-Boas has looked to increase the speed of his team’s play. </span></strong></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The Chelsea manager has been searching for a way to get Fernando Torres back to his best and employed new signing Juan Mata behind the £50m striker.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>It worked initially as Torres scored Chelsea’s impressive first goal. But the Spaniard spoiled his day by getting sent off for an ugly tackle on Swansea’s Mark Gower.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Lampard is fourth in Chelsea’s all-time appearance list, behind Ron Harris, Peter Bonetti and John Hollins. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>While he has not started the most recent Carling Cup and Champions League games, until Saturday he had started all but one of their League games since last December.</span></p>
