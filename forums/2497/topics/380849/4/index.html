              <p>If you look at the video, drogba jumped and still ended up going
              forward despite the kick. Shows the amount of force and momentum he
              had. If he had hit evans with that, evans would have been hurt
              quite badly.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure if evans kicking to protect himself is allowed in
              the game, but it was definitely keeping dragba from crashing into

              <p>True that, and kicking out? The natural reaction for self protection should be just rising his foot to anticipate the impact, not kicking out... You see... there's a fine line between self protection and intent to hurt...</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>Well, on the kicking out... Like i said earlier, instant or split second reaction to a great force coming towards him at a fast speed... Lifting up a foot or an arm alone wouldn't make any difference if it doesn't come with force of its own...</p>
              <p>You try an example by yourself... If you lift up one of your feet in the air without putting any strength or force into it and someone or something hit or push you from the front with great force... And what will most likely happen is, you will fall back... But in this case, in mid air, and both going in opposite direction instead of just standing position, so the force will be much greater... Your feet together with their joint area (knee) would probably bend and be crush between the force and your own body weight wouldn't it?</p>
              <p>But if force is apply onto your own leg... Then the chances of your leg being bent or hurt upon inpact is much lesser if you meet it with an equal or considerable among of your own force... The thing here is do you still feel it was a 50/50 chance upon seeing the picture? Or was Drogba not late into the challenge?</p>
              <p>The referee wouldn't made that call immediately if it was a 50/50... or even a 55/45 really... It was that obvious...</p>

              You are wrong. <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              What Drogba was trying to do was a run through<br>
              <br>
              My coach taught and instructed me to do it on the field before. Its all these small little things that got my team to win the championships for since I don't know when. Yes its dirty and malicious but when your coach tells you to, you can't say no (if you still want to play)
              <br>
              <br>
              I am not saying if Drogba is right or wrong, I am just going to explain the technique. Basically there are many techniques that people who watch soccer don't know about (Even some players who are in the first line up will never learn them because their coaches don't know about it). Not talking about the fancy flick flak moves or such but small little things like this that coaches teach their forwards or defenders and etc. For eg. The downward swerving free kick has been around since ages. It was done by a man who branded football "the beautiful game". I knew of a player whom I used to play with that trained with the coach everyday trying to get the ball to swerve downwards even before Ronaldo went to Man Utd. Its just that people don't mention it or that people don't do it as obviously as Ronaldo thats why its not popularised. (which is very important)
              <br>
              <br>
              Okay so basically the run through. ( I will explain it briefly because such techniques are useful because other people do not know about them)
              <br>
              <br>
              If you watch Chelsea, Drogba does this a whole lot
              <br>
              <br>
              When your opponent goes up in the air and if you can't reach the ball or have no intention to reach the ball in the air,  run into the opponents path. Plant yourself at the position where he will land. You can jump slightly to make the move not obvious.
              <br>
              <br>
              Aim?
              <br>
              <br>
              1. When the opponent is in the air and he sees that he cannot land, he will lose his balance. Likely chance that he will miss the header
              2. If you obstruct his landing, it is very lightly that he will land wrongly, get injured, get himself out of the game, have a weaker opponent you have to face and force his team to waste a substitution. 
              3. Jumping for the ball is pointless because as a forward you can't possibly head the ball into the goal from there. Do the run through. Hope he fumbles, get the ball and you are 1 on 1 with the keeper. If he manages to hit the ball clean you obstruct his landing and there is a good chance he gets injured.
              <br>
              <br>
              There are more specifics to this technique. What situation to use it. Who to use it against. When to use it. Where to jump against. Where to contact the opponent and etc. But of course that wont be shared.

              <p>Dun make things out to be more serious than it actually is... Drogba isn't coming at evans at a top speed as if he intend to spear him in his stomach that it is going to break a couple of his ribs... if anything it looked more like a follow through... Yes... My take was it was a 50-50 before evans got to the ball... The ball is falling onto the path of drogba's run in the direction to goal and evans came across to head it away... therefore you cannot make the argument drogba is charging at evans... watch the vid again</p>
              <p>I'm sure if rooney was on the receiving end, you wouldn't have rationalize the challenge(assuming coming from carvalho)</p>

              <p><br>Yes, it is that serious if not guarded against carefully... Simple things can become complicated... Who would have thought that one simple tackle from SWP on Dean Ashton just in training could well end his playing career?</p>
              <p>Just that you know, Drogba had taken more than 10 steps to build up speed and force for what you describe as a "follow through"... Thats 10 steps was more than enough to gain sufficient built up force together with his heavy body weight for a serious body blow to a static person in mid air... And like I have said earlier, had he hit him in the lower half, Evans would probably flip over and land head first direction...</p>
              <p>No one is saying Drogba intended on purpose to spear him in his stomach and break a couple of his ribs... Just like Swp probably didn't wish that on Ashton... But its just what it looks like and probably could be... Cos Drogba was late into the challenge, Evans already headed the ball when Drogba's feets were only just about to take off from the ground, thats how late it was... If not block, Drogba would naturally rise much later and would probably met lightweight Evans in the lower or middle part of his body where his ribs would be... With such great force, anything can happen. What could have been a serious injury to Evans body was prevented by his own quick actions... That why the referee gave the foul call on Drogba without hesitation immediately...</p>
              <p>The ball was indeed falling onto the path of drogba's run, Brown as well if you look at it from just a straight line... But as we can all see from your clip, it was a forward moving object with momentum on it, therefore it was also moving further away from him by the milli-second and closer towards Evans wasn't it? (Do watch the clip again to justify this)</p>
              <p>But since after reviewing the clip again and again and you can still say its a 50/50... Then there is very little else needed to be said... Just leave it for the others to view it and come to their own conclusion... Evans jumped and headed the ball well away and Drogba's feets have yet to leave the ground... Thats no 50/50 to me regardless who the player was... And if this was between Rooney and Carvalho in this incident as you said... I can tell you honestly what I will do... I will have just kept my mouth shut and my opinion to myself... Cos I wouldn't even try to defend the un-defensible... A 50/50 is more like both jumping at the same time or both heads are together in the air reaching for the ball... Not one in this case in my opinion... But like everyone else here, you are entitle to yours though...</p>
