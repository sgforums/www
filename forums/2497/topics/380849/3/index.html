              <p><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Wayne Rooney</strong></span><strong> will join up with the England squad at their Hertfordshire base tomorrow having been warned by the Football Association as to his future conduct after being caught mouthing "12 men" into a television camera after </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span><strong>'s 1-0 defeat to </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span><strong> on Sunday.</strong></p>
              <p>The United striker and his team-mates were from the turf furious that the hosts' winning goal had been allowed to stand, with <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/sir-alex-ferguson"><span style="color: #005689;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></a> subsequently citing doubts over the validity of the award of Frank Lampard's decisive free-kick and pointing to an apparent foul by Didier Drogba on Wes Brown in the goalmouth as the ball veered in towards the six-yard box. Rooney's protest prompted a booking in the immediate aftermath of the goal, with his fury just as evident as he departed the pitch.</p>
              <p>The incident had prompted comparisons with Drogba's reaction to elimination from last season's Champions League by Barcelona at the semi-final stage though, where the Ivorian had sworn into a camera with Uefa considering his manic behaviour to have been threatening to the Norwegian official, Rooney's was one of muttered disgust. His comment, with its perceived criticism of the referee, Martin Atkinson, was broadcast live, prompting the FA to warn a player who has been booked only three times this season to date.</p>
              <p>Ferguson, in contrast, will not face any sanction despite claiming Atkinson's positioning at the game's only goal as "absolutely ridiculous". "It was a bad one. That goal should not have been allowed. You lose faith in the refereeing sometimes," said the United manager, who is already on an improper conduct charge after insisting Alan Wiley was "unfit" after a 2-2 draw with Sunderland. As Ferguson did not question the referee's integrity or imply any bias, no action will be taken by the FA.</p>

              <p>I guess people fail to see that Evans was already up in the air and his eyes was also looking up towards the ball... Why Drogba was booked i guess there are 2 possibilities... First he was not going to get the ball and yet he jumped in... Had Evans not rise his foot, he would be the one hurt... In other words, Drogba went in late for the challenge.</p>
              <p>The second i guess was... The way Drogba fall to the ground and half rolling in the box was like stimulation and he was playing for a penalty...</p>
              <p>Evans didn't get booked I guess was because the ball was his in the first place... Drogba wouldn't have make it and yet went in... Evans would probably come out very much worst had he not rise his foot for self protection...</p>

              <p><br>Precisely, if we watch the replay again carefully, Drogba wasn't going to reach it and yet he went in... In other words, he was never going to get the ball but only the player... So that was already a foul commited... Had Evans not rise his foot to block the on coming Drogba, he would have ended up heading the ball and then felt the full force of big Drogba smashing into him while he was in mid air and after losing his body momentum... Clearly the referee saw it straightway what Drogba was doing as he rise his hand immediately for a foul challenged by Drogba... Drogba only have himself to blame for going in that fashion... He could have seriously hurt Evans from that attempt...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>This isn't just like any usual aerial challenged here... It was a late aerial challenged to be more precise... Bigger and tougher defenders like Terry Butcher, Pallister, Ledley King have suffered serious injuries, back injuries, leg injuries due to such late challengers...</p>
              <p>The thing here is... if 2 players or even 3 going up at the same time, the force would be almost the same... So there are no questions about it there. But if one is already up and about to descend and another is just rushing and ascending towards him with full force... He doesn't need to be sticking a leg out or swinging his arms cos the full force of the body mass would be damaging enough and if he is unfortunate and gets hit in the rib by an onrushing elbow or arm... He could have also sustain a broken rib with that kind of impact... Thanks for the clip... It clearly illustrate what I am trying to say... We have seen this kind of late challenged before with the defender coming out worse... In most cases, the defender would be hit while in mid air with such a force that he lands head first from the impact to the middle of his body.</p>

              <p><br>Instant reaction my friend, instant reaction to danger... I understand it look bad from some angles but it was never a 50/50 chance... Even from the clip we can see Evans heading the ball well earlier and Drogba was still a leg length apart... So its definitely not a 50/50 ball... Evens was already up in the air heading the ball and Drogba was just about to take off from the ground... Is that still a 50/50?</p>
              <p>The outcome like I said earlier, Had Evans not rise his foot to protect himself, Evans would head the ball away and after losing momentum in mid air, he gets smash by the onrushing Drogba... And we all know how damaging that could be from someone the size of Drogba in full force...</p>

              <p>You can see Drogba is still grounded while Evans has already headed the ball away... There was no need for Drogba to go in like that... That why the instant reaction from the referee...</p>
              <p>I am not trying the defend the un-defensible... or just because he happens to be a United player... I am just saying it as i see it... Here Drogba was the active player not Evans... Evans was the passive one... Thats why the referee made the call immediately upon the challenged...</p>

              <p>True that, and kicking out? The natural reaction for self protection should be just rising his foot to anticipate the impact, not kicking out... You see... there's a fine line between self protection and intent to hurt...</p>

              <p>No a fan of either side, but just some comments.</p>
              <p>If you look at the video, drogba jumped and still ended up going forward despite the kick. Shows the amount of force and momentum he had. If he had hit evans with that, evans would have been hurt quite badly.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure if evans kicking to protect himself is allowed in the game, but it was definitely keeping dragba from crashing into him.</p>
