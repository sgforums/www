              <h2>Sky Sport Italia are reporting that a problem with the Frenchman's teeth may see the move fall through.</h2>
              <p>Milan face the very real possibility of sending Ahly Cissokho back to
              Porto and scrapping the move for him following a problem which has
              emerged regarding his teeth, according to <em>Sky Sport Italia.<br></em><br>The
              Rossoneri were due to announce the conclusion of the deal for the
              stopper on Tuesday, but club doctor Jean-Pierre Meersseman has
              requested a further medical after what should have been his final
              examination revealed new concerns over the player's teeth.<br><br>The
              report suggests Cissokoho will have another medical at Milan Lab later
              this afternoon and it is here where a final decision will be made as to
              whether he joins the club or not. <br><br>Vice president Adriano
              Galliani is expected to be present at the medical and an official
              announcement is expected to arrive within the next few hours.
              Cissokho's entourage are also in Milan and they are concerned.<br><br>Massimo
              Ambrosini's agent was set to meet Galliani today over the midfielder's
              future, but that move has slipped following the Cissokho drama.</p>

              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Aly Cissokho's proposed move to AC Milan has collapsed after the Rossoneri failed to meet Porto's demands. </strong></p>
              <p>The French full-back had appeared to be all set to
              join the Rossoneri, and had even claimed to have signed a pre-contract
              agreement with the Serie A giants.</p>
              <p>The move had been delayed over
              fears regarding dental problems revealed during a medical, but that
              issue was resolved after the player underwent further tests.</p>
              <p>A £12.7million deal was widely touted, with the formalities expected to be pushed through without any hindrances.</p>
              <p>However, Milan now claim that the move has stalled due to financial differences with Porto.</p>
              <p>The
              Italian outfit are believed to have requested to have the deal altered
              to incorporate an initial loan switch, with the view to a permanent
              agreement being struck in the future.</p>
              <p>That has fallen through, though, as Cissokho's current employers are demanding too much money.</p>
              <p>"Our
              doctors found some problems with his teeth which cause muscular
              trouble, which he has and which could deteriorate," Milan general
              manager Adriano Galliani told Sky Italia.</p>
              <p>"So I made a proposal
              to Porto to make it a loan with a option to buy and no longer a
              permanent deal. We'll have him with us and treat him next season and if
              the player is all right we'll buy him in a year's time.</p>
              <p>"Porto
              accepted the idea of a loan but not the cost and we are negotiating. If
              Porto don't accept our figure, we'll pull out. At the moment it's more
              No than Yes."</p>

              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Aly Cissokho's agent remains 'very confident' the full-back will still complete his proposed move from Porto to AC Milan. </strong></p>
              <p>The Frenchman looked poised to seal a summer switch to
              the Serie A giants only for the transfer to collapse after dental
              problems emerged during a medical.</p>
              <p>Milan, who initially agreed a
              fee thought to be in the region of £12.6million, were keen to
              renegotiate the terms after discovering the issue.</p>
              <p>But it was
              suggested Porto were reluctant to lower the price or sanction a loan
              deal, sparking claims that Cissokho would remain in Portugal.</p>
              <p>However,
              amid rumours that a figure of £8.5m has now been accepted, Cissokho's
              representative, Roger Boli, is optimistic a transfer is on the horizon.</p>
              <p>"Only
              a couple of details are missing, but I am very confident. The biggest
              obstacle was the deal between the two clubs," Boli told <em>L'Equipe</em>.</p>

              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Aly Cissokho's transfer from Porto to AC Milan could be back on according to the player's agent Roger Boli. </strong></p>
              <p>The 21-year-old was set to be unveiled as a Rossoneri
              player last week but the deal collapsed after the defender failed a
              medical.</p>
              <p>Milan doctors discovered a problem with the Frenchman's
              teeth which they feared could affect his posture in the future and the
              transfer was called off.</p>
              <p>However Milan officials stated that a
              failure to come to a financial agreement with Porto was the real reason
              why the transfer fell through.</p>
              <p>Upon hearing the news of the
              medical the Italian giants were keen to take the full-back on an
              initial one-year loan with a view to buy at the end of the spell,
              something that the Portuguese champions rejected.</p>
              <h4>Negotiations</h4>
              <p>But Boli insists that the move could finally be completed after Porto reportedly lowered their asking price.</p>
              <p>"The two clubs are once again in negotiations," he told <em>Renascenca</em>. "They are trying to find a solution, I cannot say which, that pleases all parties.</p>
              <p>"I
              do not know when the negotiations will be finalised. But the deal is
              still possible, I do not know if it will be a loan or a transfer."</p>

              <h1>Aly Cissokho Slams Milan: There Is Nothing Wrong With My Teeth!</h1>
              <h2>The Porto full-back is angry with the Rossoneri over his collapsed move to San Siro</h2>
              <p>Porto left back Aly Cissokho has blasted Milan over his failed move to
              San Siro, claiming there is nothing wrong with his teeth, and that the
              Rossoneri called off the move due to monetary reasons.<br><br>Milan
              announced that they had signed the Frenchman last month, but then the
              transfer collapsed after the Italians claimed that they had found a
              problem with Cissokho’s teeth during his medical.<br><br>“I am fine and have no problem with my teeth, they are as perfect as always,” Cissokho roared in La Gazzetta dello Sport.<br><br>“I have never had a problem like this, just as I have never had muscular problems in recent years.<br><br>“I
              don’t know why Milan are saying these things, and I don’t like it. I
              only found out some time after the medical. I went to Senegal for 10
              days and when I returned from <span class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;"><span style="color: #0464d1;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #0464d1 ! important; font-family: Verdana,Arial; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">holiday</span></span></span> they told me there was a problem.<br><br>“I
              did two medicals – one for Milan and one for the Italian Federation –
              and nobody told me there was anything wrong. It’s just an excuse to
              stop the transfer.<br><br>“Now I am tired of this situation. I hear
              from one side that I’m going to Milan, then I’m staying at Porto, then
              leaving to go somewhere else. I want an answer.<br><br>“The real problem is not my teeth. In this whole affair the issue is money.”<br><br>Cissokho’s
              remarks are certain to annoy Milan fans, many of whom are becoming
              increasingly frustrated by the transfer movements of the club’s
              management. <br><br>There are now reports that Cissokho could instead move to Lyon as a replacement for the Juventus-bound Fabio Grosso.</p>
