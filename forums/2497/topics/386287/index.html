              <h1>Spanish Inquisition: La Liga Team Of The Season</h1>
              <h2>With
              the league calendar in Spain now taking a mid-season break, Goal.com’s
              KS Leong offers his La Liga team of the season so far.</h2>
              
              <h4></h4>
              </div>
              <div id="article_detail_block"></div>
              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword">
              </span></p><p class="NormalWeb" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong>Formation: 3-1-3-3</strong></p>
              <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Goalkeeper</span></strong></p>
              <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong>Dudu Aouate (Mallorca)</strong> – Spain’s two high profile goalkeepers, Iker Casillas and Victor Valdes
              may be leading the race for the Zamora Trophy, but with a number of
              big-game defenders infront of them, it’s little wonder. Aouate, on the
              other hand, has had to single-handedly rescue his Mallorca side on
              several occasions with a hatful of superb saves. The Israeli has
              conceded just three goals in seven home games and he is one of the main
              reasons why the Balearic Islanders have found themselves all the way up
              in fifth place in the standings at present. <span> </span></p>
              <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/62140_hp.jpg" border="0" alt="" align="bottom"></span></p>
              <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Defence</span></strong></p>
              <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong>Sergio Ramos (Real Madrid) –</strong> Touted as Paolo Maldini’s heir, the Merengues right-back has enjoyed a
              resurgence this season after a tumultuous past couple of years where he
              suffered from inconsistency and a dip in form. Now, having rediscovered
              his confidence under Manuel Pellegrini,
              he looks sharper in defense and much more threatening in attack,
              whether it’s down the right wing or infront of the opposition goal from
              set-pieces.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></strong></p>
              <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong>Carles Puyol (Barcelona)</strong> – The Blaugrana captain remains the bedrock of the team’s unstoppable
              rise. Much of the focus has been on Gerard Pique and his scoring
              exploits, but it’s the veteran Puyol who constantly holds Barca’s
              backline together with his remarkable reading of the game and brave
              last-ditch tackles. The highlight of his season thus far is undoubtedly
              his man-of-the-match performance against Real Madrid.</p>
              <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/58541_hp.jpg" border="0" alt="" align="bottom"></p>
              <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong>Joan Capdevila (Villarreal)</strong> – As the Yellow Submarine struggled in the early stages of the season,
              the experienced left-back appears to have found a second wind towards
              the tail-end of his career. He has made some vital assists and scored
              some crucial goals and in what is a hugely pivotal season for
              Capdevila, he will be hoping to carry his sterling form through to the
              end of the campaign into next summer for the 2010 World Cup.</p>
              <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Midfield</span></strong></p>
              <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong>Lassana Diarra (Real Madrid) </strong>–
              The Frenchman’s value and importance to Los Blancos cannot be stressed
              nearly enough. His work rate as a defensive midfielder is second to
              none and this season, with the help of Xabi Alonso forming part of the
              double pivot, Lass has been given the freedom to exhibit the attacking
              side of his game. And to further highlight his incredible versatility,
              he frequently roams forward or drifts out wide to the right to act as
              an overlapping full-back.<span>  </span></p>
              <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/41735_hp.jpg" border="0" alt="" align="bottom"></span></p>
              <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong>Jesus Navas (Sevilla) </strong><span>–
              The tricky winger has long caught the attention of La Liga followers
              with his dazzling displays but this season, he has taken his form up
              another notch. This season, he has demonstrated a characteristic that
              has been missing from his game in previous years: consistency. Also
              having overcome his homesickness and anxiety problems, he capped off
              his year with a fully deserved maiden call-up to the Spanish national
              team in November.</span></p>
              <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong>Xavi (Barcelona)</strong> – The engine that continually keeps Barcelona ticking over, the
              midfield pocket dynamite has not missed a beat this term. With five
              assists in the league, his simple yet majestic ball control and
              possession-retention abilities continue to amaze while his outrageous
              passing range remains a sight to behold. If Puyol is the glue that
              holds Barca’s backline together, then Xavi is the heart and soul of the
              Blaugrana’s now world famous irresistible attack.</p>
              <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong>Diego Costa (Real Valladolid)</strong> – The 21-year-old Brazilian is poised for big things. Still fairly
              unheard of and playing in an unfancied team like Valladolid, the
              attacking midfielder has quietly been one of the star performers in the
              league in the first 15 rounds of the season. Defenders have found it
              difficult to cope with his pace and trickery, whether he’s playing
              through the middle or out wide. He has provided three assists but even
              more impressive, he has six goals to his name.</p>
              <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/60538_hp.jpg" border="0" alt="" align="bottom"></p>
              <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Attack</span></strong></p>
              <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong>Lionel Messi (Barcelona) </strong>–
              The more accolades Messi wins, the more criticism he seems to face.
              Such is football. But in spite of all that, he has not allowed personal
              success or denigration affect his game as he continues to lead Barca’s
              attack with elegance and efficiency. If anything, he is improving on
              his minor shortcomings, such as his predatory instincts infront of goal
              and his all-round game. On top of his nine goals, he has also made five
              assists.</p>
              <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong>David Villa (Valencia) –</strong> ‘El Guaje’ is showing no signs of suffering from the ill-effects of the
              transfer wild goose chase during the summer. After coming so close to
              leaving the Mestalla for Real Madrid and then for Barcelona, the
              28-year-old has won back the hearts of the Che faithful as he currently
              leads the Pichichi race with 12 goals after 15 rounds. Villa continues
              to stake his claim as one of the best strikers in world football at
              present. <span> </span></p>
              <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo (Real Madrid)</strong> – The most expensive football on the planet has already proved his
              doubters wrong with a superlative performance for his new club so far
              this campaign. His attacking influence in this newly-assembled Real
              Madrid side is unquestionable and his absence was painfully felt during
              his month-long lay-off because of an ankle injury. In eight La Liga
              appearances, he has scored in six of them, tallying seven goals in
              total.</p>
