              <p><strong>SINGAPORE - It is almost certain that Singaporeans will, after all, get 
              their dose of World Cup football on television from June 11 to July 11.</strong><br> <br> After months of uncertainty for fans, MediaCorp understands an 
              announcement by joint bidders SingTel and StarHub on broadcast details 
              is just around the corner.<br> <br> Both companies had been locked in a stalemate with Fifa's Asia sales 
              representatives, Football Media Services (FMS), since December over 
              broadcast rights fees.<br> <br> The standoff had gripped the country and last Friday, Acting Minister 
              for Information, Communications and the Arts Lui Tuck Yew told 
              Parliament the telcos had recently submitted a new offer to FMS and he 
              was hopeful of "a sensible outcome".<br> <br> The initial bid was believed to be in the region of $40 million and the 
              latest offer has apparently struck a chord with FMS, breaking the 
              deadlock.<br> <br> "The latest negotiation with FMS has progressed very well and we can 
              expect an announcement by the two pay-TV operators before the end of the
               month," a highly-placed source told MediaCorp.<br> <br> When contacted, both SingTel and StarHub declined to comment. Neither 
              would the head of the Fifa representative's Asia headquarters in 
              Singapore, Mr Michael Francombe.<br> <br> News of an imminent announcement was greeted with cheer by fans and pub 
              operators.<br> <br> Mr Dennis Foo, chief executive officer of St James Holdings which 
              operates the St James Power Station at Harbour Front and outlets at 
              Clarke Quay and Orchard Road, said he never doubted a deal could be 
              reached. "(The World Cup) is once every four years and the climax of 
              football. Without the live broadcasts, our business will be 50 per cent 
              down; with it, we will be 50 per cent up," he said.<br> <br> Indeed, it is good news for food and beverage outlets with the World Cup
               broadcasts encouraging people to go out more and stay out longer during
               the tournament, said Mr Michael Ma, founder of the Indochine chain of 
              pubs and restaurants. "The impact will be huge for us."<br> <br> With less than three months before the kick-off, analysts said there is 
              still time for SingTel and StarHub to round up enough sponsorship to 
              offset the cost of beaming the World Cup live.<br> <br> "They would have lined up their sponsors way ahead of time," said Mr 
              Kenneth Liew, senior analyst at IDC Asia/Pacific.<br> <br> "So if they have struck a deal, sponsors can be activated and this can 
              help bring down their cost."<br> <br> Gartner Research's director of carrier operations and strategies, Mr 
              King Yew Tong, added that the telcos' joint bid will not prevent 
              competition for subscribers. "This is an opportunity to increase their 
              base," he said.<br> <br> "They could offer a discount for the World Cup by packaging it with 
              their current offerings on their respective networks to attract new 
              subscribers and even try to retain existing ones," said Mr King.<br> <br> For sports buff Kelvin Tan, it is all about the telcos' reciprocation to
               fans who have endured yearly increases in fees to watch football, 
              especially the English Premiership, on pay-TV. He hopes the World Cup 
              rates will be reasonable.<br> <br> Said the 30-year-old banker: "They owe it to us, their loyal football 
              fans, to give us the World Cup at an affordable price after all the 
              hikes."<br> <br> Source: <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Sports/EDC100316-0000068/World-Cup-deal-by-the-end-of-the-month">http://www.todayonline.com/Sports/ED...d-of-the-month</a></p>
