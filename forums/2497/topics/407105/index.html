              <p>Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp has always admired Dutch striker Huntelaar, 26, while the Serie A side fancy Mexican ace Dos Santos, 21, after his excellent displays at the World Cup this summer.</p>

              <p class="small bold">The Brazilian forward was linked with a switch to London after Spurs boss Harry Redknapp confirmed his interest in the player last month.</p>
              <p class="small bold">But Fabiano, 29, says he has no intention of leaving the Primera Division side and instead plans on extending his stay in Spain.</p>
              <p class="small bold">He said: "My future is with Seville. I have never thought about leaving this year.</p>
              <p class="small bold">"I have had some offers, but I never considered leaving.</p>
              <p class="small bold">"I have a good relationship with the club, I'm not worried. With calm, I will renew my contract with Seville."</p>

              <p>Belarus midfielder Hleb, 29, spent three years with the Gunners before joining Barcelona in 2008.</p>
              <p>But he has been a bit part player at the Nou Camp, making just 19 appearances, and spent last season on loan at German side Stuttgart.</p>
              <p>However, Spurs chief Redknapp is apparently ready to hand the playmaker a lifeline by offering him a return to the Premier League.</p>
              <p>Hleb revealed: "I have a contract with Barcelona and I must respect that, but I heard about the link with Tottenham Hotspur and I think they are a great club.</p>
              <p>"I appreciate their interest and we will see what happens in the future."</p>
              <p>Hleb's agent, Oliver Mintzlaff, added: "The situation with Alex will be sorted in the coming weeks.</p>
              <p>"Tottenham Hotspur are interested in signing Alex as well as Sevilla.</p>
              <p>"The player has a contract for two more years with Barcelona and the club would have to be willing to sell him, but both of these clubs interest him."</p>

              <p>Sparky convinced Wales striker Bellamy to sign for Manchester City ahead of the North Londoners 18 months ago.</p>
              <p>And now the new Fulham manager is poised to nab Bellamy despite Harry Redknapp's public desire to land him.</p>
              <p>Bellamy, 31, insists he wants to stay and fight for his place at City.</p>
              <p>But the striker fears he could be squeezed out by Roberto Mancini's big-money buys and Hughes will do his best to convince Bellamy that his future lies elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Hughes is also bidding to hijack Hull keeper Boaz Myhill's £1.5million move to West Brom.</p>
              <p>He has matched Baggies' bid for the Wales stopper, 27, because he still fears losing Mark Schwarzer to Arsenal.</p>

              <p><strong>TOTTENHAM are ready to offer £6million for Portuguese striker Yannick Djalo.</strong></p>
              <p>Two Spurs directors held talks with Djalo, 24, and his model wife Luciana Abreu in a Lisbon hotel yesterday.</p>
              <p>A source close to the player confirmed: "Everything indicates that the transfer to Spurs can take shape in the coming days."</p>
              <p>Djalo has been at Sporting Lisbon all his career but wants to play in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>He hit just six goals in 26 games last season but is fast and technically gifted. He is seen as the ideal replacement for Robbie Keane if he joins Aston Villa.</p>
              <p>Djalo's agent Lionel da Silva said: "Tottenham looks like the most likely destination."</p>

              <p>i guess reason is simple, Spurs have too much midfielders already especially in the positions of CM and AM..</p>
              <p>as u can see, they have so many midfielders naming Bentley,  Huddlestone, Jenas, Kranjcar, Lennon, Modric, O'Hara, Palacios(these are the most popular names we football fans shld know) and many more..</p>
              <p>and just the reserves alone, they have Bostock, Fredericks, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/147337/sandro"><span style="color: #000000;">Sandro</span></a>, Livermore, Parrett, Rose, Townsend etc..</p>
              <p>if I were him, I will also leave Spurs..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>furthermore, there is this new 23-man rule rite?</p>
              <p>if Spurs swap him for Huntelaar, he is also not English leh.. haha..</p>

              <p><br>yea, i agreed too..</p>
              <p>they need quality backup for their defence especially Central Backs..</p>
              <p>as players like Woodgate &amp; King are very prone to long-term injuries..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>furthermore wif UCL this season,</p>
              <p>more games will be played, they certainly need to beef up its defence..</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">TOTTENHAM have offloaded midfielder Adel Taarabt to QPR for £1million.</h2>
              <p>The Moroccan starlet spent last season on loan at Loftus Road and has now signed a three-year deal with Neil Warncock's side.</p>
              <p>Tarrabt said: "I'm delighted to be back.</p>
              <p>"I had options to go elsewhere but what Neil said to me was very positive and I've made the decision to join QPR.</p>
              <p>"Over the past year, everyone at the club has been great to me — it feels like home here.</p>
              <p>"This is the first time in my life that I've had ambition. Before, I'd play football just to enjoy it but now I've come to an age where I have to step up.</p>
              <p>"I don't think there's a manager that wants me as much as Neil does.</p>
              <p>"I feel the club will move forward under him - I've come here because next year I want to play in the Premier League."</p>
              <p>Taarabt, 21, was hailed as the "new Zinedine Zidane" when he arrived at White Hart Lane from Lens for £3million in 2007.</p>
              <p>But he made just nine appearances for Spurs - who are taking a significant loss on the midfielder Harry Redknapp once described as "frightening".</p>
              <p>QPR boss Warnock said: "I'm glad to have finally tied Adel up.</p>
              <p>"He's a player who has got a unique talent and I'm hoping that we can channel it for the good of QPR.</p>
              <p>"I've been very patient and I've probably worn him down over the past few months!</p>
              <p>"We're delighted to have him on board and he gives us that little bit of quality that you need.</p>
              <p>"I think it's good for him that he knows where he's going to be permanently now.</p>
              <p>"Long-term, his target is still to play at the very top level and I'm hoping that we can help him to achieve that."</p>

              <p>Assistant boss Joe Jordan denied Crouch - wanted by former club Liverpool plus Everton - and Keane, who spent four months on loan at Celtic last term, would be sold to fund a bid for Nice ace Loic Remy.</p>

              <p>The Nice striker emerged as one of the hottest properties in France after scoring 14 goals in 34 games for the Ligue 1 club last season.</p>
              <p>His form saw Liverpool, Stoke, Sunderland and West Ham all express an interest in signing him, but the 23-year-old appears to be most keen on a move to White Hart Lane.</p>
              <p>He said: "A move to Spurs would be interesting.</p>
              <p>"Stoke is not the move that I want. Nice is in real need of money and it should be adaptable with the price to help sell me.</p>
              <p>"I want to go. I really hope there can be an agreement before the end of the month."</p>
              <p>But Remy revealed at least one other side have confirmed an interesting in signing him.</p>
              <p>He added: "I am interested in England, but there is also a club in France in for me."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">WILLIAM GALLAS wants to land a two-year deal - which could rule out a move to Spurs.</h2>
              <p>The French defender was released by Arsenal, who were only prepared to offer him a further season at the Emirates.</p>
              <p>And it is unlikely that at 33 Spurs would come up with any more.</p>
              <p>Gallas also has a firm two-year deal on offer from Turkish side Fenerbahce while PSG in France are willing to take him home to see out his career.</p>
              <p>White Hart Lane boss Harry Redknapp has admitted he is looking for a centre-half - but insists he is nowhere near to completing a deal.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">WEST HAM have won the war to keep their captain Scott Parker.</h2>
              <p>The Hammers' midfield star, 29, is set to sign a new four-year deal a week today to finally see off interest from Tottenham and Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Boss Avram Grant has already cemented deals for Manchester City striker Felipe Caicedo and Ajax winger Miralem Sulejmani.</p>
              <p>And the Hammers will further test French side Nice's resolve with a firm £12million bid for striker Loic Remy.</p>
              <p>But Parker's decision to stay put is an enormous boost for Hammers fans, who have twice voted him their player of the year.</p>
              <p>He still had three years left on his current deal but agreed a one-year extension with a rise to around £70,000 a week.</p>
              <p>Ecuadorian Caicedo is arriving on a season-long loan with an option to buy for £2.5m, while Serb attacker Sulejmani is also expected to agree a loan deal for the season with an option to buy at £7m.</p>
              <p>Hammers have added over £10m to their £60m a year wage bill - despite being £90m in the red.</p>
              <p>But midfielder Radoslav Kovac could join Stoke to bring in £1m and save £1.5m a year on wages - while Alessandro Diamanti and Jonathan Spector are also expected to be let go.</p>

              <p>Despite having played for the Gunners and fellow London rivals Chelsea, Redknapp believes Spurs fans would forgive Gallas if he became a star this season.</p>
              <p>With uncertainty surrounding the long-term fitness of Ledley King and Jonathan Woodgate unlikely to be named in the final 25-man Premier League squad, Tottenham need defensive cover.</p>
              <p>They have already opened talks with Gallas' advisors and Redknapp said: "I like him. I think he's a great free transfer.</p>
              <p>"It is a possibility. He has not been greedy at all. His people have rung up and we spoke about it."</p>
              <p>The Arsenal connection does not bother Redknapp one bit. He added: "You can go on for ever about that. We put too much importance on that all the time.</p>
              <p>"If he comes in and plays rubbish, the crowd will slaughter him. If he comes in and plays great, they will love him. That is football."</p>
              <p>Redknapp also believes the time has come for Spurs to finish above their North London neighbours and show they mean business in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>He added: "We were behind Arsenal by miles for years and years but now we've got a chance to really push them and get above them.</p>
              <p>"That would be great for Spurs fans and it's possible. We could be close to the title. You need players who have won things.</p>
              <p>"Getting them is not easy but we will see what happens."</p>

              <p>Redknapp's Spurs were held to a goalless draw by a Joe Hart-inspired Manchester City in Saturday's Premier League curtain-raiser.</p>
              <p>And that prompted the White Hart Lane chief to finally dive in with an offer for the coveted 23-year-old Nice ace.</p>
              <p>Cash Stoke failed to lure Remy to the Britannia when he snubbed their offer following a tour of the club's training ground.</p>
              <p>West Ham and Liverpool are also keen on the player but unwilling to splash the cash, while French champions Marseille could make a move.</p>
              <p>But the striker, who scored the winner in Nice's 2-1 victory over Lorient on Saturday, has indicated his desire to join Spurs.</p>

              <p><strong>Pavlyuchenko, 28, has been growing increasingly frustrated with life on the bench at Spurs. But he may have to accept a cut on his £60,000-a-week wages to join the French champions.</strong></p>

              <p>But he has started just nine league games since his £13.8m move to White Hart Lane from Spartak Moscow two years ago.</p>

              <p>The Tottenham boss wanted to wait until after the second leg of his side's Champions League play-off against Young Boys before making an offer for the 23-year-old striker.</p>
              <p>Spurs lost 3-2 in the first leg in Berne and their dreams of Champions League riches are in the balance.</p>
              <p>Redknapp will have money to spend should Spurs progress and Remy is his choice to shake up his frontline.</p>
              <p>Ironically, Marseille turned to Remy after Roman Pavluychenko became cup-tied in the Champions League.</p>
              <p>After snubbing Stoke and West Ham, Remy's agent claimed he had agreed terms with Liverpool - but new Anfield chief Roy Hodgson poured cold water on a deal.</p>

              <p>The Ligue 1 champions are believed to have agreed a fee of around £12million with Nice and the 23-year-old looks set to finalise the move within the next few days.</p>
              <p>Remy said: "I am very pleased and proud that Marseille are interested in me.</p>
              <p>"After waiting so long for a transfer, everything has accelerated very quickly — I'm surprised.</p>
              <p>"I need time to think but I am committed to moving."</p>

              <p>The free-agent former Gunners captain will have a medical and is due to sign a one-year deal over the weekend.</p>
              <p>A pal said: "Apart from a few details, everything has been agreed and William will have a medical on Friday."</p>
              <p>Gallas met Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp last night and asked for a two-year contract but only a year was on offer.</p>
              <p>Redknapp was desperate to boost his defence due to the long-standing injury problems of Ledley King and Jonathan Woodgate.</p>
              <p>Gallas, 33, will not be registered in time to face Stoke tomorrow or play in the crucial second leg of the Champions League qualifier against Young Boys with Spurs 3-2 down.</p>
              <p>He was let go by Arsenal after refusing to accept a one-year deal that included a pay cut.</p>
              <p>The ex-Chelsea centre-half suffered abuse from fans every time he went back to Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>But that will be nothing compared to the reception he will get at the Emirates on November 21.</p>

              <p>Boss Redknapp has created a storm by bringing William Gallas to White Hart Lane.</p>
              <p>The defender, pictured yesterday after meeting his new team-mates, quit bitter rivals Arsenal in a contract row.</p>
              <p>But Redknapp said: "What has Gallas done? He is a footballer. It's not the Yorkshire Ripper I am signing is it?</p>
              <p>"It's all cobblers, I have signed on a free transfer a very good player who wanted to play for Tottenham. He's got the bottle to come here.</p>
              <p>"He's not done it for money. I think he could have earned a lot more money if he stayed at Arsenal, he could have gone to a couple of Italian clubs."</p>
              <p>Spurs fans screamed abuse at former defender Sol Campbell whenever he returned to play after joining Arsenal and even strung up an effigy of him outside the main gates.</p>
              <p>Gallas has come in because Redknapp has just two fit central defenders - Michael Dawson and Sebastien Bassong - with fresh doubt over Jonathan Woodgate's career.</p>
              <p>The former England defender, 30, has played one game in a year.</p>
              <p>And Redknapp admitted: "He is to have a final op on his groin then we will have to make a decision."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">HARRY REDKNAPP is convinced William Gallas can win over the Tottenham fans with a couple of crunching tackles - and a few goals.</h2>
              <p>The Spurs boss sparked ferocious controversy at White Hart Lane yesterday after signing out-of-contract defender Gallas.</p>
              <p>Frenchman Gallas, 33, quit bitter rivals Arsenal at the end of last season.</p>
              <p>But Redknapp said: "Listen if you play rubbish, he's going to get slaughtered.</p>
              <p>"But if he comes here, throws himself into a few tackles, wins headers, scores from set-plays, we keep clean-sheets and Tottenham are winning . . . then we'll see."</p>
              <p>Spurs fans are already resenting the arrival of Gallas and are planning to slaughter him with verbal abuse.</p>
              <p>But Redknapp believes the player can handle anything thrown at him.</p>
              <p>He added: "Stick? When I was manager at West Ham in 1993 we signed David Speedie on loan and he was getting dog's abuse when we were trying to get promoted. There were two minutes to go and if we didn't win this game we were not going up.</p>
              <p>"He'd been getting abuse all afternoon from West Ham fans. But Speedie dived in, nearly got his head kicked off and in the last minute of the game he put the ball in the back of the net.</p>
              <p>"You thought, how about that after all he's gone through he's gone and got us promoted.</p>
              <p>"William is not the first to move between the clubs and won't be the last. George Graham played for Arsenal's Double-winning team, managed them and then came to manage Tottenham.</p>
              <p>"Pat Jennings played for Tottenham and Arsenal. Alan Ball played for Southampton and Portsmouth.</p>
              <p>"Mick Channon played for Southampton and Portsmouth. You want to see hatred, that is hatred between two clubs.</p>
              <p>"You need people like William in the dressing room. Big clubs have people who run the dressing room. We don't have too many like him, we're a quiet team."</p>
              <p>Gallas arrives at White Hart Lane with a reputation for causing trouble and was stripped of the captaincy at the Emirates for criticising his team-mates.</p>
              <p>Yet Redknapp is sure any flashes of temperament - like when he sat on the Birmingham pitch in February 2008 and refused all handshakes at the end of a 2-2 draw - are down to passion.</p>
              <p>Redknapp said: "A manager can either do things or sit back and do nothing. The easy thing was for me to think 'Oh some fans might not like him, I am not going to do that and we will keep plodding along.'</p>
              <p>"I don't think he is a bad influence. I remember the time at Birmingham, he could have just walked off the pitch and asked the lads 'Where are we going tonight . . . Tramps or somewhere?'</p>
              <p>"But he didn't, did he? He was distraught at the result, he cares. You need people like him.</p>
              <p>"If he has got a temperament, then he just gets the hump with players who are not as professional as he is."</p>
              <p>Another criticism of the Gallas signing is his age. But Redknapp added: "People can talk about kids all they want but at Man United the other night it was Scholes giving the ball to Giggs and Giggs volleying the ball into the net.</p>
              <p>"Man United have men like Ferdinand, Vidic, Neville. Chelsea have John Terry, Drogba, Lampard - all these people are winners - they are men.</p>
              <p>"At Inter Milan Jose Mourinho won the Champions League with men. They were all experienced players, not kids - look at the age of his team.</p>
              <p>"They have gone out to win, they want to win. I am not saying you need all older players but you need people who know how to win matches and you only gain experience with age."</p>
              <p>Gunners boss Arsene Wenger insists Redknapp has landed a good player and hopes Gallas will be remembered as an Arsenal great - not a trouble-maker.</p>
              <p>He said: "I believe William is a great player and Spurs have got a winner.</p>
              <p>"We made him an offer to stay but you have to understand that at some stage you reach an agreement or not and then you have to move somewhere else."</p>
              <p>Redknapp has built a reputation as an excellent man-manager and has taken on some of the games most controversial figures like Paolo Di Canio at West Ham.</p>
              <p>The Italian striker infamously shoved ref Paul Alcock to the ground in 1998 while at Sheffield Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Redknapp added: "When I took on Paolo, people said I was walking a tightrope without a safety net, that he would cost me my job.</p>
              <p>"Paolo became one of the greatest all-time players for West Ham. That is the chance you take.</p>
              <p>"If people don't like it, what can you do, they pay their money it is up to them. William is playing for Tottenham you have to get behind him.</p>
              <p>"He will come here with a point to prove. If he wanted an easy life he could have gone to Greece or somewhere for big money and said 'That's OK, I've done all that'.</p>
              <p>"But he's put himself under massive pressure. You've got to give the man some credit.</p>
              <p>"Patrick Vieira wanted to come here last year. I said 'Are you sure Patrick?' He said 'Yeah, I want to prove I'm a footballer.'</p>
              <p>"Vieira was a legend at Arsenal, more of a legend than William.</p>
              <p>"He was in the team that were winning everything, the Invincibles, they didn't lose a game. And he wanted to come here - and would have come here!</p>
              <p>"I have spoken to a few other people about William, some who have played with him, and everyone came back with the same view as I have got.</p>
              <p>"William is a nice guy and a real big talent. Signing him is a no- brainer as far as I'm concerned."</p>

              <p>The South Africa winger, who is out of contract in the summer, has been linked with a swap deal with Tottenham's Peter Crouch.</p>
              <p>Round responded: "The manager (David Moyes) has said all along he wants Steven to stay.</p>
              <p>"He is under contract and as far as we are concerned he will be an Everton player this season.</p>
              <p>"There is no truth in the speculation. Steven has been a terrific player for us and is a terrific asset."</p>
