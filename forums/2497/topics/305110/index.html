However, the chances of Boro winger Stewart Downing joining Woodgate at White Hart Lane are now said to be "close to zero" by sources close to the deal.<br><br>Instead Spurs will redouble their efforts to sign Juventus midfielder Tiago for Â£9m - a deal they expect to go through when Mohamed Sissoko completes his move from Liverpool to Juve later today. The one sticking point remains Tiago's wages, with the midfielder wanting Â£50,000-a-week and Spurs offering Â£10,000-a-week less.<br><br>Elsewhere, Spurs believe they are close to agreeing a pre-contract deal with Hutton that would see the Rangers defender move to London during the summer, and they are also hopeful that the Hertha Berlin left-sided wingback Gilberto will be moving to London in a Â£2.5m deal after he fell out with his club over his demands for a new contract.<br><br>"[The move] is all in the hands of Dieter Hoeness [Berlin's general manager]," Gilberto told Bild. "If he says I may go, I am away." Hoeness, meanwhile, sounded just as trenchant: "Our entire recruitment budget for the winter break would be taken up meeting Gilberto's demands," he said.<br><br></div>
