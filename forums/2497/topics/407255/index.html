              <div class="story-image"><img class="imagecache imagecache-medium" src="http://static3.tribalfootball.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/medium/stories/anelka1_bg_2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250"></div>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> striker <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Nicolas Anelka</span></abbr> has lifted the lid on his <abbr><span class="glossary-term">World Cup</span></abbr> blow-up with France coach Raymond Domenech.</p>
              <p>He was expelled from the French camp after the spat which occurred at
               half-time of the Group A match against Mexico on June 16, with Anelka 
              claiming the argument centred over his positioning on the pitch.</p>
              <p>Anelka recalled to <em>France Soir</em>: "We returned to the dressing room
               and, for five minutes, the players talked. The coach arrived and said 
              to me: 'Damn, Nico, I've told you to stop dropping back and stay up 
              front'.</p>
              <p>"I told him if I stay there, I do not get a touch of the ball, and said:
               'Stop telling me to stay up front. I won't stay up front'.</p>
              <p>"It carried on, but at that moment my head was gone. I wasn't even listening to what he said."</p>
              <p>Domenech's immediate reaction, Anelka claims, was to dismiss him from 
              the squad despite the efforts of captain Patrice Evra to pacify both 
              parties.</p>
              <p>"He said: 'Go, it's fine, leave' and asked one of his assistants to get Dede (Andre-Pierre Gignac) ready," the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> striker continued.</p>
              <p>"I said: 'No problem, deal with your team'.</p>
              <p>"Pat (Evra) and Franck (Ribery) were next to me and they said: 'Stop, 
              Nico, calm down. Let it go, shut up!' Then Pat asked me to put my jersey
               back on and said to the coach that these things happen all the time, 
              that he should not react on a whim and make me leave. Again, the coach 
              didn't listen and made his changes."</p>

              <p>In fairness, i think, based on the revelations by Anelka, he is entirely at fault for this one.</p>
              <p>A player should do as told by the manager. He should voice his opnions during halftime to the manager that he felt he can get more of the ball by dropping back instead of staying upfront. But instead he decide to do as he wish before halftime and go against the manager's game plan.</p>
              <p>Pat and Ribery did the right thing is asking Anelka to shut up but he chooses to listen to his ego instead.</p>
              <p>I am not saying Domenech is a good manager but no matter how bad he is or how much some players dislike him, they have to stick by their manager's gameplans and tactics. If players choose to do as they wish on the field, then what is the purpose of having a manager there?</p>
              <p>From what i can deduce, some French players have too big an ego and the French team needs to be rid of these players and start to build from scratch with players with the right attitude and mindset.</p>

              <p>should always listen to wat the coaches say lah whether right or wrong.</p>
