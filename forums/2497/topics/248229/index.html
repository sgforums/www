            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Jose Mourinho has called for the intense speculation over his future to end as he is keen to continue his 'historic' work with Chelsea.</strong><br><br>After steering his side into the UEFA Champions League semi-finals on Tuesday night, Mourinho appeared to reignite talk of a possible exit by admitting he could be forced to find alternative employment come the end of the season.<br><br>The Portuguese boss has seen his relationship with owner Roman Abramovich come under close scrutiny this season and he was openly frustrated with the club's stance during the January transfer window.<br><br>Barcelona, Real Madrid and Internazionale have all been suggested as possible destinations for the self-styled 'Special One', with a move to the Bernabeu as Fabio Capello's replacement seeming the most likely scenario at present.<br><br>However, Mourinho - who is still hunting an unprecedented quadruple this season - has now attempted to curb talk of a move to Spain by underlining his desire to remain at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>"I don't want my name linked with Madrid or with any other club because I want to stay with Chelsea," Mourinho told the newspaper.<br><br>"I've got a contract until 2010 and I want to carry on."<br><br>Mourinho went on to add that if he did leave Chelsea, he would be keen to return to the Premiership at some point in the future.<br><br>"If I have to leave for some reason or because someone wants me to... that's life in soccer.<br><br>"And if I leave I want to keep coaching next season at another European club.<br><br>"I like English soccer and I'd like to coach another club in the Premiership but not now.<br><br>"I don't imagine leaving Chelsea and going straight to another English club. It would be a very strange situation and I don't want it to happen."<br><br>Having claimed four major trophies in under three seasons, with the possibility of another three to follow in the coming weeks, Mourinho has described his superb work at Stamford Bridge as 'historic'.<br><br>However, the former Porto coach believes that this season could yet prove to be his most memorable as Chelsea remain in contention for the Premiership, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League.<br><br>"I have done work in these three years which could be termed historic, because some of the things we have done can only be described this way," Mourinho added.<br><br>"This season has been the best of all because we have had to overcome some incredible problems.<br><br>"It's been unbelievable what we've suffered because of injury problems this season, and look what we're still managing to do." </span></div>
