              <p>I personally feel Pool's current problems are of their own doing... Where they are today I have to say it's all down to Rafa... Their problems didn't just happen overnight. It was accumulated and built on over the last few seasons.</p>
              <p>Who they purchase...</p>
              <p>How they set up to play...</p>
              <p>Tactics during matches...</p>
              <p>Players selection...</p>
              <p>Players relationship with the manager...</p>
              <p>The amount they squanded on presumably good players but turn bad...</p>
              <p>And also the amount they waste on poor players (namely Johnson)...</p>
              <p>All I feel is down to one man alone... Rafa.</p>
              <p>But the board isn't without fault too cos it was they who continuously gave him the support to mess up the club... And to gave him a 5 yrs contract with ridiculous clause like they will have to pay up within 24 hrs should they sack him... They were asking for it. Cos Rafa, we can say is now in comfort zone... He don't have to worry too much about losing his job now. In fact, the earlier it happens the better it might be for him. Get paid in full for the next 3, 4 yrs job well in advance and he can take a long vacation as well during this time...</p>
              <p>Imagine if Rafa or a family member was sick of the country and wanted to return home... He will just have to make himself get the sack and it's big payday time and a long vacation for him and his family...</p>
              <p>To be honest, what he has done especially this season, he should have been long gone by now but somehow Pool persevere with him... amazing...</p>
