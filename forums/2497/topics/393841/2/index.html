              <h3>Benitez backtracks: It was a penalty</h3>
              <p class="excerpt">Rafael Benitez conceded that the referee was right to
               award Manchester United a penalty during Liverpool's 2-1 league loss.</p>
              <p>Benitez
               has backtracked his earlier statement about Antonio Valencia diving 
              after the winger was adjudged to have been fouled in the box by Javier 
              Mascherano although the initial contact was made outside the box. 
              Mascherano was booked for his troubles.</p>
              <p>But Benitez later admitted to Sky Sports News that it was a penalty.</p>
              <p>"It appears that it was inside so it was a penalty, and Carra was 
              there so it was a yellow card," said Benitez.</p>

              It is a match with above average quality and high intensity, as with all Man Utd v Liverpool matches. Not a classic, but plenty of drama and talking points.
              
              Torres looked like he has lost some motivation in playing for the team, seem to be sending signals that it's time to sell him to a place where he can win trophies regularly? Gerrard look lerthagic as he has always been this season, could be the same reason.
              
              Fletcher and Rooney are the ones in the red devils' camp that have been consistently putting in 100% effort on the pitch this season, and i'm not surprised that fletcher was named man of the match. Rooney looked slightly tired and subdued, and should have done better with a chance in the 2nd half which he placed it wide of the keeper's near post when a placement shot beyond the keeper at the far post seem a better option.
              
              The biggest surprise of the match is Park scoring the winner and playing the role of a 2nd forward supporting rooney. He looked too undersize and constantly losing posession throughout the game, being pushed about by the pool defenders. I must admit i was hoping that Ferguson would replace him with Berbatov before he scored the winner.

              <p>we cant afford to give rafael the sack, but if he really loves the club, and know what's best for us, he should leave. at times, to go through thick and thin together makes relationship better. i appreciate his good intention of wanting to stick as one no matter what.</p>
              <p>but this is not a company, this is not a BGR. it's football, we're fighting a war, we need to stay top 4. if he had left eariler this season, maybe we still can have an excuse that he was the one who wracked our season then leave. but now no, he's still here, and we're still in the toilet bowl with a pile of shit. who to save us now?</p>

              <p>that's the reason why we're being mock at can?</p>
              <p>the past is for us to rmb, and for us to always walk tall but not alone :)</p>
              <p>not for us to keep saying and reminding.. we stay proud of liverpool but not 'hao lian'.</p>
              <p>the ball is round, we can win today and tml, and then lose on the day after. be humble when we win is the key. like what i did when we won 4-1 over at utd's place, i knew my utd's friends werent feeling good at all. but on the other hand, i was on the top of the world :) i dint mention much about that match afterwards, and they knew my intention of not to 'hurt' anyone. and then they too, did the same thing when they won 2-1 days back. although there was abit of 'kpkb' during the game, but i know and understand that they've no ill-intentions at all. a graceful and great rivalry between my friends and i.</p>

              <p>well, i read the stevieG was being played so many different places, and seemingly, he is being "pushed" around. Hence, he lost his platform for performing his best, and that may not be a good talking pt between him and Rafa.</p>
              <p>instead of focusing on the key points like penalty, final results, how about Rafa's formation and the actions he did when Pool was down?</p>
              <p>maybe, some Pool fans can share how they feel when they see Kuryt leaving the game or when they see Benayoun?</p>

              <p>to win u need to score 1st, and right now liverpool are not moving forward enough. out of 5 midfielders, we have 2 who are defensive minded who are not venturing forward. den u have wingers who r not exactly the fastest, n ur fast winger is on the bench more often than not (babel). end up ur offence is only left with torres, gerrard, maxi who is still adapting and the workhorse kuyt. any opponent who manage to man mark and frustrate gerrard and torres thats the end.</p>
              <p>mayb its time for benitez to revert to the standard 4-4-2, playing kuyt and torres upfront. or at least play aquilani more often, at least he is more offensive-minded than lucas and mascherano. desperate times call for desperate measures. perhaps aquilani should b given more playing time now with less than 10 matches remaining and we r lying in 6th.</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Redknapp: Gerrard will be unhappy being
               pushed around by Liverpool boss Benitez</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p>Former <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> midfielder Jamie Redknapp believes <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Steven Gerrard</span></abbr> will be unhappy with the way he was 
              utilised by manager <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rafa Benitez</span></abbr> for the defeat at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Against United he was a peripheral figure for long periods and in the 
              latter stages, as Benitez threw on Alberto Aquilani and Yossi Benayoun 
              in an attempt to salvage a point, he was moved around the pitch.</p>
              <p>That, according to former team-mate and close friend Jamie Redknapp, 
              will not have impressed the England international.</p>
              <p>"Don't get me wrong, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Steven Gerrard</span></abbr> was not at his best again, but he's 
              hardly being given the platform by his manager," Redknapp wrote in the <em>Daily
               Mail</em>.</p>
              <p>"I'm not sure if Stevie played in three, or was it four different 
              positions against United.</p>
              <p>"That's no way to treat your best players. Give him a platform, trust 
              him with the role and watch him play.</p>
              <p>"It's not as if he hasn't proved that before."</p>

              LOL this has to be Liverpool's most talked about season, mainly for the wrong reasons.
              
              Anyway during the ManU liverpool match i can't help but noticed that Benitez looked more relaxed and composed compared to earlier in the season. Maybe he knows that compensation time is near.
