              <p class="article">The Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher expects the Reds to raise their game when they visit Old Trafford on Sunday.</p>
              <p class="article">Rafa Benitez's side finished second in the Premier League last season but are in a scrap for fourth place this time around.</p>
              <p class="article">Liverpool are 15 points adrift of leaders United, who they beat 2-0 this season and 4-1 at Old Trafford in the last campaign.</p>
              <p class="article">And Fletcher, 25, warns that United must be on their guard.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "It would be very dangerous to think this is a poor Liverpool side coming to Old Trafford because they are anything but.</p>
              <p class="article">"It would be a huge mistake to think that Liverpool are not a threat. They maybe haven't had the season we expected after last year but they are still a dangerous side.</p>
              <p class="article">"They are still in the main the same team.</p>
              <p class="article">"We know what they are capable of and pushed us all the way and dished out that defeat here and the one at Anfield this season. They are still fresh in our memories."</p>
              <p class="article">Fletcher added: "Liverpool still have a lot to play for because they are battling for fourth spot. They are capable of beating anyone.</p>
              <p class="article">"We have to learn the lessons from last year's game. The warnings are there.</p>
              <p class="article">"If you are not 100 per cent focused and you make mistakes they will punish you.</p>
              <p class="article">"It is a real surprise to me they haven't been up with us. But they will still be fired up to win at Old Trafford again."</p>

              <p class="article">Fernando Torres hit his second double of the week to fire Liverpool into today's Europa League quarter-final draw. And boss Benitez insists the striker is ready to terrorise United in the Premier League on Sunday.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "Fernando is confident and there is still some match fitness to come so he can still improve. It makes a big difference when Fernando is playing well and scoring goals.</p>
              <p class="article">"He's been working hard with the physios and I'm very pleased with the job they have done. "How fit is he? I'd like to say only 50 per cent but it is clear he's close to his best.</p>
              <p class="article">"Steven Gerrard also played well and when they play like this, the whole team feels more confident."</p>
              <p class="article">Torres followed up his two goals in Monday's 4-1 league win over Portsmouth to steer the 'sinking ship' safely past French side Lille. Gerrard hit an early penalty as Liverpool showed no signs of the unrest winger Alert Riera said was rife at Anfield.</p>
              <p class="article">The Spanish winger has been sent home after his comments ahead of showdown talks on Monday. Benitez added: "The timing of the remarks was not best for the team."  </p>
              <p class="article">Skipper Gerrard said: "Rafa is the manager and <strong>HE</strong> has the right to criticise us at the right time. "But the reaction has been superb, we thoroughly deserved to go through. We need to take this into the United game."</p>

               playing with Rooney in Man Utd attack</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> hero Gary Pallister is 
              disappointed that <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> beat <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fernando Torres</span></abbr> in 2007.</p>
              <p>Torres and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> face United at Old Trafford this Sunday.</p>
              <p>Pallister told the <em>Manchester Evening News</em>: "(Wayne) Rooney and 
              Torres together at United that would have been the most dangerous strike
               partnership you could think of.</p>
              <p>"It really would have been a potent mix. I used to watch Torres when he 
              was with Atletico and with Spain and despite his lean look you could 
              tell he would relish the challenge of the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> style of football. He was made for 
              the English game.</p>
              <p>"It suits him. He likes to put himself about. Nobody is going to bully 
              him. He's robust, quick, mobile and has an eye for goal.</p>
              <p>"Like Rooney he is everything you would look for in a front man."</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez believes striker Fernando Torres is hitting top form at just the right time with a trip to Manchester United looming on Sunday.</strong></p>
              <p>The Spain international's two goals in the 3-0 Europa League victory over Lille took his tally to four in his last two matches, having scored twice in Monday's 4-1 win over Portsmouth.</p>
              <p>Torres now has 17 for the season, of which 15 have come in the Barclays Premier League, from just 27 appearances having missed five weeks after a knee operation.</p>
              <p>Liverpool are on a three-match winning run against their arch-rivals and Benitez believes with Torres looking close to his deadliest best they have every chance of winning at Old Trafford for the second successive year.</p>
              <p>"He is a very good player and a good finisher and you could see against Lille he made the difference," said the Liverpool manager.</p>
              <p>"When the other team were pushing they were a little bit long and he had the space and he can beat anyone running and dribbling - he is very good.</p>
              <p>"When you are not playing well Fernando can sometimes make the difference and when you are playing well you know Fernando, (Steven) Gerrard or the other offensive players will be there."</p>
              <p>Benitez tried to play down the obvious psychological advantage Torres will have over Nemanja Vidic - the Serbian has been sent off on his last three appearances against Liverpool - when the pair meet again on Sunday but will privately hope that continues at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>"When Fernando is fully fit he is a threat for all defenders and can beat anyone," said the Reds boss. "Vidic is a good player with experience so it will be tough for Torres."</p>
              <p>Gerrard is convinced Torres, who celebrates his 26th birthday on Saturday, will get even better. And the England midfielder admits even someone with his experience is lifted by the sight of him firing on all cylinders.</p>
              <p>"There is lot more to come from Fernando in a Liverpool shirt, believe me," said Gerrard. "He had been out a long time so it was only natural that it was going to take him a few games to find his rhythm but he is closing in on that now and it is fantastic for the team.</p>
              <p>"If we can keep him fit and firing, we'll have a really big chance of achieving what we want to. "You could see against Lille that he is looking sharp. The goals will have done him the world of good.</p>
              <p>"He is world class, it's as simple as that. When he is playing like that, it doesn't just give the crowd a lift it lifts us and it causes the players he comes up against to think twice about how they deal with him.</p>
              <p>"He's finding form at just the right time."</p>
              <p>Gerrard was also among the goalscorers in last season's 4-1 victory at Old Trafford, helping break Benitez's four-year duck at the home of their biggest rivals. And despite also beating them 2-0 at Anfield back in October the Reds captain knows United, chasing a record-breaking 20th title to go past Liverpool's tally, will be a difficult prospect.</p>
              <p>"Every time you go to Old Trafford, you expect a tough game but we are going in on the back of two good performances," he told the Liverpool Echo. "This will be a completely different game. They are the league leaders but we will give it a really good go."</p>
              <p>Midfielder Alberto Aquliani, who missed last night's victory through illness, returned to training on Friday but could still be doubtful for Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>The Italy international put in a man-of-the-match performance, scoring his first Liverpool goal, in the 4-1 Premier League victory over Portsmouth on Monday but then was struck down with a virus.</p>
              <p>"Alberto did some light training for us today so hopefully he will be ready for the weekend," assistant manager Sammy Lee told liverpoolfc.tv.</p>
              <p>"We don't know at this moment in time if he will be available but we have still got 72 hours to the match so hopefully he will be ready for us."</p>

              <p><strong>Man Utd  2  -  1  Liverpool</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">PARK JI SUNG'S diving header sent Manchester United back to the top of the table.</h2>
              <p class="article">Liverpool had stunned their arch-rivals by taking the lead through Fernando Torres after just five minutes. But Wayne Rooney drew the Premier League champions level before Park connected with Darren Fletcher's cross to secure three precious points.</p>
              <p class="article">Rafa Benitez's men flew out of the blocks as they looked to dent United's title challenge. And their hopes of closing the gap on fourth-placed Tottenham were boosted when Torres broke the deadlock.</p>
              <p class="article">Michael Carrick gifted the Spaniard possession in midfield and he quickly released Steven Gerrard. The Reds skipper raced forward before feeding Dirk Kuyt on the right, who delivered a pinpoint cross.</p>
              <p class="article">Torres dropped off his marker expertly and his header left Edwin Van der Sar well beaten. But Liverpool's lead did not last long.</p>
              <p class="article">Javier Mascherano tugged Antonio Valencia back outside the box and the United winger eventually went tumbling in the penalty area. Despite Macherano claiming a free-kick should have been awarded for the initial contact, referee Howard Webb waved away the appeals and pointed to the spot.</p>
              <p class="article">Torres was disgusted with the decision and held up play by kicking the penalty spot. He escaped without a booking but the time-wasting tactic appeared to have done the trick.</p>
              <p class="article">Pepe Reina saved Wayne Rooney's 12th-minute penalty, only to be left as a helpless onlooker as Roo tucked away the rebound. Benitez and Alex Ferguson became embroiled in a heated touchline debate after the penalty — and it set the tone for the rest of the half.</p>
              <p class="article">The game gradually became more scrappy and tempers flared again in the second half when Fletcher and Daniel Agger squared up following a foul on Dirk Kuyt. But it was Park who lifted the lid roof on Old Trafford when he flung himself to connect with Valencia's ball on the hour mark.</p>
              <p class="article">Liverpool refused to go down without a fight and did their best to break down United's well-organised ranks. Park was replaced by Paul Scholes as Alex Ferguson looked to freshen things up and ensure his side kept possession.</p>
              <p class="article">Scholes, who followed fellow veteran Ryan Giggs into the fray from the bench, was his usual assured self in the heart of midfield. But Ferguson was left with his heart in his mouth when the ball dropped to Torres in the dying seconds.</p>
              <p class="article">The Spaniard, however, managed to slice his effort harmlessly into the air as Liverpool blew their last chance.</p>

              <p>Well, he is coming to 30 already right? It happens lah. But it won't happen totally but bit by bit... Cos we can't continue to expect him to be in top form if he plays 2 or 3 matches in 7 or 8 days... Liverpool should cash in on him asap before he becomes worthless... If they are to keep him, then they will have to be selective on the matches he plays... He can be like Paul Scholes, play selectively so as to keep his fitness and form in top condition...</p>
              <p>And on the title, I now belief Arsenal have a very good chance to win it this year cos of Wenger's experienced in keeping his players motivated and not nervy. Their remainding fixtures is also a plus point. Therefore I feel they have a better chance than United. Cos out of United's last 7 matches, 3 are from the top 5 so I am quite sure they will drop some points there... As for Chelsea, I think they are feeling the pressure of leading the table and Lotti seems to be clueless in a pressured title chase. And to add away fixtures to United, Spurs and Pool... They are starting to look like they have big problem down the road which Lotti don't seem to know how to deal with...</p>
