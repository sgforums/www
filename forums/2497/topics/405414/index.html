              <p>ell, just some thoughts for sensible discussion. (if repeated, mods please remove).</p>
              <p>1) just wondering, given how germany wiped the floor with the so called english stars, and pratically show how they are perhaps creating a new blueprint to how they prepare and play, u think English FA or EPL teams will adopt or influenced by them?</p>
              <p>in that I mean, Germany was able to successfully play with a new dimension that totally negate England's 442.</p>
              <p>How many teams adopt this new gameplay? or the quality to do that?</p>
              <p>For me, It will be damn sad if EPL teams or English FA pretend nothing happens and go on with their ancient gameplays and etc.</p>

              <p>Personally, there is nothing much to it. It was just one match and even then, had Lampard's goal been given, who is to say the end result would be the same?</p>
              <p>Like I said, it's just one match... England defeated the Germans 5 - 1 in Germany not too long ago too... So what's the big deal? It's also one match only on a day that things and luck went their way... It's like United beat Roma 7-1 one season on a night everything went their way... Players who normally can't or don't score suddenly scores... But the next season when they met again, the result was totally different.</p>
              <p>So in effect, we shouldn't be taking too much from it... In terms of individual players, they were rather equal or the English might even shade it... The problem I felt was, while the young Germans played as a team, the established English players went out to show individual's talent... That's the biggest difference between them...</p>
              <p>And to be fair in knock-out matches, losing 2-1 and losing 4-1 really makes no difference... Like United and Arsenal usually does... They take their chances and if it works out, which they normally do, they get the rewards. But in the event they let in more goals... It's still 3 points lost.</p>
              <p>Or Chelsea lost 4-1 to City last season... But it was also one match only... Chelsea were the eventual winner weren't they? So one match really don't tell everything... Even if they were to meet again today or next week, who dares to say it would be the same result?</p>
              <p>So I say, forget about this result... It doesn't really mean anything probably only pride to each side...</p>

              <p>Yes, Lampard's goal may have counted, but we don't talk about the what ifs anymore do we? also, was England even convincing during the group stages? Quality wise, one on one, Germans may be similiar with England, what about Argies?</p>

              <p><br>What difference did we see from 4 yrs ago in WC 2006? You are making it sound as though the present side is so much better than the one 4 yrs ago... If anything, I thought the 2006 side was much better than the present day one... The 2006 side didn't depend a lot on counter attacks, they were more forward going and as organised. Teams fear them rather than they fear others... They went through the group stages without losing a single match unlike this 2010 side...</p>
              <p>In 2006, the side went all the way to the semi-final as well and only a goal scored in the last min of extra time against Italy was the reason they fail to make the final. Nevertheless, that side played well and was an equal to their opponent unlike the present one... Who I think had only 30+ percent of possession in the whole of their semi-final match... And it was such a terribly boring match with the German side too afraid to come out...</p>
              <p>You might like to think otherwise about England but just to let you know, they have the best qualifying record on the way to WC2010, even Germany's qualifying lost to them... So won't it be a contradiction if they were to rethink?</p>
              <p>And when you talk about "England's Golden generation". Actually I think that was like 4 yrs ago when the likes of Gerrard, Lampard, Joe Cole, M Owen, Carragher, Hargreaves and Rio were much younger or still able to play... Anyway, "Golden generation" doesn't necessary mean you have better players than others, It could also just meant that your country have a few good ones at the same time thats all... But not necessary better than others as well... Portugal had a better "Golden generation" with one even being crowned World player of the year... But so what?</p>
              <p>Realistically, as you said you only watched this match and you start to think the FA have to rethink on the whole Premier league... Then i would say it's rather too drastic... Cos had you watched the Jun 18 match between Germany and Serbia, you probably saw a different thing altogether...</p>
              <p>Like I said, "its just one match" and even if they were to meet again, the result is still anyone's guess...</p>

              <p>well, ironically, i did catch bits of the germany vs serbia. i was the only table supporting serbia when they scored. but I did expect germany to pick themselves up and they did.</p>

              <p>the crux is England seems to disintegrate in the impt or latter matches when they are able to waltz in earlier stages, whereas the germans is almost certain to make it further.</p>

              <p>Well, as you said earlier you only saw one match and that was it. I am glad you also caught the Serbia match now even though it's a bit... I bet many must have been really disappointed with them after that match. Cos who would have thought they would get beaten by Serbia right? Like you said, yours was the only table supporting them...</p>
              <p>On hindsight, We could now say at that point in time after Italy's first match we would also thought Italy could come back... But they didn't...</p>
              <p>And yeah, if you are not aware, Capello has the best qualifying record to the WC for England. And as you rightly pointed out, they did it with 27 points to Germany's 26. Therefore, the problem isn't as serious as one might think... But of course reading some unfavourable article from the English Press one could get all panic and start asking for drastic changes but have you read the Italian or the French Press as well? I bet they have an even more urgent need for it...</p>
              <p>And on the qualifying again, England did indeed have the best qualifying on their way... Even better than Spain at that point... It's just that on their second last match when they have already qualified with 6 points to spare, They had their goalkeeper Green sent off in the first 15 mins of that away match against Ukraine... But they still ended up scoring more goals than Spain and had a better goal difference too...</p>
              <p>When we look at France, who could expect them to fall to this level today? 10 yrs ago? They were the super team of the world winning the WC and the Euro within 2 yrs apart... This year, they were there by pure luck which some felt they didn't even deserve to be in the first place... And who is to say the Spain of today would not go the same way too?</p>
              <p>The thing is, each generation might bring you the best group of players coming through but unfortunately for some, they don't always do... Have the French changed a great deal from their ways 10 yrs ago? I don't think so but you don't always produce a Zidine no matter how hard you try... Just like Spain might never produce another player as good as Iniesta or a Villa who is so consistent in International matches...</p>
              <p>The crux here I guess is people always have too much expectations of England when it comes to a tournament... True they are one of the favourite because they deserve to be... But they are not the hot favourite... They losing out shouldn't be seen as a bigger surprise to Italy or France losing out either...</p>
              <p>We look at Italy, the Serie A have the most home grown players playing in it... But so what? Did it make a difference?</p>
              <p>And imagine, had some not watched the Germans other matches cos got no Starhub or Singtel and only started to watch them from the semi-final onwards against Spain... Man, they were pathetic... One would feel even Switzerland and Chile played much better than them. But again like I said, it was only just one match right?</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, The Premier League is bringing in squad limits next year to 25 only, which are already operated in European competitions... This is a new change i guess... But remember, not every new policy is necessary a good thing though...</p>
