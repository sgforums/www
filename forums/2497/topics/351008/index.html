              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>A crunch week for Liverpool
              starts with the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie
              against Real Madrid at Anfield on Tuesday.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The match is the first of a double-header that can make or
              break Liverpool's season - and possibly go some way towards
              deciding whether manager Rafa Benitez remains at the club.</p>
              <p>After playing Real, Liverpool make the short trip to Old
              Trafford on Saturday where anything other than a victory over
              leaders Manchester United will effectively end their already
              faint hopes of winning the Premier League.</p>
              <p>"It is very important to approach this (Real) game thinking
              we have to win it and not think about any other result," said
              Benitez, whose side hold a 1-0 lead from the first leg in
              Madrid.</p>
              <p>"What you must not do is think we are already there and it
              will be easy," the Spaniard told reporters.</p>
              <p>"Clearly, Real Madrid are a very good team. They are doing
              well in the Spanish league. We won in the Bernabeu, which was
              very pleasing, but it's important we finish the job at Anfield."</p>
              <p>Liverpool's inconsistency and poor home form has been their
              downfall since Christmas when they led the Premier League and
              seemed to be on course for their first championship since 1990.</p>
              <p>While a draw against Real would be enough to see them
              through to the quarter-finals, Benitez also knows that Real are
              unlikely to be as sluggish as they were in Madrid.</p>
              <p>With Steven Gerrard not yet back to his best after injury,
              and Fernando Torres also struggling for full fitness, Benitez
              will be relying on Javier Mascherano, Yossi Benayoun, the scorer
              in Madrid, and Dirk Kuyt for some impressive performances.</p>
              <p><strong>"LIKE A FINAL"</strong></p>
              <p>Real must put the disappointment behind them of having their
              10-match Primera Liga winning streak ended in a 1-1 draw at home
              against city rivals Atletico Madrid on Saturday.</p>
              <p>"The match against Liverpool will be like a final," coach
              Juande Ramos said after Saturday's clash at the Bernabeu.</p>
              <p>"It's going to be a difficult and passionate encounter and
              the players are massively fired up so they can give the fans
              something to cheer about."</p>
              <p>Real were missing suspended central defender Pepe against
              Atletico and the champions looked shaky at the back without him
              as the visitors created a host of chances.</p>
              <p>The Portuguese international's defensive partner, Fabio
              Cannavaro, said Real were lucky to come away with a point and
              called for immediate improvement.</p>
              <p>"We have to get our shape back and quickly as we cannot fail
              against Liverpool," the Italian World Cup-winning captain told
              reporters. "We have to play as a team and quickly forget the
              Atletico match."</p>
