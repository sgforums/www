              <p class="imageCaption" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Fernando Torres claims </strong><strong>Liverpool’s</strong><strong> campaign was doomed even before it 
              began, blaming the departure of key players and the failure to recruit 
              quality replacements for their disappointing season.</strong></p>
              <p>Spelling out his frustration at the loss of Xabi Alonso, Alvaro Arbeloa and 
              Sami Hyypia,<br>Torres insisted the club had become ‘messed up’ after the trio 
              left last summer.</p>
              <p>Torres said: ‘After a good season last year, the team needed certain 
              reinforcements and to keep the squad together, but circumstances dictated we had 
              to sell and<br>everything got messed up.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">‘The sale of Arbeloa, Hyypia and Alonso was an important loss. Alvaro was a 
              player who did a vital job for us, always played to a high level and his 
              flexibility was a huge bonus. </div>
              <p>‘Sami may not have played every week but he was 10 out of 10 on and off the 
              pitch and players like Xabi are very rare.</p>
              <p>‘He was the team’s engine and you know that when you change an engine it 
              takes time to work again.’</p>
              <p>He added: ‘We were so far off the top of the table so quickly. That killed us 
              psychologically and has stopped us changing the situation.’</p>

              <p>precisely, &amp; he did start for MU a few times, and did not perform to expectations hence the loan to get him games, in preparation for the WC/. To be fair to him, he may do a Ronaldo, and transform after his loan. but the odds are stacked against him.</p>

              <p>precisely, &amp; he did start for MU a few times, and did not perform to expectations hence the loan to get him games, in preparation for the WC/. To be fair to him, he may do a Ronaldo, and transform after his loan. but the odds are stacked against him.</p>

              <p>The difference here is that Man U did get a few decent replacements, like Valencia. Even Owen, for all of his injuries, had quite considerable utility when it really mattered.</p>
              <p>Also, the other Man U squad members have been quick to fill the gap left behind by Tevez and Ronaldo and to work harder and in a more cohesive manner. Rooney has flourished, and Park Ji-Sung has become a strong utility player.</p>
              <p>The real problem is the lack of depth in the Liverpool squad. Simply put, Alonso and Arbeloa were so pivotal to the Liverpool squad that whatever else they had couldn't replace these two.</p>
