              <p><strong>ARSENE WENGER is facing the first dressing room crisis of his Arsenal career.</strong></p>
              <p>On the day of the Old Trafford clash which could kill off the Gunners' season entirely, unhappy stars are questioning the manager (above) over tactics and team selection. Major rifts have also opened amongst the players with goalkeeper Manuel Almunia admitting he knows he is ‘hated' by rival Jens Lehmann. Arsenal's Champions League progress had helped paper over the cracks.</p>
              <h3>Tension</h3>
              <p>But after losing to Liverpool in midweek, there is a growing tension between managers and some players. One Gunners source said: "The turning point was going out of the FA Cup to Manchester United, the team hasn't recovered from that.</p>
              <p>"Suddenly there are major inquests going on. Nobody can understand why Kolo Toure was played at right-back instead of centre-half in big games, everybody can see Emmanuel Eboue isn't a midfielder and there is too much pressure on Cesc Fabregas to carry the team.</p>
              <p>"Arsene wants to play attractive, passing football but some of the senior players think he's breeding a team of youngsters who think it's OK to just play well without having to actually graft to win games. "There isn't a winning mentality like there is at Manchester United or Chelsea. There doesn't seem to be a win-at-all-cost attitude."</p>
              <h3>Friction</h3>
              <p>Almunia went public on the breakdown in his relationship with Lehmann, admitting: "To have someone here who hates me is just amazing. I know he hates me. "Every morning I know it's going to be the same but I don't care. I don't want any relationship with him any more."</p>
              <p>There is also friction between skipper William Gallas and some of the younger players. And the growing resentment with Nicklas Bendtner was highlighted when only Theo Walcott congratulated him for his goal against Liverpool last weekend.</p>
              <p>Alumunia revealed Wenger dislikes tension. The keeper said: "The boss is trying to build a team of kind people. He doesn't like arguments." Many believe Wenger is missing the influence of former vice-chairman David Dein, who left the club a year ago.</p>

              <p>I dun realy like arsenal... he is always over optimistics and over confidence....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I prefer humbler manager who dun talk so big. Everytime in crisis, he always say we will start winning from now onwards. After each win, he will say this is is match where we get back our confidence which will push us forward and win many matches, only to lose again or draw.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Overall, he has achieve so so, third place in EPL, Quarter final in CL.  </p>

              <p>to be fair to wenger, his culture is good. He plays with good, pleasing football.</p>
              <p>Also, his ability to pick players and groom them like Henry from Juventus, Vieira etc etc is uncanning.</p>
              <p>I think he is just low on a bit of luck.</p>
              <p>This season with his team of youngsters, not many give them a fair chance but they were doing well until some key injuries came in and without able replacements, his team was not able to subtain the momentum. </p>
              <p>Imagine the two dubious penalties his team should/should not have, he would be in UCL Semis.</p>
              <p>Now, to say he should have spend in the Jan's window, is a bit premature. All of us knows that it is almost impossible to get quality and non cup-tied players then. And if you want to aim for stop-gap, this may disrupt team dynamics also.</p>
              <p>I think Wenger will pick up from all this and next season will be different.</p>
              <p>However, I can't say the same for another team whose sole aim in EPL is to get Fourth and worm their way to UCL Finals (befriending all the UCL referees.)</p>

              <p>I also think arsene is quite a bit of sore loser type, which media often says..</p>
              <p>You lose a game, even if the referee give judgment wrongly, means you are not good enough. that is soccer, that wrong decisions happen. A good team wins despite harsh decision were taken towards them. If you get a draw and penalty because harsh decision were made towards your team, that means you are average team.</p>
              <p>Stop blaming others and just focus on how he could mangae the tactics or players and he will realize that he got more energy and time. Blaming uses up his time and emotions.....</p>

              <h2>ADEBAYOR: WENGER CAN BRING US GLORY</h2>
              <p><img src="http://clientimages.teamtalk.com/08/04/240/Emmanuel_Adebayor_Manchester_United_Arsenal_P_783911.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180"><br></p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Emmanuel Adebayor has backed Arsene Wenger's "vision" for Arsenal - and declared the Gunners will come out fighting "like a killer" for the Barclays Premier League title next season. Wenger conceded the end of his team's ambitions for the season following defeat at leaders Manchester United, which left Arsenal nine points off the pace with only four games to play.</strong></p>
              <p>Having also lost a dramatic Champions League quarter-final against Liverpool last week, the Gunners - knocked out of the FA Cup at Old Trafford and in the Carling Cup semi-finals by eventual winners Tottenham - are set for another campaign without a trophy.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, French coach Wenger, 58, continues to hold unquestioning belief his young side can deliver and feels they will be stronger from the experience of what has been a rollercoaster season, with Arsenal once five points clear at the top of the table. Adebayor, who put the Gunners ahead at Old Trafford only to see the champions fight back, maintains the man who brought Arsenal three league titles and four FA Cups, as well as an appearance in the 2006 Champions League final, has not lost his touch.</p>
              <p>"Arsene is a great man and a great manager," said Adebayor, who has 20 Premier League goals this season. "He has achieved a lot of things with this club. For sure he is going to be here. "He has a vision to bring a lot of good players to this club like Alex Hleb, Kolo Toure, Emmanuel Eboue, Cesc Fabregas and William Gallas. They are his players. So, for sure, we will win something, no doubt about that."</p>
              <p>Adebayor, 24, added: "We will never give up. Last season we finished fourth so we have made a lot of progress and we deserved something. "I still believe we are still one of the best teams in the world. We know how to achieve things and we know how to play football. "But next season we have to come out like a killer to do something. We have the quality."</p>
