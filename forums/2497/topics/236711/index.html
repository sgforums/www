            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.teamtalk.com//Images/92182.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Arsene Wenger has defended Arsenal against criticism they are hurting England - but he admits club football is now taking on greater significance compared to the international stage. </strong></span><br><br>Middlesbrough boss Steve Gibson rounded on the Barclays Premiership's big clubs for failing to help England boss Steve McClaren, but Frenchman Wenger insists it is more important to maintain quality in the domestic game rather than protecting homegrown talent. With the introduction of countries such as Gibraltar to competitive football, Wenger believes the standard of football on the international scene is diminishing, while the opposite can be said for club football in the bigger nations.<br><br>"I don't think about the national team too much because footballistically (sic) it's not of too much interest," said the Gunners boss, ahead of his side's clash against Wigan on Sunday. "I think the game has moved on and towards the club. It's more exciting to watch club football and that is the same in other countries.<br><br>"National football is boring, you have to accept that. Club football has moved forward and international football has moved backwards, because of the multiplicity of countries. Games are boring because of that." He added: "Without that national pride, and if you watch the level, most of the games at international level are of no interest at all. "There is a lot of love for the country, which is why people are interested, but no-one is interested because of the level of football."<br><br>The Frenchman did not rule out eventually managing an international side, despite much of his work at Arsenal having been done by recruiting from a host of countries rather than just one. Wenger has bought Theo Walcott from Southampton and developed Justin Hoyte, but he has a reputation of unearthing foreign talent such as Cesc Fabregas from Spain. It has led to inevitable criticism of his policy being detrimental to England's hopes, something Gibson hinted at.<br><br>However, Wenger said: "If I give you a good wine, you will see how it tastes and after you ask where it comes from." Wenger defended the club's policy, questioning the coaching of youngsters in England. "We invest a lot of money in the academy and the development of our youth team - true that is not necessarily for English kids. But it is down to quality," he said. "To put players in my team who are not good enough will not strengthen the England team, and would weaken the Arsenal team. Just to please Steve Gibson, that is not enough."<br><br>Wenger believes the most important time in a player's development is between the ages of six and 13, adding: "That is when the biggest part of the player is done. That is why I'm convinced it is the development of the coaches that makes the difference. "It's not where they finish, it's where they started. The lack of quality coaches for the young ages is not something Arsenal can do something about."<br><br>He added: "Quotas will not improve the national team and it will weaken the football level - for people who love football that is annoying. We live in a world where it is not down to protection, it is about quality. "It's a vicious circle because the expectation is so high and you go to the World Cup expecting to win."<br></div>

But with Liverpool and Arsenal preferring to pack their squads full of foreign imports, Gibson insists former Boro boss Mac should not cop all the flak. He said: Â“Steve can only work with the tools that the country gives him. At the moment, those tools arenÂ’t good enough. Â“We see the Liverpools and the Arsenals. What are they contributing at national level?<br><br>Â“WeÂ’ve got to start looking at not just the head coach but right through our structure. Â“There are many, many other reasons why the English football team isnÂ’t working. Â“It hasnÂ’t worked successfully since 1966. Â“Anybody who thinks itÂ’s going to be turned round immediately is really fooling themselves. Â“Our set-up towards football at international level needs some serious thinking about. Â“What weÂ’re asking Steve to do is perform miracles.Â”<br><br></div>
