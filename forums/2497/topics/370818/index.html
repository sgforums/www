              <h1 class="titlestory">Arsenal boss Wenger sold Man City pair to break up African clique</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsene Wenger</span></abbr> chose to sell Emmanuel Adebayor and Kolo Toure to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> to break up an African clique inside the dressing room, it has been revealed.</p>
              <p>The <em>Observer</em> says there is something ruthlessly
              strategic about his willingness to do business on Adebayor, Touré, and
              in all probability Eboué, who capered through a half of Arsenal's 2-1
              win over Atletico Madrid. In one fell swoop, it diffuses the three
              major areas of conflict within the camp.</p>
              <p>The tension between Adebayor and Nicklas Bendtner has never
              been particularly helpful. Then there is the mutual appreciation
              society involving Touré and William Gallas, which manifested itself in
              a winter crisis that saw the Frenchman stripped of the captaincy and
              the Ivorian slapping in a transfer request. Eboué's discord is rather
              more general, considering he managed to alienate the club's fans, who
              turned on him last term.</p>
              <p>Adebayor, Touré and Eboué led a clique inside the dressing
              room, with Alexandre Song the junior partner. It is natural that men
              from a similar cultural background should connect and spend time in
              each other's company, but at times the group seemed a little too
              exclusive for comfort.</p>
              <p>Song, easily the most improved performer at the club last
              season, is not seen as expendable by Wenger, but he is likely to be the
              only survivor.</p>

              <p>Arsenal have a habit of selling their players when they are reaching 30 or reach 30. So somehow in the mind of Toure, its better for him to go now than wait in 2 season's time, Arsenal will get rid of him and he won't be getting $120k per week for the next 4 yrs...</p>
              <p>Look at Henry, Vieira, Pires, Lauren, Ljungberg and Campbell... All of them were still able but got ship out no sooner so as to recover some money... Apart from Campbell who could have got a new and longer contract as he wanted but they didn't offer it to him, instead only offering year by year like what happened with Pires too which he rejected.</p>
              <p>So those smart ones will leave by 27, 28 for better paid and longer contracts like Flamini, Hleb and now Toure... Toure is a good example, cos during those years when he see senior players who have done so much for the club getting kick-out, he probably didn't think much of it as he was only 22, 23, 24... But today at 28, he knows it could happen to him too very soon. </p>
              <p>Arsenal's policy will start their players thinking if they should stay when they all reach 27, 28... The club have shown they don't want you when you reach that age, so if an opportunity comes along, better take it like Toure who will now get $100k to120k, more than twice his Arsenal pay for the next 4 yrs... If he stays, in 2 yrs time they move him out to a lower club, he will have to settle for lesser than his $50k to $60k Arsenal pay...</p>
              <p>A few years back they started this get rid of policy and now, it seems, its coming back to haunt them... Current players will view it as the club doesn't reward past players for their loyalty and contributions, so why should they even bother to be faithful to it?</p>

              <p>most players in arsenal team are probably using arsenal as a stepping stone to bigger teams who can pay bigger salary.</p>

              <p>i dont blame toure, adabayor. arsenel are not team that can win trophy nor pay big  salary, so why stay? if i am pro players, i would go for at least either one.</p>
