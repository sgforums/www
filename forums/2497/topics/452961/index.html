              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Steven Gerrard leads Roy Hodgson’s Lions against Norway tonight, admitting: “For the first time I really feel like I’m the England captain.”</strong></p>
              <p>The Liverpool midfielder is skipper for the 16th time under a fourth England boss, having first worn the armband for Sven Goran Eriksson against Sweden in Gothenburg in 2004. Gerrard also captained England under Steve McClaren before leading Fabio Capello’s side into the 2010 World Cup after Rio Ferdinand wrecked his knee ligaments in Rustenburg. </p>
              <p>But having been overlooked by Stuart Pearce in favour of Scott Parker against Holland in February, Gerrard was given the job by former Anfield boss Hodgson and he conceded: “It feels like the first time I’ve been official captain.</p>
              <p>“All the other times, I’ve known the armband was going to go back, either after the tournament or individual games.</p>
              <p>“Fabio Capello had belief in me as a player but it was clear he didn’t have total belief for me to be the official captain. This manager has done that. It’s very nice and good for my confidence. You’ve got to relish it. I’m sitting here as England captain. It’s fantastic. It’s something I’ve always dreamed of.”</p>
              <p>Gerrard clearly has a gripe with Pearce, adding: “It’s not easy when you’re told you’re no longer the England captain.</p>
              <p>“He just said he wanted to go with someone but I was disappointed. Scott’s a great player but I thought that was it for me in terms of being captain, because I felt Stuart might be the manager this summer.”</p>

              <h3>STEVEN GERRARD admits that Fabio Capello never had any faith in him as England skipper.</h3>

              <p>Gerrard has been named captain by new boss Roy Hodgson for tonight’s <span style="color: #000000;">Euro 2012</span> warm-up in Norway.</p>
              <p>Yet Gerrard said: “Capello always had belief in me as a player but it was clear he didn’t have total belief for me to be official captain.</p>
              <p>“This manager has come in and done that — it’s very nice and good for my confidence and belief.</p>

              <p>“You’ve got to relish it. It’s fantastic. It’s something I’ve always dreamed of. I’ve been in this set-up for a long time, so I’m big enough to handle this responsibility.”</p>
              <p>Hodgson, who made Gerro, 31, his skipper when in charge at Liverpool, said: “Working with him for seven months and getting to know his qualities aided me in my decision.”</p>

              <div id="bodyText">
              <p>SunSport columnist Roy Keane said: “In the Euros that would have been a straight red card. </p>
              <p>“You just can’t afford to tackle like that at international level.” </p>
              <p>But new England boss Roy Hodgson claimed it was just the type of tackle he wants to see his players make. </p>
              <p>He said: “It was a fair tackle. There was no intent to injure the player and Stevie’s studs weren’t up. It was a strong and brave challenge and the type I hope our players put in at the Euros because it shows their commitment.” </p>
              <p>Norway boss Egil Olsen said: “We don’t know how serious the injury to Hogli is but I don’t think it is too bad. </p>
              <p>“Was it a sending off? I’m not a referee.”</p>
              <p>Former England midfield hardman Peter Reid said: “I would have been proud of making a challenge like that back in my day. </p>
              <p>“But these days you cannot get away with it. As the ball ran loose we were all shouting out ‘stay on your feet, stay on your feet’. But Stevie didn’t and I think he was lucky.” </p>
              <p>Ex-Three Lions defender Gareth Southgate added: “Seven or eight years ago that would have been deemed a harsh but fair tackle. The intent was to get the ball and it was a full, thrusting tackle. </p>
              <p>“These days, though, there is a real risk of a red card. We might see those sort of tackles quite regularly in the Premier League but it will be different in the Euros. </p>
              <p>“I would say he could very well have been sent off if he’d have tackled like that in the Euros.” Gerrard, who claimed he got the ball first, was not even cautioned by German ref Michael Weiner. </p>
              <p>He could clearly be seen telling the referee: “It was a fair tackle.” </p>
              <p>But England’s skipper was substituted by Hodgson at half-time and replaced by Gareth Barry. </p>
              <p>With Wayne Rooney already banned for the first two games at Euro 2012, Hodgson must be relieved he has also not now lost another key player for the tournament. </p>
              <p>The manager’s first game in charge of his country ended in victory thanks to Ashley Young’s excellent ninth-minute finish.</p>
