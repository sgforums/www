              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/liverpool/benayoun_yaaa_480.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></p>
              <div id="div_article_main_content">
              <p><strong>Yossi Benayoun has been told by Rafa Benitez that his Liverpool future rests entirely in his own hands. </strong></p>
              <p>Benayoun has two years left on his current Anfield deal and,
              after previously expressing his frustration at a lack of first team
              opportunities, has since established himself as a key figure in
              Liverpool’s title push.</p>
              <p>The Israeli has been in scintillating form ever since his cameo
              role against Chelsea at the start of February, scoring five goals in
              the last nine games.</p>
              <p>Benitez is keen to keep the 28-year-old schemer, insisting contract talks will begin soon if Benayoun wants to listen.</p>
              <p>"I think if he is happy, then he will be okay here," Benitez is
              quoted as saying in The Independent. "Yossi now is playing, so I'm sure
              he is happy.</p>
              <p>"We've had no real approaches for him.</p>
              <p>"Now he is playing more games, has more confidence and you can see the quality that he has.</p>
              <p>"I have to talk to him [about a new contract] but he is contracted for another two years."</p>
              <p>Benitez has also given his clearest indication yet that Daniel Agger could stay at Anfield during the summer.</p>
              <p>"I think that we are closer," said Benitez of Agger's contract talks.</p>

              <p>Seriously , i think Ryan Babel the one to give way ... to Gareth Barry .</p>
              <p>Barry definitely leaving ... after Villa's UCL dream dashed !</p>
              <p>And Barry has got only i think 1 year of his contract left , rather than to let him go for nothing , i think they will cash in from Liverpool's bid .</p>
              <p>Even anything at 5 million also can liao ... than nothing after 2009 .</p>

              <p>Benny is the only creative and cool minded player that can played jack in the box role.</p>
              <p>Kuyt is too stone and have to kick 5 shots to score 2 goals.</p>
              <p>Babel confirmed sold cos he never learned his lesson from Robo.</p>
              <p>If Owen is cheap, bring him back.</p>
              <p>I prayed hard for Lucas to be sold but selling him would mean Ah Ben made a wrong decision.</p>
              <p>Voronin may be sold, Ngog dun really impressed.</p>
              <p>Strange that Liverpool have to stoop so low to survive.</p>
              <p>Better sell it to another owner ? Sg Corp maybe ?</p>

              <h1 class="sIFR-ignore">Wolves keen to talk Hyypia</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/liverpool/hyypia_goal_480.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>Mick McCarthy has taken little time to signal his intentions with
              newly-promoted Wolves by confirming his interest in Liverpool defender
              Sami Hyypia.</strong></p>
              <p>Wolves last week secured their place in The Premier League with a
              win over QPR and have since made it apparent that it is an abundance of
              top-flight experience that they wish to add to a squad already brimming
              with youth.</p>
              <p>Mick McCarthy has just one season of Premier League management
              behind him and, having failed so abominably with the meagre £6 million
              he had to spend at Sunderland, admits that he has learned lessons on
              how better to go about the task of survival this time around.</p>
              <p>Wolves fans will no doubt view the eyeing up of Hyypia, who is
              available on a free transfer at the end of the season, as the perfect
              fit for what the club needs if it is to improve upon its only previous
              year in The Premier League.</p>
              <p>“If Sami Hyypia was available and would consider coming to Wolves as
              a club who have just come up, then great,” he said in the Express and
              Star.</p>
              <p>“If Sami is on a Bosman and we could talk about it then of course
              I’d be interested. But he’s been linked with a quite a few clubs.”</p>
