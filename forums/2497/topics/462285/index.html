                  *San zero: Premier League clubs on alert as Sneijder threatens to leave Inter for FREE*
                      
                      
                      *Dutch playmaker is claiming breach of contract, which interests the likes of United, City, Liverpool and Spurs*

                      *Wesley Sneijder is ready to walk out of Inter Milan for free â€“ sparking a Premier League scramble to sign the Dutch master next month.*
                      
                      Sneijder, a Â£35million target for Manchester United 18 months ago, is taking legal advice to discover whether he can force his departure from the San Siro after being ordered to take a pay-cut by the Italian giants.
                      
                      Inter want to slash his Â£180,000-a-week wages by half â€“ and have told him he will continue to be frozen out by coach Andrea Stramaccioni until he signs the new deal.
                      
                      Sneijder, 28, will ask FIFA to intervene but has already been assured he is within his rights to walk out on Inter for breach of contract and restraint of trade.
                      
                      That would allow him to sign for another club while FIFA investigate his case â€“ and it could take FIFA up to two years to make a ruling.
                      
                      Sneijderâ€™s availability will once again alert Sir Alex Ferguson.
                      
                      The United manager wanted to sign the Dutchman last summer but pulled the plug on the deal when the player demanded wages of Â£250,000-a-week.
                      
                      Sneijderâ€™s advisers have made it clear he is now ready to take a small cut to around Â£160,000-a-week.
                      
                      Manchester City, Tottenham and Liverpool have all been informed of Sneijderâ€™s impending availability. And although Paris St Germain and Fenerbahce have made their interest clear, the player would prefer a move to England.
                      
                      Sneijder has made just five Serie A appearances for Inter this season and hasnâ€™t played since September 26. He said: â€œI am super-fit and I want to play.â€�
                      
                      Inter are trying to slash their wage bill as the world economic crisis grips Italian football. Sneijder still has two-and-a-half years left on his contract, but Inter will extend it by a further season if he accepts a pay-cut.
                      
                      Interâ€™s technical director Marco Branca warned: â€œWe have given Sneijder time to think about our offer and during this situation we will not select him for games.â€�
