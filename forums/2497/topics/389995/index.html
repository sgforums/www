              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1248374" rel="1248374|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1248374/Shes-French-born-mistress-John-Terry-This-examination-WAG-Vanessa-Perroncel-reveals-shes-woman-truly-voracious-ambition.html"></a> </p>
              <p><strong>There is a word the French use to describe women like Vanessa Perroncel. The word is <span style="font-style: italic;">effronte</span>, and it means barefaced, or shameless.</strong></p>
              <p>One could think of a number of other adjectives to describe the pneumatic Miss Perroncel, but 'shameless' is probably the most polite.</p>
              <p>Indeed, the moral charge sheet against Miss Perroncel - including not only her betrayal of her former fiance; (Wayne Bridge) but also her best friend (Toni Poole - 'Mrs John Terry') - is almost as long as the list of Chelsea footballers she is accused of bedding. </p>
              <p>We have now been given the names of another two Stamford Bridge stars who allegedly succumbed to Miss Perroncel's charms, bringing the grand total to seven - four of whom were named publicly in a red-top newspaper yesterday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img style="width: 682px; height: 449px;" src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00979/CHELSEA_TEAM_682_979819a.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><em>A source close to Vanessa last night told The Sun: "To say she's a Chelsea Girl is a bit of an understatement.</em><br></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Perhaps by the end of the week she will have been linked to a full team of 11 highly paid Chelsea footballers.</strong> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even by the sometimes dubious standards which inevitably come with being an England WAG (the so-called Wives And Girlfriends club), the 33-year-old is in a league of her own: shopping and fake tans are one thing; Miss Perroncel's predilections are of another order.</p>
              <p>Who else but Miss Perroncel could have had an affair with England captain Terry, fallen pregnant by him, had an abortion, wrecking God knows how many lives in the process, then touted her story around Fleet Street - for a figure in excess of £250,000 - promising to set the record straight as though she was the victim of this shabby debacle which threatens to derail England's World Cup campaign?</p>
              <p>Of course, Terry's past, from his almost pathological philandering to his regular displays of boorishness, is an open book which has been examined in forensic detail over the past few revelation-filled days.</p>
              <p>But, until now at least, little has been known of Vanessa Perroncel. "During each affair she was always a single girl. "But by the time she got to John Terry she'd achieved her own five-a-side football team." Revelations of Vanessa's flings will heap further embarrassment on defender Terry, 29, as he comes under pressure to quit as England captain.</p>

              <p><strong>She first came to our attention during the last World Cup, in Germany in 2006. Perroncel - and three of her fellow WAGs - armed with platinum credit cards tore through the boutiques of Baden Baden, spending £4,000 in just under an hour on Gucci, Prada and £500 sunglasses.</strong></p>
              <p>She was pregnant with Bridge's son, Jaydon, at the time and proudly showed off her bump by the swimming pool. 'It's really fantastic news,' she trilled, 'and we are both very excited about it.'</p>
              <p>It is one the many images that have now come back to haunt Miss Perroncel. Her life as a WAG, complete with Surrey mansion and Range Rover, is far removed from her humble upbringing in her native France, where her family ran a struggling fashion boutique.</p>
              <p>Of course, as we know, poor Wayne was not the first Chelsea player to fall for the French beauty.</p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>Let's go through the list. One of the stars, it is claimed, was Eidur Gudjohnsen, who left Chelsea in 2006 after six years - and has just joined London rivals Tottenham after spells with Barcelona and Monaco.</strong></p>
              <p>Gudjohnsen, 31, and Miss Perroncel are said to have begun seeing each other in 2003. The previous year Gudjohnsen, a married father of three, was caught cheating on his wife; on that occasion, the other woman was a blonde, not a brunette.</p>
              <p>The Icelandic-born player is said to have visited Miss Perroncel at her flat near Stamford Bridge, before sneaking out at 5am. Gudjohnsen, who denies having an affair with her, is alleged to have dumped Miss Perroncel.</p>
              <p>Sources also claim she slept with shamed Romanian star Adrian Mutu.</p>
              <p>The fling came before the married striker was sold by Chelsea and hit with a seven-month worldwide ban after testing positive for cocaine in 2004.</p>
              <p>There is also a fifth player, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Our own inquiries have also linked Miss Perroncel to another two current Chelsea stars.</p>
              <p>One wonders what her family makes of it back in France. Her late father, Jean-Claude, and mother, Annie, ran a fashion boutique in Bandol, a picturesque seaside resort in Provence on France's south coast.</p>
              <p>Vanessa was their only child and the couple doted on her. But the business struggled and the marriage was marred by constant rows over money. Her parents would eventually split up, and Mrs Perroncel moved to Paris with Vanessa.</p>
              <p>Mr Perroncel did have other girlfriends, and even fathered another daughter. But he never got over the split with his wife. Aged 51, and racked with debts, he took his own life.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>'Obviously from an early age Vanessa realised the power of money and the effect it can have on people's lives,' her uncle Bernard Perroncel said last night. 'She saw what money problems had done to her parents' marriage and her father, and she never wanted it to happen to her.</strong></p>
              <p>'After her father's funeral Vanessa made the decision to leave France and move to England because she wanted a better life. 'Certainly, she was very pretty and very charming, like her mother, and she decided to use those attributes to her advantage.'</p>
              <p>In any event, Vanessa finally arrived in Britain about ten years ago. She began lodging with retired carpenter Rob Todd and his wife Margaret at their modest semi in a cul-de-sac in Newington, South-East London, where she rented a room for around £500 a month - and travelled everywhere by bus.</p>
              <p>Her vital statistics - she is 5ft 9in with a 34-24-34 figure - and sultry looks meant she was never short of 'modelling' assignments. The internet is awash with pictures of a scantily dressed Miss Perroncel posing for this or that lads' magazine. In one, a miniature JCB is driving over her naked flesh.</p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>But, although she was never short of work, it was not particularly lucrative. After about three years, she was forced to move out of her digs. 'Vanessa said she couldn't afford the rent any more,' recalled Mr Todd. 'We were very sorry to lose her.'</strong></p>
              <p>Of course, Britain, unlike France, offered a more profitable career path for someone of Miss Perroncel's talent. But then the modelling was only a means to an end. Bagging a rich and famous boyfriend was the ultimate goal, if you can excuse the pun, for Vanessa Perroncel and countless other girls like her.</p>
              <p>Few, however, could have been quite as spectacularly successful as Miss Perroncel.</p>
              <p>Celebrity boyfriend Number One was not a footballer, however, but the next best thing: a member of a successful pop group.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Relationship: Perroncel and Lee Latchford Evans, former Steps singer, pictured at a film premiere together in 2002, dated for two years</em></p>
              <p><br><br><br> </p>
              <p><strong>Lee Latchford Evans, the former Steps singing star, had a two-year relationship with Miss Perroncel which ended in 2002.</strong></p>
              <p>Speaking for the first time about their fling yesterday, he said: 'Vanessa is the type who likes to be looked after, to be treated well. You have to have money to be able to do that.</p>
              <p>'That's what she always wanted. That's what she is about. 'She was always going to move on to bigger fish. I gave her a taste of celebrity and she wanted more.</p>
              <p>‘Footballers earn so much money. She knew how to climb the ranks. 'She was always going to be with someone who could look after her and who was very good at what they do. She found that with me, and she's found that with other people.'</p>
              <p>And so to the exclusive Elysium nightclub in London's Soho. Chelsea players were regular visitors to the establishment's VIP lounge, where up to £15,000 a night was often spent on Cristal champagne.</p>
              <p>Guess who ended up getting a job there, first on the door, then as a VIP hostess?</p>
              <p>Girls there earned only about £150 a week, but this bore no resemblance to the money they could earn in tips.</p>
              <p>Coincidentally, it was at the Elysium in 2004 that John Terry met former porn star Karina Clarke, who claimed they had a one-night stand (Toni Poole was then his long-term - and long-suffering - girlfriend, not his wife).</p>
              <p>And it was at the Elysium that Miss Perroncel was introduced to Wayne Bridge, her future fiance; and father of her three-year-old son. Of course, Bridge was not the first Chelsea player to fall for the French beauty.</p>
              <p>Did he know this? How could he not have done - the list, as the Mail has been told, stands at seven.</p>
              <p>One of them, of course was allegedly Eidur Gudjohnsen, who warned his then team-mate Bridge not to get involved with Miss Perroncel, according to a club source.</p>
              <p>Indeed, her reputation, and 'romantic' track record was common knowledge among the players in the Chelsea dressing room.</p>
              <p>'Vanessa's ambition in life was to become a WAG,' said the source. 'She worked at the Elysium knowing that she would bump into players on a regular basis.'</p>
              <p>Someone who met Miss Perroncel back in those days put it even more bluntly. 'She was a real piece of work,' he said. Indeed, as Miss Perroncel grew closer to the players and their wives, she even joined the Chelsea Club, a private gym and fitness centre within the Stamford Bridge development.</p>
              <p>Either way, Bridge ignored the warnings of Gudjohnsen - and all the others - and embarked on a relationship with Miss Perroncel in around 2005. It was the start of a chain of events that would have cataclysmic repercussions - which began to unravel when Bridge moved to Manchester City last year.</p>
              <p>In December, Bridge and Miss Perroncel announced that they were splitting up. Shamelessly, Miss Perroncel blamed Bridge for the break-up. 'Players and friends led him astray [in Manchester]. He was going out more than he should have done,' she said at the time.</p>
              <p>We now know that Bridge's best friend, John Terry, had been popping round to his mansion in Oxshott, Surrey, to offer 'support' to Miss Perroncel. Terry and his wife Toni live just round the corner.</p>
              <p>It says something about Miss Perroncel that she could cheat not only on her fiance; but also on the woman who was her best friend and coffee morning partner. Under different circumstances, you would not be reading any of this.</p>
              <p>Terry took out an injunction to prevent a Sunday tabloid revealing his disgraceful conduct two weeks ago. The judge initially granted the gagging order.</p>
              <p>The following night, Miss Perroncel was living it up at London's Chinawhite nightclub with Elen Rives, the former partner of Chelsea star Frank Lampard, who was celebrating her 35th birthday.</p>
              <p>Miss Rives is believed to be one of the few WAGs standing by Miss Perroncel.</p>
              <p>Might the two have toasted the judge who ruled that John Terry's dirty secret was to remain just that?</p>
              <p>'Wayne (Bridge) was horrified that Vanessa and Elen Rives spent that Saturday night drinking and partying at Chinawhite,' says a friend. 'She was there throwing herself about on the dance floor, flirting and thinking she had escaped.'</p>
              <p>As we said, shameless.</p>

              <p><strong>John Terry will not be making any public statements on his future as England captain until after a meeting with Fabio Capello.</strong></p>
              <p>The Three Lions and Chelsea skipper has been thrown into the centre of a media storm following a series of revelations over his private life.</p>
              <p>Details of the centre-back's alleged affair with the former girlfriend of international colleague Wayne Bridge were disclosed last week, after a court injunction he had obtained was overturned.</p>
              <p>This has led to frenzied reporting in the media and calls for his resignation as captain of his country from some quarters over his off-field antics.</p>
              <p><em>Sky Sports News</em> has learned Terry has no intention of relinquishing the armband, but the Football Association has already made it clear that any decision on his future as captain would be left to head coach Capello.</p>
              <p>The Italian, known for his strict approach to team discipline, is due in England later this week before he travels to Poland at the weekend ahead of the draw for Euro 2012 qualifying.</p>
              <p>Capello is set to meet with Terry at some point before next week, when he is set to decide on whether to appoint a new captain or not.</p>
              <p>And Terry has made it clear that any communication over his role as skipper of England will come from Capello, the only man who will decide his fate.</p>
              <p>Phil Hall, Terry's spokesman, said: "John Terry asked me to make it clear that he has made absolutely no statement about his future as England captain.</p>
              <p>"He is keeping his own counsel until he speaks to England manager Fabio Capello and then Mr Capello will decide what announcement will be made."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>It emerged that Cheryl Cole, wife of Terry's team-mate Ashley Cole, has declared her support for Bridge. The X-Factor judge, whose husband has faced allegations of infidelity himself, has been in touch with Bridge to sympathise with him.</strong></p>
              <p>Miss Perroncel is considering selling the story of her affair with Terry, whose wife was one of her best friends. The affair is said to have lasted for four months.</p>
              <p>It allegedly began in September, and Terry is said to have paid for her to have an abortion in October. Miss Perroncel, a French lingerie model, is also facing claims of an affair with another - unnamed - Premier League footballer.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Last night, it was not known if Ashley Cole was aware that his wife got in touch with Bridge, putting her on opposite sides from both Terry and Miss Perroncel.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Mrs Cole is understood to have told Bridge how 'sad' she felt and that she too had been through some difficult times. The singer told the Manchester City player that if there was 'anything she could do' to help him or his young son Jaydon she was 'there for him'.</p>
              <p>Bridge, 29, is understood to have told Mrs Cole that her support meant a 'great deal' to him on the day he had an 'emotional reunion' with his former partner and child.</p>
              <p>The Coles had previously been friendly with Bridge and Miss Perroncel, and holidayed together in the South of France last summer.</p>
              <p>Mrs Cole's messages came as details emerged of how Miss Perroncel had met a string of celebrities and footballers - particularly Chelsea players - after arriving in Britain from France ten years ago.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>John Terry faced new questions last night over his fitness to be England captain. A <span style="font-style: italic;">Daily Mail</span> investigation found his personal box at Wembley being 'touted out' for £4,000 a match.</strong></p>
              <p>Terry's contract to rent the luxurious 12-seater facility is subsidised to the tune of tens of thousands a year as one of his 'perks' as national team skipper. Its terms expressly forbid hiring it out.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">But yesterday the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mail</span> was offered exclusive use of it for England's friendly against Egypt next month by an associate of Terry's management agents.</p>
              </div>
              <p>'It's John Terry's box and you can have it,' said the go-between. 'It will be £4,000 and we would want the money in cash.' He said the player would provide a signed England or <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chelsea</span></span></a> shirt as 'part of the deal'.</p>
              <p>The revelation comes as England manager Fabio Capello prepares to meet the Chelsea star, a married father of two, to discuss the sex scandal that has called his international career into question.</p>
              <p>Terry had a five-month affair with Vanessa Perroncel, the estranged partner of his England team-mate Wayne Bridge, then tried to cover it up with a court 'super-injunction'.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Terry, 29, who earns £170,000 a week as Chelsea captain, is now likely to be asked to explain why his box is being offered to outsiders. The facility guarantees seats not only for football but also rugby, American football and non-sporting events including top pop concerts.</strong></p>
              <p>The Wembley scheme is revealed six weeks after Terry and an associate showed reporters posing as businessmen around Chelsea's training ground in Surrey, in return for £10,000 in £50 notes. </p>
              <p>The box was offered to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mail</span> by Anthony White, 35, sales and marketing manager at the David Beckham Academy until it closed down last month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/04/article-0-0827DF6D000005DC-988_468x351.jpg" alt="Wembley Stadium corporate box" width="468" height="351">

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>A coach at the Academy was Paul Nicholls  -  a 29-year-old semi-professional footballer and long-term friend of Terry, who is now part of the player's two-man management team.</strong></p>
              <p>Our reporter, posing as a businessman wanting to organise of football-related events, first met White at the Academy in Greenwich, South East London.</p>
              <p>After an exchange of emails, White telephoned earlier this week and said: 'I've had a think about what we could do, and as this is a special event I've pulled a few strings and how about I get you a 12-seater box at Wembley for the England-Egypt friendly on March 3?'</p>
              <p>'For the box it will be £3-4000 and we would want the money in cash. You pay a mate of mine a few days before the game. </p>
              <p>'As for the beer and wine in the box you have to pay for that, as it is fully stocked and then re-stocked afterwards. You can pay in cash on the night. That would be the best way.</p>
              <p>'I can also arrange for a signed shirt, either England or Chelsea, from John Terry. How does that sound?'</p>
              <p>In a call yesterday White confirmed: 'You can have it for four [thousand]. 'I will let you have it for four  -  no problem. The only way it will become unavailable is if John wants to use it. But I don't think that will happen.'</p>
              <p>It was unclear whether the box was being offered with Terry's knowledge but the Football Association are certain to want to know if it has been 'touted out' before  -  and if so, how often.</p>
              <p>Terry, who has been reported to be a heavy gambler, is understood to have tried to get out of the contract for the Wembley box twice in the last two years.</p>
              <p>His discount as England captain means he pays just under £80,000 a year for a box which would cost anyone else £120,000. But Internet reports yesterday claimed he owed money on the deal and that his friends had run up a £20,000 bill at last year's FA Cup Final.</p>
              <p>White claimed the box belonged to Terry's management company, Elite Management, which is run by Nicholls and Keith Cousins, chairman of lower league side Rushden and Diamonds.</p>
              <p>They provoked controversy last year after hiring a firm called Riviera Entertainment to try and fix lucrative commercial deals for Terry in the run-up to the World Cup.</p>
              <p>Referring to the sex scandal, White told the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mail</span>: 'You can imagine the furore that's been around John. Well it's the guys that look after him that own the box. I spoke to the guys yesterday from his management team and they are just checking the availability. I will put you on to a guy called Paul who will look after you once I get the nod from him.'</p>

              <p><strong>He even held out the possibility that Terry would come up after the game to meet guests in the box.</strong></p>
              <p>The legal contract between Wembley and box-holders is unambiguous about hiring out the facility. It says: 'If you don't want to attend an event, you can allow someone of your choice to use it instead, provided you give your tickets away (no money, service or benefit in kind may be given in return). If you prefer to sell your box for an event, you can ask Club Wembley to do this on your behalf. You will receive the proceeds less an administrative fee of 15 per cent.'</p>
              <p>As Terry's finances come under scrutiny, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mail</span> has learned that he has taken out four mortgages in seven years on the Surrey home he bought for £2.75million in 2003.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One financial expert said this suggests he has been raising capital against the house.</p>
              <p>Last night Terry's spokesman Phil Hall said White had been acting 'on his own' when he offered the box.</p>
              <p>He said: 'I have spoken with Paul Nicholls and the box is run by his promotions company, Sports Marketing and Promotions, of which he is sole director.</p>
              <p>'When Anthony White asked Paul for the box, Paul replied "I'm sorry Anthony, we are not allowed to sell it on. We never would do'.</p>
              <p>Mr Hall said that until last August the box had been owned by JGT Promotions  -  JGT standing for John George Terry. He did not know who was responsible for paying for it now.</p>
              <p>White also denied offering the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mail</span> the use of Terry's box. He said: 'I didn't make any offer. I said I could try and get some corporate hospitality. I am sorry if he got the wrong end of the stick.</p>
              <p>'I said I know a guy at John's management company and I know they have a box. It belongs to the management company. I just know the guy who works there and I was going to ask as a favour.'</p>
              <p> </p>

              <ul>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">It's thought Terry's lover Vanessa Perroncel has signed a kiss and sell deal to tell all about her fling with the England captain. Her publicist Max Clifford was last night spotted with a contract in his hand outside his home. Miss Perroncel has reportedly been offered £250,000 to speak about her relationship with the married footballer.  </span><br></li>

              I don't understand why having an affair with someone else's girlfriend will affect one's career. Work and private life matters should not be mixed.
              
              
              If you work in an accountancy firm, do you get sacked by your boss for visiting the brothel once every fortnight, despite showing excellent results in your work?

              <p>Source: <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=737012&amp;sec=england&amp;cc=4716">http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=737012&amp;sec=england&amp;cc=4716</a></p>
              <p><em>Soccernet</em> understands that John Terry has been dropped as England captain by Fabio Capello after meeting with the Italian at Wembley on Friday.</p>
              <p>Terry had found himself increasingly under pressure after revelations that he had an affair with the ex-girlfriend of former team-mate Wayne Bridge..</p>
              <p> Capello arrived back in England on Thursday having already felt that it would be right to strip Terry of the England captaincy.</p>
              <p>The England boss, though, wanted to wait to see Terry to make the final assessment, get Terry's side of events and to gauge the situation in a face-to-face meeting that lasted just 12 minutes.</p>
              <p>Terry was summoned to Capello's office on Friday afternoon after training, and the Italian would have heard that the Chelsea captain was willing to stand down for the good of the team ethic.</p>
              <p>Capello clearly felt it was a sound solution to the major storm that has been brewing over Terry's private life that impacted on Wayne Bridge. As soon as he was briefed by his trusted aide Franco Baldini, the England manager knew that the decision would have to go against Terry.</p>
              <p>Rio Ferdinand is favourite to step up from vice captain to take the armband from John Terry for the next match against Egypt on March 3, but with Capello it's impossible to second guess.</p>

              <p>Source: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=737012&amp;amp;sec=england&amp;amp;cc=4716">http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=737012&amp;sec=england&amp;cc=4716</a></p>
              <p><em>Soccernet</em> understands that John Terry has been dropped
              as England captain by Fabio Capello after meeting with the Italian
              at Wembley on Friday.</p>
              <p>Terry had found himself increasingly under pressure after
              revelations that he had an affair with the ex-girlfriend of former
              team-mate Wayne Bridge..</p>
              <p> Capello arrived back in England on Thursday having already
              felt that it would be right to strip Terry of the England
              captaincy.</p>
              <p>The England boss, though, wanted to wait to see Terry to make
              the final assessment, get Terry's side of events and to gauge the
              situation in a face-to-face meeting that lasted just 12
              minutes.</p>
              <p>Terry was summoned to Capello's office on Friday afternoon after
              training, and the Italian would have heard that the Chelsea captain
              was willing to stand down for the good of the team ethic.</p>
              <p>Capello clearly felt it was a sound solution to the major storm
              that has been brewing over Terry's private life that impacted on
              Wayne Bridge. As soon as he was briefed by his trusted aide Franco
              Baldini, the England manager knew that the decision would have to
              go against Terry.</p>
              <p>Rio Ferdinand is favourite to step up from vice captain to take
              the armband from John Terry for the next match against Egypt on
              March 3, but with Capello it's impossible to second guess.</p>

              <h2>NO COMMENT FROM FA OVER TERRY FUTURE</h2>
              <div><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/10/02/240/John-Terry-England-Fabio-Capello-PA_2416013.jpg" border="0" alt="Has Capello sacked Terry?"></div>
              <p><br></p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>The Football Association have refused to comment on reports that John Terry has been sacked as England captain.</strong></p>
              <p>Terry was due to meet Fabio Capello this afternoon to discuss the allegations surrounding his private life which have emerged over the past week.</p>
              <p>And, although there has been no official comment from either the FA or Terry's camp, speculation is mounting that the 29-year-old Chelsea defender has been axed as his country's skipper.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Terry's demotion, reported by Sky News, would be a bitter blow for player and manager.</p>
              <p>When most pundits expected the Italian to name Rio Ferdinand as his skipper prior to the friendly with the Czech Republic in August 2008, Capello instead turned to Terry as his on-pitch leader.</p>
              <p>It was felt the Chelsea star was better at galvanising players around him, with Capello paying little attention to the wider role many believed Ferdinand was more capable of fulfilling.</p>
              <p>Terry has done everything asked of him as England have marched on towards this summer's World Cup in South Africa.</p>
              <p>But there have been issues away from the pitch that have not sat easily with bosses at the FA.</p>
              <p>Both Terry's parents have been in the headlines for the wrong reasons, while the defender himself was accused of using his role as England skipper for personal gain when an agency to which he was linked included his status in an e-mail offering the player's services to enhance their business.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Terry emerged unscathed from all of this until last week, when a super-injunction, preventing details of an alleged affair with Vanessa Perroncel from being reported, was lifted by the High Court.</p>
              <p>As the former girlfriend of Wayne Bridge and mother of the Manchester City defender's son, Perroncel's name brought with it a sense of scandal that only intensified with Terry's efforts to keep the affair private.</p>
              <p>At home in Switzerland, where he was recovering from major knee surgery, Capello could only look on as the drip-feed of anti-Terry stories intensified.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As trusted assistant Franco Baldini gauged reaction from various figures across the country, including Bridge's club boss at Manchester City Roberto Mancini, Capello was told by senior FA figures he had full control over the decision.</p>
              <p>Although Capello needed time, he was also aware the matter needed to be dealt with prior to his departure for Warsaw tomorrow ahead of Sunday's Euro 2012 draw.</p>
              <p>He therefore called Terry to Wembley this afternoon for a meeting that apparently lasted for less than 15 minutes, seemingly informing the Chelsea star in the process that he would no longer wear the coveted armband that would bring with it immortality should England go on to win the World Cup next summer.</p>

              <p>Terry didn't want to give up on the captaincy cos it came with lots of benefits and power... He should have done the honourable thing and quit when the news first broke out... I think more people are just as upset when he took out the “super-injunction” preventing publication of allegations about his relationship with Bridge's son mother...</p>
              <p>I am afraid for him more bad news could be coming out very soon... But I guess its ok now at least he isn't the National team captain anymore... Phew...</p>

              allegations against Terry are proven they call into question his role
              as England captain.</p>
              <p>February 1: The FA says England manager Fabio Capello alone will decide whether Terry remains as England captain.</p>
              <p>February 3: Terry's spokesman Phil Hall says Terry will make no
              announcement regarding his future as England captain before meeting
              Capello.</p>
              <p>February 5: Terry is axed as England captain following a meeting with Capello.</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Chelsea’s Terry tipped to lose £20M in commercial earnings from England captaincy axe</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> skipper <abbr><span class="glossary-term">John Terry</span></abbr> faces projected losses of £20 million after being stood down as England captain.</p>
              <p><em>The Sun</em> says the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> defender, 29, was stripped of the armband - and replaced by <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rio Ferdinand</span></abbr> - after a 12-minute meeting with boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fabio Capello</span></abbr> at Wembley yesterday.</p>
              <p>Sponsorship experts believe the fall-out from Terry's affair with
              England team-mate Wayne Bridge's ex-partner Vanessa Perroncel will cost
              him several lucrative contracts.</p>
              <p>His only current individual contract is a £4m boot deal with Umbro after his contract with King of Shaves ended in 2008.</p>
              <p>Success by England at this summer's World Cup - and the prospect
              of him holding the trophy aloft - would have catapulted Terry into a
              different market.</p>
              <p>Now he has no chance of emulating <abbr><span class="glossary-term">David Beckham</span></abbr>, a magnet to blue-chip sponsors like Vodafone, Gillette and Pepsi, who offered contracts valued at between £3m and £5m each.</p>
              <p>Terry, worth an estimated £17m with club earnings of £150,000 a
              week, will also now miss out on the £250,000 captain's bonus from the
              team's sponsorship cash share-out.</p>
              <p>Then there would have been the inevitable book after South
              Africa - with a bigger advance for any England skipper - and spin-offs
              with clothing brands.</p>
              <p>Dr Sue Bridgewater, a lecturer in sports marketing at Warwick
              Business School, said: "As Tiger Woods found out to his cost, earnings
              can be substantially hit.</p>
              <p>"Companies had not made much use of Terry in marketing terms
              even before all this but the potential was there given the prospect of
              the World Cup this summer.</p>
              <p>"Previous England captains have all earned significant sums and the most successful, of course, was <abbr><span class="glossary-term">David Beckham</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>"He is seen to have a positive image outside the sport, especially in the Far East where they see him as a strong family man."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Such is the aura that surrounds Fabio Capello among England's players that no one will question his uncompromising decision to axe John Terry as captain in a 12 minute meeting.</strong></p>
              <p>Not even Terry being reduced to tears as he begged to keep his job could move the Italian, who will never again consider him as leadership material, despite the player's bizarre hopes yesterday. As far as Capello's camp is concerned, Terry has had his chance, barring a quite extraordinary spate of injuries.</p>
              <p>The extraordinary sight of 29-year old Terry dialling the number of Vanessa Perroncel in front of Capello and suggesting that he should speak to her then and there, so she could reassure him that she would not be speaking publicly about their affair, would merely have confirmed to the manager that he had come to the right decision.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">'He got out his mobile phone and started to dial her number, saying that Fabio could speak to her himself,' said an FA source. 'But the manager's mind was made up and he waved him away, saying he did not want to do that.</p>
              </div>
              <p>'John said Wayne knew about what happened quite a while ago and that they were both OK about it, that it had all been sorted out. John said it was just the media that had blown it all up.</p>
              <p>'But Fabio was in a no-nonsense mood and said he'd made his mind up. He was worried about the damage to the team. John became increasingly frustrated and angry towards the end. He was tearful and continued to argue his case. In the end, Fabio walked out and left him there.'</p>
              <p>Terry was in a withdrawn mood yesterday, practising with his teammates at Chelsea's Cobham training ground and said to be distraught at the turn of events. He may rule the roost at Chelsea, where he once boasted he had direct access to owner Roman Abramovich, but he misunderstood the chain of command with England, where Capello will allow no special relationships with players and is underwhelmed by their celebrity status.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/06/article-0-082E3598000005DC-578_468x286.jpg" alt="John Terry" width="468" height="286">

              <p><strong>Terry misjudged the situation and the brevity of their meeting offers the clearest clue as to the amount of sympathy Capello feels for his former captain's predicament.</strong></p>
              <p>The Chelsea skipper was sufficiently composed by Friday evening to contact his successor, Rio Ferdinand, congratulate him and offer full support. But significantly, Capello himself saw no need to do the same. The Manchester United defender, ironically serving a four-game ban after striking Hull striker Craig Fagan in the face and is in dispute with the FA over the length of his suspension, was yesterday confined to watching his team from the stands, sitting between Ryan Giggs and John O'Shea.</p>
              <p>Ferdinand may be Capello's new leader - with Sir Alex Ferguson's blessing - but the Italian deals with awarding the honour in a workman like rather than ceremonial manner. Indeed, the last time he appointed Ferdinand as captain, before a friendly against France in March 2008, he did so in the most perfunctory manner.</p>
              <p>Following a communal meal, Capello announced the team, adding at its conclusion, 'Captain: Ferdinand,' before leaving the room to allow his players to digest the news.</p>
              <p>It has taken an Italian to restore much-needed leadership to the post of England manager, exercising a confident and unapologetic authority over his charges which seemed to have disappeared out of fashion in an era in which player-power has grown exponentially. He genuinely treats all players the same, or rather he treats all players as subjects under his rule, and even Bridge, for whom there is enormous sympathy in the England camp after the revelation that Terry conducted an extra-marital affair with his former long-term girlfriend, will be no exception.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/06/article-0-082DEC10000005DC-127_468x350.jpg" alt="Wayne Bridge " width="468" height="350">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Two's company: Wayne Bridge takes on Hull pair Paul McShane (6) and Steven Mouyokolo</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Having arranged for the two players to speak and having pronounced on the subject itself, Capello expects the subject to be closed, however difficult that may be for Bridge. The pair will be expected to share a dressing room at the World Cup, and possibly in three weeks' time when England take on Egypt at Wembley.</strong></p>
              <p>Capello will revert to his normal football criterion, making no special arrangements.</p>
              <p>Bridge, who played in Manchester City's 2-1 defeat at Hull yesterday after two months out with a knee injury, will be selected on form, as will Terry As a source close to the players said: 'They don't need to have to go out to dinner together or be friends in order to have a working relationship. But it looks as though they have reached the point whereby they are able to think about what is best for themselves and for the England team. It is a big dressing room and they don't have to have a peg right next to each other. But will they be able to play together at the World Cup? Yes.'</p>
              <p>Bridge had resolved not to play again with Terry but has been advised to bide his time. Having seen Terry stripped of the captaincy he is likely to accept Capello's expected invitation to join the squad.</p>
              <p>Capello will want assurances that the scandal will not cause any damaging confrontations, with both players to be warned that if it were to spill over into clashes on the training ground, it would result in their expulsion from the squad.</p>
              <p>There can be no doubting Capello would follow through on his threat. He has squashed bigger names than Terry. Ruud Gullit was a former European Footballer of the Year when Capello took charge at AC Milan and he had no compunction in regularly dropping him, even once instructing his assistants to haul Gullit off the team coach when the player mistakenly thought he was in the squad.</p>
              <p>'Sometimes you have confrontations [with Capello] but I respected him as a coach,' said Gullit. 'Sometimes I didn't agree with decisions he made, but I accepted them.'</p>
