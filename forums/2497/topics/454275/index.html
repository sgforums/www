              <p>Do you think Starhub lose money on Euro2012 broadcasting rights in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>I think they lost big time this year .</p>
              <p>This year's competition . . . very little places , like coffee shop , broadcasted any live on their TV .</p>
              <p>4 years ago , still can see in places like Geylang , Jalan Besar , housinge estates food court and 24hours coffee shops , do broadcaster for free .</p>
              <p>This year , the whole of Jurong i hardly can find one place (except Mcdonalds) .</p>

              <p>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p>An insensitive posse of Melburnian burglars, with no consideration for the art of sports watching, briefly ruined my life in 2001. They stole my wife's jewellery. Fine. They filched my DVD player. Acceptable. They tried to lift my old-fashioned TV set (but the weaklings failed). Bearable.</p>
              <p>But, unforgivably and unbearably, they stole my TV remote. Perhaps they were too young to appreciate that the remote, for men, is the modern equivalent of the caveman's club. Our security blanket, our weapon to brandish.</p>
              <p>But now we are victims of our own vanity. Now we have more remotes than a metrosexual has hair gels. TV, DVD, Mio, StarHub, fan, AC. Now some of us are plain spoilt.</p>
              <p>In the old days, our fathers used us as remotes. Now we press buttons, then they tapped us on the head: go, change. It was a time when we'd ascend roofs, fiddle with antennas, get grainy, hiccuping pictures of Bjorn Borg and think life was poetic in black and white. To be connected to the sports world was a privilege. Now, in this city, it's for the privileged.</p>
              <p>There's HD, super-slow motion, a taping facility and commentators who believe that since everything is excessive in sports so, too, must be their words. There's sepak takraw, spelling bees on ESPN and men who pull tractors with their pinkies. There are over 20 sporting channels to choose from, but it's like an insidious worm eating slowly into your wallet.</p>
              <p>Yes, alas, sports is not a fundamental right, but it has become fundamentally insane. French Open on one Pay-TV provider, Wimbledon on the next. Cricket? Pay up. EPL? Fork out. World Cup? Sell wife's remaining jewellery. You can either prostrate yourself before a boss for a raise or cull a sport from your list.</p>
              <p>Of course, it's all our fault. If the EPL is selling its rights for $6 billion, a sure sign that the sporting apocalypse is upon us, it's because we're gaga about it and they know. Passion always has a new price.</p>
              <p>We titter about player wages - which is what we should truly protest about - but in fact we are paying them. The more we're hysterical about football, the more the EPL can demand, the more the clubs get as a cut, the more we have to pay.</p>
              <p>Sports is no longer just a series of romantic episodes from a Mills &amp; Boon factory - ironically, they first published sports books - it is now also a brutal business.</p>
              <p>In the past week or so, Rafa has perspired in Paris, Tiger Woods is wearing his Mount Rushmore face in San Francisco, Lewis Hamilton reminded us only in football are the English boring, LeBron James and Kevin Durant duelled in the air and Manny Pacquiao got caught by age. If you had to see it all, your monthly cost would be roughly $150.</p>
              <p>Still, the affluent among us will shrug, bitch and buy. But not everyone can. If you're not on cable, then you feel like an extra-terrestrial. Unfairly locked out of the sporting planet. Here, in this no cable-little sports world, instead of that daddy called Federer, you get a 40th re-run of The Mummy.</p>
              <p>But the movie actor and the sports star are separated by a valuable gap in authenticity. Brendan Fraser's chases require special effects; Fernando Torres produces an effect which is special. He inspires. But only if you can see him.</p>
              <p>Sports, we might argue, is primarily entertainment and thus like movies in a hall must come with a ticket price. But sports also does more, it binds, it teaches, it connects, it raises possibilities.</p>
              <p>In India, even though cricket rights are prohibitively expensive, all one-day internationals are shown free on the local broadcaster, Doordarshan. And when an Indian colleague travelled to Kashmir, riven with troubles, she found kids watching cricket, playing, aspiring, because they had found an inexpensive route to connect.</p>
              <p>It is this balance, in an expensive viewing world, we must strive for. A strong percentage of Singapore homes may have pay-TV (but can they afford most sport packages?), but there is still a reasonable number who see a blank when Mario Gomez does his goal ballet.</p>
              <p>What is unarguable is that only the deeply hungry morph into champions and hunger often arrives from adversity. To turn viewing into an elitist activity which keeps sports away from those who find the strongest inspiration from it defies the idea of a wider sporting culture, and spirit, that we keep chirping about.</p>
              <p>And it matters more in a nation where you require television because there's no constant fix of world-class sports at a stadium down the road.</p>
              <p>Some level of sports on terrestrial TV would restore a balance. Not everything, but something beyond two-footed Lions and netball reruns. Every man need not be a vain picture of five juggling remotes. But just one will suffice, where a person can click, and find sports for free, and fantasise. A watcher connected to the world's most inclusive pastime instead of being remote from it.</p>
              <p>There is a lovely story about a runner in the marathon at the 1992 Olympics. Valentina Yegorova came from a small farming village in Russia named Iziderkino which had no television set.</p>
              <p>So the mayor decided that each of the 500 households would contribute and an ancient black and a white TV set was purchased. It was positioned on the doorstep of Yegorava's house, but facing outwards so everyone could watch. But at least they watched.</p>
              <p>Yegorova went on to win Olympic gold and the effect of this moment worked both ways. It offered the village the idea that anything was possible. And it offered her the power of support, or as she tearfully said once: 'The people watched the television and prayed for me.'</p>
              <p>Except if this was in Singapore, and you didn't have cable, and a kid from your locality was involved in the London Olympics - of which only parts apparently will be on terrestrial TV - it is possible you might miss this. Might not be moved. Might not become, for a short while, one vast united village. And it would be a pity.</p>

              <p>How much they paid for it they are not going to tell us the truth. Take Singtel for example, they always report that they paid $400m for the EPL but in truth, it's all made up. The reports always say... Reported to be $400m, or rumoured to be... But never give a definite sum. They are not going to tell the public how much they paid for it... They are not even telling their shareholders how much they paid for it which by right they should but afraid the truth will come out to the public. Otherwise how are they going to justify charging fans $34.90 for it?</p>
              <p>Now they are already preparing the ground for the next increase... Expect to pay more from 2013 season onwards.</p>
              <p>I believed starhub make a tidy sum from the Euro even when there is lesser subscribing this time around as the lesser few made up with the higher chargers.</p>

              <p>The Euro could have been more exciting for the local fans had more people been given the chance to follow it. However the pricing have more of less priced lots of fans out of the game. If you don't watch it, then you will be less excited by it... If you are less excited by it, then you will not talk much about it in your normal daily routine...</p>
              <p>For me i didn't subscribe as i didn't want to pay so much for it. I personally know quite a lot of guys who forego it as well. This being the case, we don't talk so much about it or the match moments like we do with previous WC or Euro. We only follow it by reading the news and watching the goals on the internet. So the excitement is really none existence, it's like reading the newspaper during your free time to catch up. lol...</p>

              i hate the telcos.
              
              football, being one of the most watched sports, is like stable food.  they made it so ex i dont subscribe anymore.
              
              thank you singapore.  for this i am sure we are number 1.

              <p>The traditional support for Euro is for England team.</p>
              <p>But, this year they choose a low profile manager who choose a low profile team.</p>
              <p>So, the support is not there.</p>
              <p>I agreed on the point that they are over-charging to the package to make more profits.</p>
              <p>Therefore, most of fans did not subscribe it even though it is the school holiday.</p>
              <p>The boycott is on and the timing also does not allow any one to watch every matches.</p>
              <p>Since they are showing semi and final for free, what is the need to subscribe ?</p>
              <p>Lastly, every one is more worried about their rice bowl to have any time for soccer.</p>
