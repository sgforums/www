            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/rafa.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>BenÃ­tez plotting greatest comeback since Valencia at Liverpool</strong></span><br><br>Liverpool are drawing encouragement from their manager's recent history as they contemplate the possibility of overhauling Manchester United and Chelsea at the top of the Premiership, with Rafael BenÃ­tez having inspired a similarly unlikely pursuit at Valencia.<br><br>Five years ago this week BenÃ­tez responded to successive defeats by calling an impromptu press conference at the Mestalla. Valencia had just lost at home to Valladolid to leave them nine points off the leaders, Real Madrid, with disaffection sweeping through the stands and the boardroom. And yet BenÃ­tez insisted his side could still claim their first Primera Division title in 31 years, with the subsequent 17 matches yielding a staggering 13 wins and a single defeat.<br><br>By the time Real Betis were overcome on the final afternoon, Valencia had built a seven-point lead at the top and Benitez's reputation was established. The Spaniard, his side trailing United by 11 points with 14 games to play, is now hoping he can instigate a similar late-season charge with Liverpool in the Premiership.<br><br>"You have to be calm and quiet about your targets," he said, adopting a more subdued approach to five years ago following Saturday's 2-0 victory over Chelsea. "We're five points behind and it's a long race, but we're in form and we can try and get even closer now.<br><br>"We've shown, by beating Chelsea in the manner we did, that we are a very good team. We have a better squad than before, and we can beat anyone. We'd done it in the cups in the past, but now we've done it in the Premier League. Can we do what we did at Valencia? I'll tell you in three or four weeks, but if we maintain this form, we'll be a lot closer to Manchester United as well as to Chelsea."<br><br>In Liverpool's favour is the fact that they must still welcome United to Anfield, where they are unbeaten in the league since October 2005, with Arsenal also due on Merseyside before the end of the campaign. Liverpool have won eight of their past nine league games and, with 46 points, have a one more than they did at this stage last season.<br><br>Certain members of BenÃ­tez's playing staff are still urging caution, but there was clear satisfaction in having finally triumphed in the Premiership against the champions. "We had a good weekend, but there's no point putting any pressure on ourselves," said Jamie Carragher.<br><br>"We've got to just focus on winning as many games as we can and keep the pressure on the top two. The target now is to catch Chelsea. That's what Saturday's result has done for us. We've given ourselves a chance."<br><br></div>
