              <p><br>Nope Man utd and arsenal were already noticing him many seasons ago. Arsene wenger wanted him when hleb went. But then again he wanted nasri. Rumours were that arsene will go for both, but knowing wenger and his stingy-ness, he would only go for one and he went for nasri, the one with a more positive attitude.</p>
              <p>Marseille  did not immediately agree to sell nasri because they needed a replacement. Suprisingly, Lyon were ready to let ben arfa go. And that time, real madrid came and enquire about ben arfa. Many thought that ben arfa would end up at madrid, thus killing arsene's dream of getting nasri.</p>
              <p>But who knows, in the end marseille and ben arfa were ready to strike a deal that brings the player across to marseille and thus freeing up samir nasri to join arsenal.</p>
              <p>Personally I have always thought that both nasri and ben arfa are quality players and it would be great to have both of them. But I have always known that ben arfa has attitude problem, something like what players like david bentley, adebayor and jermaine pennant are having.</p>
              <p>Therefore as an arsenal fan, i would certainly be happy that we did not land him.</p>
