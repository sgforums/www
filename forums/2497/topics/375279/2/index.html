              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">EMMANUEL ADEBAYOR goaded Arsenal fans again last night by saying: I can't wait to see you at the Emirates. </h2>
              <p class="article">The FA are ready to throw the book at Adebayor for his hair-brained antics in Manchester City's 4-2 win over his old club Arsenal. </p>
              <p class="article">The City striker stamped on former team-mate Robin van Persie's head and later sparked trouble by running 90 yards to celebrate his goal in front of furious Gunners supporters at Eastlands.</p>
              <p class="article">But he insisted he is not scared of facing the fans when the teams clash again on April 24 next year. </p>
              <p class="article">He said: "I can go and play at the Emirates for the return game, why not? I play for Manchester City and if they want me to go and play, I will play." </p>
              <p class="article">Van Persie was left with a cut on his cheek after his clash with Adebayor and issued a statement branding the Togo hitman "mindless and malicious". </p>
              <p class="article">Adebayor said: "After the game I saw him and said sorry but he didn't even want to speak to me." </p>
              <p class="article">Adebayor, who joined City for £25million, is likely to face separate improper conduct charges and faces a <strong>SIX-MATCH </strong>ban. </p>
              <p class="article">One steward was taken to hospital and fans were injured as trouble flared after Adebayor taunted the visitors at Eastlands. </p>
              <p class="article">FA chief executive Ian Watmore said: "I was at the game so I saw it with my own eyes. "I was pretty unimpressed because the problems between the Arsenal fans and Adebayor are well documented but he still ran the whole length of the field to celebrate."</p>

              <p>Local police were unhappy with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> striker Emmanuel Adebayor's goal celebrations against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> on Saturday.</p>
              <p>A police spokesman told the <em>Daily Mail</em>: "A player in a
              goal celebration caused the opposition fans to be aggravated. There was
              a crowd surge. An object has been thrown and caught a steward and
              knocked him out. We have not arrested anyone for that.</p>
              <p>"It's down to the club, ground security and the FA whether they
              want to take the incident any further. It must have been horrific for
              the stewards at the time.</p>
              <p>"It was not the player throwing the missile but the fans were reacting to him. <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> fans were throwing the missiles but it was a <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> player doing the celebrating."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ROY KEANE has defended Emmanuel Adebayor's controversial goal celebration. Manchester City striker Adebayor landed himself in hot water on Saturday for taunting Arsenal fans after he scored.</h2>
              <p class="article">But ex-Manchester United star Keane believes the FA and fans should not make too much of it. The Ipswich boss said: "Fair play to the boy, I think he's apologised after the game. He probably knows he's done a bit wrong.</p>
              <p class="article">"The Arsenal fans were clearly frustrated with his behaviour but players make mistakes. "When he scored he got a bit carried away. "We shouldn't go overboard on him. I think we should go easy on the boy. "He's apologised and from my point of view, if he was one of my players I'd hope everybody would leave it at that."</p>

              <p><strong>Manchester City striker Emmanuel Adebayor sees no reason why he should be punished by the Football Association.</strong>  </p>
              <p>It seems certain the FA will this week charge the £25million <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Manchester City</span></span></a> forward with violent conduct for his apparent stamp on Robin van Persie's face during Saturday's 4-2 win over <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Arsenal</span></span></a>. </p>
              <p>Adebayor is also expected to face a separate charge for his inflammatory goal celebration, which could bring additional punishment. </p>
              <p>FA chief executive Ian Watmore yesterday confirmed they would 'take a good close look' at both incidents, the latter of which referee Mark Clattenburg decided was worthy of a booking.  </p>
              <p>But former Gunners striker Adebayor, who ran the length of the pitch to celebrate in front of Arsenal fans after scoring, said: 'I don't know what I have done wrong to get banned.</p>
              <p>'I have not heard the police or FA want to talk to me. The club have not said anything.  </p>

              <p><strong>Emmanuel Adebayor is facing at least a four-match suspension after it emerged that the FA are investigating a third incident involving the Manchester City striker in Saturday's match with Arsenal.</strong></p>
              <p>While Adebayor is expected to be charged today for his stamp on Robin van Persie, and could yet face sanctions for his 90-yard run to celebrate his goal in front of the travelling Arsenal support, an earlier clash with Gunners skipper Cesc Fabregas is also believed to be under investigation.</p>
              <p>'FA officials will today review footage of the incidents, with disciplinary chiefs certain to fast-track a decision on the Manchester City striker's dangerous kick at Van Persie,' reports The Daily Mail.</p>
              <p>'Adebayor is expected to receive an instant three-match ban for violent conduct, ruling him out of Sunday's derby at Manchester United. Last night, the FA said the stamp on Fabregas's ankle, which came to light yesterday, could result in an additional charge of violent conduct and an even longer ban.'</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Step too far: Adebayor makes contact with Van Persie's face during Manchester City's controversial clash with Arsenal</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The newspaper has also accused Adebayor of 'slapping' Arsenal midfielder Alex Song.</strong></p>
              <p>Although referee Mark Clattenburg cautioned Adebayor for his goading of the Arsenal support after scoring, The Times says that 'The FA is determined to send out the strongest possible statement about on-the-field conduct,' and a charge of improper conduct will almost certainly be imposed after the governing body receive reports from City and police.</p>
              <p>The police yesterday condemned Adebayor for the behaviour that sparked a melee behind the City goal and resulted in one steward being knocked unconscious.</p>
              <p>"A player in a goal celebration caused the opposition fans to be aggravated. There was a crowd surge. An object has been thrown and caught a steward and knocked him out. We have not arrested anyone for that," a spokesman said.</p>
              <p>"It's down to the club, ground security and the FA whether they want to take the incident any further. It must have been horrific for the stewards at the time.</p>
              <p>"It was not the player throwing the missile but the fans were reacting to him. Arsenal fans were throwing the missiles but it was a Manchester City player doing the celebrating."</p>
