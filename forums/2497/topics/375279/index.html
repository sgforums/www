              <h3>EMMANUEL ADEBAYOR was condemned as 'mindless and malicious' by Robin Van Persie after the Manchester City striker's ugly stamp. </h3>
              <p>The Arsenal striker claims former team-mate Adebayor set out to deliberately injure him during City's 4-2 victory.</p>
              <p>Now Adebayor now faces a three-match ban and Van Persie said: "I am sad and disappointed by my former team-mate Emmanuel Adebayor's mindless and malicious stamp on me during today's match.</p>
              <h4>Physical</h4>
              <p>"We are both professional footballers and I know that the game is physical. I too have made hard and sometimes mis-timed challenges but never with the intention of hurting an opponent. He set out to hurt me. </p>
              <p>"I knew he was aiming for a collision because he changed the angle of his body to allow contact to be made. </p>
              <p>"He moved backwards when his natural momentum would have taken him forward. I find that deeply disrespectful. He has shown a real lack of class today, to me and the fans. </p>
              <p>"I do feel lucky that I have not suffered a greater injury. The contact was only centimetres from my eye.</p>
              <h4>Agenda</h4>
              <p>"I have not received an apology from him, there were no words exchanged afterwards. He had his own agenda today and that is bad for football. It's bad for the game we all love. </p>
              <p>"I want to make it clear that this has nothing to do with the result of today's match. We do not hide from that disappointment but I need to speak out about his behaviour." </p>
              <p>The FA will act swiftly after referee Mark Clattenburg missed Adebayor's lunge which left Van Persie with two gashes on his face. </p>
              <p>The Manchester City striker's disciplinary case will be fast-tracked and he looks certain to miss three matches - including next weekend's Manchester derby.</p>
              <h4>Video</h4>
              <p>Clattenburg will be asked to review a video of the incident today and is expected to say he would have issued a red card to Adebayor, who left Arsenal in the summer, if he had witnessed the clash. </p>
              <p>That would allow the FA to act and hand down a ban.</p>

              <p>Ade score and help Arsenal and the fan still boo him. Even Ronaldo say want to go RM but after he decide to stay another year in Man U. Man U fans still cheer him whenever he score. That is the different between Man U and Arsenal.</p>

              <p>Adebayor, who scored City's third goal, looked lucky to stay on the field in the 70th minute when his apparent assault went unseen by referee Mark Clattenburg. Replays suggested that Adebayor knew what he was doing when his right foot made contact with a prone Van Persie, though he denied it after the game. If Clattenburg confirms he did not see the incident, the FA could ban Adebayor on video evidence.</p>
              <p>There was clearly contact close to the Dutchman's eye and he needed treatment for a facial wound. Van Persie said: "I knew he was aiming for a collision because he changed the angle of his body to allow contact to be made.</p>
              <p>"He moved backwards when his natural momentum would have taken him forward. I find that deeply disrespectful. He has shown a real lack of class today, to me and the fans."</p>
              <p>Arsenal supporters were further infuriated when, 10 minutes after the stamping incident, Adebayor taunted them after scoring to put City 3-1 ahead. He then shot off to the other end of the pitch like Usain Bolt and slid on to his knees in front of the away supporters with his arms raised.</p>
              <p>As he celebrated his goal, Arsenal’s fans vented their fury. A steward was hit by a bottle and a plastic chair – belonging to a photographer – was thrown at the player.</p>
              <p>The former Gunners striker, who joined Manchester City in a £25million summer deal,  sparked frightening scenes at Eastlands.</p>
              <p>Adebayor said his collision with Van Persie was unintentional but the Arsenal man was unconvinced. "I do feel lucky that I have not suffered a greater injury," he said. "The contact was only centimetres from my eye. I have not received an apology from him, there were no words exchanged afterwards. He had his own agenda today and that is bad for football. It's bad for the game we all love. I want to make it clear that this has nothing to do with the result of today's match. We do not hide from that disappointment but I need to speak out about his behaviour."</p>

              <p>I am a bit disappointed with Wenger leh... cos I believe he saw it, he even step out of his seat with both hands open asking what's going on kind of gesture but decided to say nothing of it at the end of the match during his interview cos ade was one of his own player not too long ago...</p>

              <p><strong>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said: 'I don't want to assess Adebayor's performance - he's not my player. His celebration was not of the highest elegance but it's out of my control.'</strong></p>
              <p>City manager Mark Hughes added his own apology and said: 'He understands that was the wrong thing to do and has already apologised. It was an emotional guy and it was an emotional moment.</p>
              <p>'I think he just wanted to enjoy the moment with the City fans and, obviously, he knew there were Arsenal fans in the vicinity, so it was the wrong thing to do.</p>
              <p>'We should maybe cut him some slack given what he's been through in the past 18 months.'</p>
              <p>Asked whether he feared Adebayor would face a ban, Hughes added: 'I've no idea. We'll have to wait and see.'</p>
              <p>Both Hughes and Wenger said they had not seen the incident in which Adebayor stamped on Van Persie's head but TV pictures showed it clearly.</p>

              <p>He said: “I was trying to kick the ball, I saw him tackle in front and I did not have any time to get out.</p>
              <p>“I am trying to kick the ball, I think my feet touched his head. I told
              him straightaway that I am sorry and I told him at the end of the
              match. It was going to be a physical game.”</p>
              <p>Gunners boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsene Wenger</span></abbr> said: “I do not want to assess his performance because he is not my player.</p>

              <p>"We have to cut Emmanuel a bit of slack,” Hughes told City's website.
              “He is an emotional guy and was caught up in the moment. It was a
              fantastic goal and great finish. He has already apologised on camera
              and that is the right thing to do because obviously it can be
              provocative.</p>
              <p>“We just have to understand that he is an emotional guy and he
              wanted to share the moment with the fans in the corner with whom he has
              a special affinity. It is the same area that the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> fans were in so there is the potential for people to see it as the wrong thing to do. We recognise that and so does Ade.”</p>
