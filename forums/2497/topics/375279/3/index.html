              <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/arsene-wenger"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Arsène Wenger</strong></span></a><strong> has told </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/mark-hughes"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Mark Hughes</strong></span></a><strong> that he is the only man who believes in </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/emmanuel-adebayor"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Emmanuel Adebayor</strong></span></a><strong>'s innocence, as he laid into the </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Manchester City</strong></span></a><strong> striker for the challenge that left Robin van Persie dazed and bloodied at Eastlands on Saturday.</strong></p>
              <p>"It looks very bad," said Wenger, the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/arsenal"><span style="color: #005689;">Arsenal</span></a> manager, after he learned that Adebayor had been charged by the Football Association with violent and improper conduct. "You ask 100 people; 99 will say it's very bad and the hundredth will be Mark Hughes."</p>
              <p>Adebayor's violent conduct charge is for the stamp that caught his former strike partner Van Persie on the side of the face during City's 4-2 victory. The improper conduct charge relates to the manner in which he celebrated the scoring of his goal in front of the travelling Arsenal fans. He faces a three-match ban for the former and an additional one or two games for the latter.</p>
              <p>Hughes, the City manager, has defended Adebayor, insisting that there was "no malice" behind the challenge on Van Persie but Wenger begged to differ. "Did you watch it?" he said, when asked whether there had been any malicious intent, as Van Persie has already claimed. "I shouldn't have to answer that question.</p>
              <p>"But you watched it, you have watched football for years, you know as well as me what a player can do. You can always ease off or not ease off. I played football and I know exactly, in a fraction of a second, when you master well your body, where you leave in or you move out. You know exactly at that fraction, 'I can injure somebody or I can not injure somebody' and you ease off or you leave in.</p>
              <p>"In England, you have many cases where the players leave in, although less now than 10 years ago. You have some challenges 10 years ago where if you did that in the street, you go to jail.</p>
              <p>"Of course we are disappointed," Wenger added, "because when you go to the head, you are always scared for people. You want to be protected, and this is Adebayor or anybody else. I think it was a very bad challenge, surprisingly bad. I didn't expect him to do that, but the referee should have sent him off for his challenge on Cesc Fábregas.</p>
              <p>"I was surprised that there was such animosity in Adebayor's attitude towards Arsenal because Arsenal was great to him. He will realise that in a few years. That's why I was deeply surprised and shocked. It has now become the case of Man City and the FA and we do not want to interfere in that. But you ask me what my opinion is, did he do it on purpose? I say yes."</p>
              <p>Wenger was asked whether he saw any similarities between the Birmingham City defender Martin Taylor's tackle which broke the leg of Eduardo da Silva in February 2008 and Adebayor's challenge on Van Persie. "In Eduardo's case, it was an act of clumsiness and this time, I don't think the two things are comparable," he replied. "In Eduardo's case, you have more doubt than in this case."</p>
              <p>Van Persie issued a statement in the hours after the City game, in which he rounded on Adebayor in the strongest of terms. "Of course I back Robin; in football everybody is free to have an opinion," said Wenger. "If somebody stamps on your head in that way, you wouldn't say, 'Thank you very much, can I turn the other cheek'. Only Jesus Christ did that."</p>

              <p>well, true la, but we should be objective and see from both ends right?</p>
              <p>Fans do pay for the game, and etc, but if they want to taunt, surely, they should be expected to receive, right?</p>
              <p>anyway, I am not condoning what Ade done, and FA already pass their judgement.</p>

              <p>unlike ade, drogba try very hard to win back the hearts of

              <p>if u r arsenal fans, you would notice there is lacking of
              commitment  in his performance last season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if he can perform week in week out in man city shirt for
              arsenal, no arsenal fans would have boo him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to ade, he think he is everything. he think he deserve respect
              irregardless of his performance.  y no one boo toure but
              instead, he get oviation from arsenal supporters during the man
              city games. players just have to look at themselves. u dont become
