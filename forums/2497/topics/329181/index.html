              <h2>Samuel Eto'o has revealed that he turned down offers to join
              Olympique Lyonnais and a team in Uzbekistan over the summer and gave
              his reasons why.</h2>
              <p>The Cameroonian international admitted that he was not prepared to move
              to Stade Gerland because the salary on offer did not match what he had
              asked for.<br><br>Despite the, Eto'o did not rule out moving to the
              French champions in the future because he would like to live in France
              and has friends at the club.<br><br>"Lyon did make a big effort but I
              could not go there and I want to think their president Jean-Michel
              Aulas for his interest even though they could not match what I asked
              for," he told TF1's Telefoot programme.<br><br>"I have friends in Lyon
              such Makoun and may be one day I could go there. For someone from
              Cameroon like me, to live in France would be great."<br><br>The Uzbeki
              outfit that wanted Eto'o were prepared to pay him an increidble sum for
              a short stay, but Eto'o felt that the move would have been below him.<br><br>"They
              offered me $25m to spend two or three months there. My head was
              spinning because of that offer, but everyone had to understand that as
              a Cameroon international I had to aim higher and play for a big club,"
              he continued.<br><br>"That was why I could not accept that offer."<br><br>Eto'o
              was expected to leave Barcelona at the end of last season but his
              impressive attitude and form in pre-season convinced coach Pep
              Guardiola to keep him at Camp Nou.</p>
