Valencia defender David Navarro has apologised for his role in the fracas.</strong><br><br>Navarro, a non-playing substitute, sparked a free-for-all with a punch which broke Nicolas Burdisso's nose. A goalless draw at the Mestalla took Valencia through to the quarter-finals on the away goals rule following the 2-2 draw in Milan.<br><br>Moratti said: "We will let the Uefa delegate do whatever he has to do." Inter coach Roberto Mancini dubbed Navarro "a coward" for his act. Mancini said: "Now I have seen the footage there's nothing else you can say about someone who throws a punch like that and runs away."<br><br>Valencia midfielder Carlos Marchena looked to kick out at Burdisso after exchanging words. The incident sparked the brawl and Navarro, who had not featured in the match, ran on to the middle of the pitch and punched Burdisso.<br><br>Several Inter players tried to trip up Navarro as he ran off the pitch and the fighting continued in the tunnel and outside the dressing rooms. Navarro said: "I have never behaved in this fashon before and I will never do it again, I am very sorry and ashamed.<br><br>"I saw that they were trying to attack a team-mate and I lost my nerve," Navarro told Spanish radion station Cadena Star. Navarro, who intends to contact Burdisso to apologice in person, added: "I haven't yet been able to see the images nor the reaction of the Inter players in our changing room, I was in another room. "It has been a lamentable incident, I want to apologise to those affected by my actions."<br><br>Inter goalkeeper Francesco Toldo entered the Valencia dressing room, while Luis Figo and Inter's Esteban Cambiasso were involved in scuffles as they tried to follow him before security guards intervened.<br><br>Inter Milan coach Roberto Mancini said he was deeply disappointed by the incident. "A Valencia player went mad when he came on to the pitch and hit Burdisso. He broke Burdisso's nose. "Toldo saw the incident and it is possible he went into the Valencia dressing room. "Players have to learn how to behave on the pitch."<br><br>Valencia's Italian defender Emiliano Moretti expressed his surprise at his team-mate's actions. "Navarro is a perfectly normal person and I don't know what would cause him to do such a thing," he told Italian television.<br></div>

Valencia substitute David Navarro sparked the melee after punching Inter's Nicolas Burdisso - breaking the Argentinian's nose in the process - with players from both teams quickly becoming involved.<br><br>The disruption continued in the tunnel with Inter players attempting to get into the Valencia dressing room to confront Navarro. A UEFA spokesman said: "An investigation has been opened for the incidents which happened last night against both clubs.<br><br>"A decision is expected at the next meeting of the UEFA disciplinary body on March 22nd."<br><br>Valencia coach Quique Sanchez Flores said: "I hope that the punishment is minimal and affects us as little as possible. "The tension of football generates these situations and affects our good sense."<br><br>Inter coach Roberto Mancini was less than impressed with how events unfolded. He told www.inter.it: "I didn't see anything because I was the first person on my way back to the dressing room. "The boys told me what had happened after. "Now I have seen the footage, I can say that the Valencia player is a coward. "There's nothing else you can say about someone who throws a punch like that then runs away."<br><br>Inter president Massimo Moratti admitted the post-match brawl had come as a surprise. He said: "I'm sorry for the player (Burdisso) and for everything that happened on the pitch after the game. We honestly weren't expecting it."<br><br>Moratti added that Inter would not be taking the matter further, however. "The UEFA delegate will do what he has to do. But I don't think Inter will take any further action."<br><br></div>

Carlos Marchena and David Navarro of Valencia, and Inter's Nicolas Burdisso, Ivan Cordoba and Maicon have all been charged with gross unsporting conduct.</strong><br><br>Uefa's Control and Disciplinary Body will deal with the case on 14 March. Navarro sparked a free-for-all after breaking Burdisso's nose, with players from both teams becoming involved. The fracas continued in the tunnel with Inter players trying to confront Navarro in Valencia's dressing-room.<br><br>A goalless draw at the Mestalla took Valencia through But the result was overshadowed by events on the final whistle. Valencia midfielder Marchena appeared to kick out at Burdisso after exchanging words. The incident sparked the brawl and Navarro, a substitute who had not featured in the match, ran on to the middle of the pitch and punched Burdisso.<br><br>Several Inter players tried to trip up Navarro as he ran off the pitch and the fighting continued in the tunnel and outside the dressing rooms. Inter coach Roberto Mancini dubbed Navarro "a coward" for his act. Mancini said: "Now I have seen the footage there's nothing else you can say about someone who throws a punch like that and runs away."<br><br>Navarro has apologised for his role in the fracas and offered to go to Italy to apologise to Burdisso in person. He said: "I want to say sorry for what happened, what I did was not good. "It was a lack of respect for the football world and that's why I wanted to ask forgiveness from the Inter player.<br><br>"If I need to go to Italy to say sorry, I will. "This is a bad time for me, nothing like this has happened before because I am not a violent person. I am setting a bad example." Navarro added that he expected Uefa to come down heavily on him, and will accept the punishment meted out to him.<br><br>He said: "It's logical that I am punished by Uefa and I must be ready for anything. "I want to say sorry to Uefa and my club as the example I gave was not good, it wasn't me."<br><br>Inter goalkeeper Francesco Toldo entered the Valencia dressing room, while Luis Figo and Inter's Esteban Cambiasso were involved in scuffles as they tried to follow him before security guards intervened.<br></div>
