            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;"><span class="large">INTER CLAIM INNOCENCE</span></span><br><br>Inter Milan claim they were the innocent parties following the brawl that marred their elimination from the Champions League at the hands of Valencia. Both clubs have been charged with improper conduct by UEFA who will rule on the case on March 14. </strong><br><br>A statement posted on club website www.inter.it read: "After the concerted aggression from Valencia, Inter can absolutely neither underestimate nor forget that as the away team it was victim of a very severe situation, generated by the violent physical aggression against a footballer who has had his nose broken after being provoked."<br><br>The statement then goes on to say that the reactions that followed the punch were "the reactions of those who had seen a team-mate struck in cold blood at the end of the game and with no motive" at a time when other players were trying to restore calm.<br><br>The statement ends: "For this reason, we are sure that it will not even have escaped UEFA's committees the exact evaluation of the facts that have seen Inter as a victim provoked and subjected to aggression. "The club makes it clear that it will state its case in all the relevant sports bodies and with all the means at its disposal."<br><br>The Valencia website reported that Navarro had sought and had received Burdisso's forgiveness. Valencia progressed on the away goals rule after the 0-0 draw at the Mestalla. The first leg at the San Siro finished 2-2.<br></div>

The disciplinary body announced the decision today after examining the official reports of the delegate and referee, along with video evidence.</strong><br><br>European football's governing body also fined the Primera Liga club 250,000 Swiss francs (Â£106,000), but opted not to impose a stadium ban which will come as a huge relief for Valencia who play Chelsea in the quarter-finals.<br><br>Navarro has already apologised for his actions. "It's only logical for Uefa to punish me," he said, "and I will accept whatever sanction they choose. I want to apologise to the club, to Uefa and to Burdisso. I cannot explain why I did it and I regret it deeply. I've been trying to contact him to apologise. I spoke to my father and we were both in tears."</div>
