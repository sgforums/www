              <p>There are only 2 games in which Man U might potentially lose or draw in the league.</p>
              <p> </p>

              All I can say is that the best teams deserved to be in the finals.
              
              Now say so much also no use, have to see their performance on the day of the match and the return leg.

              that means match predictions are usually inaccurate, cos it usually involve the favourites.
              
              if Man Utd vs Bolton at Old Trafford and Bolton win, I am sure most punters would get this wrong, including myself. Who would give Bolton a chance at Old Trafford.

              <h1>Wenger plotting United downfall</h1>
              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Arsene Wenger has studied
              Manchester United at their best and worst this season in order to plot
              the downfall of the Champions League holders.</span></strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/09/04/330/Wenger1_2212078.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The Gunners head to Old
              Trafford for Wednesday night's semi-final first leg having rediscovered
              some consistency which pushed them back into the top four of the
              Premier League.</p>
              <p>However, Wenger's plans have been hit by injuries, first to the
              regular backline - although goalkeeper Manuel Almunia is expected to be
              fit to face United - and now leading scorer Robin van Persie is
              sidelined by a niggling groin problem.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, Arsenal, who cannot field the ineligible Russian
              playmaker Andrey Arshavin in Europe, still have the personnel to cause
              any side problems - as Villarreal found out to their cost in the last
              round.</p>
              <p>Captain Cesc Fabregas has been deployed in a more advanced role
              for the Champions League games, giving support to marauding wingers
              Theo Walcott and Samir Nasri, while backed up by midfielder enforcers
              Denilson and Alex Song.</p>
              <p>Wenger, however, knows his tactics must be spot on if they are
              to "annihilate" the potent attacking threat an in-form United side can
              be.</p>
              <p>"We do not necessarily change our formation depending on who we
              are playing that day. We simply try to find the best way to express our
              own qualities, while also trying to annihilate the strong points of the
              other team," Wenger said in the May edition of the official Arsenal
              magazine.</p>
              <p>"So it is a compromise. We look for a shape where we can express our strong points, as well as stopping theirs.</p>
              <p>"When we scout the opposition we watch tapes of them losing and winning.</p>
              <p>"We watch them scoring and conceding goals, so we try to exploit the weaknesses they have, which every team has."</p>
              <p>Wenger, though, maintains: "Nothing is permanent.</p>
              <p>"We always look for the best solution.</p>
              <p>"No formation can ever solve all the problems, but you always
              try to find the system which suits your players the best and that gets
              the best out of your qualities.</p>
              <p>"So I would never say that it is for definite that we will also use this system."</p>
              <p>Wenger knows possession, and making the most of it, will be key to Arsenal's chances of taking an advantage back to Emirates.</p>
              <p>"The technical level is so high in the Champions League, so it
              is important not to lose the battle in midfield. You have to be
              defensively sound as well," said Wenger, whose side beat United in the
              Premier League at Emirates earlier this season through a brace from
              Nasri.</p>
              <p>"Most of the time in recent years we have played this formation
              in Europe because you need to have a good engine and not be outnumbered
              in the park.</p>
              <p>"The best players in the world play in England now, so that is why the quality is so high."</p>
              <p>Given the loss of William Gallas to a knee injury for the
              remainder of the campaign, veteran defender Mikael Silvestre has found
              himself handed a run in the side.</p>
              <p>The 31-year-old Frenchman, signed by Wenger in the summer, was
              part of the United squad which lifted the European Cup following a
              penalty shoot-out win over Chelsea in Moscow last May.</p>
              <p>After spending some nine seasons at Old Trafford, Silvestre is relishing the chance to go up against his old club.</p>
              <p>"I still have got a lot of friends (at United), but it is part of the competition," said Silvestre.</p>
              <p>"You go to a match and you want to fight, no matter you play against, even if it is your best friend in front of you.</p>
              <p>"When you have to tackle, to win the ball, when you have to play
              the challenges, you fight for your club and you forget everything else."</p>
