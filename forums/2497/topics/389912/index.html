              <p><strong>Harry Kewell's agent has criticised Liverpool's medical staff for their handling of the Australian.</strong></p>
              <p>Kewell left Anfield for Galatasary in the summer of 2008 after a disappointing five-year spell which was blighted by injuries.</p>
              <p>His agent Bernie Mandic told the Sydney Morning Herald: "He lost three-and-a-half years of his career at Liverpool because the guys over there in England had, quite literally, no idea what they were talking about.</p>
              <p>"You have to wonder what they're doing over there. Perhaps they're trying to protect their reputations, but they're certainly not trying to protect their players.</p>
              <p>"I think it's a disgrace, as I think it was a disgrace the way Harry was treated."</p>
              <p>Kewell is currently undergoing treatment in his homeland for a groin problem but Mandic claimed Benitez had even asked the player about his treatment in light of on-going concerns about Torres' fitness.</p>
              <p>"We had Rafa Benitez call him the other night enquiring who these guys were because Fernando Torres has got such major problems now," claimed the Australian.</p>
              <p>Mandic's attack is unlikely to carry much weight inside Liverpool's Melwood training complex, where the medical staff have been credited with returning summer signing Alberto Aquilani to full fitness from an ankle injury after he was critical of his treatment in Italy.</p>

              <p><strong>The Liverpool manager allowed the Australian winger to leave Anfield on a free transfer in 2008 after five injury-ravaged years at the club, but despite suspicions in England that Kewell would never regain full fitness, he has found his career rejuvenated since joining Turkish club Galatasaray.</strong></p>
              <p>Kewell's agent, Bernie Mandic, puts the player's renaissance down to receiving specialist treatment in his homeland, and so impressed has Benítez been by the former Leeds player's recovery that he has sought advice in an attempt to seek a cure for the groin injuries which have plagued striker Fernando Torres.</p>
              <p>"We had Rafa Benítez call him the other night inquiring who these guys were because Fernando Torres has got such major problems now," Mandic said. "We have also had Jonathan Woodgate's physio inquiring about him, because he is apparently almost unfixable.</p>
              <p>"But look at Liverpool. Why is it that, over so many recent years, usually around November, lots of their key players are injured? It is always soft-tissue injuries. How come other clubs do not have that sort of dilemma? And why do their players recover quicker? There are logical reasons."</p>
              <p>Mandic blames Liverpool's medical staff for costing Kewell "3½ years" of his career after his controversial £5 million move from Elland Road.</p>
              <p>"He gets treated in Australia now because we have the best medical staff in the world," said Mandic. "People are now wondering how he has recovered when everyone in England thought he was a broken toy."</p>
