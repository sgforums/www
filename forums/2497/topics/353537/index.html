              <p><strong>All the hype in football is about forwards and fantasistas, but increasingly the battle is won and lost among the full-backs.</strong></p>
              <p>It was, strangely, Jack Charlton who first gave voice to the
              thought, claiming after the 1994 World Cup that the most important
              attacking player on the team was the full-back. At first, it sounds
              preposterous, until you consider that every World Cup since has been
              won by the team with the best pair of attacking full-backs: Jorginho
              and Branco for Brazil in 1994; Lilian Thuram and Bixente Lizarazu for
              France in 1998; Cafu and Roberto Carlos for Brazil in 2002; and
              Gianluca Zambrotta and Fabio Grosso for Italy three years ago.</p>
              <p>Now
              of course, to an extent, that is coincidence. Nobody wins anything
              simply by having a pair of good full-backs, but what the trend
              highlights is the importance of full-backs to the tactical side of the
              game. Take, for example, Spain's victory over Russia in the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/euro-2008">Euro 2008</a> semi-final. The game tends to be remembered for its 3-0 scoreline and
              used in evidence against Andrei Arshavin, but it started very evenly.</p>
              <p>Arshavin,
              it's true, struggled to escape the marking of Marcos Senna, but the
              decisive moment of the game came after 34 minutes, when David Villa was
              injured. Off he went, on came Cesc Fábregas, and Spain switched from
              4-1-3-2 to 4-1-4-1. That brought Andres Iniesta and David Silva into
              more direct confrontation with Alexander Anyukov and Yuri Zhirkov, the
              Russia full-backs whose marauding had been such a feature of the
              tournament. With their forward surges inhibited, Russia lost fluency,
              Spain took control of midfield and went on to score three times in the
              second half. Counter-intuitively, without the tournament's top scorer,
              they played more effective football – a useful reminder that goals are
              a measure of success, not a means to it.</p>
              <p>Or consider the first leg of Manchester United's <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championsleague">Champions League</a> meeting with Internazionale. In the first half, Park Ji-Sung,
              presumably selected ahead of Wayne Rooney for the purpose, restricted
              Maicon's attacking surges from right-back, which, given how narrow
              Inter's midfield was, allowed Patrice Evra to advance. If it looked at
              times as though United had an extra man it's because, effectively, they
              did.</p>
              <p>After the break, though, as Ivan Cordoba replaced the
              hapless Nelson Rivas at centre-back, Estaban Cambiasso was able to play
              higher – in the first half, he had almost become an auxiliary
              centre-back, so deep had he dropped to bail out Rivas – allowing
              Zanetti to push further to his right and so restrict Evra. Accordingly,
              the second half was far more even than the first had been.</p>
              <h2>Brazilian beginnings</h2>
              <p>The
              full-back, in the modern sense, developed in Brazil in the fifties. The
              genesis of the 4-2-4 is complex and disputed, but what is significant
              here is that at the 1958 World Cup, Brazil were using it and nobody
              else was. It may seem counter-intuitive that it should have been
              Brazil, with their reputation for attacking flair, who pioneered the
              use of four defenders as opposed to the three of the W-M, but
              formations are neutral; it is their application that gives them an
              defensive or aggressive aspect (which is another way of saying, yet
              again, that 4-5-1 is not inherently negative).</p>
              <p>Terminology here
              is surely significant. In English the term "full-back" is used as a
              hangover from the days of 2-3-5. Those two defenders were pushed wider
              by the backward movement of the centre-half (another confusingly
              antiquated term) in the W-M, and then wider still when another
              midfielder (usually the left-half) was pushed deeper to form a back
              four (this is why the classic numbering of an English back four,
              reading from right-to-left, goes 2-5-6-3).</p>
              <p>In Brazil, though,
              (and, for that matter, in Spanish-speaking countries as well) a
              "full-back" is a 'lateral'. The term gives a notion of width, but not
              of depth: he was, in other words, a wide player, but not necessarily a
              defensive one, a mindset that was inherent in Brazilian football almost
              from the start. Arsenal toured in 1949 and, although broadly
              successful, were bewildered by what they found. "Suddenly, a bloke
              comes dashing through and he's had a shot at goal and the ball went
              wide," said the full-back Laurie Scott, describing Arsenal's 5-1 win
              over Fluminense in Aidan Hamilton's <a href="http://www.cababstractsplus.org/abstracts/Abstract.aspx?AcNo=19991800250">An Entirely Different Game</a>.
              "And we started looking around to see who we'd got to blame for this.
              We couldn't find it. We found out it was their full-back. See, they
              didn't care. I never went up there like that."</p>
              <p>That exuberance
              had been a problem for Brazilian football – they won only two Copa
              Americas before the second world war, and it's significant that both of
              Uruguay's goals in the final game of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzdNUDMWd94">1950 World Cup</a> resulted from the left-back, Bigode, being caught out of position. The
              4-2-4, though, gave just enough structure for those attacking
              tendencies to flourish.</p>
              <p>Given the space in front of them, the
              full-backs were encouraged to advance, while at the same time providing
              immediate cover. Once marking had ceased to be man-to-man, it became a
              simple process for the fourth defender to react to the forward movement
              of the full-back by not pushing out himself, leaving his side still
              with the three-man defensive cover they would have had in the W-M. The
              pairing of Nilton Santos and Djalma Santos is often overlooked, but
              they were key to Brazil's World Cup victories of 1958 and 1962.</p>
              <h2>Natural evolution</h2>
              <p>Even
              by 1962, though, the shape had changed, with Mario Zagallo shuttling up
              and down the left rather than acting as a traditional winger – as
              Garrincha most certainly was on the other side. England, in 1966,
              operated without wingers, using something that would today probably be
              described as a 4-1-3-2. Their full-backs, George Cohen and Ray Wilson,
              while nowhere near as flamboyant as their Brazilian forebears, had
              vital roles, and were noted for their overlapping runs. This, of
              course, is a natural evolution: if there are no wingers to defend
              against, the full-back can be more adventurous; and at the same time,
              if there is no winger, there is a need for the full-backs to advance to
              provide width.</p>
              <p>In 1970, Brazil operated with just one attacking
              full-back, Carlos Alberto, with Everaldo tucking in on the left to
              provide balance. That was a function of the highly idiosyncratic
              development of that side, but it was symptomatic of a more general
              trend. Most European sides who used a <em>libero</em> tended to deploy
              one attacking full-back, balanced by a more defensive player on the
              other flank, who tucked in and operated as a marker: Giacinto Facchetti
              and Tarcisio Burgnich in Helenio Herrera's Inter, for instance; Paul
              Breitner and Berti Vogts in West Germany's World Cup-winning side of
              1974; or Antonio Cabrini and Claudio Gentile in Italy's World Cup
              winners of 1982.</p>
              <p>In those last three combinations, the left-back
              was the attacking one of the pair, which was the orthodoxy. Gianluca
              Vialli has a theory that the right-back was always the worst player on
              the team. If he showed defensive ability, and was of average height or
              above, he would be moved into the centre; if he was good on the ball he
              would be pushed into midfield. The only players left to play at
              right-back, then, were those who were outstanding neither defensively
              nor technically. Left-backs were different, partly because left-footers
              are rarer and tend to be nurtured, and partly because of the example of
              Facchetti. That thinking has changed over the past 20 years.</p>
              <p>The
              advent of wing-backs can be seen as attempt to liberate both full-backs
              again – particularly in a world without wingers, but as the gradual
              move to a single striker has led to a return to a back four, the
              full-back has again taken on attacking importance. That <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2009/jan/26/dani-alves-barcelona-leo-messi">Dani Alves can be hailed as one of the greatest players in the world</a> is an indication of how crucial the role has become.</p>
              <p>Few sides today play with wingers who stay wide. Part of the point of a 4-2-3-1, in fact, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2008/dec/18/4231-442-tactics-jonathan-wilson">is to restore dribblers to the game</a> without risking becoming over-manned in the centre. Even in a 4-4-2,
              the wide midfielders rarely play high up the field, which means that,
              as Charlton said, the full-backs are the only players on the field who
              regularly have space in front of them, and where there is space there
              is opportunity: if there is no direct opponent, there is the chance to
              overman, as United showed in the San Siro.</p>
              <h2>Trying to counter the full-back</h2>
              <p>The
              danger, of course, is that sides become over-reliant on the full-backs
              to provide attacking width, as happened to Russia in that Euro 2008
              semi-final. Equally, Chelsea under Luiz Felipe Scolari, after early
              success with Jose Bosingwa and Ashley Cole pushing forwards (a
              Brazilian coach employing a typically Brazilian tactic), found
              themselves restricted as teams began to deploy midfielders to pen them
              back.</p>
              <p>The rise of players like Park and Dirk Kuyt, wide men who
              play high up the field but are capable of taking on a defensive brief,
              is one of the most striking features of the past couple of seasons (or
              look at the job Wayne Rooney did in Barcelona last season). In a sense
              they are modern incarnations of players such as Jair, who operated on
              the right for Herrera's Inter. He was a tornante (literally
              "returner"), a wide midfielder characteristic of classic <em>catenaccio</em>, whose role was to occupy the opposing left-back and track his forward surges.</p>
              <p>Most
              fascinating is what happens when genuine winger and attacking full-back
              clash, as happened in last season's Champions League final. Cole has
              probably played Cristiano Ronaldo as well as anybody, and so Sir Alex
              Ferguson switched Ronaldo across to the left, putting him up against
              Michael Essien.</p>
              <p>For half an hour, Ronaldo destroyed him, not
              merely twice beating him on the ground, but even leaping above him to
              head United into the lead. The temptation must have been to try to
              double up on Ronaldo, but Chelsea ended up doing the opposite. Essien
              drove by him again and again. That effectively gave Chelsea an extra
              man in midfield and as they came to dominate, Ronaldo became
              increasingly marginalised. Frank Lampard's equaliser, of course, came
              from a half-blocked Essien drive. The course of the game mirrored
              exactly the ebb and flow of that battle between Essien and Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>England's
              4-1 victory in Croatia, similarly, can be seen as a tale of winger and
              full-back. Danijel Pranjic had looked excellent in the Euros, his
              overlapping runs allowing Ivan Rakitic to drift infield off the left
              flank on to his favoured right foot. Faced with the pace of Theo
              Walcott, though, he never had the confidence to abandon his man and
              surge forward, which had the effect both of stymieing Croatia as an
              attacking force, and of exposing his own defensive shortcomings. That
              Walcott scored a hat-trick underlined the point, but came almost a
              bonus alongside his primary role of disrupting Croatia's left flank.</p>
              <p>Come
              next summer's World Cup, of course, all the build-up will be about the
              forwards and fantasistas – Lionel Messi and Franck Ribéry, Wayne Rooney
              and Fernando Torres, Samuel Eto'o and Robinho. Perhaps though, what we
              should be concentrating on is the full-backs: Sergio Ramos and Philipp
              Lahm, Alexander Anyukov and Patrice Evra, Dani Alves and Ashley Cole.
              For it is there, increasingly, where the battle is lost and won.</p>

              <p>without defenders, having a good gk, midfielders and strikers, may draw a game</p>
              <p>but without gk, the opponent can take long range shots and shoot into the open net.</p>

              <p>I think midfielder (esp winger) is the most impt lor.</p>
              <p>Almost every season, the winner is due to having a good winger like c. ronaldo, giggs, pires, robben etc. Sometimes its the midfielder like lampard, vieira who inspire the whole team.</p>
              <p>I mean just look at last season. Can you say umm evra is a better player than c. ronaldo? Who would you rather have in the squad for last season? evra vs c ronaldo? ashley cole vs pires?</p>
