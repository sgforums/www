              <p><strong>Real Madrid's dreams of a Champions League final at their Bernabeu home were crushed by Lyon drew 1-1 at the Bernabeu to progress 2-1 on aggregate.</strong></p>
              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo's seventh Champions League goal of the season gave Madrid the perfect early start as he netted after just six minutes to level up the aggregate scores at 1-1.</p>
              <p>However, Madrid failed to make the most of a host of first-half chances and they paid the cost as Miralem Pjanic smashed home a 75th-minute equaliser for Lyon to send Manuel Pellegrini's men crashing out.</p>
              <p>The result meant the Spanish giants were knocked out at the last-16 stage for the sixth successive season.</p>

              <p><strong>The campaign to remove the </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Real Madrid</strong></span><strong> coach, Manuel Pellegrini, has already begun following their </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Champions League</strong></span><strong> elimination to Lyon in the Bernabéu last night.</strong></p>
              <p>Real, who spent £240m on players during the summer including Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaká, expected to fare better in a competition they have won a record nine times, and despite a vote of confidence from the club's director general, Jorge Valdano, the Spanish media appear to have made up their minds about the future of Pellegrini, launching a series of savage attacks on the Chilean coach.</p>
              <p>The front page of the influential Madrid-based newspaper Marca this morning says, "Adiós Champions, Adiós Pellegrini. Fuera", which translates as the unequivocal message, "Goodbye Champions [League], Goodbye Pellegrini. Out".</p>
              <p>This is the sixth successive season Real Madrid have been knocked out at the first knockout stage of the Champions League and with the final to be held at the Bernabéu this defeat has been particularly hard to accept.</p>
              <p>"You don't buy titles, you win them," the columnist José Samano wrote in El País following the last-16 defeat to Lyon.</p>
              <p>"When the ball is in play it's the business of the players and Hollywood-style theatre is irrelevant," he added. "Everything is possible in sport except for those who consider the pitch a stock market."</p>
              <p>The hyperbole reached new heights with the opinion of Orfeo Suárez in El Mundo. "The catastrophe suffered by this pharaonic Madrid team is as if an earthquake had destroyed the Valley of the Kings.</p>
              <p>"Watching the competition to which they owe their legend from the sidelines will be their penitence and torment."</p>
              <p>There was no let-up in ABC, where Julián Avila wrote about "stratospheric spending" accompanied by the headlines "Sixth galactic failure" and "More than €250 million down the drain".</p>
              <p>"The jewel in the crown, Cristiano Ronaldo, Champions League finalist in the past two seasons, is out of the tournament at his first attempt in a white shirt," said Avila.</p>
              <p>Elswhere, Carlos Marcote, writing in daily El Periódico, said Florentino Pérez, the Real president, had failed in his attempt "to bulldoze Madrid back to the summit of world soccer".</p>
              <p>"Not even winning the league… will remove such a scandalous stain, the worst in the recent history of Madrid given the such lofty heights they were obliged to reach."</p>

              <h2>CASILLAS: PLAYERS MUST TAKE BLAME</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/10/03/240/Manuel-Pellegrini-2-edited1_2429456.jpg" border="0" alt="Manuel Pellegrini - has players' backing."></div>
              <p><br></p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Iker Casillas insists the players are the ones to blame for Real Madrid's latest Champions League failure and pledged to make it up to the club's fans.</strong></p>
              <p>With this year's final being played at their Bernabeu home and having spent around 250million euros on new players last summer, Madrid had invested a lot of hope, energy and money into trying for a record 10th European Cup title this year.</p>
              <p>But, for the sixth successive campaign, they were dumped out of the Champions League at the last-16 stage after a 1-1 draw with Lyon at the Bernabeu resulted in a 2-1 aggregate loss.</p>
              <p>That exit, combined with their humiliating 4-1 aggregate defeat to third-tier Alcorcon in the Copa del Rey earlier this season, has left Madrid with only the Primera Division title left to fight for and coach Manuel Pellegrini under increasing pressure.</p>
              <p>Immediately after their European exit, Madrid-based Marca, the biggest-selling daily in Spain, wrote on their website: "Goodbye Champions, Goodbye Pellegrini."</p>
              <p>Any Madrid player brave enough to have read some of the other Spanish newspapers on Thursday would also have been greeted by terms such as "failure", "nightmare", "catastrophe" and "galactic humiliation".</p>
              <p>It remains to be seen what steps, if any, Madrid take in the wake of this latest setback.</p>
              <p>Pellegrini was quizzed about his future after the game, but he insisted he was not going to resign or give up the fight.</p>
              <p>The former Villarreal coach, who only took charge last summer, was also given a vote of confidence by director general Jorge Valdano following the match.</p>
              <p>However, with a track record that has seen Madrid employ nine coaches since the hugely-successful Vicente Del Bosque was not kept on in 2003, Pellegrini will know that he is always likely to be walking a tightrope at the Spanish giants.</p>
              <p>Despite the spotlight falling on Pellegrini though, goalkeeper Casillas believes it is the players who are responsible, saying: "Pellegrini has the support of all the players. He knows that. The first person who is blamed is the coach, but the main ones to blame are us."</p>
              <p>Madrid at least have the Primera Division to fall back on, where they are in fine form with seven successive victories and a 100% home record.</p>

              <p><br>Don't blame him lah, he had every right to go... They are paying him something like $200,000 per week with a 25% increment every season... So next season his pay would become $250,000... follow by $312,500 the next until his 6th year where he will be like 30 yrs old and getting paid more than half a million per week...</p>
              <p>And also the Euro have strengthen against the falling Pound, the Tax increased in UK come April against the special after tax he gets at Real... Really, no horse to run against...</p>
              <p>Anyway, it's just one season... There are still a few more to go for glory... But he won't be the big loser whatever happens cos compare to his $120k per week before 40% tax and soon to be 50% from United... There really isn't much to compare...</p>
