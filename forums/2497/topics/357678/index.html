              <p><strong>John Terry last night condemned </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>West Ham's</strong></span></a><strong> supporters for the disgraceful taunts aimed at him and team-mate Frank Lampard during </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea's</strong></span></a><strong> 1-0 victory at Upton Park.</strong></p>
              <p>West Ham fans sang 'you let your children down' to former Hammer Lampard throughout the game, a reference to his infamous call to a London radio station last Friday in which he sought to defend himself on air against accusations of being a bad father.</p>
              <p>Terry revealed that his mother, along with several members of his family, did not attend the game after West Ham websites encouraged supporters to sing <em>'John Terry's mum is a thief'</em> following her recent brush with the law.</p>
              <p>The Chelsea captain, who was disgusted by the abuse, said: 'When we scored I went running to Frank and gave them a bit back, but there's nothing wrong with that. The referee had a quiet word and told me not to wind them up but if I can take it, they have to get a little bit back as well. They have to respect it, but when we gave them some back they all got the a***.'</p>
              <p>West Ham fans have developed a reputation for being among the most spiteful in the country and abuse former players when they return to Upton Park. </p>
              <p>Paul Ince was still the target of hate-filled chants when he went back last August as Blackburn manager, 19 years after incurring the supporters' wrath by being pictured in a Manchester United shirt before he had joined them.</p>
              <p>Lampard has had to endure stick for years, too, but other stars, such as David Beckham, have also been singled out for vile abuse in the past. </p>

              <p><strong>The only consolation for the Chelsea midfielder and his team-mates is that it could help prepare them to face the hostility of 90,000 Barcelona fans at the Nou Camp tomorrow evening in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final.</strong></p>
              <p>But Terry, who, along with Lampard was given a police escort to the team bus after the game, is still fuming about West Ham. He said: 'I will take it and I will give it back. Frank and I were so fired up before this game and we told the lads we couldn't let it slip.</p>
              <p>'Frank and I are big enough to take it, but my family are all West Ham fans and some of them did not go to the game because there were things on a website about the songs they were going to sing.</p>
              <p>'When we get stick like that we are more determined to shut them up. We did that.</p>
              <p>'I think West Ham's fans cross the line but I'm not going to give them the chance to have a whinge at me. There are certain things in life you enjoy. We came to get three points and their fans walked away with nothing. You can't buy that.'</p>
