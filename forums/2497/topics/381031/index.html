              </div>
              </div>
              <p>The Court of Arbitration for Sport has granted Chelsea's request to
              suspend their transfer ban pending a final decision regarding their
              case.</p>
              <p>Chelsea were initially handed a FIFA ban over the next two transfer
              windows after they were found guilty of inducing French teenager Gael
              Kakuta to breach his contract with Lens in 2007, but the Blues appealed
              to CAS against the punishment and, as part of their appeal, requested
              the transfer ban be 'stayed' until the case had been dealt with.</p>
              <p>Now
              the appeals body have given the London club a lifeline which will allow
              them to sign players again in January if the final decision is not
              taken before then.</p>
              <p>A statement on the CAS website read: ''The
              Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has granted the request for a stay
              filed by Chelsea Football Club Ltd and Mr Gaël Kakuta in relation to
              the decision taken by the FIFA Dispute Resolution Chamber on 27 August
              2009.</p>
              <p>''The FIFA Dispute Resolution Chamber imposed, inter alia,
              a restriction of four months' ineligibility on Mr Gaël Kakuta, and
              Chelsea Football Club Ltd was banned from registering any new players,
              either nationally or internationally, for the next two complete,
              consecutive registration periods. Such sanctions are now stayed until
              the CAS renders its final decision in this matter.''</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">CHELSEA have been boosted by the news that their transfer ban is on hold while the club fights charges against them.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Blues should be able to trade in the January transfer window after the Court of Arbitration for Sport agreed to suspend their FIFA-imposed transfer ban until a final decision is made in the case of the signing of Gael Kakuta.</p>
              <p class="article">It means boss Carlo Ancelotti can step up his hunt for new recruits such as £40million-rated Sergio Aguero, who scored twice against his side for Atletico Madrid in midweek.</p>
              <p class="article">FIFA banned the Blues from any transfer activity until January 2011 after they were found guilty of illegally inducing Kakuta to breach his contract with French club Lens.</p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea appealed to CAS against the punishment and, as part of their appeal, requested the transfer ban be 'stayed' until the case had been dealt with.</p>
              <p class="article">A statement from CAS today read: "The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has granted the request for a stay filed by Chelsea Football Club Ltd and Mr Gael Kakuta in relation to the decision taken by the FIFA Dispute Resolution Chamber on 27 August 2009.</p>
              <p class="article">"The FIFA Dispute Resolution Chamber imposed, inter alia, a restriction of four months' ineligibility on Mr Gael Kakuta, and Chelsea Football Club Ltd was banned from registering any new players, either nationally or internationally, for the next two complete, consecutive registration periods. Such sanctions are now stayed until the CAS renders its final decision in this matter."</p>
              <p class="article">CAS are not expected to hear the case until the new year, which should leave Chelsea free to buy and sell as normal in January.</p>
              <p class="article">Professor Ian Blackshaw, a CAS lawyer, believes the ruling will enable the west Londoners to enjoy an unimpeded transfer window in January.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "Until the appeal is finally decided by CAS the position before the appeal is reversed. That means Chelsea are free, if they wish to do so, to deal in the transfer market in January.</p>
              <p class="article">"Once all the paperwork is there then it is possible to hold a hearing. In this case, because it's such an important one, I imagine there will be an oral hearing rather than a decision based just on papers.</p>
              <p class="article">"In that case it will be possible for Kakuta to present his version of the facts. "But I don't think we will get an appeal much before March or even April next year."</p>
