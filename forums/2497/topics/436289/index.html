              </span></p><p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black"><strong>The Glazer family are considering selling 30 per cent of Manchester United, raising £600million in the process. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">And that will open up manager Sir Alex Ferguson and chief executive David Gill to public scrutiny by investors. </span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">News on Tuesday that the owners have appointed a bank - thought to be Credit Suisse - to look into the partial flotation of the club on the Singapore stock market has raised the possibility of United not being owned 100 per cent privately for the first time since 2005. </span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">Though the Glazers would still hold an enormous majority share interest and essentially retain the right to run things however they wish, it is thought the club would again be required to hold annual meetings and produce detailed yearly finance reports. </span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">Ferguson and Gill have no cause for concern, but the development would give supporters some insight into how the club is being run. </span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">In the Glazers' six-and-a-half years in charge, fans have been frustrated by a lack of accountability. </span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">Whether any of the £600m raised by a flotation would be funnelled back into the club is open to question. </span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">Experts suggested last night it is more likely to be used to pay off some of the debt the Glazer family have racked up. None of the shares made available in Singapore are likely to fall into the hands of regular United supporters.</span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">Instead they would be bought by investors in Asia. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">The Manchester United Supporters Trust hinted last night they would look to find a way to invest. </span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">A statement said: 'It is possible shares will not be available to ordinary supporters and MUST will have to provide a mechanism for supporters to buy shares.'</span></p>

              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">The Glazers are said to be looking to offload 30 per cent of United by selling shares on the Singapore stock market.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">How much money do they hope to make?</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">It is thought the move could raise around £600million. </span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">By selling about a third of the company the Glazer family would keep control and could use the money to pay down debts of more than £500m which accrue hefty interest.</span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">It would also establish a price tag for the club.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">So how much are United worth?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>If the Glazers raised £600m by selling 25 per cent that would value the club at £2.4bn. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>However, reports suggest the final stock market valuation would be closer to £1.7bn. The Glazers paid £780m in 2005. </span></p>
              <p>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p><span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Why Singapore not London?</span> </span></p>
              <p></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Of the club's 300 million fans, more than 190 million live in Asia, which is seen as a growth area for the club's revenues. </span></p>
              <p><span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">So is this a good time to be attempting such a move? </span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The stock market wobble will not help - and don't forget United made a £105m loss in their last set of accounts. </span></p>

              <p><br>Don't be naive... With the Uefa's fair play rules to come into effect within the next year to 3, it would suggest they will used it to clear their bond loans which stand at almost $500m unless they don't want to play in the Champions League anymore...</p>
              <p>These very same people who said the bond issue would be a lost money investment are now looking with envy when it was over subscribe by almost twice... These people may very well get their returns early if the listing goes ahead...</p>
              <p>Anyway, don't expect ordinary investors to get their hands on it as it would most likely be offered to investment houses across asia and the world first and by which time, there will be very few floated in the sgx for the individual investor... Those holding their bond may even be offered to convert it into shares which may mean very little live shares will be available...</p>
              <p>Paying the yearly dividend to their shareholders is almost very similar to servicing their bond issued currently... The only difference is, they will be known as debt-free...</p>
              <p>Just like the currently owners of Liverpool FC isn't an individual at all... They are own by a group of investors and within it, there is a NBA basket ball player too...</p>

              <p>Despite manager Sir Alex Ferguson insisting that the Glazers have fully supported his plans to recruit players, supporters have grown frustrated by the lack of investment in perceived stellar signings, pointing to the interest payments as money that could strengthen the squad.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>With <span style="color: #000000;">Manchester City</span> backed by the supreme wealth of Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan, United have been regularly outspent by their rivals, who are expected to take their summer spending through the £70 million mark by signing Arsenal’s Samir Nasri in the coming days.</p>
              <p>United had also made an attempt to sign Nasri, but failed to match City’s £25 million offer and £170,000-a-week salary, while efforts to lure Wesley Sneijder from Inter Milan have also foundered due to a reluctance at Old Trafford to meet the Dutch midfielder’s pay demands.</p>
              <p>United are expected to become the first club to announce commercial income of more than £100million when accounts are released in October. The Glazers and senior figures at United believe that the strength of their business model, which has seen total turnover double to almost £300million under the Americans, will ensure the club can compete with City and other wealthy European rivals.</p>
              <p>There is optimism within United that they will be listed in Singapore within two months and that a full prospectus for potential investors will be available by October.</p>
              <p>Some financial experts have expressed surprise at United’s decision to list in Singapore, rather than the larger and more established market in Hong Kong. The club’s popularity in Singapore and the belief that it is a more suitable base for commercial growth in Asia are believed to be behind the decision.</p>

              <p>When you think of it, it won't make much difference HK or SG cos only 25% to 30% of its actual stock will be release and of these, a good percentage will be taken up by trading houses who invest with a long term view. So we can expect very little will actually be traded therefore the price will not move in great numbers...</p>
              <p>Also, I think they may decide to go with the Sgx as the ST reported that the sgx are desperate to beat HK to the deal as it would be like they pull off a coup if they really do land the Man United brand... I  am guessing sweetener may have been thrown in to persuade them to list here instead as earlier reports said United were keen to list on the Hang Seng initially...</p>
              <p>Anyway, I find it a very smart move by the club / Glazers for the future... They have been good owners despite what some want to make them out to be... And in a few years time when Uefa's fair play rule takes effect, they will be in a good position compare to some others as they generate their own income to purchase players... Which is acceptable to Uefa. Those depending on rich owners may have a problem or have to think of another way to make big money purchases in the future if they don't generate their own income...</p>

              <p><br>As I recall before the Glazers came... There were a few different shareholders during those time... From horse owners to invertment companies and even a Celtic director... The 2 horse owners directors were always looking for trouble with the manager and the CEO... The club was getting negative publicity in the press on a weekly basis... Remember?</p>
              <p>Maybe too much success in recent years could make one forget the bad times of yesteryears... But those days, Fergie's purchases were like one quality player and the rest were like Kleberson, David Bellion, Dong Fangzhuo, Eric Djemba Djemba, those that didn't cost much money kind... or a young Fletcher that everyone got upset when they see his name in the starting 11 remember those days?</p>
              <p>SAF was also there between 2003 to 2006 and they were not good weren't they?</p>
              <p>It needs two hands to clap... Sometimes by not doing anything is better than wanting to do too much... What if they decided to play their own Football manager and buy who they want and order the manager to play him? worse right?</p>

              <p>Err... The bond thing already done way back early last year... Over subscribe too... That one is over... Finish.</p>
              <p>This is an IPO listing on a stock exchange... or at least an application... It's a totally different thing... Just like Roman convert his Chelsea's £800m to £1 billion loans into shares in order to keep Chelsea debt free... But since it's a private company, they don't need to list it. And also since it's an artificially pop up company/club, the true value of the listing price won't reflex the sum Roman have put in... A company need to be profitable and have potential for growth to have a chance of getting listed... Example Chelsea or City's books of consecutive annual losses won't make it...</p>
              <p>For now, it's just an application, not necessarily will go ahead unless they decide to... It's like getting a license first, and when you got it, then you can decide whether you want to drive or not later I guess...</p>
              <p>Err... also, don't be confuse... The current debt comes from the bond issue now... They have convert their bank loans to bonds in the last exercise. Maybe for some reason with Uefa's fair play rule, they don't permit bonds to be excluded as loans too maybe? </p>
              <p>The listing will clear its debt... It's like take Arsenal for example... There are a few different shareholders formerly... If one director had been a bank, then they will be considered owing the bank a loan too on top of their existing load/debts... Payment made to the loan interest is almost like paying dividends to a shareholder... The difference will be more owners / shareholders and debt-free to one owner with a bank loan...</p>

              year... Over subscribe too... That one is over... Finish.</p>
              <p>This is an IPO listing on a stock exchange... or at
              least an application... It's a totally different thing... Just like
              Roman convert his Chelsea's £800m to £1 billion loans into
              shares in order to keep Chelsea debt free... But since it's a
              private company, they don't need to list it. And also since it's
              an artificially pop up company/club, the true value of the
              listing price won't reflex the sum Roman have put
              in... A company need to be profitable and have potential for
              growth to have a chance of getting listed... Example Chelsea or
              City's books of consecutive annual losses won't make it...</p>
              <p>For now, it's just an application, not necessarily will go
              ahead unless they decide to... It's like getting a license first,
              and when you got it, then you can decide whether you want to drive
              or not later I guess...</p>
              <p>Err... also, don't be confuse... The current debt comes from the
              bond issue now... They have convert their bank loans to bonds in
              the last exercise. Maybe for some reason with Uefa's fair play
              rule, they don't permit bonds to be excluded as loans too
              maybe?</p>
              <p>The listing will clear its debt... It's like take Arsenal for
              example... There are a few different shareholders formerly... If
              one director had been a bank, then they will be
              considered owing the bank a loan too on top of their
              existing load/debts... Payment made to the loan interest is
              almost like paying dividends to a shareholder... The
              difference will be more owners / shareholders and debt-free to
              one owner with a bank loan...</p>

              <p>Oh... Ok, bond and listing are two separate things lor...</p>
              <p>On bond, you pay a yearly fixed interest for a period of time... It's safer but you don't make much the longer it goes... It's like a fixed deposit in a bank account. The only way you lose is the company or bank go bust which is normally very unlikely... </p>
              <p>While listing on exchange means you pay dividends to shareholders once, twice a year depending on the board... But the gains are far greater too as shareholders as the share price may go up and taking inflation into consideration, the longer you hold on to it, the higher the share is likely to go if business is running as per normal...</p>
              <p>So don't worry, if the bond can be over subscribe, the shares will be very much the same too considering only 30% will be available and not 50% to 70%... If people dare to buy its 7yrs bond issue, it means they are confident the company won't go bust in that time frame and they are able to get their money back...</p>
              <p>And in their draft prospectus submitted to the Singaporean financial authorities which have been made known the reason for their listing... "Central to their submission is confirmation that they will significantly reduce a £480 million debt to make United more competitive in the transfer market." meaning the money generated from the listing will go into clearing its present debts... The current interest payment could become dividends to future shareholders...</p>
              <p>They can't lie about such things one as it's an undertaking to the exchange to get approval to be listed... Sgx have a reputation to protect too... </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>i am a man utd fan but investing in the club is really bad investment decision... right now the value is at a certain amount but consider this, man utd is now peaking... what happens if man city or liverpool or chelsea took over the domination of man utd, the value of the club will tank (think about liverpool glory days, then becomes the decade of man utd, what goes up will come down) and in financial terms, the worst time to invest is when the shares are at the peak... you want to invest when the shares are low and sell when it's high... right now man utd is nearly or is already peaking, i can say this, any player can leave man utd and it will be just as strong, but once alex ferguson leaves, that's it... i love man utd but i hate glazers. even in fm manager i am running FC United...</p></div>
