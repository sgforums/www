              <p>i am a man utd fan but investing in the club is really bad investment decision... right now the value is at a certain amount but consider this, man utd is now peaking... what happens if man city or liverpool or chelsea took over the domination of man utd, the value of the club will tank (think about liverpool glory days, then becomes the decade of man utd, what goes up will come down) and in financial terms, the worst time to invest is when the shares are at the peak... you want to invest when the shares are low and sell when it's high... right now man utd is nearly or is already peaking, i can say this, any player can leave man utd and it will be just as strong, but once alex ferguson leaves, that's it... i love man utd but i hate glazers. even in fm manager i am running FC United...</p>

              <p><br>To say one's share price is at it's peak is like saying one can predict the future... If like this, we all can become remisier kings...</p>
              <p>Simply put, No one can predict the future. Not even a remisier king... Who is to say that this could not be just the beginning of better things to come?</p>
              <p>Your "what goes up will come down" statement may be true to a certain degree but who can seriously predict that its up is only for 20 yrs? For all we know it could be up for 40, 50 yrs or maybe even down next year of course in a very dramatic scenario...</p>
              <p>Also, to compare to Liverpool's situation, it's terrible. Cos while Liverpool stayed put enjoying their glory days, they fail to keep up with the times from the mid 80s right up to the mid 2000. So for 20 yrs they were stagnant under fan / owner David Moores... They sat and watch the years go by not knowing how or doing anything for the growth of the club... They became leaden with debts and eventually had to sell off.</p>
              <p>Ironically, it was during this time that United took the initiative and got listed and started to make move to get ahead... They didn't just sit around and got lucky and waited for the "decade of man utd" to arrived by chance... Initiative off the field gave them the ability they could put on it... and it's this very initiative that is continuously keeping the club moving forward...</p>
              <p>Man United has grown bigger than any of its players... And it will also grow pass it's manager too eventually when the time comes... And to say the least, to be very honest, to put it in a very bad way... The club don't have to necessarily win anything in the next 10 yrs... They just have to be up there and about in the top 3, 4 and it will still remain good for investment...</p>
              <p>Your comment of "you want to invest when the shares are low and sell when it's high... right now man utd is nearly or is already peaking" "what happens if man city or liverpool or chelsea took over"  is a very common statement from any average guy who just dip his hands into the market once in a while kind and sell off as quickly too... But this are for long term investments...</p>
              <p>Once a upon a time before the ipod came to prominence, when Microsoft was rising while Apple products were failing one after another, many said why buy apple shares as it's now on the decline and almost a dead company... But who would have thought that the little product was the start of more to come? The ipod, imac, iphone 2, 3, 4.. 5, ipad 1, 2.. 3, powerbook, macbook, Air, Pro... etc... People who pick up Apple Inc shares then are laughing to the bank today... Or who could have predicted Apple would take over the market share of handphones in so few years Nokia took more than a decade to established? Apple wasn't even a hp player 5, 6 yrs ago to say the least and yet they manage to...</p>
              <p>Look, if enough people are willing to over-subscribe to their 7yrs bond on only 8.5% returns just last year... It shows confidence that they are happy to "park" their money with the club and not worried that they will lose it anytime in the next 7yrs... The return from shares could be far more than just the 8.5%...</p>
              <p>Also, in this type of cases, normally 60% or more wouldn't be the club fans who buys them... Investment institutions who are profit driven could take up a significant portion of it... Even a Liverpool fan said on fanzone he would buy it and used the profits he makes to buy Pool stuffs...</p>

              <p>.</p>
              <p>As the club's owners proceed with plans to float a stake of up 30% on the Singapore stock exchange, the club's brokers are likely to point to the deal with logistics firm DHL as further evidence of their global commercial clout.</p>
              <p>The total, understood to be worth slightly over £40m across four years, exceeds the club's main shirt deal with former sponsors Vodafone, which ended in 2005, and is around half the £20m a year that Aon pays to be emblazoned across their shirt.</p>
              <p>It is understood that chief of staff Edward Woodward, who oversees Manchester United's London-based commercial arm, and commercial director Richard Arnold have targeted a substantial increase on that total when the shirt sponsorship comes up for renegotiation in 2014.</p>
              <p>Although the move might be interpreted by some as controversial given the club's kit deal with Aon, the American financial giant are said to have been fully aware of negotiations with DHL, whose branding will now be worn during training sessions outside of European games.</p>
              <p>In 2008, they reorganised the club's commercial department to target growth across the world in a range of regional categories and sign individual deals with telecom and media partners.</p>
              <p>Manchester United's full year accounts, to be released in October, are expected to show that commercial revenues have topped £100m for the first time. Quarterly results in May showed growth of around 30% on the previous year, while matchday and media income remained flat.</p>
              <p>The club's chief executive David Gill said the DHL deal "breaks new ground in the English game". DHL's logo will appear on training kit worn by first team, reserve and youth team players but only covers domestic fixtures.</p>
              <p>The US company is banking on the fact that increased global media coverage of the Premier League will mean that its logo is heavily featured.</p>
              <p>The club have also announced a three-year partnership with Vietnamese mobile telecommunications company, Beeline, to distribute United content in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. They claim to have 16m supporters in Vietnam alone, of 192m across Asia.</p>
              <p>"Manchester United has always been at the forefront of the game off the pitch as well on it and this partnership is another example of that," Sir Alex Ferguson said.</p>
              <p>"Everyone knows about the passion of our fans in that part of the world and this deal makes it a lot easier for us to keep in touch with them."</p>
              <p>The Glazers have submitted the initial documents required to float a stake of between 25% and 30% on the Singapore stock exchange before the end of the year in a move that they hope could raise up to $1bn.</p>

              <p>When I say man utd is peaking, i mean currently they are winning 1-2 trophies each year and I won't say I know the future, but to get better you're talking about winning treble at least each year... simply put, the possibility of that happening is much lower than the possibility of it not happening... even AF says the league is getting tougher... My statements weren't saying i know the future, unless you infer I am God. I think the more apt word is making deductions... much like if heavy rain for many months in Singapore, we can deduce there may be flood in Singapore, we certainly are not saying we know the future, we're just using logical deductions. I am sure I don't need to be God to know that if the whole man utd team died in an air crash tomorrow, it is difficult for them to rebuild the team and win treble in the same season. This isn't about knowing the future, it's just calculating odds.</p>
              <p>And you may not agree it is AF keeping utd at its great period, but certainly Eric Cantona is echoing my sentiments. <a href="http://www.caughtoffside.com/2011/02/23/manchester-united-will-collapse-without-sir-alex-ferguson-says-eric-cantona-final/">http://www.caughtoffside.com/2011/02/23/manchester-united-will-collapse-without-sir-alex-ferguson-says-eric-cantona-final/</a></p>
              <p>This makes such an investment very risky, if you factor in the huge debts, man utd unknown factors once AF retires, man utd is more likely to go down than up (i mean they already league champions so many times, even if they come in 2nd, it's considered deterioration). then I don't see why this is a good investment.</p>
              <p>When emotions run high, people can become stupid. people can invest because they love the club, but i won't exactly invest because it doesn't make financial sense.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, I mentioned buying low and selling high... and you mentioned the Apple example, which was about buying low (when apple was not popular) and then selling high (now apple is so popular)... which confirmed my thinking... but what you're saying is that the Man utd is like Apple, buy their shares and laugh to bank, but if you notice in your example, last time value of Apple is low because Apple is almost dying, which if you want to compare to this soccer industry, it means Man Utd is in the relegation zone, lol... obviously right now man utd are champions so that's why i say they are peaking or towards peaking...</p>

              <p>When emotions run high, people can become stupid. people can invest because they love the club, but i won't exactly invest because it doesn't make financial sense.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p><br>If you are equating winning trophies and being profitable then you are already making a huge mistake from your deductions... As I have said earlier, "to put it in a very bad way... The club don't have to necessarily win anything in the next 10 yrs... They just have to be up there and about in the top 3, 4 and it will still remain good for investment..."</p>
              <p>Reason being how successful a club can be in their marketing depend on how big their fan base are and how widely they are followed... and not just how many trophies they win...</p>
              <p>To establish such a network of followers, it takes years, or even decades and generations... And United as a club, have this... Example: We can look at Arsenal, they are the second most profitable club in England in the last few years but yet they have not won a single trophy in 6, 7 years! Why then I ask? Cos if base on your logical deductions alone, then they shouldn't be. But ironically it's precisely these last 6, 7 years that they became the 2nd most profitable and valuable club in England and continue to grow despite their team's performance...</p>
              <p>Or Liverpool... We know for a fact it has been 20 yrs since they last won the title right? But they have remain profitable reason being because of the huge fan base built-up some 30, 40 or longer yrs ago... They were not well manage otherwise they could have been even more profitable in my opinion with its strong fan base across the world... They have a unique history that not many club can call upon too...</p>
              <p>Again, if base on your logical deductions, Chelsea who have been very successful these past few years should be doing very well too in the accounting department but yet they aren't... Why we may ask? Simple, cos 5, 10 years to build a strong fan base isn't enough... As I said, it could take generations to establised a huge and strong fan base like United's and Pool's... Real's and Barce's...  </p>
              <p>I don't disagree an ounce SAF is keeping United strong in the playing department... What Cantona thinks isn't really relevant, it's like an old student admiring and respecting his former boss abilities thats all... Or like George Best saying Sir Matt Busby is the greatest ever and no one will ever replace him kind of a statement before SAF became a United's manager... And many would probably agree with him back in the good old days too as who could have ever thought someone could break Sir Matt's 24 yrs in charge at the football club right? Just like if someone comes along and tells you the next guy will manage United longer than SAF's currently 25yrs, You wouldn't belief it too right? Who would seriously...  </p>
              <p>Investment houses isn't going to run on emotions my friend... They are profit driven... These guys study the company way before making a call just like those who bought their bond... Most normal individuals can't afford to buy a huge stake in it... Therefore this is where the investment Institutions comes in... The prize isn't just the yearly dividends, of course that would be nice to their bottomline too. But the prize is to sell it at a higher price at a later date in time...</p>
              <p>Just like the Glazers did in 2005 when they paid £790m for it... In 2005 when they paid that kind of sum for a football club people have not heard off before, thought it was a crazy investment... But 6 yrs on, today they can sell it for anything from £1.2b to £1.8b... Or just like <span style="color: #000000;">John Magnier</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and </span><span style="color: #000000;">J. P. McManus bought it at a premium way before 2005 but sold to the Glazers for a handsome profit in a very short time period...</span></p>
              <p>Individual fans being able to get their hands on a large portion of the shares may be very little or none...</p>

              <p><br>Yes, I mentioned buying low and selling high... and you mentioned the Apple example, which was about buying low (when apple was not popular) and then selling high (now apple is so popular)... which confirmed my thinking... but what you're saying is that the Man utd is like Apple, buy their shares and laugh to bank, but if you notice in your example, last time value of Apple is low because Apple is almost dying, which if you want to compare to this soccer industry, it means Man Utd is in the relegation zone, lol... obviously right now man utd are champions so that's why i say they are peaking or towards peaking...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Yup, you certainly did say so... Saying this isn't exactly appropriate right now as we all now know what happen to Apple today right? But 10, 15 yrs ago you wouldn't be saying this as you won't know the fate or destiny or course the company would take would you?</p>
              <p>That is why I said "To say one's share price is at it's peak is like saying one can predict the future... If like this, we all can become remisier kings..." Cos how do we know which one is "buy low and sell high"?</p>
              <p>To put it in prospective, would you put your money in a beat-up perceived almost dying, not popular company today? Cos that's what Apple almost was back then... Are you willing to try your "buy low and sell high" theory to the test? Cos there are a lot of cheap stocks around to pick up on the Sgx... The question is, do we know their destiny 10, 15 yrs from now today? </p>
              <p>Well, on "laughing to the bank"... lol. John Magnier<span style="color: #000000;"> and </span><span style="color: #000000;">J P McManus certainly bought high at the point of their purchases... T</span><span style="color: #000000;">he Glazers too brought it even higher at their time of purchase paying what people thought was a crazy price to pay for a soccer industry company as you call it... Your statement on "</span>This isn't about knowing the future, it's just calculating odds." <span style="color: #000000;">can certainly be used on both occasions too seriously... and even more so going by your logic as between 2003 to 2006 when these all took place during the rise of Chelsea... United were seen to be in decline weren't they? They didn't win the title for 3 yrs straight. Or to put it in your kind of words, they were heading for the relegation zone stuff...</span></p>
              <p>To be honest, If even this is too risky to invest, then there is no need for any kind of investment anymore in this world as everything comes with a risk... There is no logic to invest in oil production companies cos what if oil suddenly dries up tomorrow or next week? Or coal cos there are no more holes to dig them? Or Telecommunication companies cos an explosion from the sun rays makes all satellites orbiting the earth redundant? Wouldn't all these investment be very risky?</p>

              Then why are the top clubs among the top 10 most profitable and not clubs like those in the relegation zone who also have fan base... so clearly there is some relationship between profitability and being a top club. Anything can be bet, nothing is not viable as long as it's mathematically possible, only the odds super low maybe 1 dollar win 1 cent if the odds of something happening is so high then win very little money lor.

              <p><a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/singapore/">Singapore</a> beat Hong Kong to lure the
              initial stock sale of record 19-time English soccer champion
              Manchester United Ltd. in part by assuring a speedier approval
              process, bankers with knowledge of the matter said.</p>
              <p>A pledge by <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=SGX:SP">Singapore Exchange Ltd. (SGX)</a> to shrink the time lag
              between IPO application and approval to as little as four weeks
              -- from the usual two to three months -- was key to swaying
              United, said the bankers, who requested anonymity as they’re not
              authorized to discuss the deal. United plans to raise about $1
              billion to reduce its debt burden and finance player purchases,
              people familiar with the IPO said last week.</p>
              <p>Singapore Exchanges Chief Executive Officer <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/magnus-bocker/">Magnus Bocker</a>’s
              push to lure United is a sign of increased competition between
              the city-state and <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/hong-kong/">Hong Kong</a> for IPOs by global brands. Hong
              Kong, whose market capitalization is more than four times that
              of Singapore, this year hosted offerings by Prada SpA, Glencore
              International Plc and Samsonite International SA, extending its
              lead as <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/asia/">Asia</a>’s premier venue for IPOs.</p>
              <p>“If all the major listings are going to Hong Kong, people
              might increasingly see the SGX as not as important,” said James
              Koh, a Singapore-based analyst at Kim Eng Securities Ltd., using
              an abbreviation for Singapore Exchange. “That’s why it’s good
              to get a big catch like that.”</p>
              <p>United applied for a listing on Aug. 18, according to the
              people. The company expects to start gauging demand for the IPO
              in mid-September and aims to begin trading in the first half of
              the following month, they said. United has held talks with
              Temasek Holdings Pte., Singapore’s state-owned investment
              company, about buying shares in the IPO, according to the
              people.</p>
              <h2>Time to Market</h2>
              <p>Bocker and listings head Lawrence Wong led the efforts to
              woo United, the people said. Hong Kong’s bourse typically takes
              one and a half to two months to approve an IPO application,
              according to bankers familiar with the matter.</p>
              <p>Manchester United spokesman Philip Townsend declined to
              comment, as did spokespeople for <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/singapore-exchange/">Singapore Exchange</a> and Temasek.</p>
              <p>“Hong Kong’s listing process is efficient and HKEx aims to
              keep it that way,” Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing Ltd. said in
              an e-mailed statement. “The process is interactive so there are
              no typical cases, and there are fast-track cases from time to
              time.” The bourse didn’t specify any cases where it has allowed
              speedier approval.</p>
              <p>Singapore isn’t competing with Hong Kong for IPOs, Bocker
              said in an Aug. 23 interview. He declined to comment on United’s
              offering.</p>
              <h2>Calling Bankers</h2>
              <p>“We are offering different things,” Bocker said. “Hong
              Kong has been very successful in offering listings for companies
              that want to have a very Chinese focus. Singapore has a very
              strong offering for companies that want to have much broader
              focus, reaching out to <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/india/">India</a>, <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/southeast-asia/">Southeast Asia</a> and even to
              <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/china/">China</a>.”</p>
              <p>Luring United may help Bocker, a 49-year-old Swede who took
              the helm at Singapore Exchange in December 2009, recover from
              setbacks including the failed attempt to acquire the operator of
              <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/australia/">Australia</a>’s bourse, <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=ASX:AU">ASX Ltd. (ASX)</a>, for A$8.3 billion ($8.7 billion).
              That deal was blocked by Australia’s government in April.</p>
              <p>Glencore, run by billionaire Ivan Glasenberg, picked <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/london/">London</a> and Hong Kong for an IPO that raised $10 billion in May. After
              learning that Glencore was considering listing in Hong Kong,
              Bocker called bankers working on the deal, asking them to
              persuade the company to choose Singapore instead, a person with
              direct knowledge of the matter said.</p>
              <h2>‘Sympathy’</h2>
              <p>Bocker flew to London before United was due to submit a
              listing application to Hong Kong’s exchange, seeking to convince
              billionaire owner Malcolm Glazer to pick Singapore, the <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/straits-times/">Straits
              Times</a> reported Aug. 21, citing unidentified people.</p>
              <p>United CEO David Gill and Chief Operating Officer Edward Woodward were in Singapore last week meeting with bankers and
              exchange officials, a person with knowledge of the matter said.</p>
              <p>“I’ve got a bit of sympathy for the Singapore Exchange,”
              said Daniel Yong, head of the asset management practice at law
              firm Norton Rose LLP in Singapore. People “don’t give credit to
              the Singapore Exchange for the breadth and variety of listing
              applicants that they try to attract.”</p>
              <p>Hutchison Port Holdings Trust, an owner of port assets
              controlled by Hong Kong billionaire <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/li-ka--shing/">Li Ka-shing</a>, raised $5.5
              billion in Singapore’s largest IPO in March.</p>
              <p>Companies have raised $178 billion in IPOs in Hong Kong
              since the beginning of 2006, led by the $17.8 billion sale of
              <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=1299:HK">AIA Group Ltd. (1299)</a> in October last year, data compiled by Bloomberg
              show. That’s more than seven times the amount garnered in first-
              time offerings in Singapore over the same period.</p>
              <h2>Millionaire City</h2>
              <p>Hong Kong’s development as an IPO hub benefited from its
              proximity to China, as Chinese companies buoyed to the country’s
              economic expansion rushed to tap the city’s stock market.
              Chinese companies account for nine of the 10 biggest IPOs in
              Hong Kong’s history, Bloomberg data show.</p>
              <p>“Hong Kong may have an advantage in terms of listing
              Chinese companies because they already have a critical mass,”
              said Ng Soo Nam, the Singapore-based chief investment officer at
              Nikko Asset Management Co., which oversees about $154 billion.
              “The more international names Singapore Exchange can get to
              list here, the more they can attract.”</p>
              <p>Bocker’s sales pitch to United also touched on soccer’s
              rising popularity in Southeast Asia, the bankers said. United
              estimates 190 million of its 330 million fans are in Asia.
              Singapore, with a population of 5.1 million, has the world’s
              highest concentration of millionaires.</p>
              <p>Singaporean Peter Lim in October offered 320 million pounds
              for Liverpool, the soccer team that finished sixth in the last
              Premiership season. He later pulled the offer, saying
              Liverpool’s board wouldn’t talk to him. <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/tony-fernandes/">Tony Fernandes</a>, the CEO
              of <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/malaysia/">Malaysia</a>’s AirAsia Bhd, this month agreed to buy Queens Park
              Rangers, the west London-based <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/soccer-club/">soccer club</a> newly promoted to the
              Premier league.</p>
              <p>“The appetite is big in Asia for the Premier League,”
              said Fernandes in an Aug. 18 interview. “Singapore’s got lots
              of capital and <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/manchester-united/">Manchester United</a> is a very strong brand in
              Southeast Asia. It’s a smart move if done correctly.”</p>

              <p><strong>The reigning Premier League champions saw turnover increase by £45m to £331.4m in the year to the end of June, a record for an English club, exceeding the £313m recorded by Arsenal for the same period. </strong></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">United</span><span style="color: #000000;">’</span>s gross debt stands at £458.9m and the club paid £51.2m in interest payments to bond holders in 2010-11, equivalent to 46 per cent of annual profits.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>Interest payments and other costs such as amortisation of player contracts and depreciation reduced the pre-tax profit to £29.7m.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>The commercial growth saw cash reserves boosted to £150.6m at the end of the financial year, reducing the club’s net debt to £308.3m, the lowest since the Glazer’s bought the club in 2005. The Glazers also bought back £63.8m in bonds issued in the 2009 re-financing.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>The cash reserves may have altered since the end of June but the figures released today do include the £52m spent on Phil Jones, David de Gea and Ashley Young in the summer transfer window.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>The rise in turnover was driven by a £22m (37 per cent) increase in commercial revenue, which exceeded the £100m barrier for the first time at £103m, and the club’s on-field success which included a 19th English league title and progress to the Champions League final.</p>
              <p>Commercial growth was driven by the first year of the new shirt sponsorship deal with AON, and will increase again in 2011-12 following the £10m-a-year training kit sponsorship agreed by DHL last month.</p>
              <p>While turnover increased so did costs, with increased player wages and bonuses contributing to a £35m increase in operating expenses, which rose from £185.2m in 2009-10 to £220.5m in the year to June 2011.</p>
              <p>Staff costs rose by £21.2m, £9.7m of which was paid in bonuses and the remaining £11.5m in increased wages.</p>
              <p>Operating expenses also grew by £11.8m, which the club attributes to the cost of staging the pre-season US Tour and, somewhat curiously, the cost of travelling to the Champions League final, which was staged at Wembley.</p>
              <p>The strong financial performance will be used by the Glazer family to help boost interest in the partial floatation of the club on the Singapore stock exchange scheduled for next month.</p>
              <p>The Glazers are hoping to sell 25 per cent of the club for around £600m to reduce the club’s debts, and will hope that the strong commercial performance and deals such as that with DHL will convince investors that their pricing - which gives the club a total valuation of around $4bn - is not optimistic.</p>

              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> have converted last year's £79.2m pre-tax loss into a £29.7m profit, reflecting onfield success and strong commercial growth, and reduced their debt levels.</strong></p>
              <p>The strong figures will strengthen the hand of the Glazer family ahead of a planned IPO share flotation in Singapore next month, but will also spark renewed criticism of the effects of their leveraged <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Business" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/business"><span style="color: #005689;">business</span></a> model.</p>
              <p>The results show revenues rose to a record £331.3m in the year ending June 2011, an increase of 16% on the previous year's £286.4m.</p>
              <p>But with £51.2m in cash interest paid out over the year to service the borrowing loaded on to the club, almost half its record operating profit (before depreciation, amortisation and exceptional items) of £110.9m went on servicing debt.</p>
              <p>The results also show a sharp rise in costs, up to £220.5m from £185.2m the previous year, and a 16.1% increase in staff costs. Those who have campaigned long and hard against the Glazers' ownership model, will point to the £51.7m paid in cash interest to service the bond debt as evidence that is still acting as a drag on the club's finances.</p>
              <p>But Manchester United executives are likely to point to continued success on the field and strong growth in response. Last year's record losses were largely due to one-off charges relating to the £526m bond issue.</p>
              <p>The rise in revenues and operating profit has been driven by a 27% increase in commercial revenues, largely as a result of a string of deals signed with overseas partners, to £103.4m. It does not include the recent £10m a year deal with DHL.</p>
              <p>Media income also increased substantially, mainly as a result of the first year of the Premier League's new £3bn-plus TV deal, from £104.8m to £119.4m. And matchday income was also up 8.4% on last year, largely due to an extra home game and the club's take of the Champions League final gate money, to £108.6m.</p>
              <p>Those representing the Glazers will highlight the fact that net debt stands at its lowest level since they bought the club in a £790m leveraged deal in 2005. With £150.6m cash in the bank, and £63.8m of debt repurchased during the year, the net debt stood at £308.3m at the end of June.</p>
              <p>Upward pressure on wages, in part due to Wayne Rooney's new £180,000-a-week deal and bonuses paid to players, has seen staff costs rise by 16%. However, since the accounts were filed high earners including Gary Neville, Paul Scholes, Edwin van der Sar, Wes Brown and John O'Shea have been moved off the wage bill.</p>
              <p>The wages-to-turnover ratio is still extremely healthy compared to the club's rivals, in particular Manchester City and Chelsea. Executives believe Manchester United will have no problem complying with Uefa's new financial fair play restrictions.</p>
              <p>Ahead of a planned mid-October IPO in Singapore to float a minority stake in the club, the club will point to the results as evidence of its health and growth. But campaign groups will concentrate on the interest payments required to service the club's debt.</p>
              <p>Sources close to the float have promised that the proceeds will be used to pay down debt and boost commercial operations in Asia. That has prompting fans' groups such as the Manchester United Supporters Trust to begin campaigning for the club's debts to be paid off in full and for the money not to be diverted to the Glazers to repay their refinanced payment in kind debt, which has now been moved off the balance sheet of the club's holding company.</p>
