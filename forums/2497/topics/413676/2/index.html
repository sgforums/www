              in such type of matches referees normally avoid giving red cards early in the game.

              it seems the team which has player/s coming out sprouting rubbish before the big match always end up losing.
              
              malouda did it and chelsea lost to city.

              <h1>Manchester City would have lost with 15 players, says Arsenal's Cesc Fabregas</h1>
              <h2>Perhaps it was an unwise boast to direct at a club with Manchester City's resources but Cesc Fabregas claimed that Arsenal would have won even if the Eastlands club had been allowed to put out 15 players on Sunday.</h2>

              <p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Arsenal's</span></strong></a><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> first victory in 10 matches against Chelsea, Manchester United or </span></strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">City</span></strong></a><strong> came after Dedryck Boyata was dismissed after just four minutes before goals from Samir Nasri, Alex Song and Nicklas Bendtner secured the win. </strong> </p>
              <p>But such was Arsenal's poise, Fabregas, who also had penalty saved by Joe Hart before half time, was adamant that City would not have been able to live with Arsenal no matter how many players they had. </p>

              <div class="secondPar">
              <div class="body">
              <p>"Even if they were 15 and we were 11 we would still go and win," he said. "We always want to go forward and create chances but the way we played, we were very difficult to stop. I think we were fantastic.  </p>
              <p>"I think we played some outstanding football and it's difficult to stop a side when they play at that tempo."  </p>
              <p>Without a trophy since 2005, Arsène Wenger feels his side showed they are finally coming of age, particularly as they did not have any players sent off in some brutal exchanges in the opening period. Arsenal had four players cautioned in the opening period but did not add to that total after half time.  </p>
              <p>"I'm very pleased because they looked like they have matured," Wenger said. "We've matured in the sense of negotiating the difficulties of the game in an intelligent way.</p>
              <p>"That means not getting a red card, keeping the ball well, being patient when it was needed. Collectively, we completely dominated the game.  </p>
              <p>"It was a good performance maybe a little bit under special circumstances. It was important to get a win in a big place, to strengthen the belief of the squad and continue our march forward. We were calm and showed intelligence and put in the performance we needed to put in against 10 men."  </p>
              <p>With seven goals in seven matches as well as setting up Bendtner's goal, Wenger feels that Nasri, 23, has taken his game to another level and added: "He is becoming more efficient and I think he's become stronger physically and you judge a player on his numbers.  </p>
              <p>"He got a goal and an assist and that's what you want from a player with a lot of talent like he has. He's a complete player because he can run with the ball, he's quick and he's a clinical finisher now. At 23, your career starts at the top level."  </p>
              <p>Although he was adamant he was not angry, Roberto Mancini, the City manager, maintained that Mark Clattenburg should not have sent Boyata off because Chamakh's touch would have run through to Hart and also insisted that he has never been more confident of his team's prospects.  </p>
              <p>"They showed that they are one of the best teams in the Premier League," Mancini said. "I'm very proud of my players because they played very well. If it was 11 against 11 we would have won this game.  </p>
              <p>"Against Newcastle we had a clear chance to score because Carlos [Tevez] was in the box with a clear chance to score and it was a yellow card.  </p>
              <p>"Today the striker touched the ball but it was probably going to the goalkeeper and the referee sent him off. I don't agree with the referee."  </p>
              <p>City may face censure from the Football Association after a bottle was thrown at Nasri just weeks after a similar incident involving Blackburn's El-Hadji Diouf at Eastlands.</p>

              fabregas is smart to comment after the match, not before.
              
              he is also right that city wont win even with 15 men considering how fabregas has improved in his acting.  see how he grimaced every time he was fouled.  he reminds me of ronaldo.

              from this match we can see city is starting to play as a team.  but they need better and more experience defenders.  mancini should get rid of barry who can neither run nor defend.  he is just not efficient.
              
              city made a big mistake signing lescott and letting dunne go to villa.
              
              crazy to select players just by reputation.

              <p>quite strange, even with 10men, I do believe their combined value would be more than a 15man team. no offense.</p>
              <p>nevertheless, with such an early dismissal, it should give any competent manager a chance to reorganise, and given it is at home, isn't the crowd acting like an extra man?</p>
              <p>i think end of day, gunners played well, but not truly recognised cause they have 11man.. sad.</p>
