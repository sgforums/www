              <p>Arsenal have announced the death of director Danny Fiszman after a long illness.</p>
              <p>Fiszman,
               66, was a central figure in the club's move from Highbury to Emirates 
              Stadium and his legacy will be felt by Arsenal fans for decades to come.</p>
              <p>The news comes just two days after Fiszman agreed to sell his 16.1% holding in the Gunners to Stan Kroenke.</p>
              <p>A
               statement issues by Arsenal on their official website read: "It is with
               great sadness that Arsenal Football Club announces the death of Danny 
              Fiszman after a long battle with illness. He was 66.</p>
              <p>"Danny, who 
              joined the Board of Directors in 1992, was a much loved and respected 
              figure at the Club and will be deeply missed by his many friends and 
              colleagues at Arsenal.</p>
              <p>"During his time as an Arsenal Director, 
              Danny, a hugely successful businessman whose love of Arsenal was obvious
               to all, was a leading influence at the Club. He played an integral role
               in the Club's move from Highbury to our new stadium, working tirelessly
               for many years leading the team which created one of the finest 
              sporting arenas in the world."</p>
              <p>Arsenal Chairman Peter Hill-Wood said: "Danny Fiszman was a visionary Director, a gentleman and a true Arsenal fan.</p>
              <p>"We
               are all deeply saddened by the loss of our dear friend Danny. His 
              voice, wisdom and presence around the football club he so dearly loved 
              will be sorely missed.</p>
              <p>"Arsenal Football Club will forever be 
              indebted to Danny for his invaluable foresight and contribution during 
              the move from Highbury to our new stadium.</p>
              <p>"Our thoughts at this 
              time are with Danny's wife Sally, family and friends. We have lost a 
              much loved husband, father, grandfather and friend."</p>
