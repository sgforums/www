The French boss confronted the Gunners board yesterday in the aftermath of the bitter power struggle. And he warned chairman Peter Hill-Wood that his future is far from certain - despite the club offering him a new contract.</strong><br><br>Wenger, plus senior players including Thierry Henry, have serious concerns about the direction of the club after Dein's abrupt departure. The vice-chairman had been backing the growing influence of American tycoon Stan Kroenke's takeover attempt, believing that is the only way Arsenal could compete with the financial clout of Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea.<br><br>That forced a clash of views with managing director Keith Edelman and main shareholder, Danny Fiszman, resulting in Dein's dramatic exit. And at an hour-long Arsenal board meeting yesterday, attended by Edelman, Richard Carr and Sir Chips Keswick - but not Fiszman - at the Emirates Stadium, Wenger made it clear that he still remains fiercely loyal to Dein.<br><br>The meeting had been scheduled to confirm the club's summer transfer budget, but took on a new importance after the events of Wednesday. With only a year left on his contract, the showdown will be a major concern to Arsenal fans. Hill-Wood said: "It is well known that Arsene and David have got on very well over the past 10 years. "However, I believe that the relationship that Arsene has with the rest of the board is good and he's on contract with us until 2008."<br></div>

Dein had played a key role in transfers and his duties will now be taken on by a new director of football - the first in the club's history.</strong><br><br>"There will definitely be a director of football coming and it will definitely be my choice," Wenger said. "At present I'm doing both jobs - the one David Dein used to do and my own." Over the last 11 years Wenger and Dein established a formidable record in the transfer market, not only in terms of acquisitions and sales, but also in the worldwide scouting network the club set up.<br><br>"I was in a good position before because I would handle the football side and David would do the ugly stuff, the business," added Wenger. "Now it's all down to me. It's difficult because that side of it is very time-consuming." Dein left Arsenal last week over "irreconcilable differences" with other board members.<br><br>Meanwhile Wenger insists he is not opposed to foreign ownership of Arsenal as speculation continues a takeover move by American billionaire Stan Kroenke may be imminent. Dein was forced off the board because of his support for Kroenke's increased involvement in Arsenal, which now stands at a 12.19% stake.<br><br>Chairman Peter Hill-Wood is vehemently opposed to a foreign takeover and Wenger was previously thought to prefer that the club stay in English hands. But Wenger told the News of the World: "I'm not against foreign ownership of clubs, how could I? "I'm a foreign manager and there are many foreign players at Arsenal and in the Premiership.<br><br>"But it has to be done in the right way. If it happens at Arsenal it would not mean I'd quit the club." Dein is thought to be preparing to work with Kroenke to force a takeover of the club.<br><br></div>
