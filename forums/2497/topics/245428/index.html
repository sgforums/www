"There is no agenda.<br><br>"IÂ’d like to think IÂ’m intelligent enough and not naive, in picking the team I feel will get a result.<br><br>"IÂ’m not strong enough in the position I am, in the bottom three, to start leaving people out (for personal reasons).<br><br>"IÂ’ve said it to Teddy since IÂ’ve been at the club that heÂ’s trained really well. Especially stuff where you think Â‘perhaps heÂ’ll struggle with thatÂ’ but he hasnÂ’t and heÂ’s desperate to play.<br><br>"I understand his frustration but I donÂ’t know how much he featured before I came to the club, he obviously figured in some very important games and scored some crucial goals." </span></div>
