              <h1>Redknapp: Huntelaar wages beyond us</h1>
              <p><br> <img src="http://fourfourtwo.com/contentimages/news/Huntelaar22.jpg" alt="Huntelaar22" align="right"> </p>
              <p><strong>Tottenham
                  Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp says sealing a deal for Real Madrid
                  striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar will be difficult due to the Dutchman's
                  high wage demands.<br> <br> </strong>Huntelaar's future at the Bernabeu - along with several of his
                  fellow countrymen - has been cast into doubt following the return of
                  former president Florentino Perez, who has already splashed more than
                  €200 million on stellar signings including Kaka, Cristiano Ronaldo and
                  Karim Benzema.<br> <br> The striker has been linked with a move to several Premier League
                  clubs, including Manchester United, Arsenal and Spurs, while Bundesliga
                  outfit Stuttgart had agreed a deal with Real, only for the player to
                  snub the opportunity to join the German outfit.<br> <br> The former Portsmouth boss confirmed on Thursday that he was interested in bringing the ex-Ajax goal-getter, who has totalled 143 league goals in 203 club appearances to date, to White Hart Lane this summer.<br> <br> However, having also revealed that he would be prepared to sign Pompey
                  striker Peter Crouch, but not for the current asking price, Redknapp
                  has added that he is also reluctant to shell out silly money to land
                  Huntelaar.<br> <br> "Daniel [Levy] spoke to Real Madrid and went over to meet the people, but his wages are beyond us," he said in the <em>Daily Mail.<br> <br> </em>"I think Stuttgart were trying to do a deal, but Real Madrid were not prepared to do the deal they wanted.</p>
              <p>"I am sure we would have the same problem. I can't see it happening.<br> <br> "Wages are difficult. We pay good money but we don't pay crazy money so it's hard.<br> <br> "I was interested in Gareth Barry and Roque Santa Cruz but we couldn't get anywhere near them."</p>
