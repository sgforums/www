              <p>It's the same old story and the media or some other keyboard hero would probably said something like "If your comment on Singapore Football is so bad, assuming that you're so good, why not you represent Singapore instead?"</p>
              <p>Bulls.</p>
              <p>It's the same as S-League, the stupid tagline of "Top 10 league in Asia" is dumb. Besides Japan-League, Korea-League, Australian-League and probably Saudi Arabia League, the rest of the leagues in asia are just there to make up the number.</p>
              <p>Enough of "we're improving because Indonesia Clubs are poaching our National Team players from local club. It shows that our players are capable of performing outside Singapore". What is there to show off about when it's not even J-League, K-League or even A-League?</p>
              <p>No point sacking the coach, the management or even the players. It will be the same old story when S-League is still around.</p>
              <p>Does it ever occur to the FAS that the golden period of Singapore Football was during the Malaysia Cup days? The fans were so proud supporting Singapore even though there were ups and downs because of the brand of football that they were playing.</p>
              <p>Foreign talents were not a problem, we have Abbas Saad, Jang Jung, Michal Vana, Alistair Stewart, Warren Spink, Craig Foster.</p>
              <p>Local Heroes were also born like Fandi, Kadir Yahya, David Lee, Malek Awab, Nasri Nasir, Terry Pathmanathan and of course, the Quah brothers.</p>
              <p>Dont mention about Singapore's ranking in the world of football. It's a joke I must say.</p>
              <p>I personally do not think the foreign talents are the problem although i feel that precious is not up to scratch and players like Egmar Goncalves and Mirko Grabovac are betrayers of the system.</p>
              <p>But then again, I would say that most of these players, after obtaining Singapore citizenship, slack off and did not perform like how they used to when vying for a spot in this system. People like Shi Jiayi, Itimi Dickson, Agu Casmir, Precious, John Wilkinson, Mustafic Fahruddin all fall under radar and performed below par.</p>
              <p>If Singapore were to improve, I would say that it has to start from basic. Pass, Move, Shoot. 3 simple steps but it's not easy to master.</p>
              <p>I hope no offense is taken but Singaporeans are moved towards securing a qualification before they take any risks so that at least they have something to fall back on should their risk fail. Which is why I think the most practical approach is to target student who are not academically incline to do sports instead so that at least there's something they will be good at to earn a decent living.</p>
              <p>Do not fall into the believe that the young lions of YOG will come good one day because I can safely assume that at least half of the squad will leave the sports to concentrate on their studies instead.</p>

              <p>the coach need to blood new players, but then no quality players unearthed. the only alternative is to unearth and identify expatriates to replace the ageing expatriates like daniel bennet, wilkinson and that 40 year old Duric. get rid of the agu casmir, he is useless.</p>
