              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Luis Suarez's race-row hearing has begun under a clock of secrecy.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The Liverpool striker is charged by the FA with allegedly aiming racist abuse at Manchester United defender Patrice Evra.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>It is believed the case will last around two days, with Suarez and Evra both due to give evidence.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>If found guilty, the uruguyan star can expect to be handed a lengthy suspension from the game.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Evra has claimed that Suarez used an offensive term on several occasions during United's 1-1 draw against Liverpool at Anfield in October. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Suarez has denied the allegations and has the full backing of his club as he attempts to clear his name.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The disciplinary hearing will focus on the players' versions of events. Suarez's defence is based around the nuances of the Spanish language and cultural differences. </span></p>

              <p><strong>What we don't know for certain is the word </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Luis Suárez" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/luis-suarez"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Luis Suárez</strong></span></a><strong> used. Patrice Evra alleges it was racist and uttered at least 10 times. Suárez admits he did say something but nothing, for someone with his upbringing in Uruguay, he considers racist or deserving of the Football Association charges that will bring lawyers from </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> and </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Liverpool" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong> opposite one another in the coming weeks. Here lies the problem for the FA and the reason why they are thinking about bringing in a QC with specialist knowledge to oversee the case.</strong></p>
              <p>In ordinary circumstances, the FA would appoint a three-man panel consisting of an independent chairman, an FA councillor and someone described as a "football expert", meaning a former player or manager. The Guardian, however, has learned the FA may upgrade to a four-man commission because of the complexities of a case in which Suárez can, if necessary, point out he comes from a country where variations of the N-word are used very differently, and that it is actually quite common in Uruguay for men and women of all skin colours to have the nickname of El Negro or La Negra without any racist undertones.</p>
              <p>Obdulio Varela, the 1950 World Cup-winning captain and one of the more famous footballers in Uruguayan history, is revered as El Negro Jefe (The Black Chief). Fernando Cáceres, who was in the Argentina squad at the 1994 World Cup, is another El Negro, as is Héctor Enrique, the Argentinian who played the pass for Diego Maradona to slalom through the England team in Mexico 1986. Then consider that Enrique, for example, is not even black, and it becomes even more confused.</p>
              <p>Nor is this just a football thing. Rubén "El Negro" Rada is one of Uruguay's more successful musicians, appearing in a sitcom called La Oveja Negra (The Black Sheep) and with a compilation of his work entitled El Album Negro. Héctor Lescano, Uruguay's minister of sport and tourism, is known in politics as El Negro Lescano. The late cartoonist and writer Roberto Fontanarrosa and the late singer Mercedes Sosa were two others. Both were white.</p>
              <p>Elliott Turner, the author of An Illustrated Guide to Soccer and Spanish, posed the question recently of whether, in the Suárez case, "Anglo racial linguistic norms really offer the right and only lens by which to judge". Turner, writing for <a href="http://www.runofplay.com/"><span style="color: #005689;">The Run Of Play</span></a>, said: "On a superficial level, in the Spanish language one can use the term <em>negro</em> or <em>güero</em> or <em>moreno</em>, with no negative connotation." <em>Güero </em>is white or light-skinned; <em>moreno</em> means brown or dark.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span class="base-gallery-pic"><a class="thickbox" title="Suarez and Evra: Hearing has begun" href="http://images.football365.com/11/11/800x600/SuarezEvra_2679084.jpg"><img src="http://images.football365.com/11/11/640/SuarezEvra_2679084.jpg" alt="Suarez and Evra: Hearing has begun"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></span></a></span></p>
              <p class="base-text-caption">Suarez and Evra: Hearing has begun</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>So is it all fairly innocent in the Spanish-speaking world? Not quite. "All language exists in context," Turner continued. "I'd say those terms only to family, friends or acquaintances. If you say the same term with anger in your eyes and hate in your heart, then its meaning can change 180 degrees." Like the time, perhaps, Luis Aragonés, at the time Spain's manager, referred to Thierry Henry as "<em>negro de mierda</em>" ("a black shit") in 2004.</strong></p>
              <p>This is where Suárez may find himself being interrogated. He and Evra were, after all, arguing at the time, so it would be difficult for the Liverpool player to make a case that it was merely an alternative to "mate" or "pal". Then there is the issue of whether ignorance should constitute any form of defence anyway. If a foreign visitor were stopped for driving on the wrong side of the road in England, would he get off simply because he could claim it was the norm where he was from? Suárez has lived in northern Europe since 2006, so an argument could be made he should have a decent grasp of what can and cannot be said outside South America and would be acceptable in one country but unacceptable in another.</p>
              <p><em>Negrito</em> is another prime example. It turns out this is not the word central to the Suárez-Evra case, but it does reveal a little more about the nuances of the Spanish language, translating as "little black guy" and such a common part of the vernacular that team-mates use it on each other as an affectionate term. Take the tweet Dani Pacheco, the Liverpool player on loan at Rayo Vallecano, sent to his Spain Under-21 colleague Thiago Alcântara via Twitter recently. "Negrito, enjoy yourself," it began.</p>
              <p>Visitors to countries such as Uruguay and Argentina can, understandably, find it shocking if they are unaware of the semantics. "The key is the tone in which you say those words," Sebastián García, the South American football writer for <a href="http://www.mundoalbiceleste.com/"><span style="color: #005689;">Mundo Albiceleste</span></a>, explains. "It can be extremely friendly to call someone <em>negrito</em> but it can also be very offensive."</p>
              <p>In Brazil, it is <em>negão</em>, again with no racist connotation if none is meant. Other terms such as <em>branco</em> (white), <em>moreno</em> (dusky) and <em>mulato</em> (mixed race) are also commonly used in a non-offensive way. However, they can, too, be used in a racist capacity. Again, it comes down to context.</p>
              <p>Another example is of Javier Hernández, now Evra's team-mate at United, in an interview on the Chivas Guadalajara website in 2007, where the Mexican is quoted complimenting "the goal of the <em>Negrito</em>", talking about his team-mate Omar Esparza. As García explains: "It all depends on the connotation, the way it is used, the tone, the intent."</p>
              <p>Even then, different rules are in operation. When Carlos Tevez started out at Boca Juniors he was known as El Monito (The Little Monkey). Diego Perotti, the Sevilla player, goes by the same nickname, because his father, Hugo, who played with Diego Maradona at Boca, was El Mono (the suffixes -ito and -ita indicate a diminutive). Could a player in England, of whatever race, ever be called this?</p>
              <p>If nothing else, it highlights that there may be shades of grey involved when it comes to deciding what is racist and what is not. But it is a complicated business and, in Suárez's case, this is why the FA has allowed him more time than usual to respond to the charges. Liverpool say he will vigorously protest his innocence and the striker has said his words were not an insult but just his own "way of expressing myself. I called him something his team-mates at Manchester call him, and even they were surprised by his reaction. There were two parts of the discussion, one in Spanish, one in English."</p>
              <p>The delays have been frustrating for Liverpool, where they have offered Suárez their full backing, and also for United, where there is a feeling the dispute may have contributed towards Evra's erratic recent form. One of football's anti-racism bodies has complained behind the scenes that "people are tried for murder in less time". But the semantics and cultural issues are so complex it is not something the men in suits at FA headquarters can learn in a crash course. No date has been set for the hearing and, with legal teams to assemble, a row that began between two rival players on a football pitch on 15 October could very likely go beyond Christmas.</p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Suarez has been charged with abusing Evra, and referring to his 'ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race' by the Football Association.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The outcome of the hearing is expected later today or on Friday. The charge followed a month-long investigation and it is understood Anfield manager Dalglish will provide a character reference to help his player at the meeting scheduled to take place at a North-Western hotel.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Speaking on Thursday morning, Dalglish said: 'We can't do or say anything that will be prejudicial in any way, shape or form.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'With regards to Luis, we'll say what we have said before. We'll stand right beside him and help him as much as we possibly can. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'After it's finished there will be a chance for a conversation.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The Uruguay striker strongly denied the accusation and Liverpool say they remain 'fully supportive' of the 24-year-old with the club's lawyers set to fight his case against a possible six-match suspension.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The FA announced the charge last month, alleging Suarez used 'abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour' towards Evra.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'It is further alleged that this included a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Patrice Evra,' said the FA.</span></p>

              <p><strong>They must rule on linguistic issues, cultural differences, body language while ensuring that the subtleties of the story are not lost amid FA politicking. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>The charge facing Suárez is that he “used abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour” towards <span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span>’s Patrice Evra at Anfield on Oct 15. It is “alleged that this included a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Patrice Evra”, the FA adds.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>Evra, who is adamant he was racially abused 10 times, has the backing of his manager Sir Alex Ferguson and his club.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>Suárez, who will admit using the word “negro” once, will argue that it is a descriptive expression, and not deemed offensive in his native Uruguay, and that it is similar to Dirk Kuyt getting called “blondie” by the South American players at Anfield.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>Suárez categorically denies the racism charges and enjoys the total support of his manager, Kenny Dalglish, and Liverpool’s owners, John W Henry and Tom Werner.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>The Americans will submit testimony supporting their player while Dalglish will attend the hearing in person.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span> are also expected to use evidence from a linguistic expert.</p>
              <p>In defending Suárez, Liverpool are expected to mention the incident between Evra and Chelsea’s groundstaff in 2008 which culminated in an FA hearing which concluded that “we find Mr Evra’s account exaggerated and unreliable”.</p>
              <p>This is a case of deep detail between two well-known footballers and a broad picture of a governing body engaged in a long-running feud with Fifa president Sepp Blatter. The three men on the panel must guard against letting the FA’s desire to be seen to be strong on racism, so highlighting one of Blatter’s many weak points, clouding their judgment. Reputations are at stake.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The experienced three-man panel</strong></p>
              <p>The experienced three-man panel, which gathered on Wednesday afternoon, is chaired by Paul Goulding QC, who comes from the same Blackstones chambers as Adam Lewis, the barrister employed by the FA in Wayne Rooney’s successful Uefa appeal last week.</p>
              <p>Goulding, a qualified FA coach, appeared for Jean Tigana in his successful claim following his sacking as Fulham manager and has advised Premier League clubs and players in the past.</p>
              <p>Also involved is Brian Jones, the chairman of Sheffield and Hallamshire FA who wrote to all his county members on June 20, stressing the need to fight discrimination. The third member is Denis Smith, well respected within the game following his time as a defender at Stoke City and managing clubs such as Sunderland and Oxford United.</p>
              <p>Two representatives from the FA secretariat are present but Goulding, Jones and Smith will rule on Suárez, possibly on Friday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The allegations centre around the second half of the 1-1 draw at Anfield. Events started in the 57th minute when Suárez fouled Evra, tempers really flaring at an ensuing Liverpool corner. Amid some pushing and shoving, Evra demanded to know from Suárez why he had kicked him. Suárez replied that things happen in games and to move on.</p>
              <p>It is here that Evra claims Suárez first became racially abusive; the Frenchman was subsequently quoted on the French station Canal Plus, saying that “there are cameras, you can see him [Suárez] say a certain word to me at least 10 times’’. Suárez categorically denies using that word, negro, in the goalmouth.</p>
              <p>Watching events from the press box, it was pretty clear that Evra was incensed yet the players around seemed unaware of any dispute. The testimony of those closest, United’s David de Gea and Liverpool’s Dirk Kuyt, will play a part.</p>
              <p>There is an expectancy that it will be confirmed to the panel that nothing offensive was heard in the goalmouth.</p>
              <p>Shortly after the corner, referee Andre Marriner called the pair together for a lecture. Suárez apologised and attempted to pat the United full-back on the head. “Don’t touch me, you South American,’’ Evra is alleged to have said. To which, the Uruguayan replied: “Porque, Negro?’’</p>
              <p>Suárez’s defence rests on the argument that such expressions are commonplace in South America. It is considered offensive, according to Suárez’s defence, only when used with a pejorative adjective or when the tone is aggressive. Footage of Suárez’s body language will be scrutinised by the panel.</p>
              <p>This will inevitably form part of Liverpool’s case, that when Suárez did use the word “negro” he was not in aggressive mood, more apologetic towards Evra.</p>
              <p>Yet Suárez must prove he was unaware of the sensitivity towards the word “negro” in England. The former Ajax player will also have to explain why, having lived for three years in Holland, he had still to grasp northern European intolerance to such a word.</p>
              <p>Despite Marriner’s intervention, Evra remained furious. When he caught Kuyt two minutes later, Evra responded to Marriner’s caution by allegedly claiming: “You’re only booking me because I’m black.’’</p>
              <p>Suárez is bemused by the case. “I called him something his team-mates at Manchester call him, and even they were surprised by his reaction,’’ Suárez claimed in the immediate aftermath of the incident.</p>
              <p>Much will depend on whether Liverpool can convince the panel that Suárez does not have racist tendencies.</p>
              <p>They are expected to point out that Suárez made a video in South African townships during the 2010 World Cup called “From the Streets to the Fields”. He hails football’s “tremendous power of joining people, without any skin, religion and social discrimination”.</p>
              <p>Liverpool’s work in combating racism is sure to be mentioned. As is their owners’. Henry has been instrumental in celebrating the life of Jackie Robinson, the legendary black baseballer, at the Boston Red Sox which he owns.</p>
              <p>In focusing on increasing diversity at Fenway Park and funding school scholarships for those from disadvantaged parts of Boston, Henry told National Public Radio in October that “we have to make a statement not just in baseball but in our community that diversity is an issue that hasn’t been fully addressed in the past and certainly has to be fully addressed.</p>
              <p>"I think it’s important what your actions are. That will really define the franchise going forward’’.</p>
              <p>Liverpool’s reputation would be damaged if Suáarez were found guilty of such a heinous offence.</p>
              <p>That is why the panel must stay clear-eyed, ignoring FA tensions with Blatter over racism. Goulding, Jones and Smith must focus on one man’s word against another, and whether to accept cultural differences.</p>

              <p><span>Luis Suarez has been banned for eight matches and fined £40,000 after an Independent Regulatory Commission found a charge of misconduct against him proven.</span></p>
              <p><span>An FA statement said: 'Mr Suarez used insulting words towards Mr Evra during the match contrary to FA Rule E3(1).<br></span></p>
              <p><span>'The insulting words used by Mr Suarez included a reference to Mr Evra's colour within the meaning of Rule E3(2).</span></p>
              <p><span>'Mr Suarez shall be warned as to his future conduct, be suspended for eight matches covering all first team competitive matches and fined the sum of £40,000.</span></p>
              <p><span>'The [penalty] is suspended pending the outcome of any appeal lodged by Mr Suarez against this decision.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Mr Suarez has the right to appeal the decision of the Independent Regulatory Commission to an Appeal Board. An appeal must be lodged within 14 days of the date of the written reasons for the decision.</span></p>
              <p><span>'The penalty is suspended until after the outcome of any appeal, or the time for appealing expires, or should Mr Suarez decide not to appeal. The reason for this is to ensure that the penalty does not take effect before any appeal so that Mr Suarez has an effective right of appeal.'</span></p>
              <p><span>In response, Suarez took to Twitter, and said: 'Today is a very difficult and painful day for both me and my family. Thanks for all the support, I'll keep working!'</span></p>
              <p><span>While his manager used the same tool to convey his disappointment. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Dalglish wrote: 'Very disappointed with today's verdict. This is the time when [Luis] needs our full support. Let's not let him walk alone. KD'</span></p>
              <p><span>Open hearing the verdict, Liverpool released a statement, which said: 'Liverpool Football Club is very surprised and disappointed with the decision of the Football Association Commission to find Luis Suarez guilty of the charges against him.</span></p>
              <p><span>'We look forward to the publication of the Commission's Judgment.  We will study the detailed reasons of the Commission once they become available, but reserve our right to appeal or take any other course of action we feel appropriate with regards to this situation.</span></p>

              <p><span>'We find it extraordinary that Luis can be found guilty on the word of Patrice Evra alone when no-one else on the field of play - including Evra's own Manchester United team-mates and all the match officials - heard the alleged conversation between the two players in a crowded Kop goalmouth while a corner kick was about to be taken.</span></p>
              <p><span>'The club takes extremely seriously the fight against all forms of discrimination and has a long and successful track record in work relating to anti-racist activity and social inclusion. We remain committed to this ideal and equality for all, irrespective of a person's background.</span></p>
              <p><span>'LFC considers racism in any form to be unacceptable - without compromise. It is our strong held belief, having gone over the facts of the case, that Luis Suarez did not commit any racist act.  It is also our opinion that the accusation by this particular player was not credible - certainly no more credible than his prior unfounded accusations.</span></p>
              <p><span>'It is key to note that Patrice Evra himself in his written statement in this case said "I don't think that Luis Suarez is racist". The FA in their opening remarks accepted that Luis Suarez was not racist.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Luis himself is of a mixed race family background as his grandfather was black. He has been personally involved since the 2010 World Cup in a charitable project which uses sport to encourage solidarity amongst people of different backgrounds with the central theme that the colour of a person's skin does not matter; they can all play together as a team."</span></p>
              <p><span>'He has played with black players and mixed with their families whilst with the Uruguay national side and was Captain at Ajax Amsterdam of a team with a proud multi-cultural profile, many of whom became good friends.</span></p>
              <p><span>'It seems incredible to us that a player of mixed heritage should be accused and found guilty in the way he has based on the evidence presented. We do not recognise the way in which Luis Suarez has been characterised.</span></p>

              <p><span>'It appears to us that the FA were determined to bring charges against Luis Suarez, even before interviewing him at the beginning of November. Nothing we have heard in the course of the hearing has changed our view that Luis Suarez is innocent of the charges brought against him and we will provide Luis with whatever support he now needs to clear his name.</span></p>
              <p><span>'We would also like to know when the FA intend to charge Patrice Evra with making abusive remarks to an opponent after he admitted himself in his evidence to insulting Luis Suarez in Spanish in the most objectionable of terms. Luis, to his credit, actually told the FA he had not heard the insult.'</span></p>
              <p><span>The Uruguay international, charged by the Football Association with abusing the Manchester United defender and referring to his 'ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race', faced a disciplinary hearing last week. </span></p>
              <p><span>Suarez denied the allegations levelled against him by Evra after the 1-1 draw between the sides at Anfield on October 15, with formal proceedings in front of an independent three-man panel having started on Wednesday. </span></p>
              <p><span>Although the case became one man's word against the other, complexities left it open to interpretation.</span></p>
              <p><span>From the moment Sir Alex Ferguson escorted his player to see referee Andre Marriner at Anfield after the game, Evra insisted Suarez abused him on numerous occasions when they clashed in the second half. </span></p>
              <p><span>He confided in team-mates for several weeks that he was supremely confident the case against Suarez would be proven and his complaint vindicated. </span></p>
              <p><span>Suarez did not deny using the word 'negro' or 'negrito' once, but what complicated the case was his defence that the term was not meant as an insult and would be acceptable in Uruguay and many countries around the world.</span></p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;"><strong>WHEN DOES THE BAN BEGIN?</strong></h2>
              <p>NORMALLY disciplinary bans begin immediately, which would have ruled Suarez out of tonight's league clash with Wigan and the following seven games. But the FA have suspended the ban for a maximum of 14 days to allow Suarez time to appeal. If he does appeal, the case will be heard again by an independent appeal board appointed by the FA.</p>
              <p><strong>WHAT HAS SUAREZ BEEN FOUND GUILTY OF?</strong></p>
              <p>SUAREZ and Patrice Evra clashed during Liverpool's league showdown with Manchester United at Anfield on October 15. After the game, Evra claimed he had been racially abused by Suarez "at least 10 times". The FA subsequently charged Suarez with misconduct contrary to FA Rule E3, "using insulting words" towards the Frenchman.</p>
              <p><strong>IS THIS THE FIRST VERDICT OF ITS KIND IN FOOTBALL?</strong></p>
              <p>NO. In 2003, Reading defender John Mackie was banned for three matches with a further five suspended and fined £3,000 — half of it suspended — for making racist comments to Sheffield United striker Carl Asaba. In 2005, Spain boss Luis Aragones was fined £2,000 for racist remarks about Thierry Henry.</p>
              <p><strong>WHAT GAMES DOES HE MISS IF HE DOESN'T APPEAL?</strong></p>
              <p>IF Suarez takes 14 days and then decides <strong>NOT</strong> to appeal, he will miss the league clash at Manchester City on January 3. He will also miss the FA Cup tie against Oldham, both Carling Cup semi-final legs against City and league clashes with Stoke, Bolton, Wolves and Tottenham. If he <strong>DOES</strong> appeal and loses, the ban will begin immediately after the appeal.</p>
              <p><strong>COULD THIS AFFECT THE JOHN TERRY CASE?</strong></p>
              <p>THE FA will tell you there is no chance the Suarez ban will have any effect on the impending case involving John Terry's alleged racial insult to QPR defender Anton Ferdinand. But one thing is now clear: If JT is found guilty, he can expect at least eight games on the sidelines which would be a disaster for him, Chelsea and England.</p>

              <p><strong>HOW HARD WILL THIS HIT LIVERPOOL?</strong></p>
              <p>IF the ban is upheld, it will be hugely embarrassing for Liverpool who have always been proud of their record tackling racism. Boss Kenny Dalglish has made it clear neither he nor the club will tolerate racism in any shape or form. Liverpool again came out strongly in defence of Suarez last night whilst condemning all forms of discrimination.</p>
              <p><strong>WHAT MESSAGE DOES THIS SEND TO FOOTBALL?</strong></p>
              <p>ENGLISH football led the world in fighting racism following dreadful scenes in the 70s and 80s, when players were routinely abused by fans. Forty years on, our game is still leading the fight thanks to schemes like Kick It Out. By banning Suarez for eight matches, the FA is leaving everyone in no doubt they intend to stamp out racism for good.</p>

              <p>FA bosses found the £23million Uruguayan player guilty of using insulting words about the colour of Manchester United's black defender Patrice Evra. </p>
              <p>He was also fined £40,000. Liverpool last night attacked the verdict. But Kick It Out campaign chairman Lord Herman Ouseley said: "The FA has shown leadership. </p>
              <p>"It has demonstrated it will not stand for discrimination — something organisations such as FIFA and UEFA should take heed of." </p>
              <p>Piara Powar, of Football Against Racism in Europe, said the case centred on the word "negrito", which Suarez, 24, claimed was often used in South America. </p>
              <p>Mr Powar insisted: "It is racially offensive." But Suarez said: "I'm upset by accusations of racism. I can only say that I have always respected and respect everybody." </p>
              <p>He added on Twitter: "We are all the same. I go to the field with the maximum illusion of a little child who enjoys what he does, not to create conflicts." </p>
              <p>Liverpool FC was "surprised and disappointed". A spokesman said: "We reserve our right to appeal or take any action we feel appropriate. </p>
              <p>"We find it extraordinary that Luis can be found guilty on the word of Patrice Evra alone when no one else on the field of play heard the alleged conversation. </p>
              <p>"Patrice Evra himself in his written statement said, 'I don't think that Luis Suarez is racist'. The FA in their opening remarks accepted that Luis Suarez was not racist." </p>
              <p>Former Kop hero and BBC pundit Mark Lawrenson said the penalty "does seem somewhat harsh". </p>
              <p>And team boss Kenny Dalglish called on fans to back Suarez. He said on Twitter: "Very disappointed with today's verdict. Let's not let him walk alone." </p>
              <p>Controversial £80,000-a-week striker Suarez had been accused of racially abusing Evra ten times during a match at Anfield in October. </p>
              <p>The ruling comes as Chelsea's England captain John Terry waits to hear if he will face police charges over an alleged racial slur at QPR player Anton Ferdinand. Terry denies any wrongdoing.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4jioyxn6k&amp;feature=player_embedded">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4jioyxn6k&amp;feature=player_embedded</a></p>

              </div>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>Considering Luis Suarez had just received a seven-match ban and been branded the ‘Cannibal of Ajax’ when he moved to Anfield in January, Liverpool should perhaps have realised their new £22.8million signing might land himself in hot water sooner or later.</span></p>
              <p><span>Unfortunately for them, it was sooner.</span></p>
              <p><span>Having already divided opinion in England over the last 11 months by tarnishing his undoubted talent by going to ground too easily too often, the Uruguay striker stands guilty of the far more serious offence of racially abusing Patrice Evra </span></p>
              <p><span>As the 24-year-old digests his eight-match ban and £40,000 fine, let’s not forget he still has to face a separate FA charge for allegedly making a one-fingered gesture at Fulham fans.</span></p>
              <p><span>It would be fair to say that Suarez, who learned his trade on the streets of Montevideo after moving to the Uruguayan capital at the age of seven with his mother and six brothers, has not been a stranger to controversy.</span></p>
              <p><span>The cannibal tag was coined by Dutch newspaper <span style="font-style: italic;">De Telegraaf </span>after he bit into the shoulder of opponent Otman Bakkal during a game between Ajax and PSV Eindhoven in November last year.</span></p>
              <p><span>Ajax took the matter into their own hands, fining Suarez and giving him a two-match ban, but the Dutch FA swiftly increased that to seven games, and it was during the enforced lay-off that Liverpool made their move.</span></p>
              <p><span>That was the second time he had been suspended by Ajax. The first occasion followed an incident in November 2007 when he was involved in a dressing-room bust-up with team-mate Albert Luque over a free-kick routine that went wrong in a game against Feyenoord.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/12/20/article-0-071A2E07000005DC-109_306x423.jpg" alt="Ill-tempered: Suarez's spell at Ajax was marked by indiscipline" width="306" height="423">

              </div>
              <p><span>Suarez, whose move to Amsterdam from Groningen had been far from smooth after an arbitration panel rejected his attempt to force the transfer through, also upset Ajax coach Marco van Basten with the number of bookings brought about by his quick temper and penchant for diving.</span></p>
              <p><span>It was a problem that marred his debut for Uruguay in a World Cup qualifier against Colombia in 2007, when he was sent off in the 85th minute after picking up a second  yellow for dissent.</span></p>
              <p><span>If that went largely unnoticed outside his homeland, Suarez’s next red card for Uruguay earned him worldwide notoriety.</span></p>
              <p><span>Johannesburg, July 2010. Uruguay knocked out Ghana — Africa’s last remaining representative in the first World Cup to be staged on the continent — in a quarter-final shootout, but only after Suarez had been sent off in the final moments of extra-time for deliberately blocking Dominic Adiyiah’s goalbound header with his hands.</span></p>

              <p><span>If Suarez’s actions were understandable to many, his wild celebrations in the tunnel when Asamoah Gyan missed the resulting penalty left a sour taste, as did his ‘Hand of God’ status in Uruguay. </span></p>
              <p><span>‘He’s the most hated man in Ghana,’ Gyan would later say. Suarez responded: ‘It was something that happened in the heat of the moment. As time has gone by, I have had time to reflect on the whole episode and I can now understand the controversy it has caused.’ <br></span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span>Some inevitably bring up the charity work. ‘Football has got this tremendous power of joining people, without any skin, religion and social discrimination,’ Suarez once said.</span></p>
              <p><span>Those words might now sound a little hollow.</span></p>
              <h2><span style="font-size: x-large;">PS<br></span></h2>
              <p><span>If Luis Suarez thinks an eight-game ban is hefty, it could get even worse. He is still facing an FA improper conduct charge for an alleged abusive hand gesture in the recent 1-0 defeat at Fulham. </span></p>
              <p><span>The Uruguayan appeared to raise the middle finger of his left hand towards home fans as he left the pitch.</span></p>
