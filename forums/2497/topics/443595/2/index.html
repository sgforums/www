              <p><span>Luis Suarez, who has been banned for EIGHT matches for racially abusing Patrice Evra, should have been told what is right and wrong when he arrived in England.</span></p>
              <p><span>That is the view of players chief Gordon Taylor, who welcomed the suspension as a strong statement that racism will not be tolerated in this country.</span></p>
              <p><span>Suarez was handed his huge suspension and £40,000 fine on Tuesday night after the ruling by an FA independent regulatory commission.</span></p>
              <p><span>The Liverpool striker is expected to appeal the punishment, with his defence claiming that due to cultural differences he was unaware that language acceptable in his country was viewed as racist in Europe.</span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>understands Suarez told the commission, which also included former Sunderland manager Denis Smith and Sheffield and Hallamshire FA chairman Brian Jones, that he addressed Evra using the word ‘negrito’.</span></p>

              <p><span>Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers’ Association, insists clubs must tell their players what is acceptable.</span></p>
              <p><span>He said: ‘This is a situation involving two of our biggest clubs and a very sensitive time and it reiterates the message we want to get out.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>‘We are a multicultural society and a cosmopolitan league and players must have equal respect for people regardless of their nationality or skin colour.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘You can understand Liverpool being upset as they are a top quality club with a top quality manager but perhaps it is a timely reminder that players new to this country need to be advised about what is unacceptable.’</span></p>
              <p><span>Taylor added that Suarez’s hefty punishment was an key message especially after the outcry at FIFA president Sepp Blatter’s remarks - later retracted - that racism on the pitch should be settled by a handshake.</span></p>

              <p><strong>It is more than 30 years since Howard Gayle became </strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">'</span>s first black player. A fleet-footed winger, he joined the club at 19 from amateur football and his second appearance for the first team came as an early substitute for </strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Kenny Dalglish</span></strong><strong> in the return leg of a European Cup semi-final against Bayern Munich in Germany in 1981, when he tore apart the left flank of the home defence and terrified his opponents into a series of such violent fouls that Bob Paisley took him off for his own safety with 20 minutes to go.</strong></p>
              <p>Yet the following year he was off on loan to Newcastle United before a transfer to Birmingham City brought an end to his Anfield career. Despite his 62 goals in 156 league games for Liverpool's highly rated reserves, neither the coaches nor some of his team-mates trusted his talent at a time when black players were still widely suspected of lacking the appetite for a battle. And, of course, opposing fans were free to shower him with racist epithets.</p>
              <p>On Wednesday Gayle's voice was virtually alone among black players of the past and present who were invited to comment on the eight-match ban and £40,000 fine imposed on <span style="color: #000000;">Luis Suárez</span> for insulting behaviour towards Patrice Evra, aggravated by the use of language referring to colour of the Manchester United player's skin. The rest were unanimous in their approval of the verdict and the sentence. Mark Bright was one. Using Twitter, he said: "About time strong action was taken." Another was Clark Carlisle, the chairman of the Professional Footballers Association. "That's exactly what we want to see as a union," Carlisle said.</p>
              <p>Gayle, however, commended the now notorious Liverpool statement, issued immediately after the announcement of the verdict, in which the club mounted a spirited defence of the player. "I travel to most Liverpool home games and the stewards and staff wear 'Kick Racism Out of Football' badges all year round, so you know there is a campaign against racism or any racist chants in the ground," he told the Liverpool Echo. "I couldn't see that they would throw their weight behind Luis Suárez if the allegations were true."</p>
              <p>As with Kenny Dalglish's tweet on Tuesday night – "This is the time when @luis16suarez needs our full support. Let's not let him walk alone" – and the club's official statement, here was a club closing ranks in a refusal to accept an independent finding, thus earning the disapproval of those who felt that every step had been taken to ensure that justice would be served.</p>
              <p>Liverpool being Liverpool, and virtually impervious to outside opinion (which makes Dalglish, who shares that trait, their ideal manager), they are unlikely to look back in the cold light of another day and feel a twinge of regret at speaking in haste. But they are not flattered by angry words which appear to contradict so much of the good work they, like many other clubs, have done in the fight against racism over the past 20 years.</p>
              <p>Lord Ouseley, a former chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality and the current chair of Kick It Out, the body set up to end racism in football, was commenting on the case of John Terry and Chelsea on Wednesday when he criticised clubs for defending their players without having first made adequate inquiries, but his general point could be applied to Suárez and Liverpool. "Clubs, who are large employers, must consider the implications of dealing with allegations made against their players, and not simply offer blanket support without carrying out their own full investigations and being certain of the ground on which they are standing when they offer full support," he told Sky Sports.</p>
              <p>Suárez was found guilty by a tribunal of three men: Paul Goulding QC, a specialist in employment law who also holds FA coaching qualifications; Brian Jones, the chairman of Sheffield and Hallamshire FA; and Denis Smith, once a ferocious oldâ€‘school centre-half with Tony Waddington's Stoke City, more recently the manager of York City, Sunderland and Oxford United, and currently helping to guide Stoke City's young players through their lives off the pitch. Appointed by the FA, the members of the panel were nevertheless independent from it – although that did not prevent Liverpool's supporters from detecting possible signs of bias, such as Smith's allegedly friendly relations with Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p>In the statement that emerged from Anfield, it was asserted that the club had gone over the facts of the case and concluded "that Luis Suárez did not commit any racist act". The Uruguayan forward's defence included the claim that in his native country the Spanish terms referring to skin colour are used in a matter-of-fact way during amicable conversations. That may be true, to some extent or other, but it could be said that even though he arrived in Groningen from Montevideo in 2006 without a word of English or Dutch, he has lived in Europe long enough – five years in the multicultural Netherlands, one year in equally diverse Liverpool – to know how to avoid causing unnecessary offence.</p>
              <p>Suárez has not been convicted of being a racist. To prove or demolish such a contention would require rather more than the 40 hours of deliberation undertaken, over four days of hearing and sifting evidence, by the panel. He was simply convicted of insulting Evra during the course of an exchange in which, as he admitted, he used the word "negro". The way Evra heard it, the term was used to add weight to the insult. The panel must have had good reasons for agreeing, while declining to accept the view that there is a cultural context in which the use of such a term – particularly as part of an exchange of abuse – may be acceptable.</p>
              <p>The football pitch is no place for angels and, as we saw during the 2010 World Cup, Suárez and Evra share an ability to get themselves embroiled in unfortunate incidents. The Uruguayan, having been sent off in the quarter-final for throwing up his hand to prevent the ball crossing the line at the end of extra time, was then caught on TV celebrating with what, in the circumstances, seemed improper glee as Asamoah Gyan failed to convert the resulting penalty. A goalscorer of glittering deadliness, he is also the master of the crafty nudge, a congenital windâ€‘up merchant who infuriates opposing spectators through his habit of reacting to every unsuccessful challenge for the ball by sitting on the turf with his arms raised, imploring the referee to come to his aid. At Craven Cottage earlier this month he reacted by raising his middle finger to the Fulham fans, for which he has also been charged by the FA.</p>
              <p>Evra's past is clouded by his role as France's captain in 2010, when he led the ugly revolt against Raymond Domenech that ended in chaos and ignominy, earning an international ban and a stern rebuke from Chantal Jouanno, the sports minister: "He did not defend the values of sport which are upheld by the Republic." But attempts to slur him by claiming that he played "the race card" on two occasions in the past – as Liverpool's official website columnist did on Twitter – were baseless. In 2006 an accusation of racist abuse was levelled at Steve Finnan not by Evra but by a deaf United fan who claimed to have lipâ€‘read abusive phrases. Two years later it was United's assistant manager, Mike Phelan and another member of the backâ€‘room staff, Richard Hartis, who accused the Chelsea groundsman, Sam Bethell, of calling Evra a "fucking immigrant". In both cases the accused men were cleared, but Evra had played no part in bringing the cases against them.</p>
              <p>In the judgment of the tribunal, Suárez was guilty of unacceptable behaviour. He should learn from that, rather than rail against perceived injustice. And Liverpool, a club with a long and proud history of their own, might in turn recognise the significance of the week's events to the long struggle in which Howard Gayle played a part all those years ago, and which allowed his successors – the likes of John Barnes, Mark Walters, Michael Thomas, David James, Ryan Babel and Glen Johnson – to go about their business in an atmosphere increasingly free from fear and hatred.</p>

              <p>Suárez received the ban plus a £40,000 fine from the Football Association having been found guilty by an independent regulatory commission of racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra at Anfield on 15 October. His lawyer, Alejandro Balbi, said he would appeal against the punishment, stating: "The counts of racism that were made against him are not true. He will protest his innocence right to the end."</p>
              <p>The Uruguay international played in Liverpool's <span style="color: #000000;">goalless draw at Wigan</span> on Wednesday night, before which his team-mates and manager wore the Suárez T-shirts. Dalglish said: "We stand right beside him. Always have done and always will do, and that was reflected in the support he got from the stands tonight and the players beforehand."</p>
              <p>The T-shirts provoked criticism that the gesture conflicted with football's anti-racism campaign Kick It Out, confusing its zero tolerance message.</p>
              <p>The former Manchester United defender Paul McGrath tweeted: "As ex footballer having experienced racist comments throughout my career I was saddened to see Liverpool players wear those tshirts … I would have been much happier if they had worn anti racist tshirts."</p>
              <p>The Blackburn striker Jason Roberts tweeted: "The stance on the Suárez issue from LFC has bemused me… are United going to print Evra shirts now????? Some issues are bigger than football."</p>
              <p>And the former Newcastle defender and anti-racism campaigner Olivier Bernard told Sky: "I really didn't think it was fine to wear the T-shirts. I can understand the club's side of it, but in society we can't accept racism and give support to a player who has used racist words.</p>
              <p>"It's not OK to use racist language and the message they sent out yesterday was a bit wrong. I don't mind them giving support to Mr Suárez, but I just think it's a bit wrong to wear the T-shirt because that means they have allowed racist language. I just don't understand it."</p>
              <p>But Dalglish defended the decision, saying: "I think the boys showed their respect and admiration for Luis. It is a great reflection of the man as a character, a person and a footballer that the boys have been so supportive and so have the supporters. He has earned that, has deserved it and we will always stand beside him. They will not divide the football club, no matter how hard they try."</p>
              <p>Liverpool's goalkeeper, Jose Reina, added: "We are all right behind him. He has our full support. We were together from the very first minute of the allegations and [the T-shirts] were the minimum we can do for him.</p>
              <p>"He is not racist. I am 100% he is not racist and he has been accused of racism. We showed our support to Luis. We want him and everyone to know we are right behind our team-mate because he is a lovely guy and he has been crucified by some people and it is not fair. Eight games is not even close to being fair."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">DO Liverpool want to lead the game into anarchy?</h2>
              <p>It certainly looks like it by the way they are behaving.</p>
              <p>Furious that Luis Suarez has been given an eight-game ban and a £40,000 fine for racially abusing Patrice Evra, manager Kenny Dalglish swung into action to mastermind the backlash.</p>
              <p>A statement slammed the FA and Dalglish and his squad wore T-shirts in tribute to Suarez at Wigan on Wednesday night.</p>
              <p>Comments by Chelsea boss Andre Villas-Boas about supporting John Terry whatever the outcome of his court case, in which he is charged with racially abusing Anton Ferdinand, are not clever either.</p>
              <p>But imagine the reaction around the country if the Chelsea squad had all run out at White Hart Lane last night wearing Terry T-shirts.</p>
              <p>It is irrelevant that Terry's case is going to court, the basic accusation against him is the same.</p>
              <p>What an outcry there would be, too, if Alex Ferguson and his Manchester United stars began wearing tops with Evra on the back.</p>
              <p>We are told that all the Liverpool players willingly agreed to warm up in the Suarez shirts.</p>
              <p>Yet even if any of them had had doubts, they probably would have had little choice but to toe the party line.</p>
              <p>Dalglish has publicly announced they are all standing together behind the Uruguayan striker, so there can be no waverers.</p>
              <p>And at no point is there any acknowledgement from Anfield that Suarez might have been advised not to utter a term which could have been interpreted as racist.</p>
              <p>Liverpool, led by Dalglish, are putting two fingers up to authority and blatantly showing they have no respect for the domestic game's rulers.</p>
              <p>The Kop fans, who worship the Scot, follow the messiah and direct their venom at Evra, Manchester United and FA officials.</p>
              <p>Some of the abuse targeting FA employees would land the perpetrators in court if the police were brought in.</p>
              <p>And it is all stoking up the next meeting between United and Liverpool in February to incendiary levels.</p>
              <p>You can bet your life, if it all goes off there, it will be the FA who get the blame.</p>
              <p>It is understandable that Dalglish supports his player. But the manner in which he is going about it is neither subtle nor admirable.</p>
              <p>Someone at Liverpool needs to put an arm round the Scot's shoulder and advise him to take a step back.</p>
              <p>The League Managers Association, which usually has plenty to say for itself, should also have a word with Dalglish — one of their high-profile members — and tell him he needs to rein it in.</p>
              <p>Or is everyone too scared to challenge King Kenny?</p>

              <p>It seems like the pressure is getting to be too great for Kenny to handle... He looks like he is almost at tipping point now.</p>
              <p>Dalglish is beginning to remind me of the Mourinho of the early Chelsea days... His actions, instigations and accusations are like made from pure fantasies. And the band of people beginning to dislike his club is growing cos of his actions and attitude.</p>
              <p>However, without the success, he only learned the bad part of Jose and not he good parts...</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span><span style="color: #000000;"> has broken his silence on the </span><span style="color: #000000;">Luis Suárez</span><span style="color: #000000;"> affair, describing the </span><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span><span style="color: #000000;"> striker's eight-match ban for racially abusing Patrice Evra as "the right decision" and indicating that the Anfield club should accept the guilty verdict.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool's vigorous defence of the Uruguayan, </span><span style="color: #000000;">including the controversial decision to warm up for their game at Wigan in Suárez T-shirts</span><span style="color: #000000;">, has led to widespread criticism throughout the game. Ferguson was not willing to talk about Liverpool's protest statement, in which they described Evra as "not reliable" and called on the Football Association to issue a separate charge against the </span><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span> defender, but he made clear that the Premier League champions felt vindicated.</p>
              <p>"Our support of Patrice was obvious right from the word go and that's still the same. The matter is over and I think we're satisfied that they [the FA's independent commission] found the right decision. This wasn't about Manchester United and Liverpool at all. It was nothing to do with that. This was an individual situation where one person was racially abused."</p>
              <p>Liverpool maintain that was not the case, despite Suárez reportedly admitting using the word "<em>negro</em>", and are now waiting for the commission chairman, Paul Goulding QC, to deliver his full written findings before deciding whether to lodge an appeal.</p>
              <p>That risks an even longer ban and Ferguson drew a parallel with the way United reacted when Evra was banned for four matches in 2008 for becoming embroiled in a post-match fight with Sam Bethell, a Chelsea groundsman. The club, he pointed out, had accepted the verdict.</p>
              <p>"Patrice got that suspension for the incident down at Chelsea when no one was there, just a groundsman and our fitness coach. He got a four-match ban and we had to wait two weeks for the evidence to come through. We were quite astounded at that. A four-match ban? We thought it was well over the top for a trivial incident. But it happened and there's nothing you can do about it, you know."</p>
              <p>The insinuation was that Liverpool should accept Suárez's guilt but there is no sign of that from Anfield, with Kenny Dalglish maintaining he had no regrets over the T-shirt protest and aggressive wording of their statement.</p>
              <p>"The club have issued a statement and the players have made their statement both visually and verbally," said Dalglish. "The statement couldn't have caused anybody any trouble. I don't think the players have caused any trouble with the FA either with their statement or by their support with the T-shirts. If we are not in any trouble, we will just leave it at that before we do get into any trouble."</p>
              <p>Dalglish said "it might be weeks" before the commission's findings are made public and believes the verdict and the reasons for it should have been released simultaneously. In the vacuum, the Liverpool manager fears opposition crowds will declare open season on Suárez, as was the case at the DW Stadium on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>He said: "I wouldn't think it is helpful to anybody that it [the verdict] is done before we have seen the written documents. If that's the way they have always done it then we cannot complain. I wouldn't know because I have never been involved in anything like this before.</p>
              <p>"They [the Football Association] run the game; we don't, do we? Whether you agree with it is another matter. In another walk of life, they would have walked away and waited until they had it ready. But this is what happened. I think where they have to be more supportive is the reaction from people – and the antagonism of the crowds – towards Luis. That is the great problem."</p>
              <p>The Liverpool manager believes the fallout from the complex case will be far-reaching for the FA. "It would be helpful to everyone if someone gave us some guidelines about what you can and cannot say," he argued. Yet despite his concerns over the hostility towards Suárez, who is also facing an improper conduct charge for allegedly making an offensive gesture towards Fulham supporters at Craven Cottage on 5 December, Dalglish is adamant the 24-year-old can handle the scrutiny.</p>
              <p>"Obviously he would be better off without it, but he is a strong enough character and he has handled it very well up to now so I wouldn't expect him to show anything other than total strength. If Luis is fit and well, he will be considered for the matches until such time that he is under sanction."</p>
              <p>Ferguson is clearly unimpressed with the lengths to which Liverpool have gone, including Dalglish's decision to wear a Suaárez T-shirt during a television interview on Wednesday. "I don't need to talk about it," he said, before adding pointedly: "I'm happy with how I run my club."</p>
              <p>The United manager was asked whether he fears it will worsen the rivalry between the two clubs. "This is the biggest derby game in the country," he replied. "It's never needed anything to light the powder keg; it's always there."</p>

              <p>like it was reported, Suarez admitted to using "the word"</p>

              <p>all that being said, Suarez should be banned for using "the word" as admitted.. it is the deed done.. which is not acceptable..</p>
              <p>i still want to see Terry thrown in prison for his crimes if the FA want to prosecute racism...</p>
              <p>and also the FA must prosecute those who attempt to use racism to get others into trouble.. because those who cry wolf, as as much to blame for racism as those who are guilty of it</p>
