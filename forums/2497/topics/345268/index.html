              <p><strong>Blackburn Rovers striker Benni McCarthy says he is glad former
              manager Paul Ince got the sack in December, as he was going to cost the
              South African the chance of playing at the 2010 World Cup.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 31-year-old, who has netted 24 goals in 50 appearances for his
              country, fell out of favour with the former Macclesfield and MK Dons
              manager during his tenure at Ewood Park, with his lack of match action
              likely to deny the front-man the opportunity to represent Bafana Bafana
              when they host the tournament next year.</p>
              <p>‘It is a relief to be playing again," he told <em>The Sun</em>. "I
              don’t know why the last manager didn’t pick me, but I would love to
              know why. Some managers just prefer certain players and if you don’t
              fit in then you don’t play and you just get the boot.</p>
              <p>"It was difficult, of course. Especially when you get to my age and
              you are playing for a country that is hosting the World Cup. It was
              hard. Every time I kept going to the national team where I am like a
              really important figure - but I wasn’t playing for my club."</p>
              <p>So McCarthy is a much happier man now that Sam Allardyce is in
              charge of Rovers. Not only has the former Bolton and Newcastle boss
              lifted Blackburn out of the relegation zone, but he has also restored
              the South African to the starting line-up; a decision which has reaped
              instant rewards.</p>
              <p>The ex-Porto marksman scored twice in a 3-0 rout of fellow
              strugglers Stoke City in Big Sam's first match in charge. And he has
              since netted twice more at Ewood Park, against Manchester City and
              Newcastle respectively, to lift Rovers out of the bottom three.</p>
              <p>"Sam came in and was really direct on tactical things we didn’t do before but we have started doing now," he added.</p>
