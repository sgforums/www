              <p><strong>Several clubs – including Tottenham Hotspur – who have previously expressed interest in Carroll were contacted on Tuesday. <span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool's</span> representatives are specifically looking for a season-long loan rather than, for now, selling the 23 year-old.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>Spurs have decided against making a move and will concentrate on securing the permanent transfer of Emmanuel Adebayor from Manchester City. A deal is understood to be close for Adebayor, who spent last season on loan at Spurs, and could even be announced this week dependent on the pay-off he is expected to receive from City.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>Newly-promoted West Ham would like to take Carroll and will make an inquiry of their own but their best chance of success may rest on the England international’s close friendship, forged at Newcastle United, with West Ham captain Kevin Nolan.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>West Ham manager Sam Allardyce also shares an agent, Mark Curtis, with Carroll and that might help their cause, but the club would want the player’s wages to be subsidised by Liverpool.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>It is understood Fulham are also weighing up whether to make a move and Liverpool, who are keen to sign Clint Dempsey from the Craven Cottage club, might be interested.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has already suggested that the England international needs to prove he can fit into the 4-3-3 system he prefers or be sent out on loan, especially with an £11 million bid now submitted for Roma striker Fabio Borini.</p>
              <p>Rodgers said loaning Carroll is “something I would have to look at” and although he indicated he would give him time to prove he fitted into his plans, it appears Liverpool are, at the very least, testing the market to see if there is interest.</p>
              <p>They may face a battle to secure a deal — not least from the player himself. Carroll would rather stay at Liverpool and fight for his place.</p>
              <p>Liverpool have not had the sort of return they expected when they paid Newcastle United a British record fee for Carroll in January 2011. The striker did reasonably well for England at Euro 2012, yet it is difficult to see him slotting into the sort of system Rodgers deployed at Swansea.</p>
              <p>Carroll would not command anything like the same fee should Liverpool look to sell him this summer and it is only sensible Rodgers is contemplating a loan move for a player whose strengths seem at odds with his preferred style of play.</p>
              <p>Having broken back into the England squad under coach Roy Hodgson, Carroll needs to be playing regularly to stay there and it is unlikely he will remain opposed to a loan move if it becomes clear he will struggle to start games at Liverpool.</p>
              <p>One player who should have no trouble making the transition under Rodgers is Luis Suárez and there is even the prospect of a new contract being agreed with the Uruguayan.</p>
              <p>“I have had a good conversation with him over the phone,” said Rodgers when asked about Suárez’s absence from pre-season training because of his Olympic selection. We have exchanged lots of texts. He sent me a text on the first morning, wishing me good luck. He has really bought in to what we are trying to do.</p>
              <p>“He was really excited about how we played at Swansea last year. He is really keen and looking forward to playing in a similar sort of model.</p>
              <p>“We hope we’re getting closer to agreeing a new contract with him. There has been good dialogue. People always talk about the players coming, but what is important are the ones you already have. I look at this group and I see a really good group of players.”</p>
              <p>Rodgers will try to add to the squad he inherited from Kenny Dalglish, but has already made it clear there will not be a major change in personnel. The Italian international forward Borini is expected to become Rodgers’s first signing.</p>
              <p>The 21 year-old, who only moved back to Italy after failing to break into the first team at Chelsea last year, could link up with the squad in time to feature on their pre-season tour of North America.</p>
              <p>Midfielder Jonjo Shelvey, 20, has signed a new contract with Liverpool despite having made only 37 appearances since he joined from Charlton in May 2010.</p>

              <h3>ALAN SHEARER believes Andy Carroll would be a smash hit if he moved back to Newcastle.</h3>
              </div>
              <div class="clear-left">
              <div id="bodyText">
              <p>Shearer, a Toon legend in the No 9 shirt, was also briefly Carroll’s manager at St James’ Park.</p>
              <p>And the former England skipper, 41, insists there would be no shame in Carroll donning the famous black and white shirt again.</p>
              <p>Carroll was sold to Liverpool by Newcastle for £35million 18 months ago but new Reds boss Brendan Rodgers does not see the Three Lions forward as part of his future plans at Anfield.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old, though, proved at the Euro 2012 finals that he still has the ability to scare the life out of defenders with his stunning header in the 3-2 Group D victory over Sweden.</p>
              <p>Newcastle have tried to get Carroll on a loan deal with a view to a permanent move.</p>
              <p>But that was rejected as “derisory” with Toon owner Mike Ashley wanting the Reds to pay half the player’s wages.</p>
              <p>Shearer, though, thinks returning to Tyneside might be Carroll’s best option to get his career firing on all cylinders again.</p>
              <p>Shearer said: “How many clubs are there where Andy can realistically go?</p>
              <p>“With respect to the lower half of the Premier League, he is a better player than that.</p>
              <p>“Andy is an England centre-forward and I wouldn’t say he has been a flop at Liverpool by any means.</p>
              <p>“Yes, it took him a bit of time to settle there but he finished the season strongly and considering he only started one game at the Euros, I thought he did well.</p>
              <p>“Make no mistake, he is a very good footballer. “I can fully understand why Newcastle are in for him and I think it would be a great move.</p>
              <p>“When he was there before he benefited from the fact that the team was always working to get him the ball — and he thrived on that.</p>
              <p>“That hasn’t always been the case at Liverpool and perhaps at times he suffered.</p>
              <p>“But don’t think you just have to play long-ball if Andy’s in the team.</p>
              <p>“He doesn’t have to have everything arrowed towards his head. He can play and he is comfortable with the ball at his feet.</p>
              <p>“There is an old saying that you should never go back but, in Andy’s case, I don’t think it would be a mistake at all.</p>
              <p>“He was hero-worshipped by the crowd first time around and they would warm to him again.</p>
              <p>“Andy loved playing there and whatever the fans felt about him leaving to join Liverpool, I’m sure he would win them over quickly.”</p>
              <p>Shearer realises that it will be difficult for Carroll to accept his Liverpool career is over, even if former Swansea chief Rodgers spells it out to him.</p>
              <p>He added: “It hurts any player when you realise a club doesn’t want you anymore but that’s football and you have to get on with it.</p>
              <p>“When Ruud Gullit was manager at Newcastle I realised I would have to leave if he didn’t.</p>
              <p>“As it turned out he got sacked and, luckily, I was able to stay. But I was under no illusions about what the outcome would be if he had kept his job.</p>
              <p>“Andy will realise that you can’t fight it if the manager has plans that don’t include you. It is better to go and start again.</p>
              <p>“Brendan Rodgers wants to build his own team and he is entitled to do that.</p>
              <p>“Andy wasn’t his signing and it’s the manager’s call whether he wants to incorporate him into his own system or not.</p>
              <p>“The difficulty for Andy is that Liverpool is a top, top club and it will be hard for him to go.</p>
              <p>“Whatever the problems the club has had, it is still one of the big names in world football with great history and tradition.</p>
              <p>“Apart from the likes of Manchester United and now possibly Manchester City, there aren’t many bigger in England.”</p>
              <p>There has been some interest in Gateshead-born Carroll from abroad in the shape of AC Milan, who were looking at a possible loan move themselves.</p>
              <p>But Shearer does not believe a switch to a foreign land would suit the big striker.</p>
              <p>He said: “I think Andy would be better off staying here.</p>
              <p>“For me, his game is ideally suited to the Premier League.”</p>
              <p>Spain’s triumph at the Euros has prompted a debate about whether the old-fashioned striker has had his day because they won without using a recognised frontman.</p>
              <p>Shearer, though, is not having it that the out-and-out goalscorer is about to go the way of the Dodo.</p>
              <p>He added: “Spain are unique, they played in a way we’ve not really seen before.</p>
              <p>“But that isn’t a style for everybody and they had plenty of strikers on the bench who they were prepared to bring on.</p>
              <p>“Strikers are still a valuable commodity and Andy is one of the best. I’m a big fan and always have been.</p>
              <p>“I think he is going to end up leaving but I’m sure he will be better and stronger for the experiences he’s had. He’s still a young lad with a great future ahead of him.”</p>

              <p><span><strong>Alan Pardew has challenged owner Mike Ashley to ramp up Newcastle's bid for Andy Carroll and bring the unsettled £35million striker back to St James' Park.<br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The 50-year-old Toon boss is keen to secure the England international's return just 18 months after he sold him for a British transfer record fee to Liverpool.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Newcastle had an approach to take the England international on a season-long loan firmly rebuffed by Liverpool on Sunday night but they will now be expected to come back with another offer after receiving encouraging noises from Carroll’s entourage. </span> </p>
              <p><span>West Ham United, Fulham and Aston Villa have all stated their interest to varying degrees but it would appear Carroll would only want to go back to the North East.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>And it seems likely that the success or otherwise of Newcastle's approach will come down to finance as much as anything else, but Pardew, currently in Germany with his squad at their pre-season training camp, admits that has little to do with him.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>'That whole process is a little bit more involved with the chairman and the board at Liverpool,' Pardew told the Evening Chronicle.<br></span></p>

              <span><strong>Newcastle launched their attempt to re-sign the man they sold to Liverpool in January last year after it emerged that he was not a central figure in new Reds boss Rodgers' plans for the new season.<br></strong></span>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>Carroll was not among the party which flew out on the club's North American tour on Monday, although he was never intended to be after being given an extended break following his trip to the Euro 2012 finals with England.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>The player, who insists he does not want to leave Anfield, has indicated he would be prepared to make a temporary switch back to St James' Park, where he made his name, although Liverpool are understood to be ready only to contemplate a permanent transfer.</span></p>
              <p><span>According to an unnamed friend, who was quoted in Monday’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Newcastle Evening Chronicle</span>, Carroll is annoyed that he hasn’t had an opportunity to impress Rodgers.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘From a professional point of view Andy is miffed that he wasn’t given the chance to show what he can do in front of new manager Brendan Rodgers,’ a close friend of Carroll’s said.</span> </p>
              <p><span>‘He was expecting to get at least pre-season to show what he could offer him. He ended last season on a high and wanted to continue that. </span></p>
              <p><span>‘Now Newcastle are interested and Andy wants to come home. He’s already told Liverpool that too. He’s surprised Liverpool don’t want him anymore and doesn’t want to be where he is not wanted.’</span></p>
              <p><span>Former Newcastle captain Alan Shearer believes returning to Tyneside would be a 'great move' for Carroll.<br></span></p>

              <p><span><strong>'Make no mistake, he is a very good footballer. I can fully understand why Newcastle are in for him and I think it would be a great move.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>'When he was there before he benefited from the fact that the team was always working to get him the ball - and he thrived on that. That hasn't always been the case at Liverpool and perhaps at times he suffered.'</span></p>
              <p><span>However, Liverpool's valuation, thought to be in the region of £20million, is significantly in excess of the Magpies', and whether or not that gap can be bridged could prove to be the crux of the matter.</span></p>

              <p class="introcopy"><strong>LIVERPOOL will seek to recoup £20million for Andy Carroll, leaving ­Newcastle in no doubt they will have to increase their ­initial offer if they want to take the England striker back to Tyneside.</strong> </p>

              <div class="padding7north" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 17px; margin: 4px 5px 4px 0px; font-size: 12px;">
              <p class="storycopy">The figure still represents a significant loss on the £35m record signing for a British player who is just 18 months into his stay on Merseyside, but dwarfs <span style="color: #000000;">Newcastle</span>’s opening gambit, which was rejected out of hand on Sunday.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Newcastle offered to take Carroll on a season-long loan deal with a view to a permanent £12m move. They also wanted <span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span> to pay part of his £80,000-a-week wages during the forthcoming season.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Although Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has made it clear Carroll can leave, after voicing concerns the forward would not fit into his playing style, the club are looking to minimise their losses. And they are also seeking to offload him permanently rather than on loan.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Liverpool believe Carroll’s performances at the tail-end of last season – and his goalscoring cameo for England against Sweden in Euro 2012 – mean his value is still high for clubs who are not intent on adhering to a high-intensity, passing philosophy like Rodgers. </p>
              <p class="storycopy">They want to reinvest the proceeds of his departure into deals for Fulham’s Clint Dempsey and Swansea midfielder Joe Allen.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">A written agreement is in place preventing Rodgers returning to his former club for signings in the first year after his departure, but a loophole exists whereby Liverpool can enter the race for Allen if another club have a bid accepted for the player, who is currently on Olympic duty with Team GB.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">From a distance, Liverpool’s £20m value seems a bargaining tool which Newcastle will inevitably try to bring down as negotiations continue. Newcastle manager Alan Pardew remains confident of striking a compromise deal, especially given Carroll would favour a return to his boyhood club ahead of interest from elsewhere, which continues to be led by West Ham.</p>

              <p><strong>Andy Carroll will block attempts to offload him to West Ham, even though Liverpool have agreed a loan deal with the Londoners.</strong></p>
              <p>The <span style="color: #000000;">Reds accepted an offer of £2million to take Carroll on loan for the coming season and then £17m to make his move permanent in 12 months' time</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span>- providing Hammers stay up.</p>
              <p>However, the 23-year-old does not want to go to Upton Park.</p>
              <p>He has told friends on his native Tyneside that he will only leave Liverpool to return to Newcastle, the club he left for Merseyside in a £35m deal 18 months ago.</p>
              <p>The England striker's stance has left him at loggerheads with Liverpool, who want him to go to West Ham because their package is worth more than the Toon are offering.</p>
              <p>Newcastle have so far only been prepared to pay £13m for the <br>striker.</p>
              <p>The Reds rejected that offer and are determined to strike a deal closer to their £20m valuation.</p>
              <p>Toon boss <span style="color: #000000;">Alan Pardew believes Liverpool will soften their stance, havilg cheekily claimed last week that they should "wipe their nose and move on" over the pony-tailed target-man</span><span style="color: #000000;"> .</span></p>
              <p>Pardew feels Newcastle could still sign Carroll, who has scored just 11 goals in 56 Liverpool appearances, because he does not seem to fit in with Brendan Rodgers' Anfield plans.</p>
              <p>Carroll's position is further complicated because it is understood Liverpool have not yet paid Newcastle the final instalments of his transfer fee.</p>
              <p>It is also understood the Geordies are entitled to a cut of any deal, after inserting a 25 per cent sell-on clause into their agreement with the Anfield outfit.</p>
