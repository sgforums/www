              <p><strong>Carlo Ancelotti has firmly denied that he will be confirmed as
              Chelsea’s new manager this weekend and has described as ‘fanciful’
              suggestions that he is already dictating potential signings to the
              Premier League club.</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/italy/Milan/ancelotti-peering.jpg" alt="" width="479" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>Ancelotti is already seen as the heir apparent to the Chelsea throne
              in the English press with various reports claiming he could even be
              unveiled as Guus Hiddink’s replacement imminently.</strong></p>
              <p>“I do not think anything will happen after the game on Saturday evening,” Ancelotti told the Italian press.</p>
              <p>“Sunday I am free. I will be with my father as it is his birthday.</p>
              <p>“Seriously, nothing will happen, either Saturday or Sunday.</p>
              <p>“I do not expect phone calls from the president, he has made a clear refutation, there is no need for any comments.</p>
              <p>“The press tends to sensationalise situations. There has always been
              and there will always be a very good relationship between me and the
              club.</p>
              <p>“There is no story Chelsea-Milan.”</p>
              <p>Recent reports in England have claimed that Ancelotti is already
              shaping Chelsea’s transfer policy for the coming summer with Arsenal
              striker Emmanuel Adebayor and Milan stars Andrea Pirlo and Kaka amongst
              his reported targets.</p>
              <p>But Ancelotti has ridiculed suggestions that he has handed Roman
              Abramovich a wishlist, stating: “These are voices that are imaginative.
              It is more than fanciful.”</p>

              <h1 class="heading">Frank Rijkaard next on the list as AC Milan talk with Carlo Ancelotti</h1>
              <p class="heading"> </p>
              <p class="heading"> </p>
              <p><strong>Chelsea are approaching D-Day in their attempt to make Carlo Ancelotti their next manager. The AC Milan coach will hold discussions over his future with Silvio Berlusconi, the Milan owner, on Sunday, with Chelsea preparing to turn to Frank Rijkaard as a fall-back option.</strong></p>
              <p>Ancelotti is known to be flattered by Chelsea’s interest, with Roman Abramovich having made clear that he is No 1 choice to take over when Guus Hiddink, the interim manager, departs at the end of the season.</p>
              <p>But with nobody certain if Ancelotti will leave Milan, the Chelsea owner has been forced to draw up a list of alternative targets, including Rijkaard, the former Barcelona coach who has received a glowing endorsement from Hiddink.</p>
              <p>The difficulty for Chelsea has been in ascertaining the extent of the damage to Ancelotti’s relationship with Berlusconi, the Italian Prime Minister, who this week seemed to blame the coach for Milan’s failure to beat Inter Milan to the Serie A title. On occasions in recent weeks, Ancelotti has appeared in danger of losing his job, but Berlusconi tried to distance himself yesterday from that earlier interview and is expected to endeavour on Sunday to persuade the coach to reject Chelsea’s interest.</p>
              <p>Adriano Galliani, the Milan vice president, was insistent that Ancelotti will remain at the San Siro for at least another 12 months. “Carlo has a contract with us until 2010 and he will be on the bench of the Rossoneri next season,” Galliani said. “I spoke earlier to president Berlusconi and he was absolutely astonished to read what had been written.”</p>
              <p>Ancelotti has been made aware of the financial terms he would be offered at Stamford Bridge, but if Sunday’s meeting ends with him declaring his wish to join Chelsea, Milan are certain to try to play hardball by demanding at least ¤5 million (about £4.5 million) in compensation.</p>
              <p>Yuri Zhirkov, the Russia winger, is firmly expected to move to Chelsea in a deal that might be facilitated by Abramovich’s links with his club, CSKA Moscow, while strong rumours persist of an offer to Arsenal to sign Emmanuel Adebayor. Deco, the Portugal midfield player, may be offered a move to Corinthians.</p>

              <p class="article">SunSport understands Ancelotti told Roman Abramovich of his decision yesterday morning. It followed Milan’s 2-1 defeat by Udinese on Saturday evening that confirmed Jose Mourinho’s Inter as champions. </p>
              <p class="article">Ancelotti met with club directors, including vice-president Adriano Galliani, after the Udinese defeat. It was agreed Ancelotti’s eight-year reign at the San Siro was over and he was told he could leave for Stamford Bridge with Milan’s blessing. </p>
              <p class="article">Former Holland and Milan striker Marco Van Basten, who recently quit as Ajax boss, is in talks to take over from Ancelotti. SunSport revealed on February 10 that Ancelotti, 49, was the man Blues owner Abramovich wanted to replace Phil Scolari. </p>
              <p class="article">We also reported that Guus Hiddink’s appointment was never anything other than in a caretaker role. A four-year contract worth £22million was agreed a month ago and will be signed after Ancelotti undergoes a medical. </p>
              <p class="article">He has already identified a major summer signing in Aston Villa star Ashley Young — as we revealed last week. Ancelotti made up his mind to take the Blues job after Milan president Silvio Berlusconi blamed him for failing to land the title.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><strong>Carlo Ancelotti is set to be confirmed as </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea </strong></span><strong>manager.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>AC Milan have lined up Marco van Basten to take over at the San Siro, clearing Ancelotti to replace Guus Hiddink at Stamford Bridge. And high on the Italian's agenda will be whether to make an approach for Argentina striker Carlos Tevez.</strong></p>
              <p>Ancelotti, who discussed terms on a three-year Chelsea contract back in April, is a long-term admirer of Tevez. The 25-year-old is set to leave <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United </span></a>after a two-year loan deal and Blues owner Roman Abramovich is planning to back heavily his new coach in the transfer market.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool </strong></span><strong>and </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester City </strong></span><strong>would provide competition for a deal worth at least £25million to sign him from a consortium led by businessman Kia Joorabchian.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>revealed in April that Chelsea had turned to Ancelotti after conceding that Hiddink could not be persuaded to stay on beyond the end of this season.</p>
              <p>And it is expected they will make an announcement soon after the FA Cup Final against Everton on May 30 and Milan's final <span style="font-style: italic;">Serie A </span>match a day later.</p>
              <p>Interim boss Hiddink is keen not to impinge on his duties as Russia's head coach in the run-up to next year's World Cup, but he will continue to advise Abramovich in an informal role.</p>
              <p>Milan have put up a fight to keep Ancelotti but the relationship between him and owner Silvio Berlusconi has soured in recent weeks as it became clearer that the former Italy midfielder's future lay elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Milan's defeat by Udinese on Saturday confirmed rivals Inter as champions and Berlusconi has criticised the coach for results and not using Ronaldinho enough.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti will still not confirm his intentions publicly, but Berlusconi opened the way for his departure.</p>
              <p>The supremo said: 'At the end of the season we will sit around a table and find the best solution for him (Ancelotti) and Milan. But if he goes, you can bet on a younger man emerging. Now there are many with wide shoulders ready for drive a great team.'</p>

              <p class="imageCaption">Former Milan playing legend Van Basten is believed to have held talks about the San Siro job after arriving in the city over the weekend.

              <p>‘My compliments to Sir Alex Ferguson for his victory,' said the 49-year-old. 'They have had, and they are still having, an extraordinary season.
