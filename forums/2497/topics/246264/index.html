They even had to put Essien as a central defender.<br><br>John Terry is a good central defender and having him around would be a great boost, but to not even have a half decent central defender to take over in times of injury or suspension is rather weird.

It is probably their system rather than the player himself that could be at fault.<br><br>Man u got a 35 yrs old Larsson who never got as far as Shev as a player but he still played very well with the team... Its probably how the coach fit him into his team... Shev first match for them against Liverpool was great, he scored a good striker's goal and everyone was saying Chelsea was unstoppable this season...<br><br>I think its not just coincidence that England strikers also have this problem of not scoring goals... It could be that someone playing in their central midfield perfers to shoot most of the time rather than creating for the front man... Shev is more of a predictory kind of striker that depends on supply and seldom create his own... Over at AC, he had Kaka probably one of the best in present time to provide him that service... Over at chelsea... well, i guess they are a little bit more selfish with the supplies.</div>

Esepecially if Mourinho really leaves in the summer. Still, that's a good point.<br></div><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>Anyway, who won't want him i ask you? He was after all the European player of the year not too long ago only, scored many goals for AC Milan... It is probably their system rather than the player himself that could be at fault.</blockquote></div></blockquote>I see your point, they did need a striker at end of last season they only had Drogba as a top notch striker so if they were going to buy, why not buy the best. But still, Mourinho might have had a different choice for a striker and it remains a question if he might have spent that kind of money.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>Man u got a 35 yrs old Larsson who never got as far as Shev as a player but he still played very well with the team... Its probably how the coach fit him into his team...

Afterall, Ferguson had previously tried to lure him away from Celtic. Point is that Larsson was ultimately Ferguson's own choice hence he knew how to fit Larsson into his system.<br><div class="quote_body">[quote]I think its not just coincidence that England strikers also have this problem of not scoring goals... It could be that someone playing in their central midfield perfers to shoot most of the time rather than creating for the front man... Shev is more of a predictory kind of striker that depends on supply and seldom create his own... Over at AC, he had Kaka probably one of the best in present time to provide him that service... Over at chelsea... well, i guess they are a little bit more selfish with the supplies.</div>I think it comes to your point of fitting the player into the system.<br><br>I was wrong about the Ballack thing but still, I think Mourinho should have been given the funds to get at least one decent central defender in the back during the earlier part of the year.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>People seem to forget that Roman Abramovich is also just only a man. Chelsea football club came to prominence only because of him... Begin with, Chelsea was not a proper organization before him. He took interest in the club willingly spent lots of his money to see them do well. He also spend alot of time watching almost every match in their first 3 yrs...<br><br>But it has been 4 yrs since he came to chelsea, the interest in him probably not as "hot" as when he first came in... At that time, he probably treated it like his "New Girlfriend", spending a lot of money and time on her wasn't a problem because he was excited to be with her... But now that the new feeling is gone, he just want to make sure that "She" survive and doing ok but don't over spend his money...<br><br>Its probably true and to a certain extend that people will take things for granted after time... I am thinking that the "New feeling" is not there anymore, and she may not excite him as much as before.<br><br>He may still be willing to pay for her maintenance but not buy her diamonds and pearls anymore... I am referring to chelsea and not his ex-wife, don't get the wrong idea.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

He brought in Boulahrouz and A Cole... Boulahrouz did well for Holland at the WC and could also double up as a right-back if needed. And don't forget that he turn away PSV's strong defender Alex just because that guy was bought by the director of youth development Frank Arnesen.<br><br>The problem is, he has been really lucky in his first 2 years where they had very little injury to most of their players while others had these problems. That probably prompt him to sell players like Robert Huth (a German international) cos he weren't getting much play time and Asier Del Horno and Gallas as well.<br><br>Another possiblity is also, with so many extra high salary players added to the team, i think they may have actually cut down the numbers of players to their team in order not to over spend on salaries... Afterall, he has been enjoying injury free for the last 2 yrs and didn't expect to experience a what if situation...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Spending silly money is in the past, says Mourinho</strong></span><br><br><strong>The prospect of a position vacant at the Premiership's most affluent club must excite Europe's top managers no end. But Jose Mourinho gave pause for thought yesterday about the Chelsea his successor would inherit. In the Portuguese's first year as Chelsea manager, he presided over a club that was to record a Â£140m trading loss. But, Mourinho cautioned, the days of such extreme extravagance are over.</strong><br><br>When Mourinho was asked about the chances of Valencia's Â£25m demand for the impressive Spain international David Villa being met," the Portuguese manager said. "We have two excellent forwards as things stand. And from what I hear about the price, [Valencia] are asking silly money for him. And I can tell you here at Chelsea, it's all over, spending silly money."<br><br>It was easy to scoff whenever the club's chief executive, Peter Kenyon, announced his intention to break even by 2009; at least until the inactive winter transfer window last January suddenly rendered those statements credible.<br><br>This year's transfer-market inertia has not, however, harmed the Premiership champions too much. "When I read some coaches, some interviews, some articles, I laugh," said Mourinho, perhaps referring to Claudio Ranieri's remarks yesterday that the manager has found it difficult to accommodate last summer's additions.<br><br>"When people say this Chelsea is not so good or not playing so well as in previous seasons - either people are stupid or pretending to be stupid because it's obvious. In the same day John Terry was back we lost Michael Essien. "When Joe Cole is coming, we lose Robben. This is the history of our season.<br><br>His employers continue to cast around for potential replacements but the Portuguese hit back yesterday. "I think we can win more things until the end of the season," he said. "The problem is when people think 'I could do more' or 'I didn't give maximum'.<br><br>When asked if everybody at the club, including Abramovich, shared that view of fulfilment Mourinho demurred, saying that anybody wanting to know should consult everybody at the club. One way of restoring the smile to the Russian oligarch's face would be to dispatch Valencia tonight, though Mourinho does not consider that easy and warned of their wiles.<br><br>"I just told my players the same thing I say every Uefa competition when we play against Latins," said Mourinho. "Their mentality is different. The pure English mentality we have in the Premiership is where nobody cheats - well, almost nobody - where people try to be correct and respect opponents. You go to Uefa competitions and sometimes it's a bit different."<br><br></div>
