              <h1>Cattermole ready to quit Sunderland for Anfield after captaincy row</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="thickbox" href="http://images.football365.com/10/10/800x600/LeeCattermole_2519780.jpg"><img src="http://images.football365.com/10/10/496x259/LeeCattermole_2519780.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>LIVERPOOL could be set to make a £10million move for Lee Cattermole with the Sunderland player devastated at losing the captaincy to new boy John OShea.</strong></p>
              <p>Black Cats boss Steve Bruce has handed his recent signing from Manchester United the armband, delivering a massive blow to the tenacious Cattermole.</p>
              <p>And now the Merseysiders are keeping tabs as Kenny Dalglish continues his policy of signing top English players and the former Wigan midfielder, 23, could be next. There will be no lack of spice when Sunderland head to Anfield for the first match of the season on August 13. Bruce has signed three midfielders in Craig Gardner, David Vaughan and Seb Larsson plus young Irishman David Meyler meaning Cattermole may not even make the starting line-up.</p>
              <p>He could also be reunited with old pal Jordan Henderson, who left Wearside to join the Reds last month.</p>
              <p>Cattermole (right) found himself under fire last season because of his dire disciplinary record of TEN bookings and two sendings off including a dismissal in the opening game against Birmingham City. And, after this weeks tour of Germany, Bruce will announce OShea as his new skipper ahead of his fellow ex-United signing Wes Brown because of his superior fitness record.</p>
              <p>Despite Sunderland bringing in no fewer than nine players in the close season, there could yet be more arrivals before the big kick-off. Heading for the exit will be right-back Marcos Angeleri, who is set to return home to Argentina.</p>
              <p>Dalglish is also looking abroad for young talent and is poised to bid for young Swedish centre-half Alexander Milosevic rated at £1.5m by his club AIK Solna.</p>
              <p>The Reds chief sent his top spies to check out the 19-year-old last week and have opened talks with his club about bringing him to Anfield.</p>
              <p>Milosevic has played over a dozen times for AIK and the Kop want to snatch him now before ARSENAL and SUNDERLAND make their moves.</p>

              <p><br>Players 21 yrs old and under doesn't count in the make up of the 25 member squad... And Charlie Adam is Scottish, also don't count... El Zhar joint Pool at 19 yrs old so no chance. Ngog is already 22 when he completed his 3rd yr at Pool, so I doubt so too he is considered home grown...</p>
              <p>Of all the Pool youngsters, <span style="color: #000000;">Jonjo Shelvey impress me the most... Kelly is pretty good too... </span></p>
