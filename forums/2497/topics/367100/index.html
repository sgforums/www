              <p><strong>Carlo Ancelotti breezed into Stamford Bridge armed with a tinder dry sense of humour and a self-confessed love of "irony" - which may help him see the funny side of Manchester City trying to strong-arm Chelsea into selling John Terry.</strong></p>
              <p>Chelsea, the club that once ruled the markets with a wave of Roman Abramovich's mighty chequebook, are suddenly on the receiving end of financial muscle being wielded by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/8057277.stm"><span style="color: #242b6c;">Manchester City's Abu Dhabi rulers</span></a>.</p>
              <p>This, illustrated by the once unthinkable notion that a symbolic Stamford Bridge figure could be spirited away by a club that cannot even offer him European football, is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2009/jul/06/carlo-ancelotti-chelsea-unveiling-language"><span style="color: #242b6c;">the new reality that greets Ancelotti as he starts his Chelsea reign</span></a>.</p>
              <p>If it was a state of affairs that unduly concerned Ancelotti as he was presented in a Stamford Bridge lounge, it did not show as he turned on the charm at a media briefing that even ended in an impromptu burst of applause.</p>
              <div id="more" class="asset-more">
              <p>Ancelotti could have risked every penny of his lucrative new Chelsea contract on an instant confrontation with the Terry question at his official coronation - and so it proved.</p>
              <p>Terry's continuing association with a move to Eastlands had the potential to cast a large cloud over what Chelsea wanted to be the celebration of a new era, but Ancelotti used humour and strong words to handle a delicate matter.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti, whose permanently raised left eyebrow adds to an underlying sense of mischief, provoked a collective double-take when he announced: "John Terry is a symbol of this team, but I don't know if he will be captain next season."</p>
              <p>Cue dramatic delay for maximum effect before announcing: "Naturally I like to joke..."</p>
              <p>The serious message followed, with Ancelotti insisting <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/8135912.stm"><span style="color: #242b6c;">England's captain will also lead Chelsea "forever" and that "there is no price for Terry."</span></a></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/2516372/City-offer-JT-300k-a-wk.html"><span style="color: #242b6c;">The slight snag is that there seems to be no price for Manchester City either</span></a> as they prepare to raise the stakes all the way in pursuit of a scorched earth transfer policy.</p>
              <p>This is the sort of irony Ancelotti might appreciate as he studies Chelsea history and discovers how their own fiscal firepower once steamrollered a succession of clubs around the world into parting with top talent.</p>
              <p>Ambitious owner. Countless millions. No target out of reach. All clubs fair game. For Abramovich of recent vintage read Khaldoon Al Mubarak and the Abu Dhabi United group.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti gained instant respect for insisting his media conferences will all be staged in English, and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2009/jul/06/john-terry-chelsea-carlo-ancelotti"><span style="color: #242b6c;">his insistence that Chelsea want their captain to stay for eternity, or a form of footballing eternity, puts the ball neatly back into Terry's court</span></a>.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's new coach has made the club's position clear. Now it is time for Terry to make his statement of intent, ending a period of silence that has only fuelled speculation.</p>
              <p>If he wants to stay at Chelsea, he only has to say. If he wishes to maintain silence, doubts will continue.</p>
              <p>The smart money remains on Terry securing an improved Chelsea contract, although not on the outlandish terms apparently on offer at Eastlands, but Ancelotti played his club's hand shrewdly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course if City are deadly serious, there may come a time when it actually makes sense for Chelsea to consider a bid for a defender who is 28 and whose natural bravery has resulted in his body taking some pretty heavy-duty punishment in recent years.</p>
              <p>But, for now, Ancelotti expects Terry to usher in another new dawn at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>If first impressions are anything to go by, Chelsea have acquired a humble man and a serious coach - with all proceedings watched over by the Stamford Bridge hierarchy including chairman Bruce Buck, chief executive Peter Kenyon and director Frank Arnesen.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/chelsea/article6201771.ece"><span style="color: #242b6c;">Arnesen's presence underscored the influential role he will play in transfer policy within Ancelotti's regime, a structure the Italian appears comfortable with</span></a>.</p>
              <p>It was a happy scene and a united front. Then again, it was a happy scene and united front <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/philmcnulty/2008/07/luiz_felipe_scolari_arrived_be.html"><span style="color: #242b6c;">almost 12 months ago when we all gathered in Cobham for the introduction of Luiz Felipe Scolari</span></a>.</p>
              <p>Scolari cracked a few gags, spoke glowingly of the future and impressed everyone. And was gone in seven months.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti knows the price on the ticket. Scolari's fate held no terrors for him and a query about whether he understood that he simply had to win was met with a firm "yes."</p>
              <p>And his laconic manner suggests pressure sits easily on Ancelotti's shoulders. He survived the years at AC Milan in close proximity to the mercurial Silvio Berlusconi, so a streak of inner steel and a sense of perspective can be taken as read.</p>
              <p>A member of the Italian media, who Ancelotti insisted also spoke in English, suggested there was a "Love Story" between Chelsea and their country as a legacy of the successes enjoyed by the likes of Gianfranco Zola, Gianluca Vialli and Roberto di Matteo.</p>
              <p>It was one for the romantics, but Ancelotti - for all his self-depracating humour that even saw him dodge one loaded question with the words "I don't understand Italian" - knows this relationship will only be sustained by results.</p>
