              <p>The Dutch frontman, still awaiting his 50th Premier League goal, was rightly adjudged offside on a frustrating afternoon for his boss Kenny Dalglish.</p>
              <p>Andy Carroll was the biggest culprit, with the £35million club-record signing side-footing an early sitter against the crossbar from just six yards.</p>
              <p>It set the tone for the rest of the match as, just like against Norwich a fortnight ago, the home side failed to capitalise as the visitors left with a well-earned point.</p>
              <p>Kuyt replaced the ineffective Jordan Henderson for the start of the second half as the Reds resumed their pressure on the visitors.</p>
              <p> But Swansea were starting to ask more questions of the Liverpool defence and in the 64th minute Dyer's diagonal right-to-left allowed him to collect a through-ball but Reina deflected his shot behind off his body..</p>
              <p>Suddenly the Spaniard was the busier of the two goalkeepers and when he only half-saved Dyer's shot he had to react swiftly to block what looked like being a certain goal from Graham on the follow-up.</p>
              <p>Carroll's hopes of redeeming himself for that first-half miss were ended in the 74th minute when he was replaced by former Cardiff striker Craig Bellamy.</p>
              <p>The big striker did not hang around to see how the Wales international would do as he headed straight down the tunnel.</p>
              <p>Taylor's last-gasp clearance denied Kuyt a sight of goal and Agger headed over when Vorm weakly punched Adam's corner, with the Scotland midfielder also having a free-kick deflected wide.</p>
              <p>Kuyt thought he had scored the winner with an 88th-minute diving header but he was correctly flagged offside from Agger's header by assistant referee Sian Massey.</p>
              <p>Liverpool felt they should have had a penalty in added time when Suarez went down in the area, but referee Phil Dowd waved away appeals.</p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool:</strong> Reina, Johnson, Skrtel, Agger, Jose Enrique, Henderson (Kuyt 46), Lucas, Adam, Downing, Carroll (Bellamy 74), Suarez. <strong>Subs Not Used:</strong> Doni, Maxi, Coates, Spearing, Kelly.</p>

              <p>Beside the 7 min miss, Carroll was invisible throughout the match.</p>
              <p>Kenny is trying too hard for his UK players (Carroll, Adam, Henderson, Downing) to create a miracle without giving other players like Maxi and Kuyt to play.</p>
              <p>Lucas played better than any one of them.</p>
              <p>That is why Merieles left as he saw it coming.</p>
              <p>The owner is there to watch the match and I dun think he like what he saw as Liverpool struggle to hold the ball and to control the match.</p>
              <p>They deserved to be boo for not playing up to standard.</p>

              <p>I would say Adam isn't too bad lah... But ironically, he is the cheapest of that lot...</p>
              <p>Of the others, Henderson for $16 to $20 million is too much i feel... Downing, tho sometimes makes nice runs, but often no end product. I think he is soon becoming the new SWP... And Carroll... what else can you say... I think if $18 million still can swallow but $35m... too over liao.</p>
              <p>I think the problem is Kenny is trying too hard to integrate Carroll at the expense of personnels and changing playing styles...</p>

              <p>Did a scan through internet.</p>
              <p>Every one concluded that the wingers did not performed at all.</p>
              <p>Carroll went to sleep last night again. (He is not impressive and have become useless throughout the match as compared to No. 7)</p>
              <p>Depend on Kenny to place Maxi and Kuyt on the wings.</p>
              <p>Maybe put Bellamy in front of midfield to create the chance.</p>
              <p>Adam did not have the creativity and strength to push the ball forward when required.</p>
              <p>He was leaving a big hole in the midfield.</p>
              <p>I have a feeling that Kenny would be sticking to his all UK line-up and this may eventually lead to his resignation.</p>
              <p>I am seeing a change in manager in Jan 2012 when Henry decided to interfered.</p>

              <p>I never rated Dalglish as a top manager and I think many Pool fans were mistaken when they had a better 2nd half last season after he took over... Cos one difference was they have easier opponents compare to from the starting few matches... And also his appointment was only starting and he had a honeymoon period so to speak as players new to him might want to impress or were impress with his past reputation... But after time passes, that feeling is no longer there and what is left must be real substance.</p>
              <p>To be frank, there was no real pressure at all last season. They were cruising to what ever they can get... But this season, there is no hiding, he must deliver especially after spending so much money... Cos if we look at Spurs, Harry didn't spend a hell lot of cash... He even had internal problems to handle like Modric's right up to Sep and yet his Spurs are doing well... I put this down to the man managing skills...</p>
              <p>Henry has already came out to say he expect minimum CL qualifying position after spending so much... Kenny will definitely feel the pressure if they continue to hover outside the qualifying place...</p>
              <p>On another note, I thought Adam isn't all that bad but it seems to me many Pool fans don't like him either... Read many felt he got no stamina and can only play 50 mins kind of a player... and also he can pass but no creativity to open up defence... On Henderson, some think he is worse than 2, 3 yrs ago Lucas and wondered how come he cost $20m...  </p>
              <p>Oh well, alot of Pool fans on HWZ letting out steam... Some think Kenny will be asked to resign at the end of the season while some thought Kenny is above criticism as opponent keepers are always in "god mode" when they come up against Liverpool... lol.</p>

              <p>If you are Liverpool, you should be getting most of your core players from top teams in the other leagues, not the top players from demoted or struggling premier league teams.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Worse, he paid good money for mediocre to average players.</p>

              <p>It looks like the Downing-Lucas-Adams-Henderson-Carroll-Suarez currently is his idea of the first team.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Out of these 6 players, only Suarez has proven that he can score.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That is why even teams like Norwich and Swansea are able to hold Liverpool to draws - just stick 2 or 3 players to Suarez and you have more or less neutralized any attack from Liverpool.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Suarez and Reina can both shared the player of the match from now till the end of the season if this state of UK freak show continues.</p>
              <p>Adam is supposed to be the guy supplied the ball to the strikers for goal.</p>
              <p>He is seriously lacking in creativity and tend to pass the ball back to defence.</p>
              <p>He actually slow down the offensive attack.</p>
              <p>Lucas is already performing this role and do it better than him.</p>
              <p>That is why Suarez have to work so hard to get his goal. (Except for the 1st match that Carroll return to start, he is missing in action for most of match with his UK comrades)</p>
              <p>There are no speed in Liverpool counter attack as the opposition can fall in at their defence in time to block any Liverpool attack. (They just have to marked No. 7 as the rest of players cannot score and resting in midfield)</p>
              <p>That is the state of Liverpool now. (The Anfield crowd were right to boo the players)</p>
              <p>It seem to have returned to square 1.</p>

              <p>Agger could be in trouble after openly saying such a thing cos Kenny always try to keep it in the dressing room and not let any word gets out but Agger seems like he isn't too bother with Kenny's behind close door style... But one thing that light up to me is, Agger kind of reveal some players don't seem to care as much as others when the team isn't doing well...</p>
              <p>Maybe he is too upset or angry... Or just making plans for Jan transfer window... Cos he will probably be on the bench again once Carragher is fit...</p>
              <p>But to see a player openly defy Kenny, it is a first since he return to Pool... Unless he wants to leave like Torres and <span style="color: #000000;">Meireles... </span></p>

              <p>Agger is a honest guy and wanted the team to wake up their ideas.</p>
              <p>Not sure whether Ah Ken will take it heavily about his comments.</p>
              <p>It is better than the silly feel good comments that the rest of his team mates are saying to the press.</p>
              <p>I agreed that there are a lot of slackers within the team and they are pretty sure that they will be in the starting line-up even after playing badly.</p>

              <p>Liverpool thought they might have the next Alan Shearer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if you look carefully at the way Carroll plays, he looks damn clumsy when he has the ball and his shooting is not sharp or clinical.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For 35m, maybe they should have held back on any purchase, play the team and tactics around Suarez for the first half of the season, then use the money to buy another top rated striker in the Jan transfer window. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As it is, Carroll is just coming back from fitness and based on his current form, Liverpool would not have done any worse without him in the team anyway. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
