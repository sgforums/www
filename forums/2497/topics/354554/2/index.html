              <h1>Owen goal disallowed and even crowd can't help out as Toon icon Shearer falls flat on debut as boss</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Alan Shearer refused to blame controversy over a disallowed goal by Michael Owen as he got a real taste of what life on the bench will be like in his first game as a manager.</p>
              <p>Shearer is more used to the safety of the Match of the Day sofa, but he had to front up to explain <a href="http://http//www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/newcastle-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Newcastle's</span></a> comprehensive defeat by <a href="http://http//www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span></a> in the first of the eight games he has to save them from relegation from the Premier League.</p>
              <p>Television replays showed Owen's 71st minute shot, deflected first by Alex and then John Obi Mikel, had crossed the line before it was cleared by Ashley Cole. But Shearer survived his first 90 minutes as manager well enough to realise he had slotted straight into the routine.</p>
              <p>'I thought the ball was in, but I would say that,' he said. 'I'm already getting into manager's cliches. I asked the linesman and he said he wasn't sure and if he could not see it, he could not give it. But I gather TV replays clearly show the ball was over the line. But it isn't the linesman's fault that we lost the match.</p>
              <p>'It might have given us a rousing last five or 10 minutes, but it's all ifs and buts. If we'd scored it could have given us a lift - we'll never know.'</p>
              <p>Frank Lampard admitted his surprise that the atmosphere in St James' Park for Shearer's first game in charge was not more intimidating. 'We came here expecting a cauldron but it never developed,' he said.</p>
              <p>'Maybe it was because they didn't create so many chances or apply enough pressure. We have big players at Chelsea and we have to deal with all sorts of circumstances. You use these situations to help yourselves.</p>
              <p>'This may not have been a classical performance but we were well worthy of our win.'</p>
              <p>Newcastle midfielder Peter Lovenkrands was taken to hospital wearing breathing apparatus after collapsing in agony after a collision with Florent Malouda, who appeared to catch him accidentally in the back with an elbow.</p>

              <p>Newcastle was ok in the first half, what made them look good was the fact that nobody in Chelsea seemed to be "on the pitch" for the first 45.</p>
              <p>Lampard was making runs all over the place and yet even after the half-time break, no one was marking him and he was still free to do his thing and set up attacks.</p>
