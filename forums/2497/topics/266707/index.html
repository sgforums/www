            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/n1_08_lampsheader.jpg"><br><br><strong>ENGLAND soccer hero Frank Lampard enjoyed a late-night date with a sexy brunette Â— BEHIND locked hotel doors and BEHIND the back of his doting fiancÃ©e.</strong><br><br>Less than 48 hours after arriving in America's sin city Las Vegas on a boys-only jaunt, the Chelsea star led the beauty off to his luxury hideaway, leaving trusting lover Elen Rives in the dark back in London with their two children.<br><br><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/n1_08_lamps01.jpg"><br><br>The Chelsea midfield star picked up the woman, a glamorous East European in her late thirties, at a blackjack table in the casino of the plush five-star Wynn hotel.<br><br>After the couple spent more than two hours alone in a suite together, grinning Lampard emerged with his arm around her about 2am.<br><br>As they strolled back to the gaming tables Lampard looked about, then tenderly stroked the girl's shoulder before kissing her goodnight on the cheek and heading off to find his pals.<br><br><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/n1_08_lamps02.jpg"><br><br>But just minutes later the beauty's smiles turned to sobs when the News of the World told her the truth about her dashing 29-year-old date.<br><br>With tears streaming down her face, she said: "I had no idea he was a rich footballer and he didn't tell me he had a girlfriend and two daughters.<br><br>"This is terrible. I don't know what to do. This is a nightmare."<br><br>Lampard Â— set to become the best-paid player in the world with a new Â£135,000-a-week contract Â— jetted into Vegas on Wednesday lunchtime with team-mates Shaun Wright-Phillips, 25, Wayne Bridge, 26, Glen Johnson, 22, and other friends.<br><br><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/n1_08_lamps03.jpg"><br><br>Within hours the boys were downing beers and hitting the card tables at the Wynn.<br><br>On their first night they entertained scores of women in a private cabana at the trendy Tao nightclub before returning to their hotel alone. On day two Lampard - 5,000 miles away from home Â— made his cheeky move.<br><br>After a day drinking and sunbathing at the Hard Rock Hotel the boys Â— now joined by Teddy Sheringham Â— were at the Wynn casino again. Within an hour of sitting down at a high-stakes blackjack table it was clear Lampard had his eye on something other than the cards.<br><br>Sitting directly behind him at the next table was the attractive brunette dressed in a slinky, brown floor-length dress. Lampard could not keep his eyes off her.<br><br>Soon the pair were chatting and flirting and the woman switched to a seat alongside.<br><br>Another guest told us: "There was an obvious chemistry between them. Until spotting that girl he was concentrating on his hand and winning quite a bit of money. All the lads were betting at least Â£100 a time. But as soon as Frank clocked her his interest faltered.<br><br>"He's a complete charmer. Soon they were leaning in close, nuzzling their heads together and giggling. None of his buddies batted an eyelid.<br><br>"It was like they were used to it. They didn't even look shocked when just before midnight Lampard suddenly got up after whispering something in the girl's ear."<br><br>Lampard then walked off across the room with a burly guy, believed to be a bodyguard.<br><br>The girl followed nervously just 30 yards behind. The minder led them down a deserted corridor. After a look back he took a key card from his pocket and led the pair through a door marked "Fairway Suites" Â— a luxurious complex of Â£2,000-a-night rooms.<br><br>Seconds later the guard came back out alone. Lampard and his stunning new lady friend were left to their own devices.<br><br>The shock revelations come less than TWO months after lover Elen gave birth to their second daughter Isla Â— and nine months after he was caught cheating with a blonde in Barcelona.<br><br>In 2000 the News of the World revealed how Lampard and other stars lured girl fans into a Cyprus hotel orgy captured on video. He later admitted his shame and said: "I should never have put myself in such a compromising situation,"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/n1_08_ronheader.jpg"><br><br><strong>MANCHESTER United goal ace Cristiano Ronaldo's glamour girl lover Gemma Atkinson has secretly bedded his team-mate Alan Smith.</strong><br><br>Former Hollyoaks star Gemma Â— mascot of the British Grand Prix Â— has been dating the Portuguese "winking winger" for seven months.<br><br>But the News of the World can reveal that, unknown to Ron, he was second in line for her charms.<br><br>For busty 22-year-old Gemma had already enjoyed a string of hush-hush sex sessions with England under-21 star Smith at his Cheshire flat.<br><br>Smith would make late night calls to Gemma begging her to come to his place when his student girlfriend was away. She would then sneak in through the back door and leave under cover of darkness.<br><br>Fearing the intimate details might upset new love Ronaldo, Gemma didn't like to tell him when their relationship blossomed.<br><br><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/n1_08_ron02.jpg"><br><br>Gemma first got together with Smith a year before she met RonaldoÂ—branded "the winker" over the sly signal he gave after getting England's Wayne Rooney sent off in last year's World Cup quarter-finals.<br><br>But she has been living in fear of her secret being exposed since Smith's girlfriend Holly Worthington discovered saucy text messages on his mobile phone.<br><br>Pals say she is desperate to hang on to Ronaldo Â— especially since the couple were touted as the new Posh and Becks of English football after the Â£120,000-a-week star was named Player of the Year.<br><br>The stress of hiding the truth has taken its toll on Gemma, who confided in friends: "It's just not fair on Cristiano, it's taking the p*** and it's just making me feel rotten. I can't have it on my conscience."<br><br>One pal revealed: "Gemma is riddled with guilt about having stayed silent. She really sees her future with Cristiano and has been trying to keep it all quiet because she understands how it might cause huge problems between them."<br><br>Our revelations will spark turmoil at Premiership champions United. There were already rumours that boss Alex Ferguson wanted to sell Smith. Insiders predict today's story will seal it.<br><br>On Saturday Gemma insisted: "It's totally untrue to suggest I've cheated with Alan Smith during the seven months I've been seeing Cristiano."<br><br><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/n1_08_ron01.jpg"></div>
