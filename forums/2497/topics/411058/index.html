              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ARSENE WENGER was last night accused of being two-faced by Bolton boss Owen Coyle.</h2>
              <p>The Arsenal manager slammed Bolton's Paul Robinson for a challenge on Abou Diaby - four days after it happened.</p>
              <p>And Coyle rapped: "Pot and kettle are the words that come to mind. I sent Arsene a text after the game to apologise for missing him and he sent me a text saying we were a very good team."</p>
              <p>On Wednesday though, Wenger claimed Robinson should have been sent off during Saturday's game, which Arsenal won 4-1.</p>
              <p>Coyle added: "I understand if people say things after games. But if I am there they could say it to my face.</p>
              <p>"If we want to harp back, look at the tackle on Mark Davies by William Gallas last season."</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Arsene Wenger faces the threat of a Football Association charge after appearing to place his hands on fourth official Martin Atkinson after his side conceded a dramatic 95th-minute equaliser at Sunderland last night.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Arsenal manager confronted Atkinson after Darren Bent had scored some 15 seconds after the allocated four minutes of injury time had been played, having initially laid hands on the official to attract his attention.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Making intentional physical contact with any official is regarded as taboo by the FA, although Wenger denied that he had pushed the official and will doubtless argue that he was merely making contact so as to speak to Atkinson. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Take the pictures and look at it. I complained to nobody,' said the manager.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/09/18/article-1313308-0B3F9B78000005DC-428_634x424.jpg" alt="Sunderland's English striker Darren Bent " width="634" height="424"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption">Late drama: Darren Bent scores the equaliser</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Wenger had also patted Atkinson, again seemingly in frustration, after Alex Song was sent off after 55 minutes - the 50th red card under the Frenchman - and he admitted his frustration at being denied victory in the time added on by referee Phil Dowd.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I know it's a minimum of four minutes but nothing happened in those four minutes to justify them adding more,' he said. 'But there's nothing I can do.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Arsenal also lost Cesc Fabregas, who had opened the scoring after 14 minutes, to injury and missed a penalty when Tomas Rosicky shot over in the 74th minute.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'It's a hamstring. How bad it is I don't know,' said Wenger when asked about his captain. 'I believe we battled very hard and in the second half we were the better team but in the first half we had difficulties. With 10 men we were dominating. It is frustrating but we still take a lot of positives.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Speaking about Song's dismissal, he added: 'The first yellow card was very harsh and on the second, he makes an obstruction. We adapted quite well after that.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Sunderland boss Steve Bruce said: 'The complaint is that we played 15 seconds over but to be fair to the referee we had to get the ball out of the stands for the corner, so the referee's well within his prerogative to play more. It's a minimum of four minutes. You have to play to the whistle.' </span></p>

              <p><span class="u68">Wenger and his assistant Pat Rice were livid - and Wenger appeared to put his hand on Atkinson in a heated touchline exchange. Atkinson took a step back as if to warn the Gunners boss to back off.</span></p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ARSENE WENGER must decide this morning whether to serve a suspension at Spurs tonight or against West Brom on Saturday.</h2>
              <p>The Arsenal boss will accept a touchline ban after his FA charge of improper conduct for shoving fourth official Martin Atkinson at Sunderland on Saturday.</p>
              <p>He was furious after Darren Bent equalised in the fifth minute of injury time, when only four had been allocated. </p>
              <p>If Wenger accepts the charge by lunchtime, he will be barred from the touchline for the Carling Cup trip to White Hart Lane. But if he responds anytime between this afternoon and the Thursday deadline, Wenger will serve the punishment - which also includes an £8,000 fine - for the Premier League visit of the Baggies.</p>
              <p>Wenger last night told Arsenal officials it made sense to accept the ban because a failed appeal would see the punishment rise to two matches and a £12,000 fine.</p>
              <p>And with the Carling Cup being his least important competition, it seems more likely he will take the rap tonight.</p>
              <p>The Gunners will field a team of youngsters for the derby, with Wenger telling striker Carlos Vela he is being given "a massive opportunity".</p>
