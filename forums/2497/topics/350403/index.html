              <p>Yossi Benayoun admits the ice-cool approach of Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez has taken some getting used to.</p>
              <p>Over the past week the ex-West Ham midfielder has delivered the
              priceless Euro winner in Spain and the clinching second goal against
              the Black Cats.</p>
              <p>But he admitted: “After we won in Madrid last week, it was madness in our changing rooms.</p>
              <p>“I had to take my mobile phone into the toilets to call my
              family. It was the only way I could make myself heard. Everyone was
              screaming and shouting — except the manager, of course.</p>
              <p>“He was his usual calm self and didn’t even congratulate us or
              shake hands, never mind join in all the hugs and backslapping. But
              that’s just how he is — and I am beginning to understand why.</p>
              <p>“He is very professional and wants us to be the same all the
              time. He won’t stand for any of us getting carried away or feeling we
              are superior to anyone else.</p>
              <p>“He didn’t say a word to me about the goal. That’s how it is with him.</p>
              <p>“He likes keeping you on your toes. He only announced the team two hours before kick-off.”</p>
              <p>Benayoun’s Anfield career has really taken off since the turn of
              the year, weeks after he accepted he may have to move on if first-team
              openings did not come his way.</p>
              <p>He added: “With the number of top players we have, you accept
              you won’t always be playing and you have to give it everything when
              your chance comes. That’s fine with me.</p>
              <p>“You can score a very famous goal, an absolutely crucial one,
              and it will be forgotten the following day as far as the manager is
              concerned.</p>
              <p>“He only thinks of the next challenge and that is how it should
              be. It has taught me you can’t celebrate too long or rest on your
              laurels.</p>
              <p>“For me, my goal in Spain will only be important if we go all
              the way and win the Champions League. Otherwise, it will count for
              nothing.”</p>
