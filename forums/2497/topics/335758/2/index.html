              <p>some fans do put money down on their teams, and it is really

              <p>youyayu, as much as I like to keep this forum free and open and accept all views and opinions, I apologise for having changed your thread title cos I felt it was rather generalizing... And could cause unhappiness towards a certain group.</p>
              <p>Personally, I don't like to edit anyone's post, and I also don't like to lock anyones thread if possible (If I remember correctly, I have only edited one guy's to date going by the name of superlong and strong).</p>
              <p>Perhaps you may have come across a few and i don't doubt it one bit as there are bound to have such fans especially when they are in a group. But they are also not confine to only one club... Every club will have these type of fans... But I must say it wasn't a very wise thing to do, to taunt them at the end of the match... Some people can get beaten up because of such silly things...</p>
              <p>I have nothing against your wish to share your personal experience here and you are most welcome like everyone else. Between you and me, i believe we may have our own differences too at times but at the end of the day I will still respect your views...</p>
              <p>I understand why Trump Card thought he should lock this thread and I don't blame him as it seems like a bit getting out of hand at times... but I started this forum to be open and free to all views. I cherish the difference of opinion dearly and no matter how strong they may be but as long as they keep it within the discussion and not let it get personal... I think its still ok.</p>
              <p>Good or bad even towards myself I hope to keep everything open if possible. Otherwise, where is the freedom of speech in this forum?</p>
              <p>I would like to hope that all threads could remain open unless there is a very serious strong flaming element like personal attacks on an individual with abusive or foul words being used... (which i have not seen in this so far thats why I am keeping it open in keeping with the spirit of this forum...) In such cases, perhaps the foul words may be edited by the mods or if it persist... locking it would be the last resort. </p>
              <p>Eradicating such antisocial behaviour has been beneficial towards this forum... It has served this forum well. Flaming and all those silly name callings stuff doesn't help... There is this guy who likes to go around hammering me once in a while when he is in the mood for the past 2 over yrs already. But for me, the best thing to do with such people is simply ignore them... As I belief it would be good for everyone eventually. So don't go around creating unnecessary trouble ok...</p>
