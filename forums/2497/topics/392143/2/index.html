              <p>ManU played in the match?? 3 teams played in 1 game of

              is running the match against probably your supported team Chelsea
              (which i cant be bothered with who you supported in any way)
              Chelsea miss the keeper and their defence are not doing him any
              support by being just so very plain in a game that needs much
              better attn then that.. true that ManC is doing a big flavour by
              chipping away points from this match but its just between ManC and
              Chelsea.. ManC sure turns out much better prepared then

              <p>Let me share with everyone what I experienced today... Just now during the match, I wasn't home but I was at someone's place for dinner that had the football channel so I was the only one watching the match at someone else's home...</p>
              <p>I was eagerly looking forward to seeing what will happen when Terry met Bridge at Stanford Bridge... Will they shake hands, will they end up hugging one another and forget everything on the pitch... or will Bridge go for Terry's legs or err.. groin... lol.</p>
              <p>The starting part when they lined up was already interesting then came the hand shake moment... Bridge totally ignore Terry... I thought wow, this is going to make this match more explosive... When the match started, I was rather surprised the Chelsea fans boo Bridge whenever he touches the ball... After all, he served them well for a good number of years and was never a trouble maker at the club...</p>
              <p>Chelsea seem to play well and City was out of sorts during the first half... I was thinking Chelsea will win this cos they are at home, they are playing better (during the first half) and when Lampard scored I thought ok, game over then i switched off the Tv... You can only imagine when I got home and switch on my comp expecting a comfortable win for Chelsea, I was met with a pleasant surprise score line of Chelsea 2 - 4 City... I thought wah, what happen? Chelsea can let in 4 goals at the Bridge meh? Correct or not!</p>
              <p>Then I went on to read the story then I belief it... The ball is indeed round, Who would have expected Chelsea can kenna trashed at home?</p>
              <p>Personally, I think Arsenal will be the biggest beneficiary from this result... And I am beginning to belief they will win the title this season...</p>

              <p>i think the crowd boo bridge becos he did not shake terry's hand.</p>
              <p>anyway chelsea lost because they were not aggressive enough at the start. everybody knows man city defence is very inconsistent. also chelsea strikers were all off form today.</p>
              <p>first man city goal was because of mikel fault, and hilario is nowhere like cech.</p>
              <p>2nd man city goal was due to chelsea going for the win and leaving themselves open for counter attack. hilario also cmi of course. after that is all downhill for them as they try to chase the draw in vain.</p>
              <p>man utd fans cannot be too cocky also. they still got to play man city later iirc. with tevez man city's attack is quite formidable. he is like a rooney in the making, playstyle also quite similar.</p>
              <p>arsenal also got alot of easy games. fabregas usually performs well against smaller teams. so perhaps they can catch up quietly while the top 2 teams drop points.</p>
              <p>anyway makes for interesting title race.</p>

              <h3>JOHN TERRY suffered a devastating double blow - snubbed by Wayne Bridge and 
                  dismissed by Fabio Capello.<span style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 20px; font-size: 16px;"> </span></h3>
              <p>Bridge refused to shake the Chelsea captain's hand in one of the most public 
                  snubs in history. </p>
              <p>The Manchester City star offered his hand but as Terry went to shake it, 
                  Bridge instead shook hands with one of the mascots. </p>
              <p>And in a stinging attack Capello told the disgraced Terry he would never 
                  reclaim the England armband while the Italian was in charge. Capello said: "As 
                  long as I am England manager, I don't think John Terry will be captain again. I 
                  expect my captain to be responsible to children and for the fans. I told him all 
                  of this." </p>
              <p>Capello's words heaped more humiliation on Terry who was woefully exposed as 
                  City won 4-2. </p>

              <p><strong>John Terry was snubbed by Wayne Bridge and humiliated by Craig Bellamy as </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><strong>Manchester 
                  City</strong></a><strong> blew the title race wide open with a stunning 4-2 victory at Stamford 
                  Bridge against </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><strong>Chelsea</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
              <p>Terry, stripped of the England captaincy after revelations about his 
                  relationship with Bridge's former partner, had to suffer the indignity of his 
                  former friend and team-mate refusing to shake his hand before kick-off.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p><strong>Then Bellamy, who shared City's goals with the returning Carlos Tevez, put 
                  the boot into Terry's shattered reputation just as ruthlessly as his team had 
                  exposed nine-man Chelsea on the counter-attack.</strong></p>
              <p>'I know what JT's like,' said Bellamy. 'Nothing surprises me about him. 
                  Everyone in football knows what the guy's ike. But that's off the field. On the 
                  field, he's an outstanding player and a great captain for Chelsea, and it's 
                  always going to be difficult when you play him and his team.'</p>
              <p>But it was a terrible end to another traumatic week for Terry and Chelsea, on 
                  and off the pitch, with the apparent collapse of injured defender Ashley Cole's 
                  marriage only adding to the air of sleaze. Bridge - who has said he does not 
                  want to be picked for England following the stories about Terry and Vanessa 
                  Perroncel, the mother of his three-year-old son - went to shake Terry's hand in 
                  the traditional line-up before the match only to then pull it away.</p>
              <p>Frank Lampard gave Chelsea a deserved lead but Terry, having been at fault 
                  for the first of Inter Milan's goals in Wednesday's 2-1 Champions League defeat 
                  in Italy, was caught out by the pace of Tevez in first-half stoppage-time.</p>
