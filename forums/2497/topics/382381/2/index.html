              <p>i think the irish should just accept the referee decision and
              stop using the media to attack the french players. In fact, if FIFA
              allows reply, it will only open a can of worms and added more calls
              for reply in cases of playing diving for a penalty, referee miss a

              <p> </p>
              <p>the irish FA or UEFA should attack FIFA and exert pressure for

              <h1>Wenger: Call on France to replay their World Cup play-off as Pride of France is at stake</h1>
              <p><img style="width: 280px; height: 390px;" src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00933/Thierry_Henry_280x3_933014a.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><em>French population have roundly condemned the way Henry cheated Ireland out of a possible World Cup place</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ARSENE WENGER last night called on France to replay their World Cup play-off with the Republic of Ireland - and insisted the pride of his country is at stake. </h2>
              <p class="article">The Arsenal chief wants the under-fire French Football Federation to make a special plea to FIFA, who rejected the FAI's appeal yesterday to have the game played again. </p>
              <p class="article">Wenger also wants French soccer chiefs to <strong>HELP</strong> Thierry Henry after the former Arsenal star's blatant handball led to France's decisive goal in Paris on Wednesday.</p>
              <p class="article">Wenger said: "I think the French Football Federation has to call for a replay. Thierry has done so much for French football that French football has to help him. "I think the credibility of France going to the World Cup finals next year is depending on that. </p>
              <p class="article">"Don't forget the big ideas in sport come from France. The World Cup, the European Cup the modern Olympic Games. "There's a deep feeling in France of sport with class and the internationalisation of sport. Don't believe that in France people say 'let them talk'. </p>
              <p class="article">"It's not true. I listened to debates last night in France and, ohhh, they're not happy. "What is for sure, I was in Paris on the night. I didn't see one French flag after the game, not one." </p>
              <p class="article">Wenger is revered in his homeland where his compatriots rate the Gunners boss as one of the best French managers of all time. So these words will carry a lot of weight. The majority of the French population have roundly condemned the way Les Bleus and Henry cheated Ireland out of a possible World Cup place. And Wenger added: "I'm French but I'm quite proud by the way France reacted. The whole population, journalists and football people all reacted in a very positive way. </p>
              <p class="article">"Overall I'm very proud of the deep reaction in France. Everybody said that's not right. "I just say, as a Frenchman, I was quite amazed by how strong the response to that situation was. "France did not deserve to go through, Ireland did. But you can't blame France for that. </p>
              <p class="article">"It's Ireland's fault they didn't take their chances. If you ask me whether Ireland were the better team on the night I will say 'yes, without a doubt'." Although clearly downbeat and embarrassed for his countrymen, Wenger did manage to crack a joke.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "If France win the World Cup then my feelings will depend on how our performances are next summer. If we score after a handball in every game I won't be happy. </p>
              <p class="article">"Let's not speculate too much. We have one situation that we have to handle in France. "But you can say as well that many teams qualified sometimes with refereeing mistakes and we are a bit more sensitive with this one because it was so obvious. </p>
              <p class="article">"You have to give a tool to the ref to say 'listen, if I need help from somebody I want to be free to use it'. Once or twice per game it will not take the flow away. That's rubbish. </p>
              <p class="article">"We lost more time after this goal with all the discussions than going up to the video for 10 seconds and everybody would say 'come on, cancel that goal'. That's it. We would have wasted less time with technology." </p>
              <p class="article">The French Football Federation poured cold water on the Irish FA's appeal for a replay. An FFF spokesman said: "We understand the disappointment and the bitterness of the Irish players but FIFA's decision not to allow a replay is final."</p>
