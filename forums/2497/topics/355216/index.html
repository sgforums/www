              <p>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger saluted the mental strength of his young side after they came from a goal down to secure a 1-1 draw at Villarreal on Tuesday to enhance their chances of progressing to the Champions League semi-finals.</p>
              <p>Marcos Senna put Villarreal into a 10th minute lead before Arsenal equalised through a brilliant acrobatic goal from Emmanuel Adebayor on 65 minutes.</p>
              <p>With the all-important away goal and home advantage Arsenal will start as slight favourites for the quarter-final second leg at the Emirates Stadium on April 15.</p>
              <p>"This team have shown the whole season they are mentally very strong and when they have their backs to the wall, these young players always find an answer and never give up," lauded Wenger.</p>
              <p>"I believe we have created momentum. We are a very young team, but are capable of focussing.</p>
              <p>"We have shown with the consistency we have in the English championship that we are able to concentrate every three days and at that age, that is a big quality to have."</p>
              <p>Arsenal were up against it, trailing to Senna?s early opening goal and were then handicapped by first half injuries to goalkeeper Manuel Almunia and experienced French defender William Gallas.</p>
              <p>"Of course the injuries in the first half didn't help our rhythm but Villarreal played really well, especially Senna and we came back well in the second-half," said goal hero Adebayor.</p>
              <p>Wenger admitted Villarreal were the better side in the first 45 minutes and that the Spaniards would not be underestimated for the second leg.</p>
              <p>"Villarreal started stronger than us and the early goal made it very difficult," added Wenger.</p>
              <p>"We were happy to go into the break 1-0 down as we had a chance to reorganise after the injuries and in the second half, it was a great response from us and we dominated.</p>
              <p>"The result puts us in a great position now, but we want to qualify at home and to repeat the type of performance we produced in the second half.</p>
              <p>"We know Villarreal are a good team as well, so we will be on our toes and focused at the Emirates."</p>
              <p>Togo striker Adebayor won praise for his acrobatic equaliser as he controlled a Cesc Fabregas pass on his chest before a brilliant scissor kick volley into the corner.</p>
              <p>It was unexpected," said Wenger. "At the start of the move his body was a bit in the wrong position to score, but he managed to turn that into an advantage for him."</p>
              <p>The injuries to Almunia and Gallas were one negative for Arsenal and neither player will be fit for the return leg.</p>
              <p>"Gallas has a medial ligament injury," explained Wenger. "The initial diagnosis doesn't appear to be very positive.</p>
              <p>"As for Almunia it is the second time he has twisted his right ankle, and generally that means a three week lay-off."</p>
              <p>Another unsavoury incident saw Spanish international Fabregas apparently having coins thrown at him when taking corners.</p>
              <p>"There were coins thrown at him but I haven?t spoken with him about it yet," revealed the Frenchman.</p>
