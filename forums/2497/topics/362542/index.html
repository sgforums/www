              <p>looking at the latest transfer. I think Man City going to bring in a few more surprise signing before July. Barry is one and the next could be David Villa, and then Tevex..</p>

              <p class="imageCaption">Gareth Barry in action against his new club Manchester City in March</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester City</strong></span></a><strong> began a summer of unprecedented transfer spending with the £12million capture of Gareth Barry from </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/aston-villa.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Aston Villa</strong></span></a><strong> - and are increasingly confident of signing Carlos Tevez.</strong></p>
              <p>City moved quickly to take Barry, 28, to Eastlands on a staggering basic salary of around £130,000 a week after first making contact on Monday night and the England midfielder had a medical in London on Tuesday after agreeing a five-year contract.</p>
              <p>And it is understood that City manager Mark Hughes is confident of persuading Argentina forward Tevez, 25, to move across Manchester from United, while he has also made some progress on signing centre half Joleon Lescott from Everton and former Old Trafford striker Diego Forlan from Atletico Madrid.</p>
              <p>City’s move to sign Barry comes after Liverpool’s failure to come up with the money to get his signature and not only emphasises the financial restrictions endured by Rafael Benitez at Anfield but also the enormous wealth enjoyed by a club who cannot yet even offer their new player European football. </p>
              <div class="relatedItemsTopBorder">One source close to the deal said simply: ‘City have blown Liverpool out of the water.’ Barry cited a need to play in the Champions League as the factor behind his attempts to switch to Anfield last summer but indicated in his talks with City - 10th last season - that he was concerned at how he would be used in Benitez’s controversial rotation policy.</div>
              <div class="relatedItemsTopBorder">

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Gareth Barry is leaving Aston Villa for Manchester City</em></p>

              <p>  </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>At City he will be among the club’s top earners - with Brazilian Robinho way out in front with £160,000 a week - but it is understood he has been attracted not only by the lucrative financial terms but also by the promise of a summer of top-name signings.</strong></p>
              <p>And the England midfielder insisted last night that money was not the motivation for his move to Eastlands. ‘It didn’t take much persuasion from Mark Hughes. They are heading in the direction I want to go,’ he said. ‘There is great potential here, and I’m sure there will be a few more additions to the squad this summer.’</p>
              <p>Hughes met City’s owners in Abu Dhabi last week and was given the go-ahead to spend big. Moves for players of the calibre of Valencia’s David Villa are back on the agenda.</p>
              <p>Sources close to Barry have indicated that Hughes was ‘almost certain’ to sign Tevez, even though the official stance from City was merely that they remained confident.</p>
              <p>Tevez’s representative Kia Joorabchian is due for a final round of talks with United chief executive David Gill on Wednesday morning as the Premier League champions try to persuade the Argentine to make his two-year loan residency permanent.</p>
              <p>It is understood that Tevez himself is very attracted to the prospect of a move to City. He is keen on the opportunity for a central role again rather than being the peripheral figure he has sometimes been at United.</p>
              <p> </p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>Barry trained with his England colleagues on Tuesday morning before Saturday’s World Cup qualifier in Kazakhstan.</strong></p>
              <p>But he was quickly rushed to a medical with the England team doctor at the Grove Hotel as City executive chairman Garry Cook, who was in attendance, tied up the deal with Villa.</p>
              <p>Barry’s decision to go to City leaves Liverpool in a quandary over Xabi Alonso. Real Madrid are keen on the Spaniard but Benitez does not want him to leave until he has a replacement.</p>

              <h2>Top six hypocritical Gareth Barry quotes</h2>
              <p><strong>Six of the best from the man who said “I don’t want to be eating my own words”</strong><br> <img src="http://api.photoshop.com/home_f6af789f50f14ec681c315830bb2d97d/adobe-px-assets/f6a03519461b4ebcb79ba535b5534344" alt="" width="450" height="288"></p>
              <p>As super-ambitious Gareth Barry finally fulfils his lifelong dream of playing Champions League football having a rich Arab sugar daddy, OTP looks back at his careful £££ though-process £££ behind the £££ move.</p>
              <p>1. “My mind’s made up, I want to join Liverpool. There’s no going
              back, it’s time for me to move on. I’m desperate to play Champions
              League football and that’s why I have to leave Villa.”<br> <strong>D’oh!!!</strong></p>
              <p>2. “This year, in terms of England, it has not been a problem for me
              not playing Champions League football. I have played in the UEFA Cup,
              I’ve played regularly for my country this last 12 months. It is not the
              be-all and end-all to be playing in the Champions League but it does
              help coming into the World Cup playing at the top level.”<br> <strong>World Cup worries are put on the backburner.</strong></p>
              <p>3. “There’s nowhere else I would want to be playing at the highest
              level. It’s easy for me to want Aston Villa to play Champions League
              football.”<br> <strong>So a sideways move is out of the question, right?</strong> </p>
              <p>4. “Come next summer, once the speculation starts again, I hope
              Aston Villa will be in a strong bargaining position. At the same time,
              I don’t want to be sitting here holding the club to ransom, saying,
              ‘It’s the top four or I’m off’. It’s about improving and making strides
              forward.”<br> <strong>Well, to be fair he didn’t mention the top four this summer!</strong></p>
              <p>5. “If I’m playing Champions League football, there’s no need to
              look elsewhere. That would have to be a definite. I don’t want to be
              eating my own words.”<br> <strong>So if they had finished fourth you would have stayed, but
              because they finished sixth you had to go to the team that finished
              tenth?</strong></p>
              <p>6. “I hope the Villa fans understand. I have given my all for the
              club for 10 years and I’m only leaving because now I need to test
              myself at the very highest level.”<br> <strong>The very highest level of mid-table Premier League football, that is.</strong></p>

              <p><strong>The events on the Continent served to overshadow City’s capture of Barry, who reneged on his very public claims that he wanted to leave Villa for a club offering Champions League football by shunning Liverpool and signing a five-year deal with City worth close to £100,000 a week.</strong></p>
              <p>“It didn’t take much persuasion from Mark Hughes,” Barry, 28, said after passing a medical. “They are heading in the direction I want to go.”</p>
              <p>The news brought a humiliating end to Rafael Benítez’s tortuous year-long pursuit of the England midfield player and the Liverpool manager’s misery is expected to be compounded by the likely departure from Anfield of Xabi Alonso, the Spain midfield player, this summer. He, too, may join Real, whose spending could end up surpassing the ¤200 million mark.</p>
              <p>City’s summer spree will also continue as Hughes seeks to secure deals for Joleon Lescott, the Everton defender, and Carlos Tévez, the Manchester United forward. “I was looking to get a number of deals done as soon as possible and we have had a great start with Gareth joining us,” Hughes said. “I hope we can conclude some more so that when we come back for pre-season training, we have everybody fit and well and set for a successful campaign.”</p>
              <p>Tévez’s future is likely to be resolved today during talks with David Gill, the United chief executive, and Kia Joorabchian, who owns the Argentina player’s economic rights.</p>
              <p>United have so far balked at meeting the £25.5 million fee agreed with Joorabchian two years ago and, barring a surprise about-turn from the Premier League champions, City are likely to beat Liverpool to the player’s signature in a deal that would cost almost £54 million over four years.</p>
              <p>Hughes is expected to make an opening bid of about £12 million for Lescott, but David Moyes, the Everton manager, is fiercely opposed to selling the England defender and is unlikely to consider accepting a bid of anything less than £20 million.</p>

              <p>He was on only $40k per week at Villa, Pool offer $70 to $80k per week... City giving him $110k to $130k per week... Thats more than what Torres just sign recently... How can he turn down...</p>
              <p>Moreover, we can see City becoming a real powerhouse within the next 2 yrs... Liverpool will still be Liverpool like they have been these last 20 years... Unless some rich Arab take over them...</p>
              <p>I feel that its really more than just money here... City are a real potential considering the noise they are making and the money they are willing to throw...</p>
