              <p>Arjen Robben wasted little time in
              confirming he will become one of the shining stars of this season's
              Bundesliga campaign by scoring twice on his Bayern Munich debut in
              their 3-0 win against champions Wolfsburg last weekend.</p>
              <p><em>ESPN Soccernet</em>'s Nick Bidwell caught up with the Dutch winger as
              he reflected on a sparkling first day in his new office and an exit
              from Real Madrid that left him with a bitter taste in the mouth.</p>
              <hr>
              <p><strong>Nick Bidwell:</strong> Scoring twice on your Bayern debut in a victory
              against the reigning champions must represent the best possible start
              to your career in Germany.</p>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Arjen Robben:</strong> I couldn't have written a better script. Doubles
              are quite rare for me and I was thrilled to help Bayern get their first
              win of the season. With that out of the way, we can now go forward with
              a lot more confidence, which in football can make all the difference.
              Sometimes things just fall into place. I've only been here an instant,
              but already feel at home.  
              <strong>NB:</strong> You only signed for Bayern a few hours before making your debut. Was it all a bit rushed?
               
              <strong>AR:</strong> I think it was good for me to make my Bayern debut so
              quickly after signing. I had my first training session on Friday and
              the next day I came on as a sub against Wolfsburg. There was no time to
              worry about making a good first impression on a new set of fans. The
              trainer (Louis van Gaal) gave me few instructions, but it was just a
              case of getting out there and playing by instinct. 
              <strong>NB:</strong> Is it possible to get familiar with your new team-mates so quickly? 
               
              <strong>AR:</strong> I just went about my normal game, to take on defenders and
              play with pace. It felt very good. Of course, after only a half hour or
              so, you can't talk already of a fantastic understanding with team
              mates, but I had the impression of being on the same wavelength as many
              of them. 
              <strong>NB:</strong> You must be excited at the prospect of forming a "wing wizard" partnership with Franck Ribery at Bayern?
              <strong>AR:</strong> Ribery is a player after my own heart. He lives to create
              and make things happen in the attacking-third and he's definitely one
              of the best of the moment, similar to a Leo Messi, Kaka, Cristiano
              Ronaldo or Fernando Torres. It's always better to have someone of his
              quality on your team rather than in opposition and you saw what he
              could do against Wolfsburg. He brilliantly set up both my goals.  
              <strong>NB:</strong> After so much transfer speculation surrounding Ribery this summer, are you expecting him to stay at Bayern for the long term?
               
              <strong>AR:</strong> In my talks with the Bayern management, they made it clear
              to me they had no intention of selling Franck and this is a good sign.
              Bayern are ambitious and determined to hang onto their best players. 
              <strong>NB:</strong> Can you fit into the same team as Ribery? Don't you like to play in a similar position on the left wing?
               
              <strong>AR:</strong> I'm not making demands where I line up. Whether left, right
              or centre, all that matters is that team functions to its maximum
              potential. It always used to be said that I was at my best on the
              left., but I did really well on the right with Real Madrid. We will see
              what happens. There's no law against a left-footer playing on the
              right.  
              <strong>NB:</strong> Did you want to leave Real Madrid?
              <strong>AR:</strong> Let's say I was persuaded to leave. It was a complex
              business. Last season, in particular, I thought I performed at a very
              high level and even though the new president (Florentino Perez) brought
              in Ronaldo, Kaka, Benzema and many others, I believed I was in a good
              position to hold onto my first team place. I've never been short of
              confidence in my ability and thought that, despite the competition for
              places, I could succeed.
               However, the signals from Real were always mixed. One day they
              wanted to sell me, the next it was fine if I stayed. Then as time
              passed, it became increasingly clear that Real really were not banking
              on me. They wanted the cash from a sale and when you aren't wanted,
              there's only one thing to do. I'm proud and needed to move on.  
              <strong>NB:</strong> Do you feel as if you have reached your peak yet?
               
              <strong>AR:</strong> I hope not. I'm only 25 and I've got lots of football left
              in me. In a World Cup year, it was of no use to me or Holland to be on
              the bench. I have to play and began to consider my options. There was
              some interest in the Premier League and I know the Barcelona president
              (Joan Laporta) appreciates me, but Real don't normally sell to
              Barcelona so I was impressed when Bayern came along.  Bayern are huge club with a great history and, very
              importantly, they are not content to stand still. From my first meeting
              with them, everyone gave me a warm welcome and they went out of their
              way to make me feel at home. This counts a lot for me.</p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>NB:</strong> The Bundesliga is not considered to be the strongest league
              in Europe so do you feel you have taken a step down by joining Bayern? 
              <strong>AR:</strong> I don't think I'm dropping down a floor or two by moving to
              the Bundesliga. In terms of the great attacking football, great stadia
              and fantastic atmosphere, the German championship is on a par with
              anywhere. I'm lucky to be here. 
              <strong>NB:</strong> Who do you see as Bayern's main rivals in the Champions League this season?
               
              <strong>AR:</strong> My old club Chelsea could finally go all the way. Ancelotti
              is an experienced coach and seems to have the players on his side
              already. I also like the look of Inter as Jose Mourinho is a winner and
              a great coach. Don't believe the arrogant face he presents to the media
              as he's very close to his players. They want to perform for someone
              with his charisma and there is no one better at deflecting pressure
              away from the players.</p>
