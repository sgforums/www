              <h1>Gerrard: Ancelotti bad news for Liverpool</h1>
              <p><br> <img src="http://fourfourtwo.com/contentimages/news/Gerrard30.jpg" alt="Gerrard30" align="right"> </p>
              <p><strong> WATFORD - Chelsea could pose an
              even bigger threat next season having made "a fantastic signing"
              by naming Carlo Ancelotti as their new manager, Liverpool
              captain Steven Gerrard said.</strong></p>
              <p>Gerrard, speaking to reporters before England departed for
              Saturday's Group Six World Cup qualifier in Kazakhstan, said he
              thought the 49-year-old Italian was one of the best coaches in
              the world and he was sure he would adapt to the challenges posed
              by the Premier League.</p>
              <p>"I think it's a good appointment for Chelsea, I'm not so
              sure its a good one for Liverpool though, we will have to wait and
              see," Gerrard said half-jokingly.</p>
              <p>"He is a fantastic manager, one of the best in the world.</p>
              <p>"We played two Champions League finals against him when he
              was at AC Milan, won one on a fantastic night in Istanbul, but
              the second time around they beat us and he was spot on
              tactically in the second game."</p>
              <p>Asked how he compared with Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez,
              who guided them to second place this season, finishing ahead of
              Chelsea, Gerrard replied: "They are both fantastic managers and
              it will make the Premiership even more exciting.</p>
              <p>"These managers love going head to head against each other,
              to test each other, so I am sure Rafa and Ancelotti are looking
              forward to testing themselves again."</p>
              <p>Gerrard, who is expected to play against Kazakhstan and the
              following Wednesday's home qualifier against Andorra, said it
              was vital the group leaders won both games to take their total
              of wins to seven from their opening seven qualifiers.</p>
              <p>Six more points would mean England would need just three
              from their last three qualifiers to make sure of their place in
              next year's World Cup finals in South Africa.</p>
              <p><strong>JOB DONE</strong></p>
              <p>"We want the job done as soon as possible, with all due
              respect to Kazakhstan and Andorra, these are games we should win
              so we need to approach them with the right attitude.</p>
              <p>"The majority of the time when England play these type of
              teams we are expected to win very comfortably but these teams
              can be very organised and difficult to beat and everyone wants
              to beat England."</p>
              <p>He also hoped Wayne Rooney would bounce back from
              Manchester United's defeat to Barcelona in last week's Champions
              League final.</p>
              <p>England coach Fabio Capello appears to have found the right
              position for him playing in a free role up front and Gerrard
              added: "I think if you give a player like Wayne Rooney freedom
              he is going to cause the opposition many problems, he is such a
              talent.</p>
              <p>"Wayne has come off the back of a Champions League defeat
              I am sure  he is still hurting and will take it out on the next
              opposition."</p>
