              <p>frankly, i cannot stand teams or anyone who say this cup is not a priority or worst, its a mickey mouse cup.</p>
              <p>knn, only teams that won a cup at the end of the season have the right to say that. and please say it only at the end of the season.</p>
              <p>this tournament may be the least glamorous among all but it is still a trophy to be won.</p>
              <p>the winner has at least a trophy to show at the end of the season.</p>
              <p>wenger said its not his priority again yesterday.  he shouldnt be talking big when his club have not won a single trophy in 4 seasons.</p>
              <p>i bet all arsenal fans will be happy even if its only a carling cup trophy.  ending a long tiring season without anything is definitely worst than that.</p>

              <p>chelsea have always challenged all competitions seriously.  i am disappointed ancelotti spoilt the tradition fielding a weakened side.</p>
              <p>i am glad they lost. </p>
              <p>considering the depth of the squad they have it is inexcusable not to challenge on all fronts.</p>

              <p>What a fantastic night of Carling Cup action. Can anyone remember the last time Carling Cup games were so great?? All the teams (except Arsenal) were hungry for the win. Chelsea were unlucky after coming back twice (three times e with the penalties). But I'm really looking forward to the double Manchester derbies. I have a feeling they will be classics! GGMU</p>

              <p class="article">Goals from Carlos Tevez, Shaun Wright-Phillips and Vladimir Weiss sank Wenger's Carling Cup kids and clinched a two-leg clash with old enemies Manchester United.</p>
              <p class="article">Hughes said: "I was disappointed, as I've huge respect for him. Maybe he needs to be a little bit more gracious. "I think it is unnecessary. We all hurt when we get beaten. You don't need to do that.</p>
              <p class="article">"Nobody is more upset when we lose than me but I still shake someone's hand. "At one point he questioned why I was on his side of the technical area. Maybe he was aggrieved with that. "I would say he was aggrieved his team was beaten. I have been to the Emirates and lost 6-2 but I still offered my hand.</p>
              <p class="article">"There is a protocol and, maybe on this occasion, Arsene has not worked with that." Wenger, also dismissive of the Carling Cup, said: "I am free to shake whose hand I want. I had no professional courtesy to shake his hand.</p>
              <p class="article">"It was not to do with anything about the game. I've nothing more to say on that. "If we had won the Carling Cup, we would not parade it around saying 'We have won a trophy'.</p>

              <p class="article"><strong>"To play in the Champions League quarter-finals or an FA Cup semi-final is 10 times more different to winning the Carling Cup."</strong></p>
              <p class="article">City's win was a massive relief for Hughes, after criticism for seven successive Premier League draws. He added: "Against Arsenal, we showed what we are capable of. We have a big game against Chelsea on Saturday and, with this performance, have made a statement.</p>
              <p class="article">"It is this club's first semi-final for 28 years, so we are all delighted. We can all look forward to facing United and we hope to do well." Wenger admitted: "City's quality offensively paid off. We could not cope with their intensity."</p>

              <p class="article">The Chelsea chief made <strong>EIGHT</strong> changes from the side that buried Arsenal 3-0 on Sunday and they were dumped out of the Carling Cup on penalties.</p>
              <p class="article">After picking a weakened side, Ancelotti put on all three subs at half-time then had to play with 10 men as Salomon Kalou went off injured.</p>
              <p class="article">And Ancelotti nominated Gael Kakuta, 18, to take the vital fifth spot-kick - which he hit straight at keeper Robinson.</p>
              <p class="article">Yet Ancelotti insisted: "I took the risk at half-time because I thought it was the best for us.</p>
              <p class="article">"I wanted to put young players on to get experience. I know we ended up with 10 v 11 but that was the risk."</p>

              <p class="article">And he joked: "I'll hurry him back as I'll probably end up having a heart attack with many more games like that.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">PAUL ROBINSON went from zero to hero to book Blackburn's place in the Carling Cup semi-finals. </h2>
              <p class="article">The England hopeful looked to have blown it for Rovers when his blunder allowed Paulo Ferreira to equalise in the last minute of extra-time. </p>
              <p class="article">But he made amends in a dramatic penalty shootout as he kept out efforts from Michael Ballack and Gael Kakuta.</p>
              <p class="article">That's right, Ballack missed one. So English goalkeepers can save penalties taken by Germans after all. </p>
              <p class="article">Maybe Fabio Capello should take him to South Africa for that reason alone.</p>
              <p class="article">It was a cup tie that had almost everything, including a baffling decision by Carlo Ancelotti which came back to haunt him. </p>
              <p class="article">The Italian threw on all three subs after a lacklustre first half and lived to regret it as they played the last 50 minutes with 10 men. </p>
              <p class="article">Salomon Kalou limped off and could not continue despite lengthy treatment and it gave Rovers the belief they could win the tie. </p>
              <p class="article">A look at the Chelsea teamsheet must have given the home side some hope back at the start of the night.</p>
              <p class="article">There was no sign of John Terry, Frank Lampard, Michael Essien or Petr Cech while man-of-the-moment Didier Drogba was left on the bench.</p>
              <p class="article">A disappointing home crowd of 18,136 obviously had no faith in their team's chances but the players seemed determined to prove otherwise.</p>

              <p>It wasn't the loss in itself that was the problem. He has even shook hands with Alex Ferguson after losing. So it's got to be something else that's the reason, justified or not is another discussion on its own.</p>
