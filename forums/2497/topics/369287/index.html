              <p>Caretaker Newcastle boss Chris Hughton has insisted that an ugly mass brawl during a friendly at <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/huddersfield"><span style="color: #005689;">Huddersfield</span></a> last night showed his players care about the club.</p>
              <p>The match at the Galpharm Stadium erupted at the break after a confrontation between Senegal international Habib Beye and Town skipper Peter Clarke sparked a 20-man melée. There was a later clash too between defender Fabricio Coloccini and striker Lee Novak as Newcastle maintained their winning pre-season run with a 1-0 victory.</p>
              <p>However, Hughton, who confirmed that referee Jon Moss had not been involved in his decision to withdraw Beye, played down the incident, while promising he would look into what had happened.</p>
              <p>He said: "I will be investigating the incident today. But sometimes it's nice to have that bit of edge on the pitch – at times it didn't look like much of a friendly.</p>
              <p>"That's the nature of the game. You have got players who care out there and sometimes they overstep the mark – but that's part and parcel of the game.</p>
              <p>"You would rather have a game where the players care, and that is what happened with that incident. The referee didn't ask me to take Habib off – I was always going to do that."</p>
              <p>Huddersfield boss and former Magpies midfielder Lee Clark was not unduly concerned either, although he admitted the game had been played in a far from friendly manner.</p>
              <p>He told the Huddersfield Daily Examiner: "It was just a competitive match. It wasn't played in a friendly manner whatsoever because both teams were very committed with players wanting to do their best for their clubs.</p>
              <p>"That's what you want. I would rather have that than a game played at testimonial pace with no one tackling each other. Lee [Novak] had blood on his face and a cut on his chin, but it's got to be a contact sport. It's just football."</p>

              <p>Managerless <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/newcastleunited"><span style="color: #005689;">Newcastle United</span></a> have been dealt yet another blow with the news that their midfielder Nicky Butt will miss the start of the new season.</p>
              <p>The 34-year-old needs surgery to repair the hand injury he suffered in last weekend's friendly at Darlington and will not be available for four weeks.</p>
              <p>"Newcastle United can confirm that Nicky Butt requires an operation on the hand injury sustained during Saturday's 7–2 victory at Darlington," a club statement said.</p>
              <p>Caretaker boss Chris Hughton revealed after Saturday's game that Butt had suffered a partial dislocation of his thumb. The Magpies open their <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championship"><span style="color: #005689;">Championship</span></a> campaign at West Brom on Saturday 8 August.</p>
