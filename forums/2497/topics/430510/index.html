              <div class="ingCaptionCredit"><span class="caption"><strong><em>Party pooper: Rafael van der Vaart (centre) is congratulated by his Tottenham Hotspur team-mates after the Dutchman put his side ahead after just nine minutes at Anfield</em></strong></span></div>
              </div>
              <div class="firstPar">
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Rarely can a poisoned chalice have been so fiercely contested. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span><span style="color: #000000;"> have long aspired to the Europa League as the only coronation gift available to Kenny Dalglish; Tottenham Hotspur</span> have long scorned it as an unwelcome consolation. Seeing their Thursday nights booked up is hardly a prize either will treasure; both fought until their last breath to earn the right to complain, long and loud, next season.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>Spurs are worthy of what will, if they beat Birmingham next week, be their place in Europe, although justice was only done in the most unjust of circumstances. They deserve it for this display and this season. They started brightly, endured a predictable dip and ended on a high. Both in this display and in this season.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>But that their guests are better prepared, equipped and suited to an autumn of far-flung travel will not assuage Liverpool’s anger. Dalglish’s side fell behind to a fortuitous opener from Rafael van der Vaart and they lost thanks to the sort of decision which would have sent Ryan Babel scrambling to Photoshop.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>Even Spurs seemed taken aback to see Howard Webb point to the spot when John Flanagan and Steven Pienaar’s shoulders collided outside the box. There was no intent from either party; Webb’s decision, and Luka Modric’s coolness, certainly spoiled one.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>“I’m not here to sponsor the FA,” Dalglish said. “It is just unhelpful to everyone that we cannot express our true thoughts and it’s even more disappointing that the officials get away scot-free without having to come and explain their decisions.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Streaker Video: </em></p>
              <p><em>Pepe Reina, Lucas and Martin Skrtel were so ruthless in dealing with a streaker.</em> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><em>From another angle... </em></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aJbZsUyZp4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aJbZsUyZp4</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span id="eow-title" class="long-title" title="Anfield Streaker Liverpool v Luton Town 15th Jan 2007" dir="ltr"><em>Another Anfield Streaker back in 2007 </em></span></p>
              <p><span class="long-title" title="Anfield Streaker Liverpool v Luton Town 15th Jan 2007" dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP65n2812c8&amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP65n2812c8&amp;feature=related</a></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That anger was manifest in the Scot’s fans and players, too. On this of all days, when Dalglish was unveiled to a deafening roar as the club’s permanent manager, when Fenway Sports Group, the owners who have done so much to steer Anfield back on course, were present. Little wonder Pepe Reina, Lucas and Martin Skrtel were so ruthless in dealing with a streaker. It was no laughing matter.</p>
              <p>Yet hindsight will tell them that sixth place, after the start to their season, is a feat. It will tell them that Spurs deserved this, Webb or no Webb. It will tell them, too, that for all Redknapp’s insistence that he has no interest in the Champions League’s ugly sister, he knows – to misquote Ian Holloway – that it is better to go home at the end of the night with someone, rather than all alone.</p>
              <p>“I scared them into it,” the Spurs manager said. “I told them that if we qualified through the Fair Play league, we’d be back playing in June. We are not fighting for the Europa League. We are fighting for fifth, because you want to finish as high as you can.”</p>
              <p>It worked. Spurs started excellently, pressing high, suffocating their hosts. Van der Vaart’s opener, volleyed in off Glen Johnson, was ample reward.</p>
              <p>Andy Carroll missed the best chance of the half by ballooning a Skrtel cross over, while Luis Suárez, usually electrifying, offered the Kop the odd jolt rather than full charge.</p>
              <p>When Webb intervened, Liverpool could not muster a response. Anfield will not be blessed with Europe next season. Spurs, now that they are there, may not appreciate it, but Liverpool will tell them that, even with poisoned chalices, you do not know what you’ve got until it’s gone.</p>

              <p>Pool is like that want lah... Kenny got his contract liao now can relax already...</p>
              <p>So far cos of their end season form, some of the Pool guys are at it again... Starting to think they got a good chance for the title next season just because "King" Kenny (lol) is now there...</p>
              <p>I still maintain they were under no pressure since Kenny took over so a lot of things were made easier but the moment the real pressure starts, they will fold again... The Spurs match was the start of a little pressure cos they wanted the Europa place badly while Spurs didn't really wanted it... Then what happen? Lose at Anfield to a Spurs side that is not doing as well as at the start of the season...</p>
              <p>I still think they should have gone for Marseille's Didier Deschamps as manager... Oh well, lucky they didn't... phew...</p>
              <p>And come the end of his time at Liverpool as manager, I guess someone could say... OMG we killed kenny! (reputation)... lol.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the new owners so far isn't bad, they have given him a lot of money to play with. So even like this he can't make it to the top 4, then nothing to say liao... Just glad he is the sitting manager at the time United knock them of their perch... lol.</p>
