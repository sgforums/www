            <div class='col-md body'>Rooney denies any rift with England coach<br><br>England coach Steve McClaren has insisted he has an excellent working relationship with Wayne Rooney, after rubbishing claims he singled out the striker for criticism after the disappointing draw in Israel.<br><br>McClaren is adamant there is 'no rift' between himself and the Manchester United star who has gone nearly three years since his last competitive goal for his country during Euro 2004.<br><br>Rooney looked frustrated during the Tel Aviv clash, collected a booking and appeared to be close to boiling point as England's sequence without a win was extended to five games.<br><br>But McClaren is adamant nothing untoward spilled over into the dressing room and his main concern is to improve a record of just one goal scored during that winless sequence.<br><br>McClaren said: 'Why did I single out Rooney for criticism? I didn't say I did. I don't know where you are getting that from. I really don't. I didn't single out anyone.<br><br>'What goes on in a dressing room is private. I'll never criticise a player outside of the dressing room. I might inside. Whatever happens after a game, there was no rift between me and Rooney, absolute load of rubbish.<br><br>'Whatever was said in that dressing room was done respectfully and professionally. In fact, myself and Wayne have one of the best relationships of a player and coach because I've worked with him for many years.<br><br>'Why is he not playing well? Everyone can do better. I am not singling out one player. We all know what Wayne Rooney is and what he can be.'<br><br>Rooney and Israel's Bolton defender Tal Ben Haim - against whom the striker has scored five goals in two matches for United this season - were involved in a second-half spat.<br><br>But McClaren said: 'These players do live on the edge. Someone said Wayne scored five goals against Bolton this season. We were playing Israel, not Bolton.<br><br>'It is different. It always happens like that. All the top players are on the edge. Wayne Rooney knows what to do.<br><br>'The concern is overall from everybody that we are not scoring enough goals. That's the concern. You can pick out individuals. I'm not going to.<br><br>'My job is to make sure we score and yes that is a concern. We had 17 chances, nine of them on target. If I play every game with that ratio of chances away from home, I'll be happy.<br><br>'There is nothing radical that needs doing apart from sticking the ball in the net. That's not radical.'<br></div>
