              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>David Moyes has accused referees of favouring Liverpool during Merseyside derbies as the Everton manager turned up the heat before the teams’ FA Cup fourth-round replay at Goodison Park this evening. He believes that his club have suffered in recent matches against their neighbours because officials are unwilling to punish Liverpool players.</strong></p>
              <p>Moyes was particularly incensed by Javier Mascherano’s apparent attempt to get Tim Cahill sent off during the first tie at Anfield ten days ago, when the Argentina midfield player tumbled under a challenge from the Everton player, who had already been booked, and motioned to Steve Bennett, the referee, to show a second yellow card.</p>
              <p>Moyes felt that Mascherano’s actions warranted a card in their own right and was dismayed that Steven Pienaar was not awarded a penalty when Álvaro Arbeloa appeared to trip the Everton midfield player in front of the Kop. “I think Liverpool have had an awful lot going for them,” Moyes said as they prepared to meet for the third time in 16 days. “We are wholehearted, but when you get players lying on the floor waving their hands suggesting cards and the referee is missing challenges, it’s very hard.</p>
              <p>“But we will keep going. We won’t be provoked by it. We will be disciplined but, more importantly, we will keep doing what we have been doing.</p>
              <p>“We thought we had a penalty kick when Steven Pienaar was tackled from behind. Was it much worse than the one Mikel Arteta gave away at Old Trafford on Saturday? There are moments in games when you think it could have gone for you, but it doesn’t.”</p>
              <p>Rafael Benítez, the Liverpool manager, having claimed during his infamous rant at Sir Alex Ferguson last month that the Manchester United manager wields too much influence over referees, is likely to view Moyes’s remarks as little more than an attempt to put pressure on Alan Wiley, the referee this evening.</p>
              <p>Since Moyes took charge at Goodison in March 2002, Everton have had eight players sent off and Liverpool two in 15 derby matches. Moyes conceded that some of those dismissals had been warranted, but he pointed to the decision not to show Dirk Kuyt a red card for a waist-high challenge on Phil Neville, plus the refusal to award Joleon Lescott a penalty after he was dragged to the ground by Jamie Carragher during the 2-1 league defeat at Goodison Park in October 2007, as examples of poor officiating. “We’re no angels, we admit that, but there is always a bit of fairness required,” Moyes said.</p>
              <p>Benítez expressed the hope yesterday that Everton would attack more after accusing Moyes’s team of being over-defensive in the 1-1 draw at Anfield, but if it was an attempt to goad Moyes into changing tactics, it does not appear to have worked. “It won’t bother me two hoots what anyone is thinking or saying,” Moyes said.</p>
              <p>One player that Moyes will not have to contend with this evening is Robbie Keane, who returned to Tottenham Hotspur on Monday, with Benítez claiming that the £16 million offer was too good to resist and that David Ngog and Ryan Babel are more capable of filling in for Fernando Torres — or complementing the Spain striker — than a proven goalscorer who cost Liverpool £20.3 million.</p>
              <p>“Could you see Keane scoring a lot of goals?” Benítez said yesterday. “We were talking about ‘maybe, maybe’. He was not playing at the level he can play at. We had a very good offer for a player who is 28 and wasn’t playing at the level we were expecting, so maybe it was a good deal for him and us.</p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Dan Gosling's effort flies into the net to send Goodison Park wild with delight</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><strong>There is more than the vast expanse of Stanley Park that divides these two clubs but Dan Gosling showed there is no gap in desire as he scored a dramatic 118th-minute winner for </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/everton.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Everton</strong></span></a><strong> against the old enemy.</strong></p>
              <p>Put these two teams on the same pitch at the moment and there is little that divides them - apart from wealth.</p>
              <p>In the three utterly absorbing games these two sides have contested in the last couple of weeks, Everton have been terrific and after two draws they simply refused to concede a defeat in the third and 19-year-old substitute Gosling’s quick-footed skill in the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool</span></a> area which ended with a shot bent round the despairing Pepe Reina earned victory.</p>
              <p>An injury to Steven Gerrard after only 16 minutes unsettled Liverpool but this FA Cup fourth-round replay always looked as if it would go all the way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00726/ev_4_-_Rafa_Benitez_726236a.jpg" alt="Rafa Benitez and Steven Gerrard" width="280" height="390"></p>
              <p><em>Gerrard limped off with a hamstring strain after just 16 minutes.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>But a Liverpool side that has beaten Chelsea twice this season and also sent Manchester United away from Anfield nursing a crushing defeat could find no way of breaking the deadlock in normal time here at Goodison Park.</strong></p>
              <p>History was obviously against them. Not since 1988 had Liverpool won an FA Cup-tie here and the class of 2009 found it just as tough as their predecessors in the 211th Merseyside derby.</p>
              <p>For all the money Benitez has invested in his side, Liverpool did little to trouble this<br>terrific Everton defence. Although Liverpool’s manager would no doubt counter that Reina was no busier than Tim Howard.</p>
              <p>For an hour neither keeper had a save to make, proving how well disciplined and, indeed, how determined both sides were to earn a fifth-round meeting with Aston Villa.</p>
              <p>The absence of Javier Mascherano from Liverpool’s starting line-up certainly suggested Benitez was in a more adventurous mood and the visitors did enjoy much of the early possession, Xabi Alonso threatening with a viciously-struck effort that whistled wide of Howard’s right hand post.</p>
              <p>Lifted by Sunday’s victory over of Chelsea, and the memory of their victory here in the Premier League earlier this season, Liverpool started with confidence. But any sense of superiority was shortlived with the sudden and unexpected withdrawal of Gerrard with what looked like a hamstring injury.</p>
              <p>Understandably, Everton’s supporters celebrated as if their side had just gone ahead. Gerrard had scored in both encounters last month. Now he was out after 16 minutes.</p>
              <p>For Benitez it was hugely frustrating. Everton were again defending superbly, Phil Jagielka and Joleon Lescott proving so solid to the heart of their back four. They might have lost at Manchester United last weekend but here was evidence of<br>how they survived nine games without defeat prior to that trip.</p>
              <p>Every Liverpool move was meeting a wall of blue looking increasingly impenetrable and Everton almost stole it in the 71st minute when Osman drove Cahill’s neat pass onto Reina’s lefthand post.</p>
              <p>Liverpool’s worries increased when Lucas tripped Lescott five minutes later to earn a second yellow card - the first player to be dismissed in an FA Cup Merseyside derby.</p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/02/05/article-0-034D7640000005DC-801_468x334.jpg" alt="Gosling" width="468" height="334"></p>
              <p><em>
              </em></p><p class="article"><em>Dan Gosling, 19 on Monday, fired Everton into the fifth round with an extra-time goal.</em></p><em>
              </em><p></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>As Everton made their numerical advantage tell, Reina saved bravely at the feet of Dan Gosling in the seventh minute of extra time.</strong></p>
              <p>Then, the spectacular conclusion. Substitute Andy van der Meyde’s right-wing cross was brought down by Gosling who turned, neatly beat one challenge before curling in a shot, which took a slight deflection, and went in off the inside of Reina’s left hand post.</p>

              <h1>Dan Gosling brings FA Cup joy to Everton</h1>
              <h2>Everton (0) 0 Liverpool (0) 0; aet 1-0</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01289/dan-gosling_1289979c.jpg" alt="Dan Gosling brings FA Cup joy to Everton" width="460" height="287"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This kid has become famous overnight... Before last night, many have not even heard of him and now his pictures are all over the Football pages around the world... This is call instant fame...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>One of the most manic Merseyside derbies in recent history, a game devoid of technical merit until deep into extra time, saw Steven Gerrard limp off, Lucas sent off before the noise from the Everton supporters went off the scale as they reached a fifth-round date with Aston Villa through the sweetest of strikes from Dan Gosling.</strong></p>
              <p>As Goodison Park screamed itself hoarse, Gosling turned on the ball with moments remaining and bent the ball past Pepe Reina. Brought in from Plymouth Argyle a year ago, Gosling’s fee could rise to £2 million but this goal was priceless, giving Evertonians bragging rights.</p>

              <p>The whole team was too occupied with the question "Am I good enough for Liverpool ?" that they were not able to perform on the pitch.</p>
              <p>The concerns came after the reason given by Ah Ben on the interview with The Sun where Ah Ben keeping saying that Keane was a good player and hinted that he was NOT good enough for Liverpool.</p>
              <p>This questions was ringing in the Liverpool dressing room and goodison park that the Liverpool players was not their usual self.</p>
              <p>I am not sure about the relationship of Keane with the rest of the guys.</p>
              <p>But, it will be funny that if I try all out to prove myself and was sold away cos I was good player but not good for the team.</p>
              <p>Liverpool dun really have any marksman around to bang in lots of goal.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben is really risking his job and not Keane's career.</p>
