              <h1>Manchester United Ponder Giuseppe Rossi Return - Report</h1>
              <h2>Giuseppe Rossi could be offered the chance to go back to Old Trafford this summer...</h2>
              <p>Manchester United are weighing up a move to re-sign Giuseppe Rossi as the striker continues to see talks about a new deal with Villarreal stall, according to a report.<br><br>The
              22-year-old has a clause in his contract that allows the Red Devils to
              have first refusal should he become available or any other club make a
              bid for his services.<br><br>In recent days, Rossi has been linked with
              a move to Italy and United are said to be monitoring the situation as
              they may try to take him back, <em>The Daily Star</em> states.<br><br>Rossi
              joined the Premier League giants in 2005 when he was just 17, but made
              just five appearances and scored once before being sent out on <span class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;"><span style="color: #0464d1;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #0464d1 ! important; font-family: Verdana,Arial; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">loan</span></span></span> to Newcastle United and then Parma.<br><br>He
              took the surprising step to try his luck in Spanish football joining
              Villarreal in 2007, with the move proving to be a success and Rossi has
              impressed enough to earn a call-up to the Italian national squad.<br><br>United
              have seen Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez both leave the club this
              summer and are on the trail of new forwards which has led manager Sir
              Alex Ferguson back to Rossi.<br><br>Villarreal may be reluctant to see
              him go, but rather than lose him on a free transfer they could demand a
              fee of around €15 million from the English champions.</p>

              <h2>Chelsea are looking to continue their midfield bolstering with the acquisition of the coveted battler.</h2>
              <p>Chelsea secured their first major transfer of the summer window with
                      Monday's £18 million purchase of Russia international Yuri Zhirkov, but
                      look set to embark on their own wave of Galactico recruiting as a
                      report in an Italian newspaper intimates that the Stamford Bridge side
                      harbour ambitious hopes of landing Roma midfielder</p>

              <p><em>Il Romanista</em> claims Carlo Ancelotti would prefer the midfield
                      hardman over deep-lying Milan playmaker Andrea Pirlo, a player whose
                      credentials are familiar to the Italian tactician as they spent many
                      seasons together at the San Siro.</p>
              <p>Roma chief Bruno Conti dashed any notion of an easy switch when he
                      baulked at a €46 million bid from Real Madrid. Chelsea sponsor Roman
                      Abramovich would therefore have to pen a large cheque in order to tempt
                      the Roman outfit. Conti said last week, "De Rossi isn't worth €46
                      million, he's worth much, much more."</p>
              <p>De Rossi and Pirlo have not been the only Serie A representatives to
                      be linked to the Blues. Inter full-back Maicon is also apparently on
                      Ancelotti's shortlist as current right-back Jose Bosingwa is receiving
                      admiring glances from Bundesliga heavyweights Bayern Munich.</p>

              <h1>Daniele De Rossi Is Worth Over €40 Million - Roma Director Bruno Conti</h1>
              <h2>The tough-tackling Italian international will continue to feature at the Stadio Olimpico, according to Conti...</h2>
              <p>Daniele De Rossi is linked with a move away from Roma
              every summer, but director Bruno Conti has insisted the midfielder will
              once again stay with the club and not even free-spending Real Madrid can change their mind.<br><br>"I deny any entry into the market. De Rossi will be with us on [July] 20 for the retreat at Trigoria," he stated to <em>Sky Sport 24</em>.<br><br>"De Rossi is a player who is worth much more than €40 million."<br><br>Meanwhile,
              the 1982 World Cup winner took a moment to comment on the lavish
              spending by Real Madrid, including their player presentations.<br><br>"They are a club who recently had some problems, but Florentino Perez is trying build a great team," he explained.<br><br>"Of course there can be some exaggerations, but they have the <span class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;"><span style="color: #0464d1;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #0464d1 ! important; font-family: Verdana,Arial; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">money</span></span></span>. I am focused only on Roma and earning redemption after last season."<br><br>The
              Giallorossi finished in sixth place in Serie A last season, missing out
              on Champions League football for the 2009-10 campaign.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Roma</span> midfielder <span style="color: #ff0000;">Daniele De Rossi</span> has caught the attention of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Barcelona,</span> according to the
                        latest reports coming from Italy.<br> <br> In fact, the <em><span style="color: #333332;">Corriere dello Sport</span></em> is suggesting that the Blaugrana are presently preparing an offer for the World Cup-winning player.<br> <br> This link has also been mentioned by the Spanish daily <em><span style="color: #333332;">El Mundo Deportivo</span></em>, which has reported that the player is in the agenda of Barcelona manager Txiki
                        Begiristain.<br> <br> Apparently, the Spanish giants have been following the Italian star for
              quite some time, and it is thought that he was already in their
              short-list last year when Pep Guardiola - a former club-mate of De
              Rossi - took over at Camp Nou.<br> <br> De Rossi is seen as the alternative to Liverpool midfielder Javier
              Mascherano; therefore, if Barcelona fail to sign the Argentine player,
              they will direct their attention on the Roma man.<br> <br> Increasing the speculation about
              this move is the uncertainty surrounding the Italian club, and also the
              fact that De Rossi's 2008-09 campaign wasn't one of his finest.</p>

              <p>There have been rumours suggesting that <span class="lingo_link" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12.1667px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;">Rafa Benitez</span><img id="lingo_icon" class="lingo_icon lingo_icon_black" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 0pt ! important; padding: 0pt; float: none; position: static; left: auto; top: auto; line-height: normal; background-color: transparent; visibility: visible; width: 12px; height: 12px; background-repeat: no-repeat; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: top; display: inline; cursor: pointer;" src="http://static.lingospot.com/spot/image/spacer.gif" alt=""> has identified the 25-year-old Italy international as an ideal signing should Xabi Alonso leave for Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>However, the player's agent, <span class="lingo_link" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12.1667px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;">Franco Zavaglia,</span><img id="lingo_icon" class="lingo_icon lingo_icon_black" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 0pt ! important; padding: 0pt; float: none; position: static; left: auto; top: auto; line-height: normal; background-color: transparent; visibility: visible; width: 12px; height: 12px; background-repeat: no-repeat; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: top; display: inline; cursor: pointer;" src="http://static.lingospot.com/spot/image/spacer.gif" alt=""> insists there is absolutely no truth in those suggestions and says
              Aquilani is simply focusing on recovering from the ankle injury that

              <p>"The player just extended his contract and is working towards recovery and giving his best for Roma."</p>
              <p>Aquilani is under contract until 2013 and boss <span class="lingo_link" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12.1667px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;">Luciano Spalletti</span><img id="lingo_icon" class="lingo_icon lingo_icon_black" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 0pt ! important; padding: 0pt; float: none; position: static; left: auto; top: auto; line-height: normal; background-color: transparent; visibility: visible; width: 12px; height: 12px; background-repeat: no-repeat; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: top; display: inline; cursor: pointer;" src="http://static.lingospot.com/spot/image/spacer.gif" alt=""> this week tipped the player to recover his best form next season.</p>
