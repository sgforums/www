              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson claims equalling Liverpool's record of league championship wins was the last thing on his mind when he joined Manchester United in 1986.</strong></p>
              <p>The Merseyside giants had finished top on 18 occasions before United managed their first triumph under Ferguson in 1993. At the time, it seemed like a seminal moment in itself. Little could Ferguson have imagined that 16 years later he would stand on the brink of matching the Anfield outfit, who he famously told he would "knock off their perch" when he first came south from Aberdeen.</p>
              <p>United will not knock Liverpool off their perch by getting the point against <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal </span></a>tomorrow that would see them collect an 11th Premier League. However, it will be enough to let them shuffle up alongside, knowing one more big shove could tumble Rafael Benitez's men off altogether. 'I never even thought about moving level with Liverpool,' said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>'My first intention was to win one and break the stranglehold Liverpool had on the title. 'You don't think about how it would open the door in terms of what we see now.<br>The big challenge was that first one.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/05/15/article-0-04DF8534000005DC-507_306x368.jpg" alt=" Rafael Benitez " width="306" height="368">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez can only hope Arsenal defy the odds and down Man United at Old Trafford this weekend and that they continue winning</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Ironically it took Arsenal's assistance to prise away Liverpool's dominance of the domestic game. In winning titles under George Graham in 1989 and 1991, the Gunners showed United the correct path to follow.</strong></p>
              <p>They could not quite make it in 1992. But 12 months later began an era of unparalleled success, and it has taken just 17 seasons to complete 11<br>championship wins, compared to the 18 Liverpool managed it in from 1973.</p>
              <p>'We were a long way behind in terms of titles won,' acknowledged Ferguson. 'But we were helped by Arsenal winning it a couple of times. That changed the picture a little bit.'</p>
              <p>Ironically, United are venturing into new territory tomorrow. Of those last 11 successes, only one was completed in front of their own fans at Old Trafford. And in 1999 it was very much a do-or-die encounter with Tottenham, in which they trailed before David Beckham and Andy Cole scored the goals that sealed the first part of that historic treble.</p>
              <p>This time around, the Red Devils approach their date with destiny knowing they have another - at Hull next Sunday - in reserve should things go wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/05/15/article-0-03B650D3000005DC-937_468x487.jpg" alt="SIR ALEX FERGUSON" width="468" height="487">

              </div>
              <p><strong>Nevertheless, Ferguson is eager to get the job done immediately, to give his players the maximum preparation time for the Champions League final with Barcelona in Rome on May 27.</strong></p>
              <p>The desire to put on a performance for the world's fastest man, Usain Bolt, who was at United's Carrington training ground this morning and will be in the director's box to watch his favourite team tomorrow is a bonus, as is the strength of United's opponents.</p>
              <p>Arsenal may have suffered another fearful home battering by Chelsea since their own European dream was crushed by the Red Devils.</p>
              <p>Yet Ferguson knows their presence should ensure no-one in his squad starts to think the job has already been completed. 'Arsenal are a threat,' he said.</p>

              <p><strong>'They are a good side with great potential which you cannot dismiss. 'Without question they will attack us. They will not change the way they play. 'We expected two good games in the semi-final and we got them and that is the way it will be tomorrow.</strong></p>
              <p>'They have had a bit of criticism recently and they will want to register their abilities on a day when everyone expects Manchester United to win the title.'</p>
              <p>While Arsenal may well give a better account of themselves, few outside Anfield believe United will be denied now.</p>
              <p>Rio Ferdinand's ongoing calf problem means he will join Bolt in the stands, but everyone else will want to be involved to launch the trophy presentation in style.</p>
              <p>'I have always said I don't care where we win it,' said Ferguson. 'It is unusual and strange that we have won it four times elsewhere but only done it once out of 10 at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>'Now we have another opportunity to win it in front of our own fans tomorrow. It would be nice to do it.'</p>
