            <div class='col-md body'><p>Arsene Wenger is in no doubt midfielder Samir Nasri will make a 'quality' addition to the Arsenal squad. <br> <br>The Gunners finally completed what has been a protracted transfer of the 21-year-old from Marseille on a long-term contract for an undisclosed fee. <br><br>Wenger - who could now allow unsettled Belorussian winger Alexander Hleb to leave - feels the youngster has a 'great potential' which can be fulfilled at Emirates Stadium. <br><br>'He is young, quick and technically an outstanding player,' said Wenger, who also signed Wales teenager Aaron Ramsey earlier in the summer. <br><br>'Samir has shown great potential with his performances for Marseille and the French national team over the past two seasons and he will add great quality to our squad.' <br><br>Nasri made two appearances for France at Euro 2008 and had announced last month, somewhat prematurely, that the deal had been completed. <br><br>However, with all the relevant documents now processed, and the fee reported to be in the region of £12million, Wenger can look forward to shaping his team ahead of the new season which kicks off on August 12/13 with a Champions League qualifier. <br><br>The midfielder will join up with the rest of the Arsenal squad on their pre-season tour of Austria on July 21. <br><br>He said: 'This is a very important step in my life as a football player because Arsenal is a massive club. <br><br>'I really hope everything will go well for me here. I do will my best for Arsenal and its fans and I am honoured to be part of such a great football club.' <br><br>As well as resolving Hleb's situation, Wenger will also want the future of leading scorer Emmanuel Adebayor, a £30million target for AC Milan and Barcelona, to be confirmed before the Gunners start their pre-season schedule. <br><br>Nasri revealed Wenger's reputation for developing talent had played a major part in his decision to join the Gunners. <br><br>'The fact that Arsene Wenger gives great opportunities to young players is very important for me,' Nasri said in a statement. <br><br>'Arsene has a great reputation and he is one of the best managers in the world. He has proved that he puts a lot of confidence in the young players and he gives them a chance. <br><br>'It was very important for me to have such a great manager to work with and I'm really looking forward to working with both Arsene Wenger and all my new team mates.' <br><br>Nasri will join a large French contingent at the Emirates, which already included captain William Gallas, Gael Clichy, Abou Diaby and Bacary Sagna. <br><br>Former Gunners Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira had also given the youngster some advice. <br><br>'They both had amazing times at this club and even talking to them now, they are still very enthusiastic about Arsenal,' Nasri said. <br><br>'They both told me that it was the best choice for me to come to Arsenal.' <br><br>Nasri is looking forward to experiencing a new culture in England. <br><br>He said: 'When I was with Marseille, I was still the little boy, staying with my mum and dad, and today it's a great moment for me to join Arsenal. <br><br>'It will be a little weird because I will have to get used to a new life, but I'm grown up now and I am ready to cope with this change.' <br><br>The 21-year-old, though, is in no doubt he can have a major impact. <br><br>'I like offensive, technical and quick football, exactly in the style of Arsenal,' he said. <br><br>'I hope I will integrate myself quickly in this team and bring everything I can to Arsenal and its fans. <br><br>'I can play in the centre or on the wing. During my career, I have played behind one or two strikers or on the left, or the right hand side.' <br><br>Nasri added: 'Last season unfortunately, the team just missed out on winning a trophy, but with regards to football, in my opinion Arsenal produced the best football in Europe. <br><br>'I was a big fan of the team and of its football philosophy, which makes it so great for me to be joining the club.'<br></p></div>

              <p><br>I doubt Spure has the experience yet to overtake the gunners this time... Perhaps another year or two if they continue to move in the present direction and improve...</p>
              <p>Arsenal, I don't think you should worry too much, Wenger knows what he is doing... I belief at least another 3 new players of high quality will arrive before the season start or by 31 Aug...</p>
              <p>Arsenal still to be in the top 4...</p>

              <p>First of all , this season will be Juande Ramos' first <strong>full </strong>season in charge . Look at the silverware he has won with Sevilla and the transformation of spurs into a vibrant attacking side .</p>
              <p>Secondly , you can just look at the quality of their new acquisitions esp . Luka Modric . Would have been a complete midfielder if he adds more aggression and bites in his tackles .</p>
              <p>Now look at Gunners , Flamini has departed and Gilberto almost certain to be shown the door . Who else is capable in the team to partner Cesc in midfield and taking care of the defensive aspects of the game ? And also there will be no new addition to the central defence , which leaves Gallas and Toure as the only quality defenders . Alex Song is pretty good towards the end of last season but I don't think he will be ready . In a nutshell , Arsenal lack experience .</p>

              <p>Lacking experience to win it maybe but lacking experience to challenge for the top 4 i think they have no problem with that... I agree, Ramos has impress me very much with his management style... He has brought in a number of great signings even during the Jan window and have got rid of some ineffective ones...</p>
              <p>Why I say nothing to worry is because I belief Wenger will bring in another midfielder and striker of good quality... Heard they are currently interested on hijacting the Barry deal from Pool and considering Klaas Jan Huntelaar as a striker option too... They may or may not get them but, who knows... But one thing is for sure is it shows their intent in this direction... So even if they missed out on these 2, they will go look for 2 others of similar qualities to add to their already talented squad...</p>
