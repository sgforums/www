They should hammer him.<br><br>Â“Sooner or later Diouf, or a player like him, is going to seriously hurt someone or even end their career.<br><br>Â“The FA would certainly have charged Diouf with violent conduct yesterday had the ref not seen it. Instead, because the ref has dealt with it, the authorities wonÂ’t lift a finger and itÂ’s farcical.Â”<br><br>ReadingÂ’s Stephen Hunt got away with a similar challenge against Manchester City a week earlier.<br><br>But Tottenham skipper Robbie Keane was not so lucky after seeing red during SundayÂ’s 3-2 home defeat at the hands of Birmingham.<br><br>Winter, who retired from refereeing after the 2004 FA Cup final, says football should now adopt the same approach as rugby Â— where cheats can be cited a few days after a game has finished.<br><br>He added: Â“I think weÂ’re going to see over the next few weeks a splurge of red cards because IÂ’m sure the referees are going to be told they must get tough on these types of incidents.<br><br>Â“There is no place in the game for the sort of two-footed challenges that weÂ’ve seen recently by the likes of Stephen Hunt and El Hadji Diouf.<br><br>Â“TheyÂ’ve got to be read correctly and red cards have to be issued.<br><br>Â“Of course, when you see feet flying in, there are times when there are over-reactions from the officials, as with Robbie KeaneÂ’s dismissal.<br><br>Â“In his case, the replay shows he didnÂ’t go in with two feet and, maybe, a red card was a little bit harsh. But if sending him off gives the right message that those kind of challenges need to be stamped out, I can live with that.<br><br>Â“In rugby, they have a citing officer whose job it is to look through the tape and, basically, re-ref the game.<br><br>Â“Even if a player has been carded, there is the possibility of retrospective action if the foul play warrants it.<br><br><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00399/SNS0451A_399083a.jpg"><br><br>Â“Perhaps we should have the same sort of thing here.<br><br>Â“These two-footed challenges have crept into the game more and more recently. ItÂ’s like one every week and it must be stopped.Â”<br><br>Spurs have appealed KeaneÂ’s red card, as video replays showed the striker lunged with only one foot Â— not two.<br><br>But what angered Tottenham most was how ref Phil Dowd appeared to consult the fourth official, Uriah Rennie, over his radio mic before giving Keane his marching orders Â— which is against the rules.<br><br>However, the body in charge of Premier League refs, the Professional Game Match Officials, last night insisted Dowd did NOT consult Rennie Â— but merely informed him of the action he was taking in order to aid the management of the technical areas.<br><br>Winter added: Â“Normally, when you are going to send a player off, the card is in your hand very quickly.<br><br>Â“But, in my view, he was just radioing his officials to say Â‘Get ready, IÂ’m giving him a red cardÂ’.<br><br>Â“The fourth official is only supposed to get involved with a decision if it is regarding an off-the-ball incident that no one else has seen.<br><br>Â“People say they look at replays but they are not allowed to.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m not saying it has never happened in the past, where the ref has acted on the nod and a wink from a fourth official.<br><br>Â“But in this case, I think thatÂ’s impossible because Rennie would not have had enough time to see a replay.Â”</div>
