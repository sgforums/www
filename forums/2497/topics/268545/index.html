            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Newcastle manager Sam Allardyce has admitted he is not in the market for a "galactico" as he attempts to strengthen his squad.</strong><br><br>The Magpies have been linked with, among others, Brazilian superstar Ronaldinho and Italian World Cup winner Fabio Cannavaro in recent days with Allardyce scouring the world for new recruits.<br><br>Billionaire new owner Mike Ashley's spending power has inevitably led to frenzied speculation over the club's activity on the transfer market.<br><br>However, while Allardyce admits he would be thrilled to welcome such a name to St James' Park, his priorities currently lie elsewhere and admitted he was confident he could persuade Ashley's regime to fund his plans.<br><br>He said: "Without any reassurances in that area yet, I am confident if they need any convincing, I can convince them that a heavy investment needs to be made in terms of the transfer market.<br><br>"He made a massive, heavy investment in the first place which is hopefully, in the short term and the long term, great news for Newcastle United and for me.<br><br>"We are all hoping we can move in the transfer market and bring some good players to the football club.<br><br>"I am not talking about the 'galactico' stars that are being mentioned - that is just a nonsense at the moment.<br><br>"We need three or four solid, very, very good defenders from wherever it may be, and we will be a force this year.<br><br>"But we need to get them first. If he wants to give me a little gift after with a galactico, I won't say no."<br><br>Allardyce has already managed to land Mark Viduka, Joey Barton, David Rozehnal and Geremi since his arrival on Tyneside as Glenn Roeder's replacement.<br><br>However, he has made no secret of his wish to strengthen at the back, where inconsistently has cost the club dearly in recent years.<br><br>He lost out to Chelsea in his pursuit of Bolton centre-back Tal Ben Haim, and is currently chasing a series of other targets, although he admits the pool is growing smaller by the day.<br><br>He said: "We have other targets, but in terms of top targets, the list is running out rather rapidly now."<br><br>Allardyce's efforts to lure Marseille defender Habib Beye to St James' have so far come to nothing, while his move for Barcelona's Brazilian star Edmilson could be renewed in January when he has recovered from his knee injury - although by then Milan duo AC and Inter could be ahead of him in the queue.<br><br>He has dismissed suggestions he is in talks with Fulham's Franck Queudrue, and admits his interest in Manchester United's Gabriel Heinze is unlikely to pay dividends.<br><br>Allardyce said: "I wouldn't say we have any interest in Franck Queudrue.<br><br>"Heinze - if I wanted him, I don't think he would come. I think he would have hit sights on a greater club than this one.<br><br>"Certainly, if he got away from Manchester United, I'm not so sure that it wouldn't be another club somewhere else in Europe rather than in this country.<br><br>"It would be nice if he did want to come and we could pursue it, but I don't think we can."</div>
