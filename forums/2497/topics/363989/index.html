              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsene Wenger</span></abbr> is confident his team will deliver silverware to The Emirates stadium for the first time in four years next season.</p>
              <p>Speaking to <em>The Daily Express</em>, Wenger said, "What these
              players have already achieved, at that age, is remarkable. These
              players are winners, they will deliver, and they are very, very young.</p>
              <p>"To be in the last four in Europe, and to come back above <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Aston Villa</span></abbr> after being eight points down is remarkable. I believe the future looks very bright.</p>
              <p>"We had William Gallas, Gael Clichy, Emmanuel Adebayor, Theo
              Walcott and Cesc Fabregas out for a long time. And Tomas Rosicky did
              not play one game in the season. Can you believe that? And that’s why I
              believe what we have achieved, despite all that, is remarkable."</p>
              <p>The Frenchman sees the Champions League penalty shootout win against Roma as a vital part of his team's development.</p>
              <p>"On that day against Roma, I felt this team has not only quality but mental strength," he said.</p>
              <p>"And the (4-4 draw) Liverpool game for Arshavin was something
              special that happens to you once in a career – but only if you are a
              special player.</p>
              <p>"The match itself was something amazing. It was, maybe quality-wise, the best game of the season.</p>
              <p>"I admire his talent, his personality, his winning attitude and his efficiency and I’m convinced he will be a big hit.</p>
              <p>"We’ll also have Rosicky and all the young players who have learnt a lot this year, so let’s be positive, optimistic and brave."</p>

              <p>he doesn't need high transfer $$$, and his players are low maintenance.</p>
              <p>economical, he is the best, soccer wise, he is good..</p>
              <p>ask him to leave, get a new manager, you are looking @ 100m to spend, new contracts, losing your stars.. are you mad??</p>

              <p>most beautiful? probably yes but effective no. better to play futsal if all you want is for your players to play beautiful football on th pitch.</p>
              <p>its precisely hi stubborness to pay high that cause some players ot leave after a couple of seasons. He is the one to insist on youth and it backfired by trophyless seasons. You need a mixture of youth and experience to last a long season. His team can only have success in cups.</p>
              <p>Economical he is best? probably but if he lose stars each year and go without years of no trophy you got to question the model. Without success,  the brand will not be as profitable and each year without success will see Arsenal lose some marketability thus decreasing its profit each year. </p>
              <p>He needs to re-think his strategies coz i don't see Arsenal as a threat in the PL if they continue along the same route. For if they do end up anohter season without success, it is goodby eot Arsene, as much as i admire his approach but he is more suited as a coaching post for youth. As a manager, he is average behind the likes of David Moyes or Martin O'Neill.</p>
              <p>Target 4th place? thay wer fighting for titles a few seasons ago? So Arseanal fans are contented to go backwards? So they did well? I think they did well in parts, but throughout the season, they have not. Its only because they start to push during the 3rd quarter of the season. The first half of the season has been poor for them.</p>
