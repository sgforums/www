              <p class="imageCaption"><em>On the hunt: Abramovich has his eye on Arsenal's chief scout Steve Rowley<br></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is continuing his regeneration of the club following the £75million signing of Fernando Torres and David Luiz by trying to poach Arsenal’s chief scout Steve Rowley. </strong></p>
              <p>And Dutch legend Marco van Basten is also being considered as a potential replacement if manager Carlo Ancelotti is sacked at the end of the season.</p>
              <p>But it is Chelsea’s pursuit of Rowley, responsible for a string of signings, including Cesc Fabregas, Robin van Persie and Thomas Vermaelen, which will alarm their London rivals.</p>
              <p>Rowley’s record is unparalleled in England, with a string of young players joining Arsene Wenger’s side after being recommended by his scouting network.</p>
              <p>Players such as Alex Song Wojciech Szczesny, Bacary Sagna and Gael Clichy were all unearthed as youngsters and signed for small amounts.</p>
              <p>Chelsea now want Rowley to do the same job for them after director of football Frank Arnesen leaves in the summer. Stamford Bridge is undergoing something of a revolution since Abramovich took a direct interest again with the big Torres and Luiz deals.</p>
              <p>Van Basten is a leading candidate to take over if Chelsea’s indifferent form continues. They travel to neighbours Fulham tomorrow, needing a victory to maintain their position as Champions League qualifiers.</p>
              <p>Van Basten, one of the greatest strikers ever then Holland’s coach at the 2006 World Cup and Euro 2008, put himself in the frame by declaring his readiness to return after a two-year break since quitting Ajax.</p>
              <p>He said: ‘I am thinking about a nice big club abroad. It’s logical for me.</p>
              <p>‘I have been manager of the national team and Ajax and once you’ve done those jobs it’s awkward to manage another club in Holland.’</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> are set to be investigated over their pursuit of 15-year-old Feyenoord starlet Nathan Ake. </span></strong></p>
              <p>The promising youngster agreed a move to the Barclays Premier League champions in a deal reported to cost as much as £670,000.</p>
              <p>But strict rules in Holland prevent children under the age of 16 dealing with agents, and Dan Kramp of the Forza Fides agency is alleged to have played a key role in the deal.</p>
              <p>According to the Sun, Kramp reportedly took Ake to Chelsea during the Christmas holidays with the defender, who turns 16 on Friday,  even bragging on his Twitter account about 'heading to London,' and staying at 'a good hotel'.</p>
              <p>The deal has caused uproar in Holland, with Dutch Labour MP Tjaeerd Vekken raising the issue in parliament.</p>
              <p>'The rules clearly state that agents can't do anything with children under 16,' Vekken said.</p>
              <p>'Yet this agent turns up with a 15-year-old at Chelsea so the FA has got to tackle this issue.'</p>
              <p><br> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/02/16/article-1357506-0C8E55B8000005DC-692_468x512.jpg" alt="Treading on thin ice: Chelsea found themselves in hot water over the signing of Kakuta " width="468" height="512">

              <p><strong>A spokesman from the Dutch FA added: 'It's a transfer involving a player who is not yet 16 so our integrity unit is going to take a look at it.' </strong></p>
              <p>Chelsea denied any wrong doing over the Ake pursuit in December. A spokesman said: 'We've kept Feyenoord abreast of our interest from the very beginning and as a result have agreed terms with the club for the player's transfer to Chelsea in July.'</p>
              <p>Having been at the centre of controversy with the Gael Kakuta scandal last year, Chelsea were thought to have made their approach for Ake as above board as possible, making regular contact with Feyenoord's sporting director Leo Beenhakker to ensure they were not accused of any misdemeanours.</p>
