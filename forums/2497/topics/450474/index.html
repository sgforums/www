              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>Kenny Dalglish appears to have called into question the integrity of match officials following what he calls 'inexcusable' decisions in Liverpool's last three games. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The Reds manager, under fire following a slump in his side's league form that has seen their Champions League challenge wither, could now face an FA charge over his comments. </span></p>
              <p><span>Dalglish even called on match officials to explain their decisions to managers to avoid talk of a 'conspiracy' against his side. </span></p>
              <p><span>The Scot was particularly upset by referee Michael Oliver's refusal to award Dirk Kuyt a penalty in Saturday's 1-1 draw at home to Aston Villa, maintaining that Oliver told Kuyt he was 'unlucky'.</span></p>
              <p><span>He was irate at two decisions that went against Luis Suarez - the first, a booking for diving against Villa; the second, a disallowed goal against Wigan for handball. <br></span></p>
              <div id="ext-gen1291" class="moduleHalf"> </div>
              <p><span>Dalglish also took issue with the decision not to award Liverpool a penalty for Danny Simpson's handball on the line at Newcastle. </span></p>
              <p><span>He said: 'The last three games there are blatant decisions that have gone against us that are, frankly, inexcusable, and I'd say unexplainable as well. </span></p>
              <p><span>'I won't raise it with the Referees' Association, I've raised it now, and it's up to them. I think it really should be their concern. I've raised it, and it's up to them now to look at it. </span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span><strong>'To not get a penalty because an opponent is unlucky, surely that's not my concern, but the concern of the Referees' Association because they have got to look at something like that.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>'I am stating a fact. If they have something like that, a decision that isn't given that is so blatantly wrong – as we have felt in our last three games – then surely it is their problem, not mine.' </span></p>
              <p><span>Dalglish added: 'I know where we are coming from. I know we have integrity, I know we have integrity in bucketloads, but I can't speak for other people and whether they have integrity. </span></p>
              <p><span>'What we have to do now, is ensure this football club maintains its integrity, that the players keep their integrity, and hope that people elsewhere have some integrity too. </span></p>
              <p><span>'They [referees] have to look at themselves and ensure they are seen to have integrity.' </span></p>
              <p><span>Dalglish added that he thought those in charge of games should apologise out of respect when they got things wrong - or face accusations of conspiracy. </span></p>
              <p><span>He said: 'It would be helpful and more transparent if they told us, if they explained the decisions to us, or even just held their hands up and say, "sorry I got that wrong", and we can see they have integrity. </span></p>
              <p><span>'But they never say anything. We don't get everything right, do we? So it is understandable they don't either. But a wee bit of respect towards us would help the situation immensely. </span></p>
              <p><span>'Otherwise, people might think there is a conspiracy.</span></p>
              <p><span>'We can't believe that, we can't let it affect us, and take it into the games coming up, because that would damage us. We have to keep going, and ensure it doesn't affect the players.</span></p>
              <p><span>'If there is something, then somebody needs to tell us, and if there isn't anything, they need to explain it to us a bit better. We just need to keep going, we can't let it get to that, where we think it's a [conspiracy].'</span></p>

              <p>so much for king kenny to save liverpool after he took charge last season. if they are not careful, they may end out finishing 9th or 10 or maybe 11th place.</p>
              <p>liverpool is no longer a top 4 club, not even a top 6 club now in england. if this goes on, dun be surprised if he is given the chop. after all he was sacked by newcastle in the late 90s.</p>

              <p>He is directing too much unnecessary attention to himself.</p>
              <p>This is a ploy to distract people from his lousy players.</p>

              <p>Personally, i think he has made Liverpool much worse than before... I didn't used to feel so many people dislike them before but this past year, I notice more and more people don't like Liverpool and it's mainly because of him and the way he behaved to the press, the officials... He is rather rude when you hear or watch his interviews pre match and sometimes post match. His one answer replys or sometimes he question to a reporter's question just seems very rude.</p>
              <p>The feel good feeling that was around at the start of his second coming is now long gone... When you watch fanszone people call up to say unfavourable stuff about him, even the host also makes fun of him and his team... Even our local show like It's your shout! the host + the guests also don't like him kind...</p>
              <p>Very weird this guy.</p>
              <p>Anyway, his behaviour looks like the insanity just before the sack... Remember Rafa with his Facts nonsense... ?</p>
              <p>But despite what is happening, there are still some very die hard pool fans who still thinks kenny is the one to save them.</p>

              <p>I believe he is still using the old school of managing his beloved team.</p>
              <p>But, his method did not work as the results have shown.</p>
              <p>He have become Roy II, where the players have lost faith in him and his tactical formation.</p>
              <p>Liverpool is actually not in bad shape.</p>
              <p>They just need a tactical manager to sort out the stronger position of the players and the courage to bring forward some young players.</p>
              <p>We may lost a few matches but it is a process needed to rebuild confidence and teamwork.</p>
              <p>Same as Lions XII.</p>
              <p>As for the UK players, give them half a season to shape up or ship out.</p>
              <p>As for Carroll, he should be shown the exit for being rude.</p>

              <p>According to reports, Maxi has scored 4 goals in 8 league matches and 14 in his last 20 appearances.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yet he wants to play Downing, Henderson and Carroll more often.</p>
