            <div class='col-md body'>Angry Ferguson hits out at Premier League<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson has fiercely criticised the Premier League for failing to aid Manchester United in their Champions League quest.<br><br>United tumbled out of the tournament at the semi-final stage last night as a fitter, fresher AC Milan romped to a 3-0 win in the San Siro which sealed a 5-3 aggregate triumph and earned the Italians a rematch with 2005 conquerors Liverpool in Athens on May 23.<br><br>Just like title rivals Chelsea 24 hours earlier, United failed to find the legs to pursue their challenge.<br><br>And, while Ferguson does not blame the huge number of games his side have played recently for this crushing defeat, he does not believe the Premier League, who rejected a request to push Saturday's Manchester derby back by 24 hours, have helped them.<br><br>'We play in a very tough league and we have been using the same players with no respite for quite a while now,' said Ferguson.<br><br>'AC Milan have been able to rest their players at the appropriate times.<br><br>'In some countries, they help teams to prepare for European games. That is a problem.<br><br>'The Premier League have made an unfair decision against us by making us play Manchester City on Saturday.<br><br>'The TV people were happy for the game to be played on Sunday morning but the Premier League wanted to maintain the integrity of the competition. You can work out what integrity means. They are the ones who made Tottenham play Chelsea one-and-a-half days after a UEFA Cup tie.'<br><br>Despite an obvious fatigue factor, Ferguson admitted he never saw such a poor performance coming.<br><br>The Scot admitted United were slow out of the blocks and promptly lost their precious one-goal advantage from the first leg when Kaka drilled home after just 11 minutes.<br><br>Clarence Seedorf capped an outstanding performance by burying number two in the same corner on the half hour and though United improved after the break, they never threatened to match their amazing comeback against Juventus in 1999. And in the end, it was Milan who got a third through substitute Alberto Gilardino.<br><br>'We needed to get through the first 25 minutes without cutting our own throats,' said Ferguson.<br><br>'We needed to try and remain calm and keep possession but we conceded two sloppy goals. You should not be losing goals like that.<br><br>'It was a disappointing night. I expected more from my players but we have to take it on the chin.'<br><br>At least United still have the domestic double to play for, with victory over City required this weekend to leave them just a single point away from clinching the title.<br><br>Nemanja Vidic and Louis Saha should both improve for their appearances in the San Siro, while Ferguson expects Rio Ferdinand to be available now he has recovered from the groin strain that has dogged him for the past month.<br></div>
