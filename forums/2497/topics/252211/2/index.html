            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Fergie may have a point...</span><br><br>The end-of-season trilogy between Manchester United and Chelsea has been down-graded to a duology and those familiar with the history of English clubs on the Continent may not be surprised. Scaling twin peaks to become champions of England and Europe has generally proved a mountain too far and this week Sir Alex Ferguson and JosÃ© Mourinho have been thwarted in their attempts to plant flags on both summits.</strong><br><br>United and Chelsea, the only realistic challengers for the Barclays Premiership title since November, meet in a league match at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday and again on May 19 at Wembley in the FA Cup Final. But their hopes of a third showdown in the Champions League final collapsed and the match will feature instead a Liverpool side vastly inferior to both on the domestic front.<br><br>Of the 14 English teams to have reached the final of EuropeÂ’s senior club competition, only three have collected the league title that season. Of the remaining 11 instances, only United, in 1968, came close to winning the league. The other ten, the latest being Liverpool this season, have been well off the pace.<br><br>Even the three sides to have achieved this double hardly ran away with the domestic title. When United won the treble in 1999, they edged past Arsenal to win the Premiership crown with only 79 points, since when the average number of points recorded by champions has been 88. Liverpool, who recorded the other two such examples of triumph at home and in Europe, won the league by one point in 1977 and by three points in 1984.<br><br>There have been some dismal failures to add success at home to European Cup final appearances. In 1975, Leeds United lost to Bayern Munich but finished ninth in the table; in 1982, Aston Villa beat Bayern in the final but came eleventh in the league.<br><br>This is the third consecutive season when an English finalist has been hopelessly off the pace in the Premiership. Liverpool finished 37 points behind the champions in 2005, Arsenal 24 points behind last year and Liverpool are 18 points from the top now, having played one game more.<br><br>It has also proved hard to maintain a continental push while enjoying a good FA Cup run. Of the 14 English finalists in the European Cup, only two reached the FA Cup Final that season Â— Liverpool lost to Manchester United at Wembley in 1977 while United beat Newcastle United in 1999 en route to their treble. Of the past three English finalists in the Champions League, Liverpool exited the FA Cup at the first hurdle this year and in 2005, while Arsenal went out in the fourth round last season.<br><br>Challenging for trophies at home and abroad is perhaps tough psychologically as well as physically and, in the case of the latter, it has become no easier as the workload in Europe has increased. Liverpool have played 14 matches in the Champions League this season to reach the final, whereas they needed only either six or eight games to reach each of their five finals of the 1970s and 1980s.<br><br>Yet, while English sides have toiled to excel simultaneously at home and abroad, clubs from other countries have not experienced such great problems. Of the 90 non-English finalists in EuropeÂ’s leading club competition since it began in 1955-56, 40 won their domestic title that season.<br><br>How can this difference be explained? Until recent years, leading clubs in this country played far more than their counterparts abroad because of the 22-team top division, unlimited FA Cup replays and the presence of a second domestic knockout competition, the League Cup. Cutting the league to 20 clubs and scrapping FA Cup second replays and League Cup replays has largely removed that disadvantage but the English league is still considered by many to be more physically demanding than others in Europe.<br><br>Whatever the reasons, bookmakers who have avoided paying out fortunes on a United treble or Chelsea quadruple will be thankful for the continued difficulties faced by multitasking clubs in this country.<br><br></div>

Another club may choose to react differently depending on their situation, but in this case, that is Man City's reason.
