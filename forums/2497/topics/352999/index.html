              <div class="content">
              <p>Despite banging a hatful of goals past
              Aston Villa, Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez was not totally satisfied with
              their 5-0 victory.</p>
              <p>Benitez was disappointed from the point that Villa goalkeeper
              Brad Friedel was sent off for conceding Liverpool's second penalty -
              which resulted in their final goal.</p>
              <p>From then on, with 25 minutes left, the Anfield men took their foot off the gas.</p>
              <p>They had already overhauled United's once superior goal
              difference and have now scored more times than the champions this
              season.</p>
              <p>"There were times after the fifth goal when we should have gone on and scored more," said Benitez.</p>
              <p>"We should have kept going, scored more and made sure that our goal difference was better when we were playing against 10 men.</p>
              <p>"You never know what we will need, how many more goals we could have scored during that period.</p>
              <p>"Don't get me wrong. I was happy with the performance and the result, but we should have gone on and scored more."</p>
              <p>Albert Riera and Dirk Kuyt scored in the first period, before Steven Gerrard got the first of his dead-ball hat-trick.</p>
              <p>The first came from the spot after a foul on Riera, and the
              second was a 20-yard free-kick after Kuyt had been felled. Gerrard then
              netted the fifth from the spot, after Friedel had been dismissed for
              bringing down Fernando Torres.</p>
              <p>Benitez is content now that Liverpool have put themselves back into a position from which they can help shape their own destiny.</p>
              <p>"As far as the title chase is concerned, we just have to keep
              doing our job - we must not be concerned about United's results and how
              they are playing," he believes.</p>
              <p>"If United do make mistakes we must be ready, and that means carrying on doing what we are doing and winning points.</p>
              <p>"We are playing well, and they will see that we are playing well
              and trying to win every game. We have eight games left, and every one
              must be won - and be treated as a cup final.</p>
              <p>"Certainly we must maintain this momentum, and when we are playing well it just increases confidence.</p>
              <p>"We now have an international break, so the players must come
              back from that, re-group and start playing again just as we are at the
              moment."</p>

              <h1>Benitez: Reds can play better despite 5-0 win.</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://fourfourtwo.com/contentimages/news/Benitez13.jpg" alt="" width="286" height="161"></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool manager Rafa
              Benitez urged his team to keep their feet on the ground and told them
              they could do even better despite crushing Aston Villa 5-0 on Sunday to
              underline their title challenge to Manchester United.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Benitez, who finally signed a
              new contract on Wednesday that keeps him at Anfield until 2014, saw his
              men race to a 3-0 lead at halftime and wrap up the points with their
              biggest win of the season as they closed the gap on Premier League
              leaders United to one point.</p>
              <p>"I felt in the first half we
              gave the ball away sometimes when we could have played better on the
              counter-attack. The team was doing well but we could have done better,"
              Benitez told Sky Sports.</p>
              <p>"We are improving, we have
              confidence and there are still a lot of games to play. We have to keep
              our feet on the ground and carry on working hard."</p>
              <p>Skipper Steven Gerrard, who
              scored his first Premier League hat-trick with two of his three goals
              coming from penalties, echoed his manager's words.</p>
              <p>"I think it's important not to carried away," he told Sky Sports.</p>
              <p>"Manchester United are capable
              of winning all their remaining games. It's important we keep winning
              and focus on what we have to do, to keep on their shoulders and keep
              piling pressure on them whilst they are going into games knowing we are
              ready to pounce on any mistakes they make.</p>
              <p>"Chelsea are there as well even though they got beaten yesterday, we are still aware of Chelsea as well.</p>
              <p>"Everyone knows we are in a
              rich vein of form and confidence is high here. My first Premier League
              hat-trick means a lot but the win and three points is more important."</p>
              <p>Liverpool's other goals were
              scored by Dirk Kuyt and Albert Riera, while Aston Villa goalkeeper Brad
              Friedel was sent off after 64 minutes for bringing down Fernando Torres.</p>
              <p>"Was there an argument for a
              penalty, sure. Was there an argument for a booking sure, but I think a
              sending off was very harsh especially as there was a defender alongside
              him," Liverpool keeper Pepe Reina told Sky Sports.</p>
