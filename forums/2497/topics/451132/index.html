              <p><span><strong>Kenny Dalglish's Barclays Premier League nightmare at Liverpool suffered another demoralising blow as Roy Hodgson returned to haunt his old club. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The West Brom manager made his first trip back to Anfield since being sacked in January 2011 and Peter Odemwingie's 75th-minute goal secured a 1-0 win - 45 years to the day since Albion's last Anfield victory. </span></p>
              <p><span>It leaves Liverpool 37 points behind leaders Manchester United. <br></span></p>

              <p><span>'It is always enjoyable to win even if you need a bit of luck on your side to achieve it,' said the West Brom boss.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Forty-five years is a long time for a team like West Brom not to get a result at Anfield.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Maybe this result was written in the stars because with the last win being 45 years ago to the day maybe there is an element of fate about it.</span></p>
              <p><span>'We know how difficult it is to get results here but another hoodoo is laid to rest and I thought it was a very determined effort from our players.</span></p>
              <p><span>'The major satisfaction is winning at Anfield. With the team we have I don't think most people expect us to come and win here.'</span></p>
              <p><span>In the build-up to the game Hodgson had said he thought he would be given a difficult time by the Anfield crowd, who never took to him during his short spell in charge, but there was no such response.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I was very pleased by the reception and I thank the Liverpool fans for that. It was very courteous of them,' he added.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I would have been disappointed had it been otherwise as I have a lot of respect for Liverpool fans but it was nice they showed that courtesy to me and I appreciate it.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Liverpool dominated throughout and should have had the match wrapped up well before Odemwingie capitalised on a defensive mistake by Glen Johnson.</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Dirk Kuyt and Jordan Henderson were both denied by the woodwork, Luis Suarez and Andy Carroll had numerous opportunities while Maxi Rodriguez had appeals for a first-half penalty turned down.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Hodgson felt awarding a spot-kick for Billy Jones' challenge would have been wrong but he accepted his side had ridden their luck.</span></p>
              <p><span>'It wasn't a penalty. I can categorically state that was not a penalty and that is not just with a West Brom hat on, that is with a football lover's hat on,' he added.</span></p>
              <p><span>'The players showed a lot of commitment and effort and we were grateful to a lot of blocks and saves from our goalkeeper.</span></p>
              <p><span>'And when those two things didn't work we had a bit of luck on our side with balls hitting the post or the goalkeeper in the face when he knew nothing about it.</span></p>
              <p><span>'There was a little bit of luck there. We created two good chances in the first half which were foiled by two good Pepe Reina saves and in the second half we created a lot less and ended up scoring a goal.'</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>For Kenny Dalglish, the man who replaced him at Anfield in January last year, it was like watching repeats of previous performances.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Liverpool have won just five times in 17 home matches and tales of missed chances have become all-too commonplace for the Scot.</span></p>
              <p><span>'It's not just been one of those days; it's been like that seven or eight times here,' he said.</span></p>
              <p><span>'There's not much else that we can add to what we've said before so many times after a game at Anfield.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I think you could go back over the old interviews and it'll be the same thing.</span></p>
              <p><span>'They just need a bit of luck I think. It sounds repetitive but it's not an excuse.</span></p>
              <p><span>'We're not running away from something. It's not as if there's something drastically wrong that we can't identify.</span></p>
              <p><span>'It is just a piece of good fortune that we need.'</span></p>

              Seriously, how can a team lose when they have 30 shots at goal and 9 on target. with 15 corners and 60%+ of ball possession somemore

              Yes they have the ''style'', but it isnt the right style to win you games.
              
              
              Too many times i have seen Suarez running down the wings and look into the box, only to see that there is barely 1 red shirt in the box. He had no choice but to try and shoot from the impossible angles.

              <p>I feel liverpool really need a new striker + a right winger.</p>
              <p>Henderson looks good in the middle, but almost useless at winger. I hope to see adam johnson(man city) or maybe Granero(real madrid).</p>
              <p>Andy Carroll is still young and no where good enough to be liverpool number 9. Actually, liverpool wanted Llorrente(<span class="st">Athletic Bilbao) not carroll, but bid was rejected. I consider Llorrente wrold class.</span></p>
              <p>No
               one in the box for most of the time is fine, the problem is with the 
              timing to move into the box. Barcelona, most of the time. has no one in 
              the box too, BUT their midfielders &amp; forwards know when and how to 
              cut the defence into the box. Xavi, Fabregas, Iniesta can pick them up 
              with their passing ability.</p>
              <p>Just my own view, Liverpool overpaid 
              Carroll, Henderson and Downing simply bcuz they are english. They 
              replace good players with another good players. I can't see how the 
              above three is playing better than raul meireles, maxi rodriguez, 
              aquilani, joe cole.</p>
              <p>20 million pounds for henderson?</p>
              <p>Real 
              madrid paid less for their playermaker Ozil. Ozil is definitely one of 
              the best midfielder right now. His passing is deadly - for me, better 
              than xavi. He is reason why Kaka is owaz on bench.</p>
              <p>Seriously, I 
              don't think liverpool have any chance for the epl title next season. Top
               4 finish next season, is more than enuff for me. <img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
