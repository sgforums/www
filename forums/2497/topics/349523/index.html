              <div><span></span></div>
              <div id="articlebody">
              <p>Yossi Benayoun scored the only goal of a closely fought first leg in which there were precious few goalscoring opportunities for either side as defences largely kept their opponents at bay.</p>
              <p>Robben, who had arguably Madrid's best effort in the second half when his thunderous 25-yard strike was palmed over by Jose Reina, has not given up hope of his side progressing, and in the process avoiding another European exit at the hands of the Reds for the Dutchman.</p>
              <p>Robben was part of the Chelsea side that was eliminated by Liverpool at the semi-final stage in both 2005 and 2007, but he has faith it will be third time lucky on this occasion.</p>
              <p>"We have to go to Anfield and give it everything. We don't have anything to lose and we are going to go there confident of getting through the tie," he said. "I'm sure we can be in the quarter-finals."</p>
              <p>Robben knows from bitter experience how hard it is to get a positive result at Anfield. In 2005 Chelsea lost 1-0 there after being held goalless at home, while in 2007 the London outfit were again defeated 1-0 having led by the same scoreline from the first leg, and were subsequently knocked out 4-1 on penalties - Robben missing his side's first spot-kick.</p>
              <p>"The situation now is difficult, because we wanted to win this game," he added on his club's website. "They are an English team, which means they are very strong, especially at a tactical level. They closed up the space very well and scored a goal. It will be difficult, but in the return match we are going to try and turn the tie around.</p>
              <p>"To get a good result at Anfield we have to move the ball very quickly and try to create as many chances as possible. "They have done very well. They have not left any spaces because they wanted to keep a clean sheet.</p>
              <p>"They are tactically very strong, and although I do not really like the way they play it is always effective. "They are a stronger team at home and it will be difficult to beat them, although we can do something big there."</p>

              <p><strong>Real Madrid defender Fabio Cannavaro has urged his team-mates not to dwell on Saturdya's disappointing draw against arch rivals Atletico and focus their efforts on Tuesday's crucial Champions League clash against Liverpool.</strong></p>
              <p>Real went into the derby at the Bernabeu on the back of a 10-match winning streak in La Liga, during which time they had cut Barca's lead at the summit from 12 points to just four.</p>
              <p>However, that gap is now back to six points after Barca won and Real were held to a 1-1 draw by Atletico in a match where the Rojiblancos really should have been celebrating their first win over Real in a decade after creating a host of excellent chances.</p>
              <p>It was a disjointed display by Real, who were without the suspended Pepe and Wesley Sneijder while key striker Gonzalo Higuain started the game on the bench, and Cannavaro knows they can ill afford a repeat at Anfield, when they try to overturn a 1-0 deficit against Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"We have to get our form back quickly because on Tuesday we cannot fail. We have to play as a team and quickly forget this game. It's time to start talking about Liverpool," said the Italian World Cup winner.</p>
              <p>"We've not played well (against Atletico), but at times, after winning 10 successive games and before a match as important as the Liverpool one, these things can happen.</p>
              <p>"You always need to be optimistic, and more so in football because anything can happen."</p>
              <p>Dutchman Arjen Robben, who had a couple of opportunities to put Real ahead early on against Atletico, added on his club's website. "It was a very open game with chances for both teams. We wanted to win this game to pick up another win, but the most important thing is not to fade, to continue fighting, work hard and now we will focus on Tuesday's game.</p>
              <p>"Against Liverpool it will be a very important game for Real Madrid. On Tuesday we will have to work very hard once again. Every game until the end of the season is a 'final'."</p>

              <p><strong>Rafael BenÍtez, the Liverpool manager, has suffered a setback before the second leg of his team’s Champions League first knockout round tie against Real Madrid at Anfield tomorrow after Yossi Benayoun was ruled out for about a fortnight with a hamstring tear. The Israel midfield player, who scored the only goal in the 1-0 win at the Bernabéu in the first leg, suffered the injury during a training session on Friday.</strong></p>
              <p>However, BenÍtez is hopeful that Fernando Torres, the striker, and Álvaro Arbeloa, the right back, will overcome ankle and hamstring problems respectively. Daniel Agger, the defender, is unlikely to be fit, though.</p>
              <p>“Fernando is improving but it’s still too soon to say if he’ll be fit,” BenÍtez said. “We now have two or three more training sessions before we have to make a decision. Arbeloa is much the same as Torres and we will try to push him harder over the next couple of days.”</p>

              <p><strong>Real Madrid defender Fabio Cannavaro has said that Liverpool "did not make any effort to win the game" in Spain.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Reds did eventually triumph 1-0 at the Bernabeu thanks to a Yossi Benayoun goal but Cannavaro says Liverpool used rudimentary tactics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"At the Bernabeu, Liverpool did not make any effort to win the game," Cannavaro told AS. "Throughout the match, their goalkeeper kept sending long balls to Dirk Kuyt over and over again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I know for certain they will do the same at Anfield. I am sure of it. We must play our best football and must also have a lot of patience and eliminate any mistakes at the back. If we can score against them, we will force them to come out and play.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We do not have to go all out attack for 90 minutes. The key is to open the field by looking for our wingers so that they can take on their players one-on-one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We also have to take advantage of any mistakes their centre-backs might make because there's always a chance they will slip up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"But we can't just rely on Arjen Robben or Marcelo or Wesley Sneijder. If we want to win at Anfield, we have to play as a team because we do not have individuals like Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo. This Madrid side needs to unite as one, and that includes players on the bench, the coaches and the physios.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Liverpool are by no means a better team than Madrid. They are a very organised and solid team and they know exactly how to play. They are very compact because they have been playing more or less with the same team for the last six years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"For me, they are most dangerous on the counter and when it comes to set-pieces. They will allow you to play and they will even give you the ball, however, once they find a gap at the back, they will score."</p>

              <p>The Belgian official will referee the Champions League tie against Real Madrid and if Liverpool enjoy the benefit of another generous decision by De Bleeckere, the Spanish champions' task of pulling back a 1-0 first-leg deficit will surely be mission impossible.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">ANGRY Juande Ramos insists he will put the boot into Rafa Benitez and his ‘lucky’ Liverpool tonight. The Real Madrid boss is still raging at the Reds’ smash-and-grab win in the Bernabeu two weeks ago and is adamant Benitez and his team are in for a footballing lesson. </h2>
              <p class="article">Ramos, booted out of Tottenham five months ago and branded a Premier League failure, held nothing back as he laid into his old foe Benitez and spelt out his plans to conquer the Champions League. </p>
              <p class="article">Real are one down after the last-16 first-leg clash. That was the eighth time Ramos has lost to Kop boss Benitez in 11 career meetings. But snarling Ramos roared: “I’m not having the idea that Benitez got one over on me in the first leg. </p>
              <p class="article">“Liverpool turned up without any intention of trying to play football, hung on for a 0-0 and got lucky with a deadball situation for their goal. “It was a totally undeserved win. If they try and play that way at Anfield — and I guess they will — then all we need to do is score and we’ve got a great chance of going through. </p>
              <p class="article">“Losing to a team playing with so many men behind the ball did our morale a lot of damage and we’ve really got a thorn in our side — we’ll get rid of that at Anfield. </p>
              <p class="article">“My prediction is we’ll play a beautiful game of football because we simply have to win and we are going into the second leg with phenomenal pride and self-belief. “The players have told me that they’ll treat it like the Champions League final itself and we’ll sweat blood in order to eliminate Liverpool. </p>
              <p class="article">“I’ve got absolutely no fear of what lies ahead. With all the respect in the world for Liverpool and Rafa Benitez, I’ve been a coach at some of the great stadiums in the world, either in charge of the home side or with the opposition team. </p>
              <p class="article">“Coincidentally I never took Spurs to Anfield so it will be my first time on the bench there. But Anfield just isn’t a bigger deal than the Bernabeu, the San Siro or the Camp Nou — and I’ve seen all those before. We aren’t there as tourists, we are in Liverpool to win and then enjoy that side of the experience. </p>
              <p class="article">“It’s a bit of a disadvantage that Liverpool have had nearly seven days to rest and prepare while we had to play the Madrid derby at the weekend — but we can drive ourselves on to victory thanks to the hunger and pride we’re taking to Anfield.</p>
              <p class="article">“These types of games tend to be decided by little psychological details rather than simply by which side is in better shape physically. “The key to Real Madrid´s success is that my lads never, ever surrender. My team represents the glorious European tradition of Real Madrid — which is that you always go out and play to win. </p>
              <p class="article">“You never moan about injuries, suspensions, how the opposition treat you or whether the bookies have you as overwhelming underdogs for any reason. “At this club the only thing that matters is winning — and playing well.” </p>
              <p class="article">Keeper Iker Casillas added: “We’ve got back our dominance of Spain in the last two years and now we want to dominate Europe once again. “The legends say its special to play at Anfield. Well, I want to feel how special it is to WIN there and we’ll go after the victory from the first minute. </p>
              <p class="article">“All we need is just a touch of luck. And I’ll take any victory, even a 1-0 and extra time.” Former Chelsea, Arsenal and Portsmouth star Lassana Diarra added: “I’m quite sure we’ll win there. We can impose a style of play which can really damage Liverpool.” </p>
              <p class="article">Cynics may argue Ramos’ fighting talk stems from the fact he does not want Bernabeu bosses to replace him with Benitez at the end of the season. But several of the players who have been coached by both Ramos and Benitez insist the Liverpool boss has a mean streak that they want to address. </p>
              <p class="article">Keeper Andres Palop, double UEFA Cup winner with Ramos and La Liga winner under the current Liverpool coach rapped: “Benitez is a great manager but, at a personal level, he leaves you feeling like you don’t even exist. </p>
              <p class="article">“I always felt that the only importance I had for him was in training or a match. </p>
              <p class="article">“You never, ever got a single word from him. </p>
              <p class="article">“Nothing escapes Benitez, in fact sometimes he gives his players too much information. In comparison Jaunde is a guy who likes to unify his players and who’ll give the same treatment and opportunities to anyone in the squad without thinking about hierarchy.” </p>
              <p class="article">Full-back Josemi, who won a Champions League medal for Benitez in Istanbul after playing for Ramos at Malaga, added “Juande’s a better guy. “That day-to-day relationship with his players is something that Rafa doesn’t go for.”</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">STEVEN GERRARD has warned Real Madrid: We'll go for the kill tonight. </h2>
              <p class="article">Liverpool lead the Spanish giants 1-0 going into their Champions League last 16 second leg at Anfield. Yossi Benayoun's goal two weeks ago gives Rafa Benitez's side a slender advantage. But Reds skipper Gerrard insists his side will not sit back. </p>
              <p class="article">He said: "I think the next goal in the tie is massive. "If Madrid get it then it's game on, and that's exactly what we don't want to happen. "We want to make sure we get it and try to kill the tie off." </p>
              <p class="article">Liverpool have reached two of the last four Champions League finals. And Gerrard expects their recent experience in Europe to prove vital this evening. He added: "When it comes to Europe we've got to be confident.</p>
              <p class="article">"Over the years we have proved we can go anywhere, match any team and beat them. "Over two legs we are a very strong team. "Defensively and tactically we are spot on and we've got match winners in the side, so there's no reason why we shouldn't be confident. "You can probably tell by the way I'm speaking that we respect Madrid, we know it's not over and we'll not be taking them lightly." </p>
              <p class="article">Kop boss Benitez has been accused of focussing on the Premier League this season. But Gerrard insists the Reds are gunning to win every competition. He said: "Going into any competition as a Liverpool player you have to give it your all. </p>
              <p class="article">"Obviously, the league has always been the priority at Liverpool because we haven't won it for a long time. "It's the one people want more than anything, which is understandable. "That doesn't mean the European Cup plays second fiddle.</p>
              <p class="article">"It's a massive trophy to win and it makes the club financially better off if you can win it. "It's a very important competition for us."</p>

              <p>To be fair, this Real Madrid side look like rubbish... No fighting spirit, no good attacking ideas, very poor defenders... Anyway, well done to Pool... Just glad to see Real get a good beating... lol</p>
              <p>On another note... I think Casillas and Buffon are really over rated man... We don't see them play very often and start to form this idea that they are really super keepers then when we see them come down to this level... They are like those ordinary EPL keepers... I think even Givens is better than them...</p>
