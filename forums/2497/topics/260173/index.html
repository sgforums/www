The Spanish club contacted Beckham's camp and the Galaxy after president Ramon Calderon spoke of exploiting a possible escape clause in his contract to try to keep him in Madrid. </strong><br><br>It is understood however that Real were told "politely but firmly" that no such clause exists - and that there is no chance of Beckham changing his mind. Real Madrid coach Fabio Capello, who often left Beckham on the bench during the first half of the Primera Liga season, has admitted making errors about the way the 32-year-old was handled.<br><br>He said: "We have all made mistakes regarding Beckham. "On the sporting side we have made a decision and I am the one that has the maximum responsibility. "The truth is that with him we made a mistake. "Beckham is a great player. Now he is playing at the same level as he did at Manchester (United).<br><br>"He is a player that has recovered his physical and psychological condition because he was upset not to be playing with his national team. "For every player, the national team is important and for English players, more so."<br><br>However Galaxy general manager Alexi Lalas insists the deal to bring Beckham to California is set in stone. Although he refused to comment on the specifics on any player's contract, when asked directly if there was any mechanism Madrid could use to keep Beckham, Lalas said: "No.<br><br>"I don't doubt Real Madrid would love to have David Beckham next season but the really is that ship has sailed. "We're looking forward to his arrival. Nothing has changed from our perspective."<br></div>
