              <p><em>Atletico Madrid striker Sergio Aguero has arrived in England for a medical as he closes in on a £38million move to Manchester City.</em></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The 23-year-old Argentina international was at City's Carrington training ground this morning having cut short a holiday in his homeland to fly in to finalise contract negotiations and undergo the medical.</strong></p>
              <p>Aguero, the son-in-law of Diego Maradona, is currently on leave having been involved in the Copa America.</p>
              <p>"Just arrived in Manchester to finalise the details of signing with City," Aguero wrote on Twitter.</p>
              </div>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>"Everything is going very well! I'll tell you more in a while."</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>With striker Carlos Tevez adamant he wants to leave City to be nearer his family in Argentina Aguero is seen as the ideal replacement.</p>
              <p>Younger than his compatriot by four years, the Atletico Madrid star has been a prolific goalscorer in La Liga.</p>
              <p>He is one of the most sought-after strikers in Europe, which is why his club inserted a £38million buy-out clause when they gave him a new contract in January.</p>
              <p>Atletico had resigned themselves to the fact they would lose their prized asset when he announced in May, before the Copa America, that he wanted to leave.</p>
              <p>Aguero's preference was to remain in Spain, with city rivals Real seemingly the most likely destination, but Atletico were keen to resist such a move.</p>
              <p>So for Atletico an offer from Manchester City, although Italian club Juventus were also interested, represented the preferred option.</p>
              <p>Atletico coach Gregorio Manzano admitted last night that Aguero's departure looked imminent.</p>
              <p>"It seems as though in the coming hours we will have a final outcome to the issue that has has occupied us for so long," he told Spanish radio station Cope.</p>
              <p>"It is already in it's final stretch, I've asked the players to focus on Thursday's game (a Europa League tie against Stromsgodset).</p>
              <p>"Unfortunately we won't be able to call on Kun (Aguero)."</p>

              </span></p><p class="imageCaption"><em>Winning hands: Sergio Aguero wants to bring success to Manchester City</em></p>
              
              <p><br></p>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Sergio Aguero will become the most expensive player in Manchester City's history. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>City have agreed a deal of £35million plus add-ons with Atletico Madrid, believed to take the fee up to £38m, for the Argentina striker. In handing him a five-year contract worth close to £200,000 per week, the package to land him could reach more than £85m. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The 23-year-old, who will wear No 16 for City, flew into Manchester on Wednesday morning after cutting short a family holiday in his homeland. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>He underwent a three-hour medical before agreeing personal terms at the Etihad Stadium, where he was greeted by hundreds of jubilant supporters and spent time signing autographs. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>While the club have yet to announce anything, the player himself said the deal was done on his Twitter account last night. 'I'm already a City player,' he wrote. 'Happy to be in this club and this city. Thank you all for the welcome and the reception!' </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Yet while Aguero is preparing to embark on a new career in the Barclays Premier League - a decision will be made in the next 24 hours as to whether he is included in the squad who are travelling to Dublin for a friendly tournament - club captain Carlos Tevez is edging closer to joining Inter Milan. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>As yet, there has been no official contact between the clubs but there were suggestions last night that a deal could be possible. City's stance on the 27-year-old has not altered in that they will not let him join another European club for less than £50m. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Aguero would be a ready-made replacement for wantaway Tevez and he could find himself thrust into the fray straight away in Dublin on Friday. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>City announced a 28-man travelling party on their official website that included strikers Edin Dzeko and Mario Balotelli for the tournament that will see them come up against Inter and Celtic. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But there were only 27 names on the published list, with the section of strikers completed with the words 'plus one other'. <br><br>The signing of Aguero shows where City are in the game - 11 years ago this week they were overjoyed to be signing George Weah on a free transfer - and his addition will delight manager Roberto Mancini. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/07/27/article-2019275-0D2F909F00000578-571_634x373.jpg" alt="Sign here: Aguero signed autographs for waiting fans after he arrived at the club's HQ" width="634" height="373"> </span></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Sign here: Aguero signed autographs for waiting fans after he arrived at the club's HQ</em></p>
              <p><br></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>However, Aguero departed the Vicente Calderon Stadium after five years at the club with a stinging rebuke from Atletico manager Gregorio Manzano ringing in his ears. He said: 'Kun (Aguero) could easily have handled this more professionally, more carefully, with more humanity and a bit more class. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I had to tell all my players to ignore these unnecessary goings on to focus on our UEFA (Europa League) qualifying tie, but it would have been decent of Kun to stop and think about what was important to the club and reconsider his actions.'</span></p>

              <h1>Why Sergio Aguero's arrival as Manchester City's new pin-up will make the exit of his Argentina team-mate Carlos Tevez irrelevant</h1>

              <p><em>City are getting a talisman who can provide the impetus for them to take the final step into the elite of ­the European game</em></p>

              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>It is little wonder Manchester City fans turned out at the Etihad Stadium last night to celebrate the arrival of Sergio Aguero.</strong></p>
              <p>This, after all, is the striking wonder who has already pushed City’s current captain, Carlos Tevez, out of the ­Argentina team.</p>
              <p>The attacking sensation who has been hailed as the new Diego Maradona - whose youngest daughter, Giannina, he married. And the player who was highly-sought all over Europe before City convinced him they were a better bet than either Real Madrid or Juventus.</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>City are not just getting one of the most exciting strikers in the world for their record £40million outlay. They are also, apparently, getting a talisman who can provide the impetus for them to take the final step into the elite of ­the European game.</p>
              <p>The signing of Aguero promises a huge impact, as the crowds in Manchester last night suggested. By signing a similar player to Tevez, but one who is younger, quicker and with far more potential, City are upgrading.</p>
              <p>The facts that Aguero has replaced Tevez in their country’s forward line and is rated more highly back home adds to the sense of moving onwards and upwards for the club’s supporters.</p>
              <p>In the Copa America, Aguero started the tournament alongside his friend and – however briefly – new ­club team-mate, but then replaced him as a like-for-like striker playing in a deeper role. That seems certain to happen at City, too.</p>
              <p>Aguero started breaking records when he was just 15 years and 35 days old, while he was at Independiente.</p>
              <p>His then-coach, Oscar Ruggeri, made him the Argentinian first ­division’s youngest-ever player, beating a 27-year-old record held by his future ­father-in-law.</p>
              <p>He scored 18 goals in 36 games during the 2005-06 season, which was good enough to persuade Atletico Madrid to splash out £20m on him.</p>
              <p>“Signing with Atletico was one of the best decisions of my life,” said Aguero. “It helped me become stronger, both physically and mentally, on and off the pitch.”</p>
              <p>In his second season in Madrid, he scored 19 times in a fearsome partnership with Diego Forlan as Atletico qualified for the Champions League.</p>
              <p>Last year, he set up both goals for Forlan as Atletico destroyed Fulham in the Europa League final – a stat that surprised fans, because he is known for scoring goals not providing assists.</p>
              <p>Then, last season, he scored 20 goals in La Liga. Only two players managed more – Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>If City can get the £40m they want for Tevez from ­Corinthians or, as now seems more likely, Inter Milan, then they will have upgraded without spending any money.</p>
              <p>That would be a coup to not only excite the fans who turned out to cheer the player’s name yesterday, but to also inspire the stars already at the club who are looking for signs of progress to the next level.</p>
              <p>It is a point conceded by Gareth Barry, the man who is most likely to replace Tevez as skipper at Eastlands.</p>
              <p>He said: “Aguero is a very exciting player – a class act, and names like that will excite fans and the players.”</p>
              <p>It is no coincidence that chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak took the unusual step of becoming directly involved in negotiations to bring the ­Argentine from Atletico for the second-highest fee in British transfer history.</p>
              <p>City owner Sheikh Mansour himself senses that this summer’s transfer window is pivotal, not only defining the club’s immediate future but setting the tone for next season and beyond.</p>
              <p>With the Blues now resigned to Tevez’s exit, Sheikh Mansour knows the loss of such an important player could backfire dramatically.</p>
              <p>But the fact the Blues have beaten both Real and Juve to the capture of Aguero speaks volumes about their intent and about the attractiveness of their buying power, even in Tevez’s absence.</p>
              <p>Those two clubs are firmly established in the top tier of the game, but both dithered over the £40m buy-out clause, while City acted decisively.</p>
              <p>Such action has not only diverted a potential crisis, it has posted a strong ­statement – and there is more to come.</p>
              <p>When Tevez does go, either in a big-money switch to Inter or, more likely, with his tail between his legs in a loan move back to South America, it will free up more capital to be invested in further big name talent, with Samir Nasri still on City’s shopping list.</p>

              <p>To be fair, I wouldn't say Mancini is a poor manager. I rate him as good as Lotti if not better. It's just that City is more difficult to bring under control than Chelsea who are a team playing together for a good number of years already... The City manager job is much more difficult with so many new faces every 6 to 12 months... Big name players that have big egos as well... The team isn't as settled but he is getting them there very soon... I belief the longer he stays, the better it will be for City... And City will be a force to watch this season...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sergio Aguero has revealed he has not even spoken to Carlos Tevez about joining Manchester City.</strong></p>
              <p>Aguero last night completed his record £40million switch from Atletico Madid to replace Tevez as City’s star striker and says it was Blues defender and fellow Argentine Pablo Zabaleta who convinced him to move.</p>
              <p>He did not mention Tevez when asked which players he had consulted about City, even though they have just played together for Argentina at the Copa America.</p>
              <p>In what could be seen as another veiled snub for Tevez, Aguero claimed Liverpool’s former Atletico forward Maxi Rodriguez was his best pal in the Premier League.</p>
              </div>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>“I spoke to Zabaleta and he spoke very positively about the club,” he said. “When we were talking, I asked my agent to do everything he could because this is a good club and I had always wanted to play in the Premier League and it felt right.</p>
              <p>“Zabaleta has told me all about them and it is all very positive. He has told me it is a happy squad, so when I get the chance to meet up with my new team-mates, I will be able to see exactly what they are like. But I have only heard good things about them and can’t wait to get to know them.</p>
              <p>“I am also friendly with Maxi Rodriguez. I get on well with him. We played together for Atletico Madrid and the national team and we are good friends.”</p>
              <p>Aguero, 23, spent yesterday house-hunting while waiting for his move to be completed.</p>
              <p>He has signed a five-year deal worth £200,000-a-week and is confident he can successfully make the switch from La Liga to the Premier League.</p>
              <p>Unlike Tevez, who wants to quit City to be reunited with his family in Argentina, Aguero claims he will quickly put down roots.</p>
              <p>He is even undaunted by Manchester’s infamous dreary climate - saying he hates hot weather.</p>
              <p>“I don’t think I’ll have too many problems settling into the team,” he said. “I don’t like very hot weather, so on that side of things, I will be OK. I’m sure I am going to enjoy myself here and life will be fine.</p>
