              <p>and to a certain individual here who claims to be a liverpool fan but continue to disparage and diss the team, my only request is you come out of the closet first before you spew you shit again. confess that you are a man-u-or-whatever-team-you-support/gay/dickhead first and then you have a free reign to write nonsense about liverpool. it is one thing having constructive criticism on the team one support but quite another to have a free reign of shitting all over the place in one's own house. you are a disgrace to liverpool if you are a fan.</p>
              <p>nothing is worse than having a member in your own family washing your dirty linen in public when family members should rally together in trying times. if the country is at war, you will be the first to rat on your own country and be a traitor.</p>

              <p>I hope you could refrain from such attacks on any individual in here... Its one thing to love and support your club but I think you should also respect others and the ways they go about doing so...</p>
              <p>Individuals show their support or love in different ways... Like some parents will love the child till they become over protective and in the event, spoil him. While others may choose to discipline theirs for their own good and some will also pressure theirs hoping to get the best out of them... But at the end of the day, they all still love their child...</p>
              <p>Everyone has their different ways of expression just like you have yours... The way is to accept and respect their choices, just like you would want others to respect yours...</p>
              <p>Sometimes people do so because they are a greater supporter than the normal ones... They may not want to get their hopes too high and be disappointed again and again... Instead choosing not to say too many nice things but silently hoping for the team to do well... You just have to learn and accept that different people have different ways of approach thats all... But all roads still leads to Rome.</p>

              <p>You are absolutely correct and I agree with you on your first point. All I am saying is, we are all not program to be or do the same things so expectations could varies among different individuals from time to time even among same club supporters... I personally have came across a few within the United's fans here too but I accept they are just expressing another form of support for the club... Probably they are just letting off pent-up frustrations thats all when things are not going well... But when the club is doing well, they are happy too...</p>
              <p>You know which club I support and there is nothing for me to hide... I am not coming from any other forms, just a neutral one in this case... I just feel there was no need for the excessive used of words in an earlier post only... You want to make your point, thats fine but the extra words wasn't really necessary right? </p>
              <p>Every individual still have their rights just like I respect yours but don't use it to start unprovoked flaming lah... questioning ones nationality over a football topic and all the name callings is rather excessive don't you think so?</p>
              <p>Lets just keep it to football, afterall Pool won last night so you and all the other Pool fans should be happy today right... Should just go and enjoy your day...</p>
