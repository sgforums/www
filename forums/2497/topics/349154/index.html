              <p><strong>Real Madrid striker Gonzalo Higuain is confident his side can
              beat Liverpool in their Champions League last 16 first-leg at the
              Santiago Bernabeu and establish a lead to take with them to Anfield.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The nine-times winners of the trophy meet the five-times champions in
              the Spanish capital, with the home side in scintillating form having
              demolished Real Betis 6-1 on Saturday evening with all the goals - the
              first bagged by Higuain - scored in the opening 45-minutes.<br> <br> "Now, after this win, we have to focus on the next game," he said. "Now
              it's the Champions League and we have to continue like this.<br> <br> "We have to remain strong mentally because there are some very
              important games coming up, the first of which is against Liverpool.
              Wednesday's game is another 'final'. It's going to be a very tough game
              against a very accomplished team who do very well in these sorts of
              ties.<br> <br> "But Madrid are Madrid and this is always a bonus for us. We are going
              to work as hard as we can and we hope to pick up a positive result to
              take into the second leg.<br> <br> "Fans need to come and support us. We're going to give everything on
              the pitch and I'm sure that we are going to give them a victory against
              Liverpool."</p>

              <p><strong>Real Madrid manager Juande Ramos has set his team the target of securing a "decisive" three-goal advantage in the first-leg of their Champions League tie with Liverpool.</strong> </p>
              <p>Unperturbed by Liverpool's reputation for boasting one of the most formidable defensive units in Europe, the former Tottenham coach has predicted that winger Arjen Robben will be the key to unlocking Rafa Benitez's side. </p>
              <p>"Arjen has been spectacular since I arrived. He is different to the rest and has those very rare qualities of speed and an ability to get past defenders," declared Ramos. </p>
              <p>"I am looking for a three-goal advantage because that could be decisive and would make going to Anfield that much easier." </p>
              <p>Ramos also downplayed the news that Steven Gerrard had been named in the Liverpool squad for the tie despite not featuring for the past three weeks, claiming that he always expected the midfielder to feature. </p>
              <p>"Ever since the injury happened and they gave him a three-week recovery period I interpreted it as a strategy. At no point did I think he might not play," he said.</p>

              <p>i think i would be 1-1 or even pool losing 1-0 but once back at anfield the scousers will score a goal if it's 1-1 or a miracle comeback if it's 1-0</p>
              <p>you can count on stevie g to score that goal</p>

              <p>Real just bang 6 goals in against Real Betis 3 days ago only so I guess their confidence are high now... Add that less than 2 weeks ago, Barce were leading 12 points in the league and now its been reduce to 7 only... Now they suddenly stand a chance in the league too after being written off earlier... Guess Ramos has done some good work since he took over... Pool has to watch out and try their best to shut Real out...</p>
              <p>But I am really still thinking hard which match to watch tonight... Real v Pool or the Chelsea v Juve one...</p>
              <p>Real v Pool looks a good match but Claudio Ranieri return also quite interesting to follow... <img title="Mr. Green" src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green">  </p>

              <p>once again, liverpool proved to be a different team in the champions league. how it was devoid of ideas when playing man city just a few days ago and yet be able to put such a disciplined display at the bernabeu no less is something that will continue to baffle football fans.</p>
              <p>as i was watching the game earlier today, i was happy if we can return to anfield with a draw, so yossi's winner is unexpected. to be fair, real madrid looked out of sorts here, also wierd given their outstanding track record of straight wins in their last games. </p>
              <p>rafa once again showed what a shrewd tactician he is. with the rumors that is circulating surrounding his future, i hope it is untrue and that he commits himself to liverpool for the long haul. my fear is if he leaves, real madrid could be the beneficiary.</p>
              <p>and to a certain individual here who claims to be a liverpool fan but continue to disparage and diss the team, my only request is you come out of the closet first before you spew you shit again. confess that you are a man-u-or-whatever-team-you-support/gay/dickhead first and then you have a free reign to write nonsense about liverpool. it is one thing having constructive criticism on the team one support but quite another to have a free reign of shitting all over the place in one's own house. you are a disgrace to liverpool if you are a fan.</p>
              <p>nothing is worse than having a member in your own family washing your dirty linen in public when family members should rally together in trying times. if the country is at war, you will be the first to rat on your own country and be a traitor.</p>
              <p>i hope you are not singaporean. </p>

              <p>I thought Liverpool were very organize... I didn't think they had much creative ideas to their game but were only very fit like most EPL clubs...</p>
              <p>I personally am quite surprise with the fitness level of some European top clubs having watched this two days matches... Real were not up to the mark where fitness was concern... Liverpool's goal, not surprisingly came from a set piece... And a department that was all along suspected to be Real's weak spot, their defence. Especially their 2 short and 1 old centre-back...</p>
              <p>Over the whole match, I felt only Robben was a danger to Pool... Whenever he gets the ball, Real seem to be creating something... He came very close to scoring too... The only problem is, Real only have one player that can create trouble therefore it wasn't enough... Cos when the ball reach Robben, 2 or 3 players will be closing in on him fast...</p>
              <p>Liverpool may get pass Real after the return leg, I honestly felt they have a very good chance to do so when the draw was made... And I think the only clubs that can stop Pool are those in the EPL and Barce only... Cos other European clubs are not used to their all running and close you down style which is not very attractive to watch, (I thought Chelsea played much more attractive football last night) but effective for them I guess. Anyway a good result to them and glad Real will be out soon... lol</p>
