              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>What was your football highlight of 2009? Being a Leicester City fan, nothing 
              could top promotion back to the Championship for me but elsewhere we had 12 
              months of tears and laughter, cheating, rants and the world's first £80million 
              player.</strong></p>
              <p>It's a time to look back and reflect on the best and worst of what has 
              happened. Stars like Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Didier Drogba and Fernando 
              Torres have graced 2009 but my player of the year is Wayne Rooney, who has grown 
              from world-class talent to the talismanic leader of <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html">Manchester 
              United</a> and England.</p>
              <p>United were always going to be weakened by Ronaldo going to Real Madrid but 
              the way Rooney has thrived on the extra responsibility has been stunning. He has 
              to be the chief goalscorer and shirt-seller at Old Trafford now. And so far he 
              hasn't put a foot wrong. </p>
              <p>It struck me how special he is when I went to Stamford Bridge earlier this 
              season to see <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html">Chelsea </a>play 
              United. There were outstanding players on both teams but even in that company 
              Rooney stood head and shoulders above the rest.</p>
              <p>Besides winning a third Premier League title in a row, he scored 29 times for 
              club and country in 2009, a great record for a player who offers more than just 
              goals.</p>
              <p>If he delivers at the World Cup, we'll be talking about him as the greatest 
              English player of all-time alongside Tom Finney and Bobby Charlton.</p>
              <p>Talking of England, Fabio Capello gets my vote as manager of the year, for 
              getting to the World Cup without any palpitations and putting us in a position 
              where we could win it. That is a huge turnaround for a team that didn't qualify 
              for Euro 2008.</p>
              <p>Capello has brought discipline to the set-up and given the players 
              confidence. It might be a surprise that Premier League stars can lack 
              self-belief but that was the case with England pre-Capello.</p>
              <p>The highlight was the 5-1 win against Croatia in September. Significantly, 
              Steve Gerrard and Frank Lampard scored twice each - at one stage people didn't 
              think they could play in the same team.</p>
              <p>The year was mind-boggling for the money spent on transfers. <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html">Manchester 
              City </a>spent £135m, Real Madrid beat that on just two players, Ronaldo and 
              Kaka.</p>
              <p>The best business was done in January, however, when <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html">Tottenham </a>paid £15m to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/portsmouth.html">Portsmouth </a>for Jermain Defoe. Always a good striker, Defoe has become lethal in the 
              last 12 months, improving tremendously in his penalty box awareness. The buy of 
              the year in my view. He's worked with former <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html">Arsenal </a>and 
              England striker Ian Wright and that shows he is prepared to listen and learn.</p>
              <p>Defoe is at the stage now where I would love to see him play with Wayne as 
              the No 1 strike partnership for England. My instinct says that they would be 
              brilliant together. Over to you, Fabio.</p>
              <p>Alberto Aquilani cost more than Defoe - but you wouldn't have realised it 
              from his appearances this season. At a reported £20m, he's got to be the worst 
              buy. He was meant to replace Alonso but spent the first three months injured and 
              hasn't been pushed into the team by Rafa Benitez now that he is fit. It suggests 
              the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html">Liverpool </a>boss is not confident about his ability to fit into the English game.</p>
              <p>Benitez came up with the best soundbite of the year. But, although funny, it 
              ended up rebounding on Liverpool. His line, 'I want to talk about facts', while 
              ranting about Sir Alex Ferguson in January was great entertainment.</p>
              <p>But the timing was strange - Liverpool were top of the table and Benitez 
              didn't have to say anything at all. The next day his side were held by Stoke and 
              never recovered the title initiative.</p>
              <p>At least Liverpool had a reasonable season, Newcastle's relegation was a huge 
              shock. The turmoil off the field finally cost them on it.</p>
              <p>Best goal of the year came last weekend by <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/wigan-athletic.html">Wigan</a>'s 
              Maynor Figueroa against <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/stoke-city.html">Stoke</a>. To 
              score from inside your own half is not easy – even Pele managed to miss from 
              there. Figueroa's shot could not have been struck more sweetly.</p>

              <p><strong>We have all the Premier League games on a Saturday coming in on a live feed 
              at the BBC. One of the biggest reactions from those of us watching in 2009 
              wasn't for a goal but for Jimmy Bullard's goal celebration against Manchester 
              City. </strong></p>
              <p>His impression of a finger-wagging Hull boss Phil Brown had everyone bursting 
              out with spontaneous laughter and applause. As Alan Shearer said later, it 
              wasn't just the best goal celebration of the year but maybe of all-time.</p>
              <p>On the negative side, Thierry Henry became the biggest villain of the year 
              when his handball sent France rather than the Republic of Ireland to the World 
              Cup. The striker has built a fantastic reputation and it was shattered in a 
              moment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/12/19/article-1237181-079F3D91000005DC-879_468x545.jpg" alt="Wayne Rooney" width="468" height="545">

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>I just wish the culture in football would have allowed the referee to ask him 
              outright if he'd handled. I am sure Henry would have been honest if put on the 
              spot and all the bitter recriminations since could have been avoided. </strong></p>
              <p>Most sadly of all, we lost one of my greatest role models and inspirations in 
              football this year when Sir Bobby Robson died in July after a long battle 
              against cancer. </p>
              <p>It was so fitting that his funeral service in Durham turned into the greatest 
              football gathering of the year, where I was able to catch up with former Italia 
              90 team-mates Peter Beardsley and Paul Gascoigne and two of my former team-mates 
              from Barcelona, Jose Alexanco and Txiki Begiristain.</p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Bobby's passing 
              meant 2009 was a bittersweet year for football. Rooney could make 2010 really 
              special. </span></p>

              <p>Flop in his first year... Paid $20m which is like a club record for Pool and all they got out of it was nothing to shout about... Perhaps he might be a success later on but in his first year or so far... It seems like $20m thrown away. They could have left him in Italy first then bid for him next season or even this Jan... The money wasted on him could have brought in more able bodies during this difficult period when Alonso just left... Buying someone who cannot play to replace Alonso is like not replacing Alonso at all it seems... </p>
              <p>And I must say, having watched Aquilani played so far... He is no Alonso or even Modric level yet... Perhaps he need a lot more time to fit into the fast premier league style... Something which Pool can ill afford at this time...</p>

              <p>I'd be more concern with the depth of the squad though. You know you're in trouble when you throw your best players (torres, gerrard) into a fixture after they just returned from their injuries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course they'd struggle against Arsenal. Is like suddenly play PS3 the whole day then suddenly do one A level 10 year series. How to score A?</p>
