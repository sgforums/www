              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Just when you thought the football season was over…</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">There may be no World Cup or European Championship to showcase the finest talent over the summer, but the stars of tomorrow take over as they contest UEFA’s European Under 21 Championships in Denmark.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The competition has increased in popularity over the years and has provided the springboard to the careers for some of the game’s finest players including Rudi Voller, Laurent Blanc, Luis Figo, Fabio Cannavaro and Petr Cech.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">If that’s not enough, England are actually capable of winning it and will be amongst the leading contenders to taste glory this time around. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Here's our definitive guide to who are they up against when the tournament begins on June 11...</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Star man<br>Christian Eriksen (Ajax)</strong><br>Arguably one of the finest players that will be on show. <br></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">A regular for Ajax already, the forward was the youngest player to feature at last summer’s World Cup and left many of the full England internationals on their backsides in a friendly earlier this year.

              <p><span><strong>Danger rating: 3/5</strong><br>The inclusion of Eriksen is a big plus for the hosts they haven’t had it all their own way with club sides.

              <p><span><strong>Best performance</strong><br>After qualifying for the 2002 competition, Switzerland were chosen to host the tournament but despite progressing through a difficult group containing Italy, Portugal and England, were knocked out by France in the semi-finals.<br></span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span><strong>Manager<br>Pierluigi Tami</strong><br>In charge since July 2009, Tami has been on the coaching staff of the full Swiss team under the reign of experienced Ottmar Hitzfeld. He doesn’t ask much of his young players only that they play ‘bravely in attack and compact in defence. I ask of my players that they are capable of adapting to variable systems. I want to see 11 people working in attack as well as defence.’ Tough customer.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Star man<br>Xherdan Shaqiri (Basel)</strong><br>Has twice run England’s full team ragged in the Euro 2012 qualifiers and will be the creative spark in Switzerland’s midfield. The boy looks good enough to hold down a spot in the full national side so look out for some left-foot wonder whacks from the Basel hot-shot.  <br></span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Danger rating: 2/5</strong><br>The future looks bright for Swiss football and Tami is aiming at least for a semi-final spot to secure a place at next summer’s Olympics. Six of the squad have appeared for the full national team and that will provide some valuable experience.</span></p>

              <p><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Danger rating: 4/5</span><br>Pearce will be gutted to be without star players Andy Carroll and Jack Wilshere but there is enough talent in the squad to still give England a realistic chance of winning the tournament. With much of the full national side being criticised, this is an opportunity for players to put forward their case for a call-up to Fabio Capello’s squad.</span></p>
