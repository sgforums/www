              <p><strong>Now that David Villa has clearly stated that he is no longer reluctant to move abroad, one can expect the wheels to go into motion at a number of clubs. Valencia’s economic woes are well documented, as is the fact that — barring an unexpected white knight investor — Villa or David Silva or, possibly, both, will be made available for sale. And, simply put, it is hard to find a better striker on the market now than Villa.</strong></p>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Statistically, the Spaniard is already in a league of his own among forwards in top European leagues. It’s not just that he has scored 182 goals in 336 league appearances. It’s the fact that he has recorded at least 15 goals in a season every year since breaking into the first team at Sporting Gijón at the age of 19. Given that his total for this season already stands at 12 (in 14 games) it appears certain that his streak will continue, extending to an incredible nine consecutive years. To put such a feat in context, consider that no other striker in a top European league has achieved that more than six times in the past eight seasons (and that even a consummate goalscorer such as Alan Shearer managed it only nine times in his career).</p>
              <p>What is more, Villa has proven to be extremely durable, appearing in more than 90 per cent of Valencia’s games in that period. For a diminutive, pacy striker like him, that, too, is a remarkable feat.</p>
              <p>His international record speaks for itself. With 35 goals in 54 games for Spain, he is second in their list of all-time scorers (despite having made his debut only four years ago).</p>
              <p>Equally attractive to prospective buyers is his versatility. He has been successful as a lone centre forward, a shadow striker and even out wide in a 4-3-3. Villa turned 28 this month, which suggests he has at least another five solid seasons to come. Still, at about £30 million to £35 million he won’t come cheap (at least relative to his age). Yet for some clubs — and some managers — the price of failing to reach their seasonal objectives might be that much higher.</p>

              <p>i do..but however i think they tend to use the term pacy on too many people nowadays.. sometimes its because their off the ball movement is so good that they seem to be fast..</p>
              <p>but why i dont consider him to be pacey is because when compared to the likes of ronaldo, rooney, torres, messi, henry, walcott he just dont fit the bill imo.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>in my opinion i think that fatty ronaldo has all it takes to be the best striker, the only player in the world that plays for rm, barce, inter and ac milan. villa manage to get that record because he seldom get injured. you guys should take a look at fatty ronaldo video on youtube as well as the amount of goals he scored during his career. totally amazing</div>

              <p><br>As you have said, almost. But compare them to Real and Barce, they are really no where near or big enough or in the same league as Barce and Real...</p>
              <p>The La Liga's representation for Europe always had Barce and Real in there and some extras to make up the numbers... Clubs like <span style="color: #000000;">Sevilla</span>, <span style="color: #000000;">Deportivo La Coruna</span>, <span style="color: #000000;">Villarreal</span>, <span style="color: #000000;">Atletico Madrid... and of course Valencia too taking turns to make up the numbers... Even <span style="color: #000000;">Athletic Bilbao have won more league titles than them but are they also consider a big club now?</span></span></p>
              <p>If we are talking about only a short period of time, then Nottingham Forest also can qualify as a 'big club' as they were once king of Europe too... Then how about Blackburn? They have won the premier league but Liverpool have not, but which is the bigger club? It's quite obvious isn't it?</p>
              <p>But I agree with you lah since you mentioned that time... Maybe for a short period of time but still they never reach the height of Real and Barce though... </p>
