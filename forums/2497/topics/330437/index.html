              <p class="first"><strong>Liverpool fans are planning to protest against owners Tom Hicks and
              George Gillett ahead of Saturday's visit of rivals Manchester United at
              Anfield.</strong></p>
              <p>The Spirit of Shankly group has organised a march from Lower Breck Road from 11am up to the stadium.</p>
              <p>The organisation says it wants to direct its anger "towards those ruining our football club".</p>
              <p>Plans for a new stadium were delayed last month amid reports that the owners were struggling to raise funds.
              </p>
              <p>The match could be an uncomfortable one for Gillett, who is expected to take his place in the directors' box.</p>
              <p>Hicks and Gillett have become increasingly unpopular among Reds fans
              since they took the club over in March last year, drawing criticism for
              their treatment of manager Rafael Benitez and their financial
              management of the club.</p>
              <p>Since taking charge, Liverpool's proposed new stadium has had
              two re-designs and the loans the men took out to purchase the club have
              had to be refinanced.</p>
              <p>In addition, there has been continued speculation that Dubai
              International Capital, who tried to buy Liverpool before Gillett and
              Hicks took control, remain interested in buying out either one or both
              of them.</p>
              <p>Within months of their arrival, Gillett and Hicks had a very public
              spat with Benitez over the Spaniard's transfer policy and at the start
              of 2008, Hicks revealed he had spoken to former Germany manager Jurgen
              Klinsmann in November about the possibility of taking over at Anfield.</p>
              <p>In March this year, Gillett said his relationship with Hicks had
              become "unworkable", although in June he said that communication
              between the pair had "substantially improved".</p>
              <p>Tensions between Benitez and the board resurfaced this summer
              with the manager criticising the failure to secure midfielder Gareth
              Barry from Aston Villa.</p>
              <p>And a Spirit of Shankly statement added: "What we need on
              Saturday is two resounding victories. Firstly, a march on a massive
              scale that tells the world that Liverpool has had enough of Gillett and
              Hicks.</p>
              <p>"A march of passion, a march of anger, a march of Red
              solidarity that roars its message loud and proud: 'enough is enough, go
              now.'</p>
              <p>"This is the biggest club game in football and the world will
              be watching. Our second victory on Saturday comes when we take all that
              passion and pride inside the ground."</p>
              <p>Saturday's planned protest coincides with the demonstration
              expected at St James' Park, with Newcastle fans angry at the ownership
              of Mike Ashley and the departure of manager Kevin Keegan.</p>
