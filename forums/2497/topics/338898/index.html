              <h1>Chelsea Blew Deal With Real Madrid - Robinho</h1>
              <h2>Chelsea lost out on Robinho by jumping the gun and upsetting Real Madrid, claims the player, who sees Manchester City becoming as big as rivals United over the next few years, with himself very much part of the project.</h2>

              <p><em>Robinho: claims Chelsea upset Real Madrid.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Ahead of this weekend's Mancunian derby, Manchester City superstar Robinho has said the sky is the limit for the ambitious Citizens. He also revealed that it was Chelsea's fault that his proposed August transfer from Real Madrid to Stamford Bridge collapsed.</strong><br><br>The Brazilian, who has made such an impact at Eastlands - where Manchester United will be City's opposition on Sunday - claims that Chelsea messed up his potential transfer from the Bernabeu in the summer transfer window.<br><br>Robinho had been widely expected to sign for Roman Abramovich's west London outfit, but at the last minute Real Madrid instead sold him to Manchester City for a British record fee of £32 million in a deadline-day deal that stunned the football world.<br><br>The forward now claims that Chelsea undermined the move themseves by putting a picture of a shirt bearing his name on their website before the deal was completed.<br><br>"It was Chelsea's own fault," he was quoted as saying by <em>ITV</em>.<br><br>"Everything would probably have been okay, but Chelsea put that picture of me on their website and Madrid were upset about that. "They didn't want to sell to Chelsea because they are in the Champions League and, with me, they would have been even stronger."<br><br>But that is in the past and Robinho is relishing being a City star in the present. Now, he sees no reason why the Citizens can't become as powerful as their illustrious neighbours United.<br><br>"In football, nothing is impossible," he said. "Manchester City might be classed as a small club but, in two or three years' time, who knows?<br><br>"Three or four years ago Chelsea were considered a small club, but now they are a big club. Anything can happen. "The project here is very ambitious and Manchester City will grow very quickly over the next few years."<br><br>And he pledged his own future to City, saying: "The only thing in my mind is to stay here for many years. Next year we will try our best to reach the Champions League."</p>

              <p>I believe they actually won't mind selling to Chelsea cos at that point in time, Chelsea was the only club interested or able to afford Robinho and he wanted to leave Real too... Discussion between Kenyon and Real were probably favourable during the earlier stages enough for Kenyon to say <span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea will sign Robinho in the next 48 hours 3, 4 days before the window closed...</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>And not too long from this comments, their web site started taking orders for Robinho's shirts... They probably were confident enough to get him as there were no other competitors for his signature... But the sudden arrival of the rich owners at City changed all that...</p>
