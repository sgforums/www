            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>April 29  - Brief reports of matches played in the Primera Liga on Sunday.</strong></span><br><br><strong>ATHLETIC BILBAO 1 REAL MADRID 4</strong><br>Bilbao took the game to Real but the visitors showed greater precision in front of goal. Defender Sergio Ramos headed in David Beckham's freekick after 14 minutes and Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy scored with another header in the 34th. Van Nistelrooy volleyed his 18th of the season early in the second half after Bilbao failed to clear a corner to make it 3-0 before the home side pulled one back from a Fernando Llorente header in the 80th minute. Real substitute Guti broke clear on a swift counter-attack in the 84th minute to complete the rout.<br><br><strong>BARCELONA 1 LEVANTE 0</strong><br>Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o bundled in a loose ball in the 28th minute after Lionel Messi's run and low cross forced the visiting goalkeeper Jose Molina into a save in a crowded area. Barca improved after the break but Molina's saves and poor finishing led to a nerve-jangling finish as Levante almost snatched an equaliser at the end.<br><br><strong>CELTA VIGO 0 REAL MALLORCA 3</strong><br>After recording a win in his first home game in charge of Celta, coach Hristo Stoichkov watched the side put in the type of performance that saw off his predecessor, in his second. Mallorca's Venezuelan forward Juan Arango curled in the opener from the edge of the area in the 10th minute, and in the 22nd Fernando Varela scored from a similar range. Argentine striker Maxi Lopez added the third on the break in the 79th.<br><br><strong>GETAFE 1 REAL SOCIEDAD 0</strong><br>Consecutive wins had boosted Sociedad's bid to avoid relegation but a powerful header from Getafe defender Alexis, from a 71st-minute corner, denied them a third.<br><br><strong>GIMNASTIC 0 VILLARREAL 3</strong><br>Villarreal's Uruguayan striker Diego Forlan fired in from a tight angle from Cani's pass in the 18th minute and added a second 11 minutes from time running clear on to Matias Fernandez's pass. The Argentine-born Chilean midfielder Fernandez conjured his own, rounding the keeper to score at the end.<br><br><strong>OSASUNA 2 REAL ZARAGOZA 2</strong><br>UEFA Cup semi-finalists Osasuna went ahead when Juanlu crashed in a volley in the fifth minute but Zaragoza levelled in the 12th as Argentine Pablo Aimar's free kick went through the wall and in off the post. Valdo restored the home side's lead in the 55th with a low shot but in the final minute Sergio Garcia rose to head in at the far post from another free kick.<br><br><strong>RACING SANTANDER 0 DEPORTIVO CORUNA 0</strong><br>A goalless north coast derby did little for either team's aspirations of achieving a place in Europe next season.<br><br><strong>SEVILLA 3 ESPANYOL 1</strong><br>Sevilla laid siege to their fellow UEFA Cup semi-finalists' goal but were unable to open the scoring until the 51st minute when midfielder Antonio Puerta put away a loose ball. Two minutes later Uruguayan striker Ernesto Chevanton's persistence earned him the second. Espanyol pulled one back through striker Ferran Corominas on a break in the 60th. Midfielder Jose Luis Marti collected a throw in and turned to lash a low shot into the far corner in the 74th to settle the game.<br><br><strong>Played Saturday:<br><br>ATLETICO MADRID 0 REAL BETIS 0</strong><br>Atletico dominated possession but laboured to create clear chances until Bulgaria winger Martin Petrov blazed over near the end. Struggling Betis collected their 14th draw of the season as they made it seven games without a win.<br><br><strong>VALENCIA 2 RECREATIVO HUELVA 0</strong><br>Recre made life difficult for Valencia with their quick breaks in the first half but were undone in the 60th minute when David Villa broke the offside trap to set up winger Joaquin for the opening goal. Three minutes later, David Silva crossed for Joaquin to volley the second at the far post.<br></div>

Depor levelled when Uruguayan striker Sebastian Taborda was sent on as a substitute at a free kick in the 69th and diverted Joan Capdevila's header into the net. But Silva delivered the win for Valencia, finishing off a swift break five minutes later.<br><br><strong>REAL SOCIEDAD 0 BARCELONA 2</strong><br>Barca's poor away form haunted them against the relegation strugglers until Brazilian forward Ronaldinho sent Andres Iniesta through the offside trap to score in the 47th. Home keeper Claudio Bravo denied Barca a second until two minutes from time when Ronaldinho picked out Samuel Eto'o with a long pass for the Cameroon striker to settle the points.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Played on Sunday:<br><br>ESPANYOL 2 ATLETICO MADRID 1</strong><br>UEFA Cup finalists Espanyol followed up their midweek win over Werder Bremen with another sprightly display against a ragged-looking Atletico. Moroccan midfielder Moha put the home side ahead with a well taken volley and Uruguayan striker Walter Pandiani made it 2-0 in the second half when he poked in after Atletico keeper Ivan Cuellar had served the ball up on a plate with a poor save. Midfielder Martin Petrov pulled one back for Atletico at the death, but it came too late to affect the result.<br><br><strong>LEVANTE 2 GIMNASTIC 0</strong><br>An important win for Levante that lifted the Valencia-based side three points clear of the relegation zone and left Gimnastic a step closer to the second division. Centre-back Cesar Navas headed into his own net after Riga had hoofed a hopeful ball up into the area and the Levante striker made it 2-0 before halftime when he hooked in after pouncing on a loose ball in the area. -<br><br><strong>REAL BETIS 0 GETAFE 2</strong><br>Bernd Schuster's Getafe joined the hunt for a place in Europe thanks to their first away win since January. Striker Daniel Guiza turned in at the near post for the first and talented midfielder Francisco Casquero made sure of the win with a classy second, leaving keeper Pedro Contreras stranded with a great lob from just outside the area.<br><br><strong>REAL MADRID 3 SEVILLA 2</strong><br>Substitute Guti produced an inspired performance to steer Real to an enthralling comeback win in a high-tension match at the Bernabeu. Sevilla took the lead thanks to a wonderful dipping volley from Italian midfielder Enzo Maresca four minutes before the break but Fabio Capello's decision to send on Guti on the hour turned the match. The midfielder produced superb passes to set up all three of his side's goals, two for Ruud van Nistelrooy and one for Robinho. Sevilla Substitute Ernesto Chevanton cracked home a free kick deep into injury time but it came too late to change the result.<br><br><strong>REAL MALLORCA 3 OSASUNA 1</strong><br>Osasuna looked to be suffering from a UEFA Cup hangover following their semi-final defeat against Sevilla in midweek. Midfielder Fernando Varela put the islanders in front when he cracked in from nearly 30 metres out, although Osasuna levelled on the hour through Raul Garcia. Argentine midfielder Jonas Gutierrez restored Mallorca's lead with a fine solo effort and Serbian striker Bosko Jankovic guaranteed his side the points when he smashed home on the rebound after his first shot had ricocheted off both posts.<br><br><strong>REAL ZARAGOZA 0 RACING SANTANDER 0</strong><br>A setback for Zaragoza's Champions League ambitions as they were held by a well drilled Racing who remain in the hunt for a UEFA Cup place. Outplayed in the first half, Zaragoza stepped up a gear in the second but failed to take advantage of a string of scoring opportunities in the closing minutes.<br><br><strong>RECREATIVO HUELVA 0 ATHLETIC BILBAO 0</strong><br>A result that will have done little to satisfy either side, Recreativo missing the chance to consolidate their bid for a UEFA Cup place and Athletic spurning an opportunity to pull clear of the danger zone. Athletic had to play the final 20 minutes with 10 men after defender Fernando Amorebieta was somewhat harshly sent off after a straight red for a midfield trip on the lively Ikechukwu Uche.<br><br><strong>VILLARREAL 1 CELTA VIGO 0</strong><br>A third defeat in a row for Hristo Stoichkov's relegation-threatened Celta side who are now three points adrift of safety. Substitute Guillermo Franco scored the winner three minutes after stepping on to the pitch when he was given a free header from a corner midway through the second half.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Real take control in Spain after Barca draw</span><br><br>Barcelona completed a wretched week when they surrendered the leadership of the Primera Liga to arch-rivals Real Madrid after they were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Real Betis on Sunday. Barca, who saw their double dreams go up in smoke when they were given a 4-0 mauling by Bernd Schuster's Getafe in the King's Cup in midweek, looked to be heading for a nervous win after Ronaldinho gave them an early lead from the penalty spot. But Betis dashed their hopes of returning to the top of the table when Brazilian striker Rafael Sobis took advantage of some shaky defending to drill home at the near post two minutes from time.</strong><br><br>The result means that with four games left to play Real and Barca are level on 66 points but the nine-times European champions top the standings by virtue of their better head-to-head record. It is the first time that Real have ended a round of matches at the top of the table since October 2005. "There are still games left to play and we can't drop our heads now," said Barca coach Frank Rijkaard. "It is a shame we didn't win but we have to retain our pride. The league isn't decided yet."<br><br>Real went top on Saturday after staging a dramatic fightback to come from 3-1 down to snatch a 4-3 win at home to Espanyol thanks to a last-gasp strike from Argentine forward Gonzalo Higuain. Sevilla are in third, just two points behind the leaders, after they warmed up for Wednesday's all-Spanish UEFA Cup final against Espanyol with a 2-1 win over Recreativo Huelva on Saturday.<br><br>Valencia tightened their grip on fourth spot, and are now only four points behind the leaders, after a classy 2-0 win at home to Real Zaragoza, the goals coming from defender Emiliano Moretti and talented forward David Silva.<br><br><strong>RONALDINHO PENALTY</strong><br><br>Barca looked as though they might be able to put their humiliating Cup defeat behind them when they were awarded a penalty after Betis defender Melli brought down Deco as he burst into the area in the fifth minute. Ronaldinho smashed the spot kick high into the net to take his tally for the season to 18 goals. Barca dominated thereafter but despite spectacular efforts from Samuel Eto'o and Andres Iniesta they were unable to extend their lead. Rijkaard opted to try to safeguard the result by replacing Ronaldinho and Lionel Messi after the break but his side never looked comfortable in defence and keeper Victor Valdes had to produce several saves to stop Betis from equalising.<br><br>Two minutes from time Betis midfielder Marcos Assuncao released Sobis into a gap on the right and the striker beat keeper Victor Valdes at the near post with a powerful low shot to the dismay of the Nou Camp faithful. Earlier basement side Gimnastic Tarragona were left with one foot in the second division after a 3-1 defeat at home to fellow strugglers Real Sociedad.<br><br>Defeat means that the Catalans are now 10 points adrift of safety with four games left to play. Celta Vigo also suffered a major blow to their chances of avoiding the drop when they slumped to a 2-1 defeat at home to Levante in another relegation struggle, their fourth defeat in a row under new coach Hristo Stoichkov.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkred;">Brief reports of matches played in the Primera Liga this weekend:</span><br><br>ATHLETIC BILBAO 1 DEPORTIVO CORUNA 1</strong><br>A valuable point that left Athletic four points clear of the drop zone. Defender Ander Murillo put Athletic in front when he headed in from a corner in the second half, although Depor striker Riki cancelled out the lead five minutes later when he blasted home a long-range free kick. Depor's Joan Capdevila and Athletic's Josu Sarriegi were both sent off late in the game.<br><br><strong>BARCELONA 1 REAL BETIS 1</strong><br>Barca ended a miserable week that saw them crash out of the Cup with a home draw that could end up costing them the title. They got off to what appeared to be a perfect start when Ronaldinho smashed in from the penalty spot in the fifth minute after Deco had been brought down when he burst into the area. But they failed to finish the job and paid the price when Betis striker Rafael Sobis took advantage of some shaky defending to fire home at the near post two minutes from time.<br><br><strong>CELTA VIGO 1 LEVANTE 2</strong><br>Levante moved six points clear of the drop zone after inflicting a fourth defeat in a row on Hristo Stoichkov's troubled Celta. Argentine Gustavo Reggi put Levante ahead thanks to a highly controversial penalty late in the first half and fellow striker Riga made it 2-0 when he lashed in from the edge of the area. Celta striker Fernando Baiano pulled one back in the 62nd minute but his effort was to no avail.<br><br><strong>GETAFE 1 ATLETICO MADRID 4</strong><br>Getafe were brought back down to earth after their stunning 4-0 Cup victory over Barcelona in midweek as they slipped to their second defeat at home this season. A classy double from leading striker Fernando Torres, a long-range strike from Portugal midfielder Maniche and a late penalty from Luciano Galletti earned Atletico Madrid an emphatic win that put them a step closer to Europe. Former Atletico midfielder Manu del Moral scored for Getafe.<br><br><strong>GIMNASTIC 1 REAL SOCIEDAD 3</strong><br>A result that left Gimnastic on the brink of relegation but kept alive Sociedad's hopes of staying in the top flight. Sociedad went 2-0 up on 25 minutes thanks to a header from Gaizka Garitano and a fine strike from fellow midfielder Savio. Former Real Madrid striker Javier Portillo pulled one back with a 35-metre stunner from wide on the left on the half hour, but defender Ion Ansotegi killed the game off with a well taken close range volley midway through the second half.<br><br><strong>OSASUNA 1 VILLARREAL 4</strong><br>Diego Forlan was the star of the show as he hit a second-half hat-trick to lead Villarreal to a fourth win in a row against a sorry-looking Osasuna who stretched their winless run to seven games. French midfielder Robert Pires set Villarreal on the way in the seventh minute only to see Valdo square the game soon after when he tapped in from two metres out. But Forlan turned on the style in the second half to finish off the Navarrans. The Uruguayan whipped his first goal into the far corner on 64 minutes, outpaced keeper Ricardo for his second and completed his hat-trick with a breakaway goal in injury time.<br><br><strong>RACING SANTANDER 0 REAL MALLORCA 2</strong><br>Racing got off to a bad start when influential forward Pedro Munitis was sent off for hitting out at Sergio Ballesteros in the 21st minute. The held on until the break but paid the price when Mallorca struck twice early in the second half, Fernando Navarro heading in from close range and Venezuelan international Juan Arango tucking the ball home after a great assist from Ariel Ibagaza.<br><br><strong>VALENCIA 2 REAL ZARAGOZA 0</strong><br>An important win that went a long way to ensuring Valencia a place in next season's Champions League. Defender Emiliano Moretti put the home side in front when he swept in from close range after connecting with a miscued shot from David Silva on 20 minutes Leading striker David Villa missed a penalty soon after, but Silva made it 2-0 when he put the finishing touch to a wonderful passing move on the stroke of halftime.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Real Madrid held on to the leadership of the Primera Liga by the skin of their teeth after a last-gasp 3-2 win over Recreativo Huelva on Sunday. Real looked as though they might lose top spot after Recre fought back from 2-0 down to level at 2-2 with five minutes to go, but Brazilian fullback Roberto Carlos snatched a vital win when he dinked home in injury time.</strong><br><br>Barcelona, who relinquished top spot after last weekend's 1-1 draw at home to Real Betis, bounced back with a 6-0 destruction of Atletico Madrid, to inflict a heaviest ever home league defeat on the rojiblancos. With three games left to play, Real are level on 69 points with Barcelona, but they lead the standing thanks to their better head-to-head record. Both teams are now assured of a place in the Champions League qualifiers next season.<br><br>UEFA Cup winners Sevilla are just two points further back, staying in the hunt for the title with a 2-1 comeback win at Deportivo Coruna. Valencia are in fourth on 65, just four behind the leaders after their 1-0 win away to Real Mallorca on Saturday.<br><br>Real knew they had to deliver the goods after Sevilla's win at Deportivo and they made a perfect start when the unmarked Robinho headed in from six metres after David Beckham whipped in a fine curling cross from the right in the ninth minute. Real extended their lead eight minutes into the second half when Ruud van Nistelrooy took his tally for the season to 22 with a penalty given after Recre keeper Bertrand Laquait brought down Robinho as the Brazilian raced towards the byline.<br><br>Recre pulled one back when Jesus Vazquez converted a penalty after substitute Ikechukwu Uche was felled by Sergio Ramos and Real began to look a little nervous. Uche, who ran the Real defence ragged in the final quarter, made it 2-2 when he fired in from a corner, but Real, who had snatched last-gasp wins over Espanyol and Sevilla in their previous two league outings, refused to throw in the towel. With practically their last throw of the dice, Roberto Carlos clipped in past Laquait after Fernando Gago had put him in the clear with a clever turn and pass on the edge of the area.<br></div>
