            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Italian Serie A reports</span><br><br>Brief reports of Italian Serie A matches played on Sunday:</strong><br><br>CATANIA 0 CAGLIARI 1<br>Cagliari striker David Suazo put an end to Catania's unbeaten home record this season, tumbling over home defender Mauro Minelli to earn an eighth-minute penalty, which he then converted. The win put a seven-point gap between Cagliari and the Serie A relegation zone.<br>- - - -<br>EMPOLI 2 SAMPDORIA 0<br>Empoli continue to be one of the surprises of the season with a win that keeps them in the hunt for an unlikely top-four finish and a place in next season's Champions League. Luca Saudati put them ahead from the penalty spot early in the second half after Ighli Vannucchi was tripped by Luigi Sala. Davide Matteini sealed the win two minutes from the end with a goal on the break.<br>- - - -<br>INTER MILAN 3 FIORENTINA 1<br>Inter Milan appear to be cruising towards this season's title after notching up their 13th win in a row and moving 11 points clear of second-placed AS Roma. Fiorentina briefly threatened an upset when Luca Toni headed them into an early lead. But goals by Dejan Stankovic, Adriano and Zlatan Ibrahimovic sealed the win.<br>- - - -<br>LAZIO 0 AC MILAN 0<br>AC Milan's run of three Serie A wins in a row came to an end at Rome's Olympic stadium, where they were outplayed by Lazio. Goran Pandev and Stefano Mauri both missed from close range for the hosts, and Milan keeper Dida turned a shot by Tommaso Rocchi round his post just before the interval.<br>- - - -<br>LIVORNO 1 AS ROMA 1<br>Roma made a poor start, Philippe Mexes tugging needlessly on Cristiano Lucarelli's shirt to concede a penalty, which Lucarelli fired home. Francesco Totti's 74th-minute equaliser rewarded a bright second-half performance by the visitors, but his late sending-off for kicking out at Livorno defender Fabio Galante ended Roma's hopes of winning the match.<br>- - - -<br>PARMA 1 TORINO 0<br>Italy Under-21 striker Giuseppe Rossi, who arrived at Parma earlier this week on loan from Manchester United, capped a lively Serie A debut in the 75th minute, when he dribbled past two defenders and fired a left-footed shot into the bottom corner of Torino's net.<br>- - - -<br>SIENA 2 CHIEVO VERONA 1<br>Behind at halftime to a strike by Chievo midfielder Matteo Brighi, Siena turned the match around with two goals in five second-half minutes. Midfielder Luca Antonini struck first, bursting forward on the break to angle the ball past keeper Vincenzo Sicignano. Daniele Portanova got their second when he headed in from a corner.<br>- - - -<br>UDINESE 1 MESSINA 0<br>Italy striker Vincenzo Iaquinta gave Udinese a well-deserved win when he headed in from a corner 14 minutes from the end. The defeat left Messina hanging one point above the relegation zone.<br>- - - -<br>Played on Saturday:<br>ASCOLI 1 ATALANTA 3<br>Bottom-placed Ascoli seemed on course for a share of the points after Michele Paolucci cancelled out Riccardo Zampagna's opening goal for Atalanta. But two goals in the last six minutes by Brazilian defender Adriano and playmaker Cristiano Doni gave Atalanta the points to continue their challenge for Italy's fourth and final Champions League berth.<br>- - - -<br>REGGINA 0 PALERMO 0<br>Palermo's pursuit of second place in the division suffered a setback at the Granillo stadium, where relegation-threatened Reggina's effective rearguard action neutralised their attack. Cristian Zaccardo wasted the visitors best chance of winning the match in the 66th minute, when he blasted the ball over the bar from close range.<br><br><strong>Juve leads Serie B and seems a sure bet for promotion... Diego Maradona's Napoli looks like they may come back into Serie A too after all these years.</strong><br><br><img src="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p143/zococl/ItaB.jpg"></div>

"It looks like there are going to be some more problems soon and that isn't going to help."<br><br>Real have experienced a turbulent start to the year with David Beckham, Ronaldo and Antonio Cassano being ostracised by coach Fabio Capello and president Ramon Calderon having to apologise for his outspoken criticism of players.<br><br>Calderon's future as president is also in the balance as the club await the outcome of two key legal decisions that could hasten the end of his tenure. A provincial court is expected to make a ruling over the decision to suspend the count of the postal vote in last July's presidential election on Thursday, while next week a judge will decide if some or all of the embargoed ballot papers are valid.<br><br>It is widely believed that if the 10,511 postal votes are counted Calderon will be unseated as president after winning the elections by a margin of just 246. "All this talk about the postal vote affects the team," said Salgado. "This is the first thing that has to be resolved. After all, the players belong to Real Madrid not to any particular person and this will affect all of us."<br><br>Salgado also backed club captain Raul's recent criticism of the club's decision to sideline Beckham, Ronaldo and Cassano. "Above all they are Real Madrid players and they can help us win trophies," he said. "It doesn't seem like a good idea to leave three or four players out before the end of the season. It isn't good for the squad, but in the end it is down to the coach to make these decisions."<br><br>Beckham has announced he will be joining MLS side LA Galaxy at the end of the season, while Real are negotiating the sale of Ronaldo to AC Milan.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>MADRID, Jan 27 - Real Madrid slumped to their third defeat in five games when they went down 1-0 at Villarreal in the Primera Liga on Saturday.</strong><br><br>Villarreal, who had won once in their previous six outings, notched up their first ever victory against Real when 19-year-old midfielder Marcos clipped the ball home after a slick passing move midway through the second half.<br><br>Real, missing AC Milan-bound Ronaldo, David Beckham, the injured Raul and the out-of-favour Antonio Cassano, barely managed to threaten the Villarreal goal in a toothless performance at the Madrigal.<br><br>The result meant Fabio Capello's side remain in third place in the table, a point behind leaders Barcelona who host Celta Vigo on Sunday.<br><br>Atletico Madrid's hopes of keeping the pressure on the leading pack were frustrated when they were held to a 1-1 draw by Racing Santander at the Calderon earlier on Saturday. Atletico fell behind when Racing's little-and-large partnership of Pedro Munitis and Nikola Zigic manufactured a classy goal 17 minutes from time.<br><br>Despite the absence of out-of-favour playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme, who was looking on from the stands, Villarreal dominated against Real as they clipped the ball around the midfield and hit the visitors on the break.<br><br>They would have taken the lead on the half hour had it not been for some superb goalkeeping from Iker Casillas, who got a hand to a Diego Forlan shot, blocked a follow-up effort and closed down Matias Fernandez as he tried to blast the ball into the net.<br><br>But they finally broke the deadlock midway through the second half, when Marcos fired home with a first-time shot after Fernandez had slipped the ball past the Real back four.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Primera Liga reports<br><br>MADRID, Jan 28 </strong></span><br><br>Brief reports of matches played in the Primera Liga over the weekend:<br><br><strong>Played Sunday:<br>BARCELONA 3 CELTA VIGO 1</strong><br>In-form Argentine striker Javier Saviola set Barca on their way to victory with a header from Giovanni van Bronckhorst's cross in the 34th minute. But Barca eased off in the second half and Celta levelled from the penalty spot through Brazilian Nene in the 67th. Barca won a disputed penalty in the 78th which Ronaldinho put away, and substitute Ludovic Giuly scored the third on a breakaway four minutes from time. Celta finished with 10 men after defender Matias Lequi was sent off at the end. - - - -<br><strong>GETAFE 2 OSASUNA 0</strong><br>Getafe struck a psychological blow ahead of Wednesday's King's Cup quarter-final, first leg between the two sides. Striker Daniel Guiza sprinted on to Mario Cotelo's header to score after 27 minutes, and used his pace once again to double Getafe's lead when he was put clear by Angel Vivar Dorado's pass in the 45th. Osasuna, who had four players sent off last weekend, lost defender Josetxo to a red card in the 77th minute. - - - -<br><strong>GIMNASTIC 4 ESPANYOL 0</strong><br>Gimnastic's former Real Madrid striker Javier Portillo headed in from close range after eight minutes and was brought down for a penalty in the 18th. Alejandro Campano scored from the spot. A sliced clearance out of defence fell to Antonio Pinilla to score at the second attempt in the 26th and after Portillo had put a free header against the post defender Cesar Navas headed the fourth from a corner in the 43rd. Espanyol goalkeeper Carlos Kameni made a string of second-half saves to deny the league's bottom club more goals.<br>- - - -<br><strong>LEVANTE 2 SEVILLA 4</strong><br>Sevilla had not won a league game in 2007 but took the lead when winger Antonio Puerta broke down the left and crossed for Mali striker Frederic Kanoute to sidefoot home his 16th of the season. Youngster Alejandro Alfaro showed great skill to set up Russian striker Alexander Kerzhakov for his first goal for Sevilla in the 55th and forced the third when his surging run ended up with Italian Damiano Tommasi scoring in his own net from outside the area in the 66th. Levante's Frenchman Frederic Dehu scored a near-post header from a corner in the 68th and three minutes later Gustavo Reggi headed in Ian Harte's free kick but Alfaro rose to settle the game in the 76th with an unopposed header from a free kick. - - - -<br><strong>REAL BETIS 2 VALENCIA 1</strong><br>Valencia had won six league games on the trot and were given an early lead when David Villa raced on to David Silva's pass to score in the 10th minute. But Betis have been given resilience and belief by new coach Luis Fernandez and they levelled five minutes later from the boot of Brazilian striker Robert. Robert scored the winner from the penalty spot in the 68th after Capi had been fouled, deservedly dragging the side out of the relegation places.<br>- - - -<br><strong>REAL MALLORCA 2 RECREATIVO HUELVA 1</strong><br>Mallorca went ahead when defender Sergio Ballesteros scored with a thundering first-time shot in the 39th minute. Portuguese defender Jose Carlos Nunes headed the second from a corner in the 45th. Recre pulled one back when Javi Guerrero volleyed in Aitor's deep cross in the 49th. Mallorca's Ballesteros was sent off 11 minutes from time.<br>- - - -<br><strong>REAL SOCIEDAD 0 ATHLETIC BILBAO 2</strong><br>A poor punch from Sociedad goalkeeper Claudio Bravo allowed Andoni Iraola to volley the opener from the edge of the area in the 13th minute of the Basque derby. Sociedad had the chance to level when they won a penalty for handball in the 37th but Daniel Aranzubia saved Xabi Prieto's attempt.<br>Iraola settled the match with another volley from the edge of the area to leave Sociedad deep in trouble.<br>- - - -<br><strong>REAL ZARAGOZA 1 DEPORTIVO CORUNA 1</strong><br>Depor's Angel Arizmendi found space on the right and crossed for Uruguayan striker Sebastian Taborda to score with a firm header after 21 minutes. But Depor's first away win of the season eluded them when Taborda gave away a penalty and was sent off in the 79th minute. Zaragoza's Argentine striker Diego Milito scored his 13th of the campaign from the spot.<br>- - - -<br><strong>Played Saturday:<br>ATLETICO MADRID 1 RACING SANTANDER 1</strong><br>Atletico missed their chance to keep pressure on the leaders with another disappointing performance at the Calderon. Racing took the lead when Serbian striker Nikola Zigic fired home after a clever overhead pass from Pedro Munitis 17 minutes from time. Atletico equalised almost immediately, centre-back Pablo Ibanez marking his 100th appearance for the club when he skimmed a header into the net after a free kick, but the point did little to boost their hopes of a top-four finish.<br>- - - -<br><strong>VILLARREAL 1 REAL MADRID 0</strong><br>Real slumped to their third defeat in five games after midfielder Marcos clipped the ball past Iker Casillas to put to the finishing touch to a slick passing move involving Diego Forlan and Matias Fernandez midway through the second half. The 19-year-old's classy strike earned Villarreal their second victory in seven outings and their first ever league win over Real Madrid.<br></div>

He has, therefore, decided to make the short trip to El Madrigal after the Yellow Submarines offered him a three-year contract.<br><br>Ayala joined Valencia in 2000 and played a key role as the club won two Primera Liga titles and the 2004 UEFA Cup. He is expected to make his 107th appearance for Argentina against France in Paris later on Wednesday, making him his country's most-capped player.<br></div>

Ruud van Nistelrooy secured the victory with a brave header, three minutes into the second half to give Real their first points in three games.<br><br>'Beckham spares the life of his executioner,' was Marca's verdict on the midfielder's goal, saying that Capello was in debt to the former England captain after his performance. 'A gift from Beckham to Capello,' was El Pais's description of the goal, while most papers were agreed that the victory had saved the former Juventus coach from dismissal.<br><br>Capello, who said Beckham's professional attitude in training had persuaded him to reverse his decision to exclude him for the rest of the season, was delighted with his performance. 'You have to be happy when players score important goals and David's goal was very important,' the Italian told a news conference after the game. 'He played a great game and deserves the credit. 'As I said before, the mark of an intelligent person is one who knows how to rectify his mistakes.'<br><br>Van Nistelrooy also heaped praise on his former Manchester United colleague. 'Beckham has been fantastic, his attitude has been brilliant,' said the Dutchman. 'When you go for a month without playing it isn't easy to be at your best but he always trains hard and has a very positive attitude. That's why you can always bet on him. It was a great day for him.'<br></div>

Defeat left Bilbao hovering above the drop zone on goal difference. - - - -<br><br><strong>BARCELONA 2 RACING SANTANDER 0</strong><br>Ronaldinho put the recent criticisms of his form behind him when he struck twice to lead his side to a confident win that put them three points clear at the top of the table. Barca keeper Victor Valdes saved a first-half penalty from Argentine Ezequiel Garay, but Ronaldinho then took control.<br>The Brazilian opened with a magnificent free kick six minutes after halftime and took his tally for the season to 15 with a fine header. - - - -<br><br><strong>CELTA VIGO 0 ESPANYOL 2</strong><br>Celta boss Fernando Vazquez will come under heavy pressure after his side dropped into the relegation zone with this costly defeat at home to a lively Espanyol. Luis Garcia put the visitors ahead in the 20th minute, poking home after some scrappy defending and fellow striker Walter Pandiani made it 2-0 when he put the finishing touch to a slickly worked counter attack early in the second half. Celta's Romania defender Gabriel Tamas was sent off 19 minutes from time. - - - -<br><br><strong>GETAFE 3 VALENCIA 0</strong><br>Getafe knocked Valencia out of the Cup last month and Bernd Schuster's men got the better of them again with this thumping win at the Coliseo.<br>Skipper Mario Cotelo broke the deadlock when he rifled home at the near post early in the second half, leading striker Daniel Guiza made it 2-0 with his seventh of the season and midfielder Nacho completed the rout when he lashed in late on. - - - -<br><br><strong>GIMNASTIC TARRAGONA 2 OSASUNA 3</strong><br>Osasuna took an early lead through Carlos Cuellar, but basement side Gimnastic looked to be on course for a rare win when sharply taken goals from striker Javier Portillo and defender Cesar Navas put them 2-1 up on the hour. But Roberto Soldado struck twice inside four minutes to turn the tables on the home side, the former Real Madrid player opening his account with a close-range header and then stroking home after good work by Savo Milosevic. - - - -<br><br><strong>LEVANTE 2 RECREATIVO HUELVA 1</strong><br>New signing Salva Ballesta followed up his debut goal in last weekend's 1-0 win over Real Madrid with a great double.<br>He notched his first when he dinked the ball over the keeper after latching on to a long pass from midfield and made it 2-0 with a great diving header, throwing himself in front of a defender to meet a fine cross from Manolo.<br>Recreativo pulled one back when Florent Sinama-Pongolle scored from the penalty spot early in the second half, but even though Levante lost defender Frederic Dehu as a result of the incident the home side held on for the win. - - - -<br><br><strong>REAL MALLORCA 2 REAL ZARAGOZA 1</strong><br>Zaragoza striker Diego Milito put Zaragoza ahead when he bundled in an Andres D'Alessandro cross 10 minutes after the break to take his tally for the season to 14. But the islanders staged a fierce fightback, Jose Carlos Nunes equalising almost immediately when he got his foot to a free kick and Serbian forward Bosko Jankovic cracking home from the edge of the area six minutes from time. - - - -<br><br><strong>VILLARREAL 0 DEPORTIVO CORUNA 2</strong><br>Deportivo took the lead when midfielder Marcos Senna skimmed the ball past Mariano Barbosa and into his own net as he tired to head clear a Sergio free kick in the 20th minute. Young striker Joan Verdu ensured the Galicians of a second win in a row when he fired a spectacular 20-metre shot into the top corner 11 minutes from the final whistle. - - - -<br><br><strong>Played on Saturday: REAL SOCIEDAD 1 REAL MADRID 2</strong><br>David Beckham marked his Real Madrid return after a month on the sidelines by sparking their comeback win with an equaliser eight minutes before halftime. The former England captain scored his third league goal of the season when he sent a 25-metre free kick skidding under keeper Claudio Bravo to cancel out an early header from Sociedad midfielder Mikel Aranburu.<br>Former Manchester United colleague Ruud van Nistelrooy secured the win three minutes into the second half by heading in a fine cross from right back Miguel Torres. - - - -<br><br><strong>REAL BETIS 0 SEVILLA 0</strong><br>Another missed opportunity for Sevilla, who have won only one of their six league games in 2007. Improving city rivals Betis had the best chances, Brazilian striker Robert missing a 12th-minute penalty and firing straight at keeper Andres Palop after going clear late on.<br></div>

Evangelos Nastos and Gabriele Paonessa then scored for Vicenza in the 73rd and 78th minutes to level the score.<br><br>"After going two goals up, you just can't throw away two points like that," Juventus coach Didier Deschamps said. "We sat back too deep and let them attack us. "Our attitude is all wrong when we take the lead. It's like the players think the game is already in the bag. We really need to start winning away from home if we're going to open up a gap at the top of the table."<br><br>Juventus, which was demoted and docked nine points in the Italian match-fixing scandal, has 40 points and is tied for first with Napoli, which beat Piacenza 1-0. Vicenza has 22 points.<br><br>Twenty-five stadiums in Italy's top two divisions were closed on Thursday for failing to meet the safety standards. Juventus looked to be cruising to its 15th win of the season after Del Piero tucked Nedved's through-ball past Vicenza goalkeeper Adriano Zancope. But Nastos' superb diagonal shot from the edge of the area stunned the Turin powerhouse and Paonessa capitalized with a header to grab a point for the hosts.<br><br>"We played some good football right up until the second goal," Deschamps said. "But for the umpteenth time this season, we suffered a physical drop. "Credit has to go to Vicenza, they never stopped believing, but the blame lies with us," Deschamps added. "We lost our concentration and their first goal really rattled us. It's like we thought they'd already drawn level."<br><br>A minute's silence was held before kickoff for 38-year-old Filippo Raciti, the policeman killed in the riots.<br><br><img src="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p143/zococl/SerBfeb10.jpg"></div>

He lived in Acireale, in the Catania neighbourhood, with his wife and two children, aged 15 and 9.<br><br>A week before his death, Raciti gave evidence at the trial of a football hooligan, who was then freed by the local magistrate. According to one of his colleagues, the hooligan laughed in his face as he left the court.<br><br>Raciti died in Catania on February 2, 2007, after the end of the football derby between Catania and Palermo, because of liver damage caused by blunt object trauma, disproving an initial hypothesis which claimed his death was caused by a homemade firecracker.<br><br>Raciti's death, which brought all Italian football matches to be suspended for an indefinite time, caused strong emotion in Italy, with a great and somewhat uncommon amount of solidarity towards the Italian law enforcement forces, and massive coverage worldwide.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br></div>

We might as well quit right here and start again in September. "My words are clearly a provocation, but to play without fans makes no sense. "We should do as they do in Formula One - when the conditions to continue are no longer favourable, they stop and the one who is leading wins.<br><br>"What happened in Catania was very serious and no family should lose a father in such an absurd situation. "But let's not forget that in Italy nothing has been done, we always delay our reaction. "Our stadia are old and let's not talk about the state of the pitch. Like this, it's impossible to attract people to the stadia."<br><br>Mancini has also warned his players not to become complacent after they equalled Bayern Munich and Real Madrid's European record for consecutive league wins. Inter secured their 15th successive victory after beating Chievo 2-0 thanks to goals by Adriano and Hernan Crespo.<br><br>But Mancini added: "It's great, but this hasn't yet given us a title. Fantastic things are not remembered by consecutive victories but by the trophies they bring home at the end."<br></div>
