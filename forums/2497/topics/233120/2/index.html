            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Brief reports of matches played in the Primera Liga on Sunday:<br><br>BARCELONA 3 ATHLETIC BILBAO 0</strong><br>Stung by criticism following back-to-back defeats against Valencia and Liverpool, Barcelona produced their best performance in recent months as they dismantled a sorry looking Bilbao. Barca took the lead when Bilbao defender Fernando Amorebieta turned into his own net midway through the first half, midfielder Xavi made it 2-0 when he put the finishing touch to a gleaming passing move and Samuel Eto'o marked his return to the starting lineup with a cool finish before the break. - - - -<br><br><strong>CELTA VIGO 2 RACING SANTANDER 2</strong><br>Celta looked on course for a second home win of the season when a dubious penalty from Fernando Baiano and a fine header from new signing Habib Bamogo put them 2-0 up just after the half hour. But Racing pulled one back early in the second half when Pedro Munitis angled a shot into the far corner after good work from Serbian strike partner Nikola Zigic and earned themselves a point with a Cristian Alvarez penalty 11 minutes from time. - - - -<br><br><strong>GETAFE 0 SEVILLA 0</strong><br>Bernd Schuster's Getafe maintained their excellent defensive record at home this season thanks to another disciplined and determined display at the Coliseo. The Madrid-based side, who have conceded just three goals and lost only once at home this term, successfully shackled Primera Liga leading scorer Frederic Kanoute and then did the same with his replacement Ernesto Chevanton. - - - -<br><br><strong>GIMNASTIC TARRAGONA 1 VALENCIA 1</strong><br>A last-gasp header by substitute Ruben Castro denied Valencia a victory that would have jacked up the pressure on the leaders. Winger Joaquin put Valencia in front with his first goal for the club when he poked home after keeper Albano Bizzarri had parried a Fernando Morientes shot into this path just after the hour, but Gimnastic refused to cave in and finally got their reward with Castro's injury-time strike. - - - -<br><br><strong>LEVANTE 0 REAL ZARAGOZA 0</strong><br>Zaragoza missed the chance to leapfrog Atletico Madrid in the standings after they were held by an improving Levante who were reduced to 10 men when defender Inaki Descarga was sent off in injury time. - - - -<br><br><strong>OSASUNA 0 ESPANYOL 2</strong><br>Forward Ferran Corominas put in-form Espanyol in front when he fired an angled shot low into the far corner and leading striker Raul Tamudo secured a third win in a row when his deflected shot ballooned over keeper Ricardo at the near post midway through the second half. Espanyol had few problems holding on to their lead even though centre back Daniel Jarque was sent off with 14 minutes left to play. - - - -<br><br><strong>REAL BETIS 0 RECREATIVO HUELVA 0</strong><br>A third goalless draw in a row for Luis Fernandez's Betis, but they have not lost in six and are slowly but surely hoisting themselves clear of the relegation zone. Recreativo, who were on the ropes for much of the second half, will be happy with a point that keeps them in the hunt for the European places. - - - -<br><br><strong>VILLARREAL 2 REAL MALLORCA 1</strong><br>A late goal from Argentine defender Fabricio Fuentes put an end to Villarreal's three-match losing streak and condemned relegation-threatened Mallorca to a costly defeat.<br>Villarreal fell behind when Mallorca midfielder Guillermo Pereyra headed in from a corner, but Jon Dahl Tomasson levelled 12 minutes later when he steered in from close range after a great run and cut-back from Chile midfielder Matias Fernandez. - - - -<br><br><strong>Played Saturday:<br>REAL SOCIEDAD 0 DEPORTIVO CORUNA 1</strong><br>Sociedad's chances of remaining in the top flight look increasingly slim after a sixth defeat in seven games. Striker Angel Arizmendi scored the winner for Depor just before the half hour when he steered in from close range after midfielder Sergio had clipped a free kick into the area. Sociedad threw everything at Depor in the second half but did not have the firepower to breach the visitors' defence. - - - -<br><br><strong>ATLETICO MADRID 1 REAL MADRID 1</strong><br>A dominant Atletico were denied a first win in eight years over their city rivals at the Calderon when Argentine striker Gonzalo Higuain scored his first goal since joining Real from River Plate in January just after the hour. Fernando Torres had put Atletico in front with his first ever goal against Real thanks to a classy strike in the 11th minute but his side had a second controversially ruled out soon afterwards, apparently for offside. Real were kept in the game by goalkeeper Iker Casillas and the visitors managed to hang on for a point despite having centre back Fabio Cannavaro sent off six minutes from time. - - - -<br></div>

Zaragoza had a host of scoring chances before they finally broke the deadlock 13 minutes after the break, Diego Milito claiming his 19th goal of the season after fellow Argentine Andres D'Alessandro threaded an acute-angled shot in from the bye-line. Barca have won just one of their last nine away games and this latest defeat will give their rivals renewed hope of stopping them taking a third successive league title.<br><br><strong>ATHLETIC BILBAO 1 VALENCIA 0</strong><br>Igor Gabilondo boosted Athletic's hopes of avoiding the drop when he earned Athletic their first win in six with a stylish finish just before the half hour although his side were lucky to hang on for the victory. The midfielder clipped an angled back-heel past reserve keeper Ludovic Butelle after good work from Joseba Etxeberria on the right. Valencia clearly had one eye on next week's Champions League quarter-final return against Chelsea as coach Quique Sanchez Flores decided to leave a host of first-choice players on the bench at San Mames.<br></div>

Raul put Real ahead 12 minutes before the break after Garay had surrendered possession in his own area. But the Argentine atoned for his error when he drilled home after Lionel Scaloni appeared to dive in the area. Garay added another penalty in the final minute, the referee pointing to the spot when Fabio Cannavaro laid a hand on Serbian striker Nikola Zigic.

The Basque side could hardly have got off to a worse start, falling behind with three minutes on the clock when Espanyol midfielder Jonatas caught keeper Daniel Aranzubia off guard by letting fly from a metre inside the opposition half.<br><br><strong>ATLETICO MADRID 1 LEVANTE 0</strong><br>Leading striker Fernando Torres scored his 10th goal of the season with a fine second-half curler to earn Atletico a win that reignited their hopes of a Champions League place. It was a costly defeat for Levante who dropped into the relegation zone after their immediate rivals won.<br><br><strong>BARCELONA 1 REAL MALLORCA 0</strong><br>A last-gasp own goal from their former player Fernando Navarro earned a sluggish-looking Barcelona a win that helped them stretch their lead at the top. Mallorca had a great chance to take the lead on 31 minutes when they were awarded a penalty when midfielder Jonas Gutierrez was felled by keeper Victor Valdes. But the Argentine fluffed his spot kick and Barca came away with the points when Navarro turned the ball into his own net after a Javier Saviola shot had rebounded off the post.<br><br><strong>CELTA VIGO 1 DEPORTIVO CORUNA 0</strong><br>Former Bulgaria coach Hristo Stoichkov got off to a winning start as manager of Celta who claimed their first victory in seven outings and only their second at Balaidos this season. Brazilian striker Fernando Baiano ended a barren run in front of goal when he diverted a shot into the net after 61 minutes.<br><br><strong>GETAFE 3 VILLARREAL 0</strong><br>Getafe gained their first win in eight outings with a stylish victory over out-of-sorts Villarreal who welcomed back central defender Gonzalo Rodriguez after nine months injured. Francisco Casquero put Bernd Schuster's side ahead just after the half hour when he smashed an unstoppable shot high into the net from just outside the area. Daniel Guiza missed a penalty seven minutes later but fellow striker Maris Verpakovskis did make it 2-0 midway through the second half. Substitute Sergio Pachon completed the rout.<br><br><strong>GIMNASTIC 1 REAL ZARAGOZA 0</strong><br>Former Real Madrid striker Javier Portillo earned basement side Gimnastic a thoroughly deserved win over high-flying Zaragoza with a fine diving header eight minutes from time. Zaragoza were a shadow of the side that beat Barcelona 1-0 last weekend and were outplayed for much of the game.<br><br><strong>OSASUNA 1 RECREATIVO HUELVA 1</strong><br>Former Liverpool striker Florent Sinama-Pongolle put Recre in front with his 11th goal this season, finishing a superbly crafted passing move early in the second half. But UEFA Cup semi-finalists Osasuna hit back almost immediately with defender Cesar Cruchaga outjumping the defence to head home at the far post from a free kick.<br><br><strong>VALENCIA 2 SEVILLA 0</strong><br>Valencia bounced back from their Champions League exit at the hands of Chelsea with a win that put them back in the top four and dented Sevilla's title ambitions. David Villa put the home side in front midway through the first half, but keeper Santiago Canizares produced a superb save to preserve his side's lead when he turned an Enzo Maresca penalty on to the post. Villa made sure of the win when he netted from the spot early in the second half after he went down under a challenge from Sevilla defender Andreas Hinkel who was sent off.<br></div>
