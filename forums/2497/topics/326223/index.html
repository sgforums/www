              <p><strong>Scolari impressed by four-goal Anelka</strong></p>
              <p>Chelsea coach Luiz
              Felipe Scolari believes Nicolas Anelka finally showed he can be his
              lethal weapon with a four-goal rampage against AC Milan.</p>
              <p>The clinical Frenchman scored two in each half as the Blues hammered the
              Italians 5-0 in Moscow in the pre-season Railways Cup after Frank Lampard's
              early opener.</p>
              <p>'This game was important for Anelka but more important for us - the fans, the
              coach and the other players who will have more confidence in him,' Scolari said.</p>
              <p>'Today was good not because he scored four goals but because he played more
              free and with more quality than in other games.</p>
              <p>'He was playing against a big club and to get four goals against Milan, for
              his confidence it is fantastic and Anelka today and in the last game played more
              inside the penalty area than before.</p>
              <p>'That is where I asked him to play and where I need him, not right and left as
              before, because we have one striker and that is Anelka.'</p>
              <p>With Didier Drogba getting ever closer to returning to training after a knee
              injury, Scolari admits he has some tough decisions to make before meaningful
              action kicks off against Portsmouth on August 17.</p>
              <p>'Maybe I will receive good news about Drogba and we have 12 days to train and
              maybe we will have something I don't expect,' he said.</p>
              <p>'I have quality, competitive players and they fight for places on the pitch. I
              have 22 here, five at home. I have a good team.'</p>

              <h3>Ivorian will miss Portsmouth clash and maybe more</h3>
              <p class="ss-text-bold">Luiz Felipe Scolari has conceded Didier Drogba is definitely out of Chelsea's first game of the season and is unlikely to figure until the end of August.</p>
              <p>The 30-year-old has missed the club's pre-season as he recuperates from a knee injury that will prohibit his involvement at the start of the season.</p>
              <p>Chelsea kick-off their campaign against Portsmouth on 17th August and will do so short of fire-power as Nicolas Anelka is their only available recognised striker.</p>
              <p>Scolari has pencilled in the London derby against Tottenham on 31st August for a possible return but admits he will not rush the Ivory Coast star back into action.</p>
              <h4>Fitness work</h4>
              <p>"Didier will not play in our first game against Portsmouth and will probably miss the second against Wigan. If there are no more problems he should be ready for the game after that," said Scolari.</p>
              <p>"But when you have a knee injury, you just never know.</p>
              <p>"I have been getting a progress report from the doctor every day.</p>
              <p>"He's getting better and is working with a fitness coach back at the training ground. I hope he will be ready to start training next week. But he will not play until he is in good condition."</p>

              <h1>Kalac: Not All My Fault</h1>
              <h2>Goalkeeper Zeljko Kalac feels as though he is not completely to blame for Milan's terrible showing against Chelsea.</h2>
              <p>Milan's Australian goalkeeper Zeljko Kalac took the brunt of the blame
              after this past weekends comprehensive 5 – 0 loss to Chelsea, and
              though the player believes that some fault is his, he is not willing to
              assume sole responsibility for the game. <br><br>Spider, as he is
              affectionately known, has admitted to making the mistake that lead to
              the third goal saying, “I went for the ball with my left, preferring my
              right and I made a mistake. That kind of thing has never happened to
              me.”  <br><br>Kalac spread out the blame for the other four goals when
              he said, “Mistakes happen, thats football,” continuing with, “Besides
              that mistake what else could I have done, nothing.” Surely after
              letting in five goals in one game, albeit a pre-season friendly,
              Ancelotti must be feeling the heat to give Christian Abbiati the number
              one jersey this season.  <br><br>When questioned regarding his fellow
              goalkeeper at Milan Kalac said, “He is doing better then me at the
              moment, but I'm not afraid of the competition, I'm just concentrated on
              training and making saves.”  <br><br>Kalac concluded with a final
              comment, “It wouldn't be fair to judge me based solely on the game in
              Moscow.” The goalkeeper has a point - no one is infallible - but one
              cannot help but wonder many mistakes Christian Abbiati would have made
              in his place.</p>
