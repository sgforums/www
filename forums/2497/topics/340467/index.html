              <h3>GIANFRANCO ZOLA has threatened to walk out on West Ham if the club goes back on promises it made to him.</h3>
              <p>On the eve of the cash-hit Hammers’ clash at his former club Chelsea, Zola admits he has demanded assurances about his future. West Ham’s Icelandic owner Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson — still in Reykjavik following the credit crunch collapse of his business empire — wants to sell the club.</p>
              <p>And Zola warned: “I have been told the club won’t change but we will see. “And if they tell me they need to change their strategy I would have to think about my future because the scenario would have changed.”</p>
              <p>With Hammers chief executive Scott Duxbury also facing a £50million legal battle with Sheffield United over the Carlos Tevez affair, Zola is worried his best players will have to be sold.</p>
              <p>Spurs are preparing a double January bid for keeper Robert Green and England centre-half Matthew Upson, while Manchester City want striker Craig Bellamy.</p>
              <p>Zola added: “When I agreed to come here as manager it was because of the project of developing the players we have got, bringing on the younger ones and keeping them to reach a point when we could compete with the ther big clubs.</p>
              <p>“That was the project, but a lot of things have happened on and off the pitch. We need time but the club must speak to me if they need to change their strategy.”</p>
              <p>Zola was appointed by Gudmundsson three months ago following Alan Curbishley’s shock dismissal. But the club’s parent company and shirt sponsors have both gone into liquidation and the Hammers are spiralling towards relegation with just one win in 10 games.</p>
              <p>Zola, who scored 59 times in 185 League starts between 1996 and 2003 for Chelsea, insisted: “I should not be judged on three months’ work. "But if doesn’t work I am going to be the first to say: ‘Look, I made a mistake, I am not good enough to do this so I have to do something else.’</p>
              <p>“I respect the people I work for and if I cannot give them what they expect from me then there is no point for me to stay. “And if I feel I am the problem then I won’t have a problem...”</p>
              <p>Zola, who is expected to get a great reception at Stamford Bridge today, was named Footballer of the Year in 1997.</p>

              <h2>ZOLA TELLS FANS TO LAY OFF LAMPARD</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"></div>
              <div><span><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/08/12/240/Gianfranco-Zola_1599072.jpg" border="0" alt="Zola - returns to Stamford Bridge."></span></div>
              <div></div>
              <div></div>
              <div></div>
              <div><span><strong>Gianfranco Zola has urged West Ham fans to end their abuse of former Upton Park favourite Frank Lampard. Zola returns to Chelsea on Sunday for the first time since being appointed Hammers boss in September and could experience the wrath of spurned fans himself given the rivalry between the clubs.</strong> </span></div>
              <div><span></span></div>
              <div id="articlebody">
              <p>The 42-year-old former Blues great hopes he will receive a warm reception at Stamford Bridge - and believes Lampard deserves the same. England midfielder Lampard left Upton Park seven years ago and has come under heavy fire from Hammers supporters ever since. "It would be a good time to end this abuse," said Zola.</p>
              <p>"Frank has gone his own way and people should be pleased with what he's doing, not only for Chelsea but also for his country. "He has decided to go somewhere else and people need to accept it. We talk sometimes and he always says how great West Ham is.</p>
              <p>"When he knew I was going to come here he said I was coming to a great club with a great atmosphere and a wonderful place to start my career. "That's the opinion he has of the club and people need to realise that he has moved to a bigger team."</p>
              <p>Lampard was just one of the players to role off a Upton Park production line that also produced Joe Cole, Michael Carrick and Rio Ferdinand. West Ham were powerless to prevent them joining bigger clubs and all four played in last season's Champions League final between Manchester United and Chelsea.</p>
              <p>One of Zola's tasks is to begin unearthing the next generation of Lampards and the popular Italian supports the plan. "When I came here the programme was to develop the young players that we had and keep them to help get to the point where we could compete with bigger clubs," he said.</p>

              <p class="small bold"><em>BELL AND THE BALL ... Craig Bellamy fires West Ham ahead despite the efforts of Chelsea defender Alex.</em></p>
              <p class="small bold"> </p>
              <p class="small bold"> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">GIANFRANCO ZOLA did not allow himself to celebrate one of the most important goals of his career. Even though it came at Stamford Bridge, the Chelsea legend sat glued to his seat when Craig Bellamy struck for West Ham. </h2>
              <p class="article">After all the talk of his future as Hammers boss being in doubt, you would have understood if he had danced all the way down the Fulham Road. But Zola, who spent six years at Chelsea as a player, insisted his lack of reaction was a mark of respect for the fans who still idolise him. </p>
              <p class="article">He said: “I couldn’t do that. Inside I was very happy for our goal, especially for Bellamy because he needed it and his confidence will improve now. “He has been working hard, playing well. That goal I’m sure will help. It was like I scored, I’m very happy for him. </p>
              <p class="article">“Inside I was very happy for the goal but I had to pay some respect to these people at Chelsea, I like to respect people that have given me so much.” Zola received a rapturous welcome from the Blues fans who even applauded him afterwards having booed off their own team. </p>
              <p class="article">For the rookie Italian boss, the point earned in his old stamping ground could yet prove the kiss of life to his struggling side. He said: “It was a great result, it has been a very good performance from my team, it’s been a great day — I’ve had a fantastic reception, it’s amazing. </p>
              <p class="article">“I have had fantastic support at this club, to me they showed it again. Thank you very much. “It is very important, especially after last week’s performance against Tottenham. We came from one away win, a draw at Liverpool and then we lost a big game against Tottenham. </p>
              <p class="article">“Everyone was down, everyone was nervous during the week. “This performance will help again to build up our confidence and maybe when we play at home we will have more confidence, more freedom and less pressure. </p>
              <p class="article">“This point and the performance have been vital to us.” It could have been even better for Zola, as former Chelsea striker Carlton Cole went through on goal in the last minute. But his shot was saved. </p>
              <p class="article">Zola said: “When Carlton was through I was thinking chip it over, chip it over. “He had a good shot, Petr Cech has made a very good save. They had another very good chance. I think it was a fair result. </p>
              <p class="article">“Stamford Bridge is not an easy place to come. We were very good and made it difficult for them. “It won’t be easy for anyone to come here and pick up points. “I don’t think it is only Chelsea who are dropping points, though. “It’s also Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal who are all dropping points. The other teams are getting more organised, making it more difficult for the big teams to beat them. </p>
              <p class="article">“Also, don’t underestimate the fact that this is a very competitive championship, the competition is making everybody better, including the small teams.” Zola was so overawed by his return to his spiritual home in England, he almost went in the wrong dressing room before kick-off. </p>
              <p class="article">He said: “The first 10 minutes I couldn’t understand what was going on. It took me 10 minutes just to settle down. To be in this stadium is always incredible for me. “I was thinking of other things — instinctively I just passed my changing room.”</p>

              <p>"If I think about the competition and the games that we lost points here, I agree with the fans but they need to understand the players try to do their best," he said. "Sometimes, we don't have quality for the win. I put [the players] on the pitch, I am responsible for this. We play now better away. Until now, all the teams come to Stamford Bridge, they play back 40 metres and sometimes my players need to improve, need to try something different."</p>

              <p>At first, I thought Pool got the worst result of the week among the big 4 but after last night's totally unexpected result, I think Pool won't feel that bad now... Afterall, they are still top of the league and Hull is still a position 6 side whereas WH is a bottom side in disarray on and off the pitch at the moment...</p>

WH have been poor lately, they are in the bottom 4 I think and they got there because of their recent form... They have not won since Sep apart from that match against a Roy Keane troubled and even worst Sunderland side... So, didn't expect them to get anything out of this at the Bridge with Drogba and J Cole back...</p></div>

              <p>Hull is a tough team, u noe, having beaten arsenal n narrowly losing to man U. a draw is fair for both teams.</p>
