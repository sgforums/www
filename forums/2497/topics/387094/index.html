              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> Lancashire rivals Bolton Wanderers and Burnley have agreed a compensatory figure that will pave the way for Owen Coyle to move from Turf Moor to the Reebok Stadium.<br><br>Burnley
              are loathe to lose the Scottish-born boss, and are believed to have
              held out for more than £3 million in compensation from Wanderers,
              according to <em>Sky Sports News</em>.<br><br>Coyle has been Bolton's
              top choice to replace the sacked Gary Megson, and the deal is set to be
              announced this evening despite a desperate last minute plea from
              Burnley chairman Barry Kilby.<br><br>Financial clout is said to be the
              main lure for Coyle, who recently remarked that Bolton had a budget
              three times that of Burnley's.</span></p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Coyle agrees to take Bolton job</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p>Owen Coyle has agreed to take the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Bolton</span></abbr> Wanderers job.</p>
              <p>The <em>Guardian</em> says Coyle is poised to be confirmed as the new manager of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Bolton</span></abbr> Wanderers in the next 48 hours. The Scot agreed to move from <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Burnley</span></abbr> to the Reebok Stadium tonight after he spent the evening discussing
              terms with Barry Kilby, the chairman at Turf Moor. Barring a dramatic
              about-face on Coyle's part, the switch should be finalised shortly.</p>
              <p>Coyle had met Phil Gartside, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Bolton</span></abbr>'s
              chairman, on Sunday in Scotland – where he was belatedly celebrating
              the festive period with his mother – to discuss the mooted transfer
              after receiving reluctant permission to open talks from Kilby.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Burnley</span></abbr> said after tonight's discussions that Coyle and Kilby had agreed "to
              take a further 24 hours to digest the information shared before making
              any further announcement". It is likely this reflects an ongoing
              wrangle over compensation.</p>

They are fighting from the drop as well... Maybe say Martin O'Neill, Steve Bruce, Alex McLeish or even Roy Hodgson... who despite his success, was only given a 12 months contract at Fulham... Maybe his compensation won't be £3 million also. </p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>the managers you mentioned are good managers of cos but why would they leave their clubs to come to Bolton? For Coyle its different, Bolton by history is still a bigger club then Burnley though they are struggling now and also we do not know what was promised to Coyle in terms of transfer budget or even his salary and he might see saving Bolton as a challenge and as for why Coyle and not the other managers, i see one big reason is that he has done reasonably well to bring Burnley up and they are not doing too badly now on a relatively small budget. Coyle also plays relatively attractive football compared to Megson and the usual Bolton approach and that may be the reasons why Coyle was wanted and thus their willingness to pay the money.</p></div>

              <p>Well, there is still Mark Hughes, Peter Reid, Roy Hodgson... There are just so many out there why even pay compensation for a fellow struggling club manager... Get what i mean... It's not like they are getting Sam Allardyce who is more experienced... It make no sense going for Coyle... lol. </p>
              <p>It's not as though he is really that good like a Harry Redknapp who is more likely to change the club's fortune overnight... or David Moyes who have been there, done that, even with little funds...</p>
              <p>There are others out there looking for a manager job too and some you don't even need to pay compensation for them as they may be out of a club... Some of these guys like <span style="color: #000000;">Kevin Keegan, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Alan Shearer, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Gareth Southgate, </span>Chris Coleman, Graeme Souness, <span style="color: #000000;">Steve Coppell</span>... are out of a manager job too... And its not that they are any worse than him... For all we know they may be better than him being more experienced.</p>
              <p>And if we look at the table, Burnley isn't exactly in a great position themselves... They are only 2 points ahead of Bolton but have played 2 matches more... That can't be comforting for Bolton fans... lol</p>
              <p>And Bolton is no bigger than Burnley... These two clubs are more than 120 yrs old. Their average attendance are about the same, 20,000 each match. They have an even chance to go down too. And who knows, with an inexperienced manager taking them throught the dogfight of relegation... They may actually fall.</p>
              <p>But the irony of it, should Burnley replaced him with a more experienced manager having taken their compensation and using it to pay for a more experienced guy... They may actually survive the drop at the end of the season... lol.</p>

              <p>No offence, if club history and attendance is any indication, then Sheffield Wednesday is a much bigger club than both these 2 clubs but obviously Sheffield Wednesday while a huge team in the past is not a big club anymore now.</p>
              <p>Why I say Bolton would be seen as the bigger club is becos Burnley just returned to the top flight after 33 years spending most of its time outside the top flight. Bolton has been more consistently in the top flight with its latest stint since 2001. In recent years, Bolton has been the one who have even been in European competitions while of cos not doing very well in it and if we compare the players they attract (not saying they have attracted very excellent players), they have definitely more drawing power as a club compare to Burnley. (Look at the players they have attracted, though in the advanced years but still world class players when they came to Bolton: Djorkaeff, Hierro, Campo, Okacha, Anelka etc. Another reason that why Owen Coyle might want to go back is that he did play for Bolton for a short period and he was well liked there.</p>
              <p>But why would Bolton not approached those managers you mentioned. Honestly, its true and no one can argue that managers like Roy Hodgson are gonna be more experienced and have better track records than Coyle. But both you and I could not possibly know that Bolton had not tried to approach these managers but as I said, why would these managers want to come? At the end of the day, they wanted someone who can come in, bring something different, and have a track record of working with a tight budget and he does have a record of turning things fast as shown in his 2 years with Burnley when he brought them up to the top flight. And inexperienced and no track record does not mean he cannot do a good job, who was Mourinho when he won the the CL with Porto? Of cos i am not saying that Bolton is gonna win the league but I am saying that probably Bolton knew that at this moment, Coyle is the best they can get and he is not that bad afterall, with such a team at Burnley, he is keeping them out of the relegation zone which everyone predicts they should be. And why 3m? maybe too expensive but you need to pay esp when Burnley never wanted to let him go. You think even if people like Hodgson want to come, Fulham would settle for 3m?</p>
              <p>Just my tot, but i tot its a good choice.</p>

              <p>But in my opinion, Coyle should only switch club at the end of the season. He has managed to build a good squad in Burnley in a matter of months and  Burnley is always ever so dangerous at home. What about Bolton? A roller-coaster team for many season after Big Sam's departure. They are always in the relegation dog fight and never in a safe position until towards the end of the season.</p>

              <p>I think you may be mistaken... Playing in the Premier league alone or longer doesn't neceassary mean you become a big club compare to those playing in the lower divisions... It just mean you have manage well these last few years only... And despite playing in the top level, very few supporters still turn out to watch your club play... That's an indication of how big or small you are... Bolton or Burnley are probably not much difference... They both attract about the same amount of crowd each match.</p>
              <p>Of course history and club attendance is definitely one good source to take as to judge whether a club is big or not... You take Newcastle or even Leeds who are playing in League 1 (2 Divisions down)... These are bigger clubs than Bolton or Burnley and I think you will agree with me... Even Sheff United or Wed are as big a club as these two... And they still are. They attract as many fans to their matches despite playing in a less attractive lower league. And like Sunderland before them, more will turn up if they reach the top level... For Bolton or Burnley who are already in the top level, unfortunately, still only manage what those in the lower league gets. So we can assume that once they get relegated, their 20 thousand will become 15 and15 could become 10 thousand like what Burnley was playing to 2 yrs ago only...</p>
              <p>It's just that things have not been good these last few years for those clubs that's all... But they are no different from Burnley or Bolton... And probably bigger than them. Southampton was in the top level for 27 yrs... But so what? They got relegated and that's it... Gone. But I think they may still be bigger than Bolton though... lol.</p>
              <p>There are just so many examples out there... <span style="color: #000000;">Nottingham Forest, </span><span style="color: #000000;">West Bromwich Albion, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Middlesbrough and </span><span style="color: #000000;">Reading... We take Reading, they were in the lower league... Then under <span style="color: #000000;">Steve Coppell, they manage to come up... They manage to survive their first year... Then their 2nd year, they did really well and people were singing the praise of <span style="color: #000000;">Steve Coppell of how good he was this and that and was another who could succeed Fergie at United afterall he was an old boy... But he still wasn't experienced. Then the next year, they went down... So Owen Coyle brought Burnley up... He can also take any side down like Alan Pardew as well... As they say, the difficult part is not to take them up but to keep them in the top level...</span></span></span></p>
              <p>Yeah, Bolton attracted some known players or in your term... "advanced years but still world class players" But how did they got there? Was it because of the club or the management skills of a certain Sam Allardyce that got those you mentioned like Djorkaeff, Fernando Hierro, Campo, Okacha, El Hadji Diouf, Gary Speed, Anelka all there in the first place? Yeah, all signed by Big Sam if you are not aware... All of them, even present day Kevin Davies was signed by him...I don't think these players would have gone to Bolton had they not met him and he manage to persuaded them to sign for the club after having sold his vision for the club to them... And since he left, did they got any of "advanced years but still world class players" in to date?</p>
              <p>The thing I read about how Owen Coyle got to the Bolton job I think has not much to do with Burnley, The Bolton chairman already wanted him before he appointed Gary Megson 2 yrs ago. Just that he was 2nd choice.</p>
              <p>On Hodgson, I don't think he would have cost that much either... Even now he just signed a 12 months rolling contract only... It could have been lesser who knows... his salary maybe lesser than $2.5m. Even Mark Hughes, who is currently out of a job and have work wonders at Blackburn, would have been a better choice to me... And the best thing is, there is no compensation required... lol.</p>
              <p>To me, its a risky choice with a lesser chance of surviving in the longer term... and he may turn out to be another <span style="color: #000000;">Steve Coppell or maybe worse... cannot even last 3 seasons...</span></p>

              just mean you have manage well these last few years
              only... And despite playing in the top level, very few supporters
              still turn out to watch your club play... That's an indication of
              how big or small you are... Bolton or Burnley are probably not much
              difference... They both attract about the same amount
              of crowd each match.</p>
              <p>Of course history and club attendance is definitely one
              good source to take as to judge whether a club is big or not... You
              take Newcastle or even Leeds who are playing in League 1 (2
              Divisions down)... These are bigger clubs than Bolton or Burnley
              and I think you will agree with me... Even Sheff United or Wed
              are as big a club as these two... And they still are. They
              attract as many fans to their matches despite playing in
              a less attractive lower league. And like Sunderland before
              them, more will turn up if they reach the top level... For Bolton
              or Burnley who are already in the top level,
              unfortunately, still only manage what those in the lower league
              gets. So we can assume that once they get relegated, their 20
              thousand will become 15 and15 could become 10 thousand like
              what Burnley was playing to 2 yrs ago only...</p>
              <p>It's just that things have not been good these last few years
              for those clubs that's all... But they are no different from
              Burnley or Bolton... And probably bigger than them. Southampton was
              in the top level for 27 yrs... But so what? They got relegated and
              that's it... Gone. But I think they may still be bigger than
              Bolton though... lol.</p>
              <p>There are just so many examples out there... <span style="color: #000000;">Nottingham Forest,</span> <span style="color: #000000;">West Bromwich Albion,</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Middlesbrough and</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Reading... We take Reading, they were in the
              lower league... Then under <span style="color: #000000;">Steve
              Coppell, they manage to come up... They manage to survive their
              first year... Then their 2nd year, they did really well and people
              were singing the praise of <span style="color: #000000;">Steve
              Coppell of how good he was this and that and was another who could
              succeed Fergie at United afterall he was an old boy... But he still
              wasn't experienced. Then the next year, they went down...
              So Owen Coyle brought Burnley up... He can also take any side
              down like Alan Pardew as well... As they say, the difficult
              part is not to take them up but to keep them in the top
              level...</span></span></span></p>
              <p>Yeah, Bolton attracted some known players or in your
              term... "advanced years but still world class players" But how
              did they got there? Was it because of the club or the
              management skills of a certain Sam Allardyce that got
              those you mentioned like Djorkaeff, Fernando Hierro, Campo,
              Okacha, El Hadji Diouf, Gary Speed, Anelka all there in the
              first place? Yeah, all signed by Big Sam if you are not
              aware... All of them, even present day Kevin Davies was signed
              by him...I don't think these players would have gone to Bolton had
              they not met him and he manage to persuaded them to sign
              for the club after having sold his vision for the
              club to them... And since he left, did they got any of
              "advanced years but still world class players" in to date?</p>
              <p>The thing I read about how Owen Coyle got to the
              Bolton job I think has not much to do with Burnley,
              The Bolton chairman already wanted him before he
              appointed Gary Megson 2 yrs ago. Just that he was 2nd
              choice.</p>
              <p>On Hodgson, I don't think he would have cost that much either...
              Even now he just signed a 12 months rolling contract only... It
              could have been lesser who knows... his salary maybe lesser than
              $2.5m. Even Mark Hughes, who is currently out of a job and
              have work wonders at Blackburn, would have been a better choice to
              me... And the best thing is, there is no compensation required...
              lol.</p>
              <p>To me, its a risky choice with a lesser chance of surviving in
              the longer term... and he may turn out to be another <span style="color: #000000;">Steve Coppell or maybe worse... cannot even last
              3 seasons...</span></p>

              <p><br>No need right or wrong... Everyone have a different opinion thats all... You have yours and I can respect it... You think Owen Coyle will be good for Bolton while I feel he is a risky choice that's all... With him I think they will just continue to hover around the relegation area if they don't get relegated... We can just sit back and watch where Bolton end up in 3 years time lor... It's not like we are going anywhere unless... one of us depart from this world... lol.</p>
