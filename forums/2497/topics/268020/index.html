            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Jose Antonio Reyes has denied that a deal has been struck to make his loan move to Real Madrid permanent, amid reports that Arsenal have agreed to sell him.</strong><br><br>The Spain international is desperate to stay at the Bernabeu and has let the Gunners know that he does want to return to England.<br><br>A Â€10million deal was said to have been struck between Arsenal and Madrid, but Reyes has now claimed that nothing has been confirmed.<br><br>"No agreement has been reached," he said at a Nike Soccer Camp. "But I do expect the situation to be solved as soon as possible.<br><br>"But I want to win everything that there is and if that can happen at Real Madrid, then that would be perfect.<br><br>Arsenal paid around Â€20million to sign Reyes from Sevilla in 2004 and he impressed at Highbury during his first two seasons in the Premiership.<br><br>After failing to adapt to life in England though, the 23-year-old forced a move back to Spain last summer and he spent last term on loan at Madrid.<br><br>Now he wants to remain in la Primera and believes that he would fit in well under new coach Bernd Schusyer.<br><br>"I think that Madrid are going to play a lot better under the new German coach," Reyes continued, before stating his main dislike of London life.<br><br>"The rain was one of the main reasons that I could not adjust to life over there."<br><br>His agent Jesus Rodriguez de Moya explained recently that Arsenal have agreed to allow him to leave for less than they paid and that talks are continuing.<br><br>"Reyes doesn't want to return to London.<br><br>"If the logical steps are taken, Reyes will be a Madrid player next year.<br><br>"Arsenal are not asking for Â€20million (Â£13.6million) but they are asking for a reasonable fee in accordance with what they paid to Sevilla. The negotiations are on the table."</div>
