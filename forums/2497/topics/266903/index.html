            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech believes next season's title race could be closer than ever, with all of the capital club's rivals having invested in the transfer market.</strong><br><br>While Chelsea have been relatively subdued in terms of new signings, pending the arrival of Â£13.5million Florent Malouda, the likes of Manchester United and Liverpool have made significant signings.<br><br>Cech believes both of these clubs will be capable of challenging for the Premier League title, while he is quick to not rule out the threat of Arsenal, despite the sale of Thierry Henry to Barcelona.<br><br>"We will see how Arsenal can cope with the departure of Thierry Henry, the best striker in the club's history," Cech told Pravo.<br><br>"On the other hand, they have got a lot of money in return and they can buy a good replacement.<br><br>"Manchester United have strengthened their squad and they will definitely be keen on defending the title. Liverpool have bought more players, mainly from La Liga.<br><br>"It is good mainly for the Champions League, as European-style football is useful there. The question is how these players settle in the Premiership.<br><br>"They might not be used to playing here right from the start."<br><br>Although Chelsea have settled for a summer of prudence, in comparison with the lavish spending of bygone campaigns, Cech is confident that they will have more than enough quality to compete for honours.<br><br>"Three new players have come in, on free transfers so the club has not spent much," he added. "But the squad is sufficiently large and of a good quality.<br><br>"I am glad that almost all the players have stayed, including the coach Jose Mourinho. There can be injuries again, but I believe that we will be even stronger.<br><br>"It is important that the best players like (Didier) Drogba and (Frank) Lampard have remained with Chelsea."<br><br>Cech also confirmed that he will continue to use the protective headgear he wore last season, following what was a serious injury sustained at Reading.<br><br>"I have undergone another complete medical and the doctors have advised me to keep using the helmet.<br><br>"The fans will therefore see me with it again next season. Of course, I would like to put it aside, but on the other hand, it is necessary to lower the risk."</div>
