The Manchester United winger is up for both young player and player of the year, and the Chelsea and England captain says he is a huge fan of his. "I could watch United just to watch him. He does things no-one else in the world doing at the minute," he said. "He's the best in the world. At his best, not many people can stop him."</strong><br><br>As well as his skill, Terry said he admired the Portuguese's personality for the way he handled the backlash against him after his team put England out of the World Cup last summer. "It was understandable after knocking us out of the World Cup, but he has done all his talking on the pitch," said Terry.<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42808000/jpg/_42808137_terry203.jpg"><br><br>"When he is at his best I don't think there are many people who can stop him. When he is running at you like he does with his skills and tricks, you don't know which way he is going. "A lot of teams double up on him and he has often said he has two players to beat in every game. "But you double up on him and then he passes the ball to Wayne Rooney who does the same, so where do you stop? You can't double up on everyone."<br><br>Ronaldo's team-mates Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes are also nominated for the main award, as is Terry's colleague Didier Drogba, along with Liverpool's Steven Gerrard and Arsenal's Cesc Fabregas. Wayne Rooney, Ronaldo and Fabregas are also up for the young player award, along with Tottenham's Aaron Lennon, Kevin Doyle of Reading and Manchester City's Micah Richards.<br><br>"Didier has, arguably, been Chelsea's best and most consistent performer this season - no mean achievement when he is playing alongside so many top-class players at Stamford Bridge," said PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor. He echoed Terry's opinion on Ronaldo, 22, who has scored 21 goals for Manchester United this season. "Cristiano is the most exciting player in the country at the moment - the quickness of his feet and the skills he possesses make you think, at times, that he is from another planet," added Taylor.<br></div>

I see. Ok, so let me ask you this question: Mr Brown did podcast. His podcast is directly and indirectly targeting at the government however, he did not mention any name. He came up with the Bak Chor Mee Mai Ter Gua with regards to the Gomez incident. No names were involve so was he at fault? No?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Define covering up for each other.
