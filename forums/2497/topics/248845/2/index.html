Even the Liverpool or Arsenal fans? They don't like each other too you know..... Besides, like someone else has said, not all the Chelsea fans are getting drawing negative reactions. Namely, only you and the clones.<br><br>Other fans have come out in support of Chelsea too, but other than the clones, none draw the kind of response you do. Perhaps you're not bright enough to understand why?<br><br>There are a few others who make snide remarks at Man U fans as well, but the kind of posts they make are not as far of as yours. Also, it helps that they know what they are talking about when it comes to soccer, whichever club they are a fan of.<br><br>It's not just the Man U fans that dislike you. Liverpool fans as well and even soccer fans who don't support either club.<br><br>Go figure Ghim pheng. You're drawing negative response not because you're a Chelsea fan, it's how you conduct yourself as a fan in sgforums. It won't matter even if you were a fan of Man U, Liverpool, Arsenal or any other club. With the way you're posting, people will still find you an eyesore.<br><br>Most of the people have an issue with you rather than about Chelsea, in case you haven't noticed. www is right, you have no real undertstanding what PFA is about. Just like how you have no real understanding of soccer.<br><br>Whether or not you are a Chelsea fan isn't really the relevant point, it's how lousy you are as a soccer fan.<br></div>
