              <p><strong>Robbie Keane admits he could not understand why Rafa Benitez dropped him from his squad, insisting “I’m no bad egg”. </strong></p>
              <p>Keane spoke for the first time of his horror six months at Anfield,
              where he became increasingly jettisoned before returning to Tottenham
              in the January transfer window.</p>
              <p>The Republic of Ireland international refused to attack Benitez for
              how he was treated, but he did express his confusion at being left out
              of squads to play Everton and later Chelsea.</p>
              <p>“Sometimes it doesn’t work out for you. I worked hard in training
              every day, I did everything I possibly could, sometimes the manager
              just doesn’t fancy you,” Keane said in Friday’s press conference.</p>
              <p>“When you’re in and out of the team it’s never easy as a striker.
              You need your fitness and sharpness. I love playing, I didn’t play as
              often as I would have liked.</p>
              <p>“To be left out of the squad was particularly difficult to take.
              I’ve never been left out of a squad since I was 17, as a player I found
              that difficult.</p>
              <p>“If I was a bad egg I could understand but I work every day in training.”</p>
              <p>One man not complaining is Harry Redknapp, who revealed he can already see the ‘Keane-Factor’ rubbing off on his team.</p>
              <p>“Even in training this week I’ve seen a big difference. He rubs off
              on other people,” stated Redknapp, who also rubbished reports that
              Keane had demanded to be captain.</p>
              <p>“Robbie never asked me to be captain if he came back. It was totally
              my decision. Woody’s been fantastic, JJ has done the job, but Robbie
              brings his enthusiasm.</p>
              <p>“I can talk with him about the team openly, any problems we can improve – he’ll be very important to me.”</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">ROBBIE KEANE would give away his medal if Liverpool won the Premier League. The striker insists the gong is worthless after the way he was treated by Rafa Benitez.</h2>
              <p class="article">Keane, who returned to Tottenham this week just six months after Kop boss Benitez signed him, said: “Winning the Premier League would mean nothing at all to me now.</p>
              <p class="article">“My brother is a Liverpool fan so I’d probably give it to him. The way I look at it is that a medal means something when you are a part of the squad and involved in winning a trophy. “When you are in and out of the squad and not involved in games, there are times when you don’t feel part of it.</p>
              <p class="article">“Next month’s Carling Cup final means more to me because I’m a Tottenham player now, even though I can’t play. “Liverpool is gone. It’s the past. What happens there now is not my problem.”</p>
              <p class="article">Liverpool paid Spurs £20.3million for Keane but sold him back for £12m on Monday. He played 16 league games, with 10 qualifying him for a medal.</p>
              <p class="article">And in a blast at Benitez, Keane said: “I did everything possible to succeed and with a different manager I could have made it work.”</p>

              <p>keane is a misfit at liverpool, in the scheme of things. shit happens....that's part and parcel of life.</p>
              <p>so, i am not sure if all this cackles are true given that keane is now back at spurs wearing a captains armband, so he's focus. and liverpool got bigger things on their plate now than to continue to be involved with the keane tangle.</p>

              <p>Keane would have been perfect for Pool's game against Portsmouth while Torres is given a good rest after playing almost 100 mins right after coming back from a long term injury... If Torres don't take to the field tonight, I guess Ngog or Kuyt will have to do... I also wonder why they let Pennant go too as if Kuyt is move to the striker position, Pennant would be perfect to cover the right wing spot...</p>
              <p>Oh well, I honestly belief Rafa has scored an own goal big time by letting Keane and Pennant go without bringing in anyone to cover...</p>
