The Aston Villa boss is expected to make a number of signings in the January sales.<br><br>But the Irishman wants to return to the old system when clubs could buy players at any point during the season until transfer deadline day in late March.<br><br>O'Neill said: "Do I like the transfer window? Not particularly. "I think what it does is point everyone into this supposed window of opportunity Â— and sometimes you are panicked into things.<br><br>"After January 31 a manager is not able to do anything until the end of the season. He has that in his mind. "Before the system was OK. I am not a fan of this one Â— and I am not sure many people are Â— but whilst it is in place you can't do anything about it.<br><br>"You are not going to change the transfer window this season. "But I am sure people will be lobbying to try and do something about it and hopefully that will be successful in the not too distant future."<br><br></div>
