            <div class='col-md body'>De la Pena wants Espanyol stay<br><br>Ivan De la Pena has announced that he wants to sign a new contract with Espanyol as soon as possible and put an end to reports linking him with a move to Valencia.<br><br>The 31-year-old midfielder's current deal at the Barcelona-based club expires at the end of June, but he is ready to sit down and thrash out a new deal.<br><br>Rumours surfaced that Valencia were keen on signing him on a free transfer, but after reaching the Uefa Cup final this term De la Pena wants to help Espanyol to greater things.<br><br>Negotiations are due to begin next week and the former Barcelona, Lazio and Marseille playmaker hinted that he is prepared to end his career with los Periquitos.<br><br>"We have agreed to hold talks next week," he explained in a press conference on Friday. "I expect to have everything sorted out soon and to stay here for many years.<br><br>"My position is the same now as it has been for several months.<br><br>"The two sides want to carry on together and I do not think that it will be difficult to reach an agreement.<br><br>"I really feel at home here. I have been treated magnificently since I arrived and even more so after the final last week when the fans were incredible.<br><br>"That gave me even more incentive to want to stay."<br><br>De la Pena believes that he can help Espanyol to build on their performance this season, but admits that the club will have to dip into the transfer market to bolster the squad.<br><br>"We have had three good years," he said. "Now we cannot afford to sit back and to think that the job is done.<br><br>"We need a leap up again in quality.<br><br>"Hopefully we can have another go at it, but I know it will be very difficult.<br><br>"I would love to do it all again after what I have experienced this year, because it has been great and we all really wanted to win something.<br><br>"I truly believe that we will win it one day though."<br><br>Despite spending his formative years at Barcelona, the Santander-born De la Pena believes that Real Madrid are best placed to lift this season's league championship.<br><br>"Madrid is the favourite because they are the current leaders and if they do not make any mistakes then they will win," he stated.<br><br>"Two weeks ago I would have given a different answer."<br></div>
