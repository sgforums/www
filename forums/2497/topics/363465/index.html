              <p><strong>Real Madrid president Florentino Perez celebrated the completion of the £59m capture of Kaka by warning Manchester United that Cristiano Ronaldo is next on his hit list.</strong></p>

              <p><strong>Perez, who oversaw the <em>galacticos</em> era at Madrid between 2001 and 2006, said last week that he would not
              jeopardise his relationship with United to sign Ronaldo but buoyed by
              the success of the Kaka deal he was in bullish mood.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"We're
              always thinking about great players, Cristiano Ronaldo and (Zlatan)
              Ibrahimovic are among other great players around the world," Perez
              said. "We all know that these are players that we would like but they
              all can't come.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"Ronaldo is a great player who we'd like to bring
              to the club, but first we have to speak to Manchester United because
              the important thing is for us to maintain a good rapport with
              everyone." </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Real angered United last summer following a public pursuit of Ronaldo, which prompted Red Devils manager Alex Fergeson to blast: " I wouldn't sell a virus to that mob."</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Various
              Madrid officials have claimed that there is a pre-contract agreement in
              place to sign the FIFA World Player of the Year for €90m but nobody
              will admit to actually seeing the document.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The deal was
              allegedly agreed by ousted Real chief Ramon Calderon and facilitated by
              Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes. United have repeatedly denied the
              existence of any agreement.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Meanwhile, Tuesday's edition of Spanish daily <em>Marca</em> claimed that Perez has an agreement in place with financially troubled Valencia to sign star striker David Villa.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Real
              sporting director Jorge Valdano confirmed that the club were looking to
              sign more players but did not identify any targets by name.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"We have needs and we will try to satisfy them with more signings which must make us better," Valdano said.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"We
              will be working on purchases and sales at the same time and see then
              what squad we are left with, certainly a better one than last season
              which is the main aim."</strong></p>

              <p>Perez told <em>Onda Cero and Radio Marca</em>: "I will do everything possible to get <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Cristiano Ronaldo</span></abbr> at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Real Madrid</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>"<abbr><span class="glossary-term">Kaka</span></abbr> is (just) the first signing."</p>
              <p>Asked about reports <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> have allowed <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Ronaldo</span></abbr> to sign a pre-contract with Madrid, Perez said: "I have read about this

              <p>He added: "What I want the most is to keep good relationships with other clubs.</p>
              <p>"The only thing I have done is ensure we follow the path

              <p>Perez's comments about <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Ronaldo</span></abbr> are likely to infuriate United, who voiced their displeasure last summer at Madrid's public pursuit of the winger.</p>
              <p>And Perez insisted any move for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Ronaldo</span></abbr> this time would be done via the right channels.</p>

              *Real Madrid send doctor to check on Cristiano Ronaldo as Perez caves in on Â£75m fee to sign Manchester United star*
              .
              .
              
              *Real Madrid have reportedly agreed to pay a world record fee to sign Cristiano Ronaldo and have dispatched a doctor to examine his hernia problem. Spain say the club's new president Florentino Perez has sanctioned a deal that will dwarf the Â£56m paid to AC Milan for Kaka.*
              
              It has long been said that there is a pre-contract agreement to sign Manchester United star Ronaldo - understood by Sportsmail to be set at Â£75m. The contract, which United have previously denied the existence of, would have to be executed before June 30, with Madrid paying a Â£26m penalty if they broke the terms.
              
              Perez's predecessor Ramon Calderon has persistently hinted that Ronaldo will arrive at the Bernabeu because of work he had already done on the deal last summer. Perez is understood to be unhappy at such a high fee and has reportedly been in talks with United chief executive David Gill over the last few days in an attempt to renegotiate the deal. But the Barclays Premier League champions have refused to budge other than agreeing to take the payments spread over five years, leaving Perez to reluctantly sanction the transfer rather pay Â£26m and have no player.
              
              El Mundo Deportivo says that a representative of the club and a doctor have been sent to meet the 24-year-old in Los Angeles, where he is recuperating after injury forced him out of the Portugal squad.
              
              His prospective new employers want to examine the suspected hernia to see if it needs surgery, which may rule him out of the start of the season, but they could move quickly to finalise the deal if they are satisfied. He would receive about Â£200,000 a week on a similar deal to Kaka.
              
              Reports in Portuguese newspaper A Bola say Ronaldo will not need surgery and that his pain is the natural result of a 59-match season. While Calderon angered United boss Sir Alex Ferguson by courting Ronaldo in public, Perez has not met the same resistance despite constantly stating in interviews in recent days that he was determined to sign the Portugal international.
              
              Perez, 62, is said to have a much better relationship wit the Old Trafford hierarchy, dating back to a time when he chaired the now disbanded G-14 collection of Europe's elite football clubs.
              
              Bernabeu insiders insist the spending will not stop with a player they have spent two years chasing. There is an estimated Â£260m budget, with deals still in the offing for Bayern Munich star Franck Ribery, Liverpool's Xabi Alonso and plus Valencia trio David Villa, David Silva and Raul Albiol.
              
              He has also spoken warmly of Inter Milan striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, though it appears the club's interest in Wigan winger Antonio Valencia - which predates Perez's appointment - may have cooled.

              <h1>Valdano hints at Real Ronaldo talks</h1>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p><strong>Reports in Spain suggest
              that new Madrid president Florentino Perez has been in talks with the
              Premier League club and are on the verge of breaking their own world
              record transfer, set just a few days ago for Kaka, to bring Ronaldo to
              the Bernabeu. </strong></p>
              <p>Valdano's comments will only serve to add fuel to the
              speculation that the Spanish giants have upped their efforts to sign
              the Portugal winger.</p>
              <p>"I can't answer any questions about him," he told TVE. "I can
              only talk about players who are on their way here, not about those we
              are in negotiations over.</p>
              <p>"He is a great professional, he dedicates a very great deal of
              time to his work. He is a great footballer and a very good
              professional."</p>
              <p>Ronaldo has been enjoying the close season, spending time in Sardinia and Los Angeles.</p>
              <p>The 24-year-old obviously enjoys the trappings of his fame, but Valdano insists he is still the perfect player for Madrid.</p>
              <p>"According to the information we have managed to obtain, he is
              an excellent professional," he added. "You don't get the player's body
              he has, which is a footballing advertisement, without working a great
              deal.</p>
              <p>"Another thing is that his reputation as an officially
              good-looking guy, and a social or advertising model, blurs his image a
              bit.</p>
