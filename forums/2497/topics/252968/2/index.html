I know exactly where he's gone but I am not allowed to say.' Jose Mourinho refused to rule Chelsea out a move for Reading midfielder Steve Sidwell after watching his side equal Liverpool's record 63-match unbeaten home run with a 1-1 draw against Everton at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>Mourinho admitted that he possibly required two new midfielders to compensate for the expected loss of Michael Essien and Mikel John Obi in the African Cup of Nations next season.<br><br>Chelsea have been consistently linked with a move for Sidwell, who Royals boss Steve Coppell revealed has left the club despite an offer to increase his wages to around Â£25,000-a-week.<br><br>Sidwell, 24, had looked poised to sign for Newcastle but the departure of manager Glenn Roeder has left the door open for other clubs and Chelsea are now regarded as favourites for his signature.<br><br>And Mourinho failed to dampen speculation that the highly-rated midfielder will be arriving at Stamford Bridge for free.<br><br>Mourinho declared: 'I don't think it is the time to talk about it. It is obvious that we need a couple of players, two or three players. That is the nature of a team like us which is trying to improve.<br><br>'I don't think we will be involved in the crazy market in big transfer and changes. But of course we need a central defender, a midfield player to make the group stronger, especially a group that will lose Mikel and Essien at the same time for the African Cup, and we need a striker.<br><br>'Three or four players is what we are looking for quietly. After the FA Cup final it will be time to think seriously about two or three coming in and two or three leaving as that is the nature of a big club like us.'<br></div>

But the Reading star has been warned the move could wreck his career. Midfielder Sidwell, 24, was at the centre of a transfer tug-of-war between the PremiershipÂ’s top clubs all season after refusing to sign a new deal with the Royals. And boss Steve Coppell confirmed: Â“HeÂ’s gone. I know exactly where heÂ’s gone but I am not allowed to say.Â”</strong><br><br>Former Arsenal rookie Sidwell elected to treble his wages by joining the Blues but has been told by ReadingÂ’s director of football Nicky Hammond he will have to get used to life on the bench. Hammond said: Â“He knows what he has got at Reading, we have been really competitive this year and he has been the mainstay of our side.<br><br>Â“For him that is imperative wherever he goes but he is not likely to find that decision easy to come by at other clubs. Â“He needs to play week-in, week-out to be at the top of his game Â— but there is no guarantee of that happening somewhere else.Â”<br><br></div>
