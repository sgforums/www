[The club's president] Silvio Berlusconi wanted Ronaldinho but we rejected that move and what I told Berlusconi about what would happen if I sold him has become legendary.Â”<br><br>Laporta privately admitted to his Italian counterpart that he would be 'chased out of the country by the fans' if he ever sold the 27-year-old.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ronaldinho will probably join chelsea one day. If not by this friday, perhaps in a few years time when Ronaldinho will be about 30 yrs old... Maybe Roman can get him on a "discount" by then, perhaps 50% discount at $40m?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Ronaldinho would have to do his share here, says Terry<br><br>Â· Brazilian would have 'to learn to track back'<br>Â· He would provide 'an option' for the Blues </span><br><br>John Terry last night enthused over the possibility of Ronaldinho swapping the Camp Nou for Stamford Bridge, though his thrilled anticipation was delivered with a proviso. The Brazilian, said the England captain, would have to buy into Chelsea's workaholic mentality, including recognising the need to track back, if the prospect of a move to the club was ever to become a reality.</strong><br><br>Barcelona continue to say that they would not countenance Ronaldinho's sale before Friday's closure of the transfer window despite reports that the Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, met the 27-year-old's brother and agent, Roberto de Assis Moreira, at the Lanesborough Hotel in Mayfair over the weekend. The Catalans' director of sport, Txiki BeguiristÃ¡in, has dismissed suggestions that the meeting might prove the prelude to a Â£50m British record move to the Premiership, yet Terry admitted the prospect - however remote - of playing alongside Ronaldinho remained enticing.<br><br>"It was exciting seeing the link with him and it would be a great acquisition to get a player of that ability in," said Terry. "I've played against him, seen what he's all about, and he's such a difficult player to mark. He'd give us an option if he does come and it would be great for the Premiership to have a player like Ronaldinho here.<br><br>Yet Terry's glowing assessment was offered with a warning. "I'd like to think he could fit into the team, though he'd have to learn about the defensive duties expected of everyone," added Terry. "We've got wide men going forward but they've got defensive responsibilities as well. We've seen at times that Jose Mourinho has taken Shaun Wright- Phillips or Joe Cole off because they've not been doing their bit at the back.<br><br>"It takes players a month or so to learn that you have to track back and, if you don't, then you come off. Once you've realised that it's about a team and defending as well, you can attack as well and he can give us something that not many in the world can give us. I suppose if he's doing what he's so good at going forward, then perhaps the manager will let him off a little bit at the back, but we'd have to see."<br><br></div>
