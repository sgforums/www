              <p><strong>Zlatan Ibrahimovic's agent has launched an astonishing broadside at Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho, claiming he has done "more harm than good" at the San Siro.</strong></p>
              <p>Mourinho took over Inter in the summer after Roberto Mancini was sacked despite leading the Nerazzurri to three successive Serie A titles.</p>
              <p>Under the former Chelsea coach Inter are seven points clear at the top of the table and in the last 16 of the Champions League.</p>
              <p>However, Mourinho has caused no end of controversy since his arrival in Italy and agent Mino Raiola does not believe the Portuguese coach will last long at the club.</p>
              <p>"I'm certain that Mourinho is doing everything to go to Real Madrid," Raiola told Milan daily Il Giorno. "But he has to think about not repeating the disastrous buys he has made.</p>
              <p>"He made (Inter president Massimo) Moratti throw away 45 million and he's winning with Mancini's squad. "What more has he given to the team? He has only destroyed someone like Maxwell who I still believe is among the best defenders in Europe. "If he had left Ibra out he would have already been sacked as happened at Chelsea.</p>
              <p>"Mourinho has to change his attitude, he's doing more harm than good. And he only has Zlatan to thank for the fact they're where they're at." Ibrahimovic is enjoying another excellent season in Serie A, where he has scored over 15 goals this campaign.</p>
              <p>Raiola claims Barcelona and Real Madrid are interested in the 27-year-old, and insists that if the Sweden international decides to leave the San Siro there would be nothing the club could do.</p>
              <p>"Real Madrid and Barcelona are ready to do everything to get him," he added. "In the Spanish league Ibra would score 40 goals a season and would certainly have more of a chance of winning the Ballon d'Or.</p>
              <p>"I want something to be clear: if Zlatan decides to leave, it's certain he will leave. "In all his transfers, from Ajax to Juve and Juve to Inter, it was always the player who enforced his own desire. "That's not a warning, I only say that it's not up to others to decide for him."</p>
