              <div></div>
              <div><span><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo has been named FifPro World Footballer of the Year. </strong></span></div>
              <div id="articlebody">
              <p><strong>It is the first in what is expected to be a host of individual honours for the 23-year-old, who scored 42 goals for Manchester United on their way to Champions League and Premier League title glory last term.</strong></p>
              <p>Ronaldo had suggested last week he could do no more than he did to be crowned the best player on the planet and peers from over 40 countries are in agreement.</p>
              <p>At £12.2million, Ronaldo has proved to be a bargain since his arrival from Sporting Lisbon in 2003, growing steadily into the most influential player in the United team.</p>
              <p>It is anticipated Ronaldo will also scoop the Balon D'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, with the Portugal international - who has also been named in FifPro's world team of the year - keen to remain at Old Trafford for another couple of seasons at least.</p>
              <p>"I insist that I am a Manchester United player and now I think that next year I will continue here," Ronaldo told Marca</p>
              <p>Although Sir Alex Ferguson has twice been forced to intervene to keep Ronaldo at the club - immediately after the 2006 World Cup and last summer as Real Madrid made their bid to get him - the player seems committed to helping United win further honours, even if his lack of goal celebrations recently has been the subject of major debate.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo admitted Ferguson played a huge part in his decision to commit his immediate future to the Red Devils following this summer's transfer speculation.</p>
              <p>"He has been a key person. I respect him a lot, because it was him who signed me and he has played a very important part in all that I have won," said Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>"In Lisbon I reached an agreement with him and it was decided that the best thing for all was to continue.</p>
              <p>"He listened to my arguments and I listened to his. Now I understand that it was the correct decision. I am with Manchester United body and soul."</p>

              <p><br>Don't think so...</p>
              <p>Though he did win the Fifa and European footballer of the year in 2002, he didn't win the UEFA Club Striker of the Year, UEFA Club Footballer of the Year, La Liga top scorer or Golden Shoe in 2002... But overall, he did a great job in the space of a few year tho, picking up other awards... But I think his 2002 awards were mostly for the Brazil 2002 World Cup win.</p>

              <p>Just my take on it...</p>
              <p>Ronaldo was indeed bought to replace Beckham because they both play in the same position. Fergie even gave him Beck's shirt number when he initially wanted no.28. On the other hand, I don't think Ronaldo was bought to replace their miss on Ronaldinho...</p>
              <p>Back in 2003, United needed another striker apart from another right winger to help Rvn as Solskjaer was at times injured and Ronaldinho was that target... They miss out on him and they started that season without an extra striker. However they did buy Saha when the transfer window open in Jan 2004.</p>
              <p>I think Saha was bought to replace their miss on Ronaldinho. As for Ronaldo, they were already keeping an eye on him before and after playing that pre-season friendly, the players decided he was the man to replace Beck at right-wing. I think had they got Ronaldinho, they would still have got Ronaldo cos both plays in different positions and they needed to cover both positions.</p>

              <p><br>Reason is you were never a United fan to begin with... You were more of a Beckham fan rather than a United one... A lot of people are sometimes confuse... Subconsciously they can't tell apart the difference between supporting an individual and supporting a club... From your posting, I can tell you support Chelsea but yet you prefer us to think you actually support Newcastle but I sense your passion for them is much lesser.</p>
              <p>Actually its not something very hard to imagine... During the Mourinho days, quite a number of Chelsea fans actually support Mourinho rather than the club... Their passion for him and the club were very strong... But when he left, these few fellows also loss their keen interest in the club.</p>
              <p>I myself was never a Real Madrid fan but when Beckham went over, I started watching their matches and supported them to win the La Liga. But when he left, I no longer have interest in Real now.</p>
              <p>I support the club and not any individual. Even if Mourinho, a manager I least want to see at United become its manager, I will still not change clubs... In fact, I will start to support him too as long as he is the United manager.</p>

              <p>other den ronaldo giving alot of peeps uncertainty about him staying in Mutd or not, and his diving, i don see any reason for people to actually "hate" him. . . more of a jealousy i tink.<br><br>clearly, alot of striker dive also. .  and ronaldo prolly falls easily due to the way he runs. . his style is some sort like robben.<br><br></p>
