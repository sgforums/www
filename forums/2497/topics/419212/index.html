              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;"><strong>OWEN COYLE</strong></h2>
              <p>BOLTON chief won huge praise for his job at the Reebok. At 44, he fits the bill age-wise, and has a growing reputation for getting the most out of his players. His style of play would also go down well at Anfield.</p>
              <p><strong>FRANK RIJKAARD</strong></p>
              <p>STARTED the Barcelona revolution by blooding Xavi, Andres Iniesta, Victor Valdes and Carles Puyol. Sacked in 2008 and lasted just 14 months at Galatasaray but still highly-rated.</p>
              <p><strong>DIDIER DESCHAMPS</strong></p>
              <p>THE 42-year-old will be the front-runner as and when Hodgson goes, having come close to getting the job when Rafa Benitez left. Led Marseille to their first title in 18 years and knows England after a year at Chelsea and only contract up to 2012.</p>
              <p><strong>JURGEN KLOPP</strong></p>
              <p>DORTMUND manager, 43, is rated as one of the best young bosses in Europe. His side are 10 points clear in the Bundesliga, and he is already being tipped for one of the game's real big jobs. Has a contract until 2014 but the lure of Liverpool would be hard to resist.</p>
              <p><strong>KENNY DALGLISH</strong></p>
              <p>A SENTIMENTAL choice but a short-term option until a permanent boss is found. A Kop legend and hugely popular with fans - and fact he's already there in an ambassadorial role would also make him a convenient option.</p>

              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Liverpool" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span></strong></a><strong><span style="color: #000000;">'s American owners are running out of patience with </span></strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Roy Hodgson" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/roy-hodgson"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Roy Hodgson</span></strong></a><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> amid fears that the manager's relationship with the club's supporters has broken down irretrievably.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Despite the fact that in one poll 95% of Liverpool fans wanted Hodgson to be sacked immediately after last night's 1-0 home defeat by Wolverhampton Wanderers, there appears to be no great appetite for regime change. John W Henry and Tom Werner of New England Sports Ventures are prepared to give Hodgson more time after six torturous months.</p>
              <p>However, Henry has already labelled performances this season "unacceptable" and the next three games – against Bolton Wanderers and Blackburn Rovers in the league and Manchester United in the FA Cup – are likely to be critical to Hodgson's chances of surviving until the summer, when his position will be reviewed.</p>
              <p>Henry and Werner, who run the Fenway Sports Group, through which NESV controls Liverpool, are understood to be concerned by the breakdown in relations between fans and the manager. A poll on the Liverpool website The Empire of the Kop drew more than 4,300 replies, with 95.5% of respondents answering yes to the question: "Do you want Roy Hodgson to be fired today?"</p>
              <p>His win rate of 41% is almost exactly the same as that achieved by Graeme Souness during his time at Anfield and is the poorest by any Liverpool manager since Bill Shankly created the modern club. The defeat by Wolves, which Hodgson considered Liverpool's worst performance of a dismal season, was dominated by ironic chants of "Hodgson for England" and by calls for Kenny Dalglish to take over.</p>
              <p>That latter scenario is unlikely to arise even if Hodgson is fired. Given his impassioned loyalty to Liverpool, Dalglish would be unlikely to refuse an offer to return to the job he quit in 1991. However, his candidacy to replace Rafael Benítez in the summer was rejected almost out of hand by the then managing director, Christian Purslow, and his successors are acutely aware that recalling a man who has been out of frontline football since a brief spell as Celtic's caretaker manager more than a decade ago would create more problems than it would solve.</p>
              <p>Fenway has no desire to install an interim manager and if Dalglish were unable to pull Liverpool out of their tailspin it would tarnish his glittering reputation and that of the board. If Dalglish were a qualified success, he may block Fenway's plans to bring in a young, long-term manager.</p>
              <p>The former Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard is the favourite, although Hodgson has pointed out that the Dutchman's last job at Galatasaray ended in failure. The Marseille coach, Didier Deschamps, who was interviewed for the post of Liverpool manager in the summer, has moved to distance himself from fresh speculation linking him with Anfield. He has let it be known he would not welcome an approach while Marseille are still in the Champions League and that his long-term aim is to manage the French champions when they move into a refurbished Stade Vélodrome in 2014.</p>
              <p>While recognising his position is precarious, Hodgson, who was voted the League Managers Association's manager of the year last season, insisted he still retained the support of a dressing-room that often failed to give Benítez its wholehearted backing. "I am lucky in that the support I have had has been from the players and from within the club," Hodgson said. "I haven't had a lot of support from the fans since I have been here. The fans have not been happy with what they have seen in the whole of 2010 and since I have come here we haven't won enough games to keep them happy.</p>
              <p>"That is the way of football. When you take on any job, especially a big job like this, and results do not go the way you want, especially at home, you are going to be a target for disapproval."</p>

              <p><strong>It Could Be Worse...</strong></p>
              <p><strong><br></strong>I can understand all the Liverpool fans being unhappy, but surely they are going a little OTT...surely they should spare a thought for us Villa fans, who, although we didn't lose to Wolves or Blackpool, are currently the Premier League's whipping boys under the (seemingly wayward) management of one of their previous 'messiahs'...one whole point above the bottom 3...remember boys, we finished above you last year, so our 'fall from grace' is statistically more spectacular (based on last season, not the one before, yes, yes I know you finished 2nd, I know, poor you)...if you can tell me which of our next 6 games (having lost all but 1 of our last bunch) will provide us with a win, I will be pleased to know...<br><br>It's not 'only a game' as my good lady always tells me, but get a grip Pool fans, it could be worse...<br><strong>Andrew 'No wonder they'll never walk alone, there's bloody loads of 'em' Millington AVFC</strong></p>

              <p><br><br><br><strong>Liverpool <em>Are</em> Mid-Table</strong><br>This is in relation to Mark Cohen, Johannesburg and his statement "We are not a mid-table club. And we never will be."<br><br>Now I am sorry for being pedantic about things in this situation, but I thought I might refer to you the Barclays Premier League Table which shows you in 12th. Correct me if I am wrong, but I think that is mid-table.<br><br>Conclusion: You are a mid-table club so please just deal with it. Leeds fans have had to deal with being a Championship team as did Newcastle last year. In fact, my team is in the SFL and are in administration for the second time in 10 years and are close to disappearing off the map. We have also lost 25 points in the process and may drop down a into SFL 2 at the end of the season, but have the support and history in which we should in theory be at the high end of the SPL. <br><br>The truth is, in practice we are not but you don't hear us saying we are not as SFL club and never will be. Deal with it as there are a lot of other football teams in a far worse position than your team are and there have been teams in a worse position than mine.<br><br>Anyway, thank Christ for the Premier League to take my mind off things.<br><strong>Stu (Aye, Scottish football is p*ss poor) Dundee</strong></p>

              <p></p>
              <p>I've never been published before so this would make a nice (albeit belated) Christmas present. <br><br>I have been a Liverpool fan all my life, and am a scouser, (which is rather unusual considering you need to speak Norwegian or Gaelic when you go to Anfield these days!!), and last night is by far and away the worst performance I have seen from any Liverpool team EVER.<br><br>I am not one of those who believes we should be sat at the top of the pile due to our illustrious history as I believe that history counts for nothing when you do nothing to add to that legacy. However, I do believe that we should at the very least be fighting to add to that legacy. <br><br>As far as last night's game goes we were awful, but credit where it is due, Wolves played very well. They gave us no time or space (not that any of those in red shirts last night looked like they had a clue or gave a toss anyway), and comprehensively out fought, out thought, out played and out classed us.<br><br>As far as Roy Hodgson goes the man has only ever been a stop gap. He came in at a time when the clubs ownership and financial future were in doubt.<br><br>He knows himself he is out of his depth and would NEVER have got the job under more 'normal' circumstances. But by the same token which manager, mediocre, moderately successful or a world beater would turn down the chance to manage a club like Liverpool? He is a nice enough man he just seems to be tactically inept, unable to motivate players and devoid of ideas when things are not going his way.<br><br>Which brings me to the players, whether this is some kind of half arsed protest against Roy I don't know, they just seem like they cannot be bothered and need only turn up to assure victory, and many of them would struggle to get into any other Premier League team based on their current form and attitude.<br><br>Rafa Benitez did not leave the greatest squad and recent acquisitions have been, for want of a better word, sh**e, and the new owners are yet to make any concrete pledges regarding what, if any, money will be made available for players either in January or the summer.<br><br>I think it is a forgone conclusion that Roy will go, it is a case of 'when' rather than 'if', but with no guarantees from the owners we cannot be sure a top quality replacement manager would be brought in and we do not know if any new manager would be given funds to revitalise, strengthen or rebuild what is essentially a very poor squad.<br><br>It saddens me as I never thought I would find myself writing these words about the club I have loved for the last 30 years but I fear the situation will not improve any time soon.<br><br>Rome wasn't built in a day but I fear it will be many years before Liverpool will again be competing at the very highest level.<br><strong>Gareth, Liverpool </strong></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p>
              </p><p><br><br><br><strong>Hodgson Is Kinda Right...<br></strong>Whilst it seems that Roy has signed his own death certificate with his comments about Liverpool fans, he is right in a way about the 'famous' Anfield roar. Watching last night was a painful experience. Not only were Liverpool abject, for me it was the anticipation of failure that really struck home. Roy has been brought in as a sacrificial lamb, put at the helm of a club living on past glories and desperately in need of venting their anger at someone, anyone, as long as they don't need to turn the mirror on themselves and realise what all of us already know. They've missed the bus. They had chance to cement themselves as a consistent top 4 club, but sold themselves down the river to a couple of dodgy yanks, and now that they have pimped themselves out and it didn't work, like a petulant child, they are spitting their dummy out good style. <br><br>There was a period in last night's game just after Wolves scored when I said 'If Liverpool of old were in this predicament you wouldn't be able to hear yourself think with all the noise you would have heard in the ground'. Granted, the Liverpool of old wouldn't have found themselves in that predicament, but the 12th man now appears to have realised that their beloved Liverpool has cheated on them by not running their ship correctly and kopping off (pardon the pun) with rich Americans they thought were going to come through with all the promises they made. Now, with all the other money being spent on other teams, Liverpool are simply one of the teams vying for a Europa place. <br><br>The top 5 now excludes them, and Liverpool find themselves as the bitter old spinster of the premiership, pretty in their day, but time has been a fickle mistress to them and instead of backing their side, the fans have finally turned on them. Roy is right in a way, whilst HE hasn't provided, so Liverpool fans have failed him AND the club they claim to love so much. I hope however that with all the scrweaming and scrweaming and scrweaming you'll get from the precious Liverpool fans you don't forget that Wolves put in a performance worthy of winning the game. <br><br>Seriously, Liverpool are that bad at the moment, if they were playing in my back garden I'd shut the curtains.<br><strong>Chris, (No back garden), Liverpool</strong></p>

              <p><strong>Understanding Hodgson And Asking What Liverpool Are Actually About</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p></p>
              <p>First of all let me say that I am not an apologist for Uncle Woy and if I did care about Liverpool I would think that it's time he should go. That said, Mark Cohen, what on earth are you talking about? Uncle Woy doesn't understand "what Liverpool is about"? Perhaps you could explain it to the rest of us non-Liverpool supporters because other than saying you're not a mid-table club (which, by the way if you look at the table, you clearly are) you don't seem to expand on what makes your club different to every other football club in the world.<br><br>Arsenal, Chelsea (the club that has my affection), Man Ure, Wigan, Romney Marsh FC are all the same, they want to score goals, keep clean sheets, win games and win their respective titles. Precisely (or even vaguely if that's all you can manage) what is it about Liverpool that makes you so different? Go on, tell me about your history, your fans, your record of titles and how this makes LFC special. Then look at your record over the last twenty years, stop being an arrogant p***k and realise that you and your team are not the centre of the universe or one of the top 5 or 6 teams in the Premier League even.<br><strong>Michael, London</strong><br></p>
              <p>
              </p><p><br><br><strong>Time For NESV To Act<br></strong>Since NESV has taken over, one got a feeling that they were good businessmen who would act shrewdly and do what is best for this club. So far, we have seen none of that. <br><br>NESV has to act and act now. Remove Hodgson immediately and look for a replacement. Forget the Liverpool way of showing loyalty to managers and remove the sentimental effect.<br><br>Liverpool need a real kick in its ass to change the pathetic condition in which they are and the owners need to make a point. <br><br>And oh, to our fans: Let's hope we DONT get Rafa or King Kenny. King Kenny has been out of the game for too long and will take too long to adjust. As for Rafa, it's a bit like wanting to get back with your ex girlfriend of 4 years. You remember the good times and the laughs, and remember what a nice person she is, but you realise why you broke up with her only when you get back with her. A return of the tedious 0-0 at home with route 1 football is not something I would want. Rafa is someone who I will support and someone who I always want the best for, but it would just be a step backwards.<br><br>It's really not that hard to get a world class manager. Pay him a lot of money and the promise of transfer fees and I challenge you to name me one manager who would NOT relish the prospect of bringing once mighty Liverpool, still the Greatest English Club, back from the dead.<br><strong>Siddharth V, LFC, India</strong></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;">After the shock 1-0 home defeat to lowly Wolves, Hodgson is facing calls to step down despite just six months in charge. The Reds currently sit just three points above the Barclays Premier League relegation zone after a disastrous start to the campaign.</span></p>
              <p><span>Hodgson has now insisted he will never quit Liverpool despite having to apologise for offending fans with his comments made after Wednesday's loss.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Supporters have added over 10,000 signatures to an online petition directed at owners Fenway Sports Group - led by John Henry and Tom Werner - calling for Hodgson to be removed immediately.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The accompanying letter, which runs to almost 3,000 words, lists the reasons why they want the former Fulham boss to be booted out.</span></p>
              <p><span>The letter is divided into sections highlighting Hodgson's perceived weaknesses, headlined 'Inexperience at the top level', 'Relationship with the fans/Communication with the media', 'Signings' and 'Statistics' before concluding with a final 'Please Act Now' plea.</span></p>
              <p><span>It starts: 'The undersigned plead with you to relieve our great club’s current manager, Mr Hodgson, of his duties immediately.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Upon purchase of the club, a key promise you made was to engage with and listen to the fans – we very much hope this was with a view to acting on issues we feel tremendously strongly about.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Indeed all have been impressed with your approach to managing the club and handling of the media to date, however now is the time to take swift and decisive action in respect of a matter vital to our progression. </span></p>
              <p><span>'This is not simply an unconsidered reaction following the loss to Wolves yesterday evening, though this was clearly an unacceptable result, but a culmination of events over the past six months.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Liverpool fans are widely regarded as knowledgeable and, crucially, extremely patient, and so the fact recent polls show that in excess of 95% wish to see Mr Hodgson removed from his position is evidence enough that it is time to fulfil your promise. Can a majority this overwhelming be ignored and, more importantly, all incorrect in their views?'</span></p>
              <p><span>'The fans all understand the potential argument for keeping Mr Hodgson, namely the importance of stability, however the current regime poses a threat even to this as, should we continue in our current vain, there is both little hope of attracting the calibre of player required to improve our fortunes and little chance of retaining players key to maintaining a solid core around which we can build.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Your willingness to stand by a manager is noble and it is encouraging that owners with a degree of patience still exist in the world of football, however it is crucial that this patience is only offered to an individual worthy of it. Results are clearly a key performance measure for any manager. </span></p>
              <p><span>'Results have without question been unacceptable under the current manager. However, Mr Hodgson also falls short in respect of an array of other measures as outlined below.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Mr Hodgson asked to be judged after 10 games. We have given him 18 and he has provided the worst start to a league campaign for 57 years. Even by his own measures, he deserves to go.'</span></p>
              <p><span>It is believed only a victory against Bolton at Anfield on Saturday is likely to save Hodgson following the shambolic defeat by Wolves. The club have even been forced to deny claims he has already left.</span></p>
              <p><span>Hodgson has apologised for offending fans with his comments made after the defeat at home to Wolves. He had to endure chants of 'Dalglish' and 'Hodgson for England'.</span></p>
              <p><span>Hodgson said after the game he had never had the 'famous Anfield support' in his six months in charge and that was interpreted as an attack on his critics in the crowd. However, the Reds boss insisted that was not the case.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Things have been misinterpreted,' said Hodgson. 'I'm afraid people have taken one small comment where I was describing my situation.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I was responding to a question about how it felt to be jeered by fans, making it clear it hurts me and I was disappointed by it because no-one wants to feel they are unpopular.</span></p>
              <p><span>

              <p><span>'But if I have offended them in any way I deeply regret that. All I can do is apologise and make it perfectly clear there was nothing offensive in my comments.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Hodgson said supporters were perfectly entitled to their views and accepted he and the team had to do more to improve their enjoyment.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Fans always have the right to show their anger and disapproval - we've got fantastic fans but you have to give them something to be passionate about and we didn't do that on Wednesday.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I don't think they were happy with anyone and as manager you are first in the firing line. The Anfield support will always be there and what's more it's better in times of crisis.'</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Hodgson also claimed that he will never quit as he remains convinced he is the man to lead the club back to former glories.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>He added: 'It has taken me a long while to get to this elevated position coaching one of the best clubs in Europe. I was very pleased to get the job - I left a very good job to take it - so the last thing in my mind is walking away from a club like this or walking away from football.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I want to be here, I want to change things, I want to turn it around and I want to help the club and the new owners get the success they want.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>'There is no security as a Premier League manager and when you take any job you don't take it for security, you take it because you believe you can do it and do it well.</span></p>
              <p><span>'No-one gives you security because having the job I have there are an awful lot of people who would like to be standing where I am today.</span></p>
              <p><span>There are a lot of people who believe they can do the job better so that would automatically diminish your security. But you believe you can justify the faith of other people who have appointed you.'</span></p>

              <p>I have already said I have reservations of him managing liverpool. I will say it again.</p>
              <p>He is a good coach thru his experiences managing switzerland, Inter and Fulham, but you need a winning coach, not a mere good coach to win you trophies. Hodgson is a good coach, make no mistake about it, but how many trophies has he won to classify him as a winner? you would not associate him with the likes of wenger, fergie, mourinho when it comes to winning isnt it.</p>
              <p>also he is shooting himself in his own foot by all his trash talks to the media after defeats and also thrashing his own players. he is a PR's nightmare. His buying spree also doesnt helps. that poulsen is a thrash player, as is konchesky. konchesky is a good player at fulham, but failed miserably at a bigger club.</p>
