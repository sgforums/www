            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Former Fifa referee Anders Frisk was disappointed with the actions of the Italian police towards Manchester United fans during their UEFA Champions League quarter-final first leg defeat to Roma.</strong><br><br>Frisk, who attended the game as a spectator, is no stranger to incidents at the Stadio Olimpico having refereed matches against Dynamo Kiev and Galatasaray where trouble flared in the stands.<br><br>"It was a very bad experience for me to be back in the Olympic Stadium and this time witnessing something that was not good for the game of football," Frisk told the website.<br><br>"I think the approach from the Italian police was (to blame), in my opinion. My feeling from the beginning was that they were very close to the United supporters.<br><br>"Maybe what started it was something being thrown and I think the Italian police reacted very, very aggressively towards one or two incidents and this is what caused everything to flare in my opinion."<br><br>Frisk, who is promoting a soccer website alongside Patrick Vieira and Rudi Voller, also criticised the security staff at the stadium.<br><br>He continued: "I went as a normal fan and when I went through the gates I was not searched at all so of course if you don't search people they will bring in bottles and things to throw at each other so that was a major mistake."<br><br>Frisk was forced to abandon the match between Roma and Dynamo Kiev in September 2004 after being hit by an object thrown from the crowd.<br><br>However, the Swede does not think Wednesday's referee Herbert Fandel ever considered calling a halt to the game, which Roma won 2-1.<br><br>"I don't think he really had that in his mind," Frisk said. "If I could read his body language when he was out on the pitch he was very concentrated on doing a good job.<br><br>"I didn't think he had any communications with the representatives from security about abandoning the match.<br><br>"I think it was actually better to continue this match because if we had stopped this match maybe the conflict would have been even more extensive."<br><br>Meanwhile, Frisk has called for improved communication throughout the game to avoid future incidents, and believes the lack of trouble inside English stadiums can be attributed to this.<br><br>He added: "It's about how you communicate with people, it's important for coaches, for players, for referees, for police and for fans to make the right communications because if you don't then you will have conflict in the match." </span></div>
