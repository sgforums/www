              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>GOOD news for pay-TV viewers.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Whoever wins the rights to the 2014 English Premier League (EPL), they will be able to watch it on their current set-top box.</strong></p>
              <p>The Government on Friday announced that pay-TV providers like SingTel and StarHub will have to carry exclusive content purchased by another player, a move expected to make such content more accessible and cheaper for consumers. This is unlike the situation today where EPL matches - exclusive to SingTel - are only available on its mio TV service.</p>
              <p>Under the revised Media Market Conduct Code, pay-TV providers must also charge all viewers the same fee for exclusive content they have the rights to, whether they are its customers or another player's.</p>
              <p>The new regulations, though, will apply to all contracts signed from Friday, said Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts Lui Tuck Yew, who announced the changes in Parliament. He added that the new measure will not apply retrospectively to existing agreements such as the 2010 to 2013 BPL broadcast rights.</p>
              <p>This means that SingTel will not have to share its 2010 to 2013 English Premier League live broadcasts with StarHub, although the company that wins the right to show the 2014 EPL will have to do so. The Straits Times understands that most pay-TV contracts are for two to three year durations, so most pay-TV programmes should be viewable on all set-top boxes by 2013, and many before that.</p>
              <p>This move, a major overhaul to how pay-TV content is bought, sold and distributed, is also acknowledgment that the intense competition between the two rival pay-TV providers has hurt consumers in convenience, choice and cost.</p>
              <p>A Government study on the pay-TV market, for instance, found that out of the 179 pay-TV channel, only seven are common to both players. And of 16 channels popular with viewers worldwide, Singapore was the only country that had exclusive arrangements for all the channels.</p>
              <p>Costs to watch sports programming too, had risen, from about $33 in 2000 to $74 today. This situation, said Mr Lui, was 'unlikely to self-correct in the near future, and steps need to be taken to address this market failure'.</p>

              <div class="sidestorytitle"><strong>Response from StarHub</strong></div>
              <p>STARHUB notes the comments made by the Acting Minister and MDA in regard to content exclusivity on Friday. While we will be making our comments on MDA's consultation paper in due course, we would like to provide a few points at this juncture.</p>
              <p>In regard to the new content exclusivity regime proposed by MDA, we note that it appears to be similar to StarHub's proposal of November 2009 when we first suggested the idea of carrying future Barclay Premier League broadcast carriages over our cable TV network.</p>
              <p>As such, StarHub fully supports the Government's efforts to ensure fair and reasonable content costs, as this will ultimately benefit StarHub and our customers. In addition, we support the idea of having a common set-top box for consumers in Singapore, as it gives our customers greater convenience, cost-savings and quality assurance.</p>
              <p>We understand that the proposed regime will not be applied retrospectively to StarHub's existing agreements with our channel partners. As a result, the new regime will have little impact on us in the foreseeable future.</p>
              <p>Due to strict confidentiality and business obligations, we are not able to provide details of our existing agreements with our content partners, nor will we be able to provide information on upcoming content that is up for renewal or bidding.</p>
              <p>With over a decade of operating a pay TV service in Singapore, StarHub has accumulated extensive experience in delivering not only a comprehensive range of pay TV content in the market, but also in ensuring that the overall customer experience continues to be excellent.</p>
              <p>We have always worked hard to innovate our services, as can be seen in our Interactive TV and On-Demand offerings and we will continue to do so in future, in order to further differentiate ourselves over our competitors.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="sidestorytitle"><strong>Response from M1</strong></div>
              <p>'WE welcome this positive development. It opens up the opportunity for M1 to enter the pay-TV market to offer a full range of services to our customers.</p>
              <p>Consumers will ultimately benefit from more choices and a greater variety of content at competitive prices'.</p>
