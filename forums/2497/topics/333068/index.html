              <p><strong>Sunday was the day that the Aston Villa
                  juggernaut was set to send the Premiership in circles by derailing what
                  is turning out to be one of the most astonishing records in Premiership
                  history. Instead of ranting about what Chelsea football club have done, this will be a more interactive article involving every football fan.</strong></p>
              <p>Take the team you support, and try to remember (without opening
                  another tab on your explorer) the last time that 3 points were hijacked
                  from Stamford Bridge by your team…?</p>
              <p>Have you found out yet? Well here are answers for some of the
                  football community, while I would genuinely be interested for those
                  clubs outside the following to let me know:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Arsenal fans will point to February 2004 when Claudio Ranieri’s team fell to the eventual champions.</li>
              <li>Manchester United are not so lucky and will have to grab at the tail of a 2002 memory, back when a Paul Scholes stunner set United to a 3-0 win.</li>
              <li>Liverpool are not too far behind Arsenal, snatching a 1-0 win back in January 2004.</li>
              <li> Looking across to the blue side of Liverpool, Everton have not gained victory in West London since November 1994.</li>
              <li>Bolton picked up a 2-1 win in 2003 thanks to a late John Terry own goal, but had not won for 28 years before that.</li>
              <li>Sunderland grabbed a surprising 4-2 triumph in March 2001.</li>
              <li>FA cup holders Portsmouth haven’t won at Stamford Bridge in 53 years.</li>
              <li>After Sunday, Aston Villa haven’t won in their last 7 trips to Chelsea.</li>
              <li>Blackburn picked up all 3 points in a 2-1 victory over the blues in 2003.</li>
              <li>And although Tottenham
                  are at the wrong end of most jokes recently….Spurs’ last League victory
                  at Stamford Bridge was 18 years ago, Gary Lineker hitting the winner as
                  they beat Chelsea 2-1 in February 1990.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>However, most of these results were before the invasion of Roman Abramovich and his seemingly bottomless pockets of cash. None of the above victories took place during Jose Mourinho’s
                  time in London and none have since. The special one has installed a
                  mentality to the squad that you just don’t lose at home. On the other
                  hand, there is hope for people outside the SW6.</p>
              <p>Many teams have taken points away from West London during this long run (and I am not talking about Craven Cottage.) Wigan followed Blackburn Rovers, Fulham,
                  Everton, Aston Villa and Liverpool in taking a point from Stamford
                  Bridge last season, while from December the previous term Chelsea were
                  held at home by Arsenal, Reading, Fulham, Bolton Wanderers, Manchester United and Everton.</p>
              <p>The only other team to come close to this achievement was a record
                  set previously by Liverpool who had an all-time run of 63 games
                  unbeaten at home between February 1978 and January 1981. This was the
                  standing record until it was beaten by Chelsea’s current standing in
                  Aril 2007. Manchester United put together there own unbeaten run at
                  home last season, but next door neighbours Man City swiftly put an end
                  to that with a 2-0 victory.</p>
              <p>There is an old saying that nothing goes on forever….Someone just has to tell Chelsea that!</p>
