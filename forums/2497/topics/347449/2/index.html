              <p>1st reason is that not much british players or any players around the world played for a club for such long period of time.</p>
              <p>2nd is his achievements while playing for the club = awesome....</p>
              <p>3rd he is royal to clubs and always avoiding limelight/bad press</p>

              <p>I like starhawk's reply... And I agree very much...</p>
              <p>What else must he do to achieve his knighthood???</p>
              <p>He has scored in every season for the past 17 seasons. He's the most decorated English Premiership player. He has the most appearances at Utd. He won Goal of the Season in 1999 against Arsenal. He's less controversial on / off the pitch. I think that's very much deserving. And I'm sure a lot of rival fans would say that even though they hate Utd, it is very difficult to hate someone like Ryan Giggs who doesn't cheat nor dive...</p>

              <p>Gerrard has only MBE and that's like Singapore's PBM..SAF is not knighted under the orders of chivalry but under Knights Bachelor..meaning though he is "Sir", he doesn't have the suffix (Knight of the British Empire)..and I'm sure Ryan Giggs will be knighted as a Knight Bachelor...sportsmen of other sports like rugby, canoeing,sailing,cycling (like Chris Hoy who was knighted for winning the Olympic gold medal <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">) are easily given knighthoods and MBEs...</p>

              are Tom Finney, Bobby Charlton, Geoff Hurst, Alex Ferguson and
              Trevor Brooking as well as Bobby Robson in 2002... I guess they
              will have to be 40 and above before they can be consider for
              knighthood.</p>
