            <div class='col-md body'><p>I feel that liverpool board been making mistakes after mistakes in their appointments since 1991, when Souness was made the manager to replace kenny after he resigned. When Souness resigned or sacked, he was replaced by Roy Evans, another diastrous appointment. Houllier and Rafa had mixed successes, they won UEFA and CL and finished second. what liverpool truly want is the league title. Roy Hodgson is clearly not the manager to lead liverpool to its first title since 1991. just look at the way his team play football on the pitch.</p></div>

              <p>You said Blackburn gave an own goal to Liverpool to make it 2-1. The 2nd goal that Torres scored was no way near being an own goal and now I checked that the first goalthe Greek scored is not credited as an own goal. Instead the goal that blackburn scored was credited an own goal. So why not LUCKY that Blackburn scored an equaliser but when we scored, its LUCK?</p>

              <p>just for the record.</p>
              <p>a ball shot on target no matter who touched it last would be counted as the one who shot the goal initially.</p>
              <p>yesterday was counted as carragher own goal is because the initial shot has already been blocked by reina or skrtel cant remember, and hit back to carragher which unfortunately hit his legs and into the goal.</p>

              <p>I feel that liverpool board been making mistakes after mistakes in their appointments since 1991, when Souness was made the manager to replace kenny after he resigned. When Souness resigned or sacked, he was replaced by Roy Evans, another diastrous appointment. Houllier and Rafa had mixed successes, they won UEFA and CL and finished second. what liverpool truly want is the league title. Roy Hodgson is clearly not the manager to lead liverpool to its first title since 1991. just look at the way his team play football on the pitch.</p>

              <p><br>To be honest, yesterday was the best Liverpool game so far.</p>
              <p>Before this RH's team always plays super defensive without pressuring on the opponent, allowing the opponent to roam free on Liverpool's half. Yesterday Liverpool seems to play high above Blackburn's half with alot of pressure hence winning alot of ball back immediately. To keep playing this, Liverpool need another Mascherano and a strong/quick defender.</p>
