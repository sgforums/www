              <p> </p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson reckons the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Premier League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span></a> is getting harder, and cites Birmingham's rise under Alex McLeish as proof that standards throughout the league have improved this season.</p>
              <p>He would say that though, wouldn't he? Most people think the fact that a modest outfit such as Birmingham are sitting in the top eight and scaring the pants off bigger clubs is evidence that Premier League standards have fallen, and that everyone from the top four down are not as rich or as invincible as they used to be. Well, <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester City" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester City</span></a> are richer than they used to be and quite possibly on their way to being invincible now they have stopped drawing all their matches, though they will need to beat someone a little more testing than Sunderland, Stoke or Middlesbrough to convince everyone that a revolution has taken place.</p>
              <p>It is also difficult to argue that the Premier League is better than ever when players who left it thinking their time was up are returning two or three years later. City have just signed Patrick Vieira, Arsenal do not seem to be ruling out the possibility of Sol Campbell playing for them again and, at 31, Barry Ferguson looks a far better player for Birmingham than he did seven years ago in his first spell in England with Blackburn. At this rate Manchester United will soon be turning to David Beckham again. While they may not be able to afford him this time round there is little doubt he would get into the team.</p>
              <p>Vieira is particularly interesting because he went to Italy in the first place because it was felt he was no longer a force in the Premier League. Arsène Wenger seemed to feel that way, in any case, otherwise he would never have let him go. Lately, even the slower Italian game seemed to be passing Vieira by, so a return to Premier League pell-mell has to be regarded as a gamble, and an expensive one at that. Someone of the calibre of Nigel de Jong or Gareth Barry will have to make way for Vieira at Eastlands and, while it could be argued a driving midfielder who can break up opposing attacks and intelligently launch new ones is exactly what City need, it remains to be seen whether the Frenchman is still that player. This seems like a case of <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Roberto Mancini" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/roberto-mancini"><span style="color: #005689;">Roberto Mancini</span></a> wanting to bring a trusted friend into a foreign dressing room, to give him an ally within the team, yet for precisely that reason it could blow up in his face if Vieira struggles to justify his selection.</p>
              <p>Mancini seems to have enjoyed initial success at City by not having friends or preconceptions and giving everyone the chance of a fresh start, a bit like Sven-Goran Eriksson did when he first came to England. That is not how the Eriksson story ended, however. In the end he was rightly pilloried for hanging on to certain players for too long and having obvious favourites within the camp, and it would be ironic if another import from Italy given a clean slate made life hard for himself in the same way.</p>
              <p>All that can be safely said at this stage is that Mancini has made an odd choice of keynote signing, and that if Vieira succeeds it will be the best indication yet that the Premier League is nowhere near as quick and energetic as it thinks it is. It is probably not as good as it used to be either, judging by some of the FA Cup games last weekend. Maybe it is just a top-four decline, but it would be hard to imagine the Manchester United of a couple of years ago being slapped around the chops so publicly by a team from two divisions below, or Liverpool being pathetically grateful to escape with a draw from Reading, two places above the Championship relegation zone.</p>
              <p>None of the traditional top four have been as convincing this season as they have seemed in the past. Only Chelsea have looked genuinely menacing, though they appear to have lost the ability to do it to order and remain a fairly elderly squad growing old together. United now look as if they are not the same team without Carlos Tevez, never mind Cristiano Ronaldo, and the deterioration evident in their FA Cup performance could soon be writ larger if they are as uncompetitive when the Champions League resumes. Liverpool, already out of that competition, are entering a new contest called How Long Can They Keep Hold of Torres and Gerrard? while Arsenal, though ticking along fairly well at the moment, have a long game called Life After Fábregas.</p>
              <p>Perhaps this is no more than a crisis of confidence, and perhaps we ought to be reassured that if the set-in-stone top four finally crumbles, young thrusters such as Aston Villa, City and Spurs are ready to take their place. We should be excited. Change at last! But can we really rely on Villa, City and Spurs to kill the old king? When City signed Vieira Harry Redknapp came out and admitted he had been on the same trail himself. That's progress? This is a 33-year-old midfielder shown the door by Arsenal five years ago, when everyone agreed Wenger had seen the best of him. Small wonder Rafael Benítez can "guarantee" a top-four finish for Liverpool.</p>
