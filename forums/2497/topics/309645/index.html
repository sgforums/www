              <p class="ss-text-bold">Chelsea have appealed against the red card given to Frank Lampard at West Ham on Saturday.</p>
              <p> Although The Blues won the game 4-0 at Upton Park, they were
                  made to play for just under an hour with 10 men following Lampard's
                  dismissal.</p>
              <p>Lampard saw red for violent conduct after lashing out at Luis
                  Boa Morte after the pair clashed just outside Chelsea's penalty area.</p>
              <p> The former West Ham midfielder was given a straight red by
                  referee Peter Walton, although Chelsea have now claimed wrongful
                  dismissal.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's appeal will be heard by a Regulatory Commission on Tuesday 4th March</p>

              <p>All those prone to seizures, spasms or suicidal thoughts, look away now.</p>
              <p>Martin
              Taylor is serving a three-match ban for the challenge that turned
              Eduardo's ankle 180 degrees and Frank Lampard will do the same after an
              assistant referee took offence to his petulant shove on Luis Boa Morte.</p>
              <p>The Barclays Premier League has gone potty. Official.</p>
              <p><strong>Scroll down for more</strong></p>
              <div id="ArtContentImgBodyC" style="width: 470px;"><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_01/lampardDM0203_468x698.jpg" border="1" alt="lampard" width="468" height="698">
              <p class="caption">Flashpoint: Lampard has words with Boa Morte</p>
              </div>
              <p>Chelsea generals met in the war room on Sunday to discuss tactics as
              they consider an appeal, but it should be a no-brainer; all out attack
              is the only option.</p>
              <p>If they grit their teeth, Lampard will be in
              the stands for games against Barnsley in the FA Cup and the 'gimmes'
              against Derby and Sunderland.</p>
              <p>If they bare their teeth instead,
              it raises the alarming prospect that the FA will apply the 'Aliadiere
              principle' and add an extra game to his punishment.</p>
              <p>Should
              Lampard make a stand and be prepared for the possibility that he will
              then miss the chance to avenge their Carling Cup Final defeat by
              Tottenham on March 19?</p>
              <p>Decisions, decisions.</p>
              <p>To take this
              on the chin — and how Lampard must be wishing that is exactly where he
              had planted his retribution for Boa Morte's part in his dismissal —
              would be to gloss over a miscarriage of justice.</p>
              <p>Not quite on the same scale as the Birmingham Six, but baffling all the same.</p>
              <p>For all his talent, Boa Morte is undoubtedly the Premier League's most irritating player.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div id="ArtContentImgBodyC" style="width: 470px;"><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_01/arsenalDM0203_468x303.jpg" border="1" alt="eduardo" width="468" height="303">
              <p class="caption">One
              rule for one, one for another? Last weekend, Martin Taylor was rightly
              sent off for his rash challenge on Eduardo, but on Saturday, Claude
              Makelele's almost identical lunge at Julien Faubert went unpunished
              (see picture below)</p>
              </div>
              <p>He twice called it on with Chelsea
              captain John Terry in the opening half hour, but his tangle with
              Lampard should have taken referee Peter Walton no more than 10 seconds
              to sort out.</p>
              <p>Instead assistant referee Guy Beale summoned Walton to the sidelines and Lampard was sent off for the second time in his career.</p>
              <p>Just
              imagine 'Big Fat Frank', as the West Ham supporters joyously belted out
              while he walked off the pitch in the 35th minute, flanked by lawyers on
              the steps of Soho Square later this week and contemptuously admitting
              that the FA are bastions of the beautiful game.</p>
              <p>Make a stand, Frank.</p>
              <p>"I
              have no problem with the referee, only the assistant," claimed Avram
              Grant — the Chelsea manager who appeared more relieved that his side
              responded so emphatically at the end of a week he wishes he had never
              had.</p>
              <p>"The referee said it was very clear that Lampard touched
              the face of Boa Morte and if he did it's a red card. If not, then it's
              not a red card."</p>
              <p>Still, it was hardly the red mist.</p>
              <p>Chelsea
              saved that for their opponents with a display of such attacking intent
              in the opening half hour there was talk of supplanting the Premier
              League's record score.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div id="ArtContentImgBodyC" style="width: 470px;"><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_01/makeleleDM0203_468x360.jpg" border="1" alt="makelele" width="468" height="360"></div>
              <p>After
              Lampard kissed the badge in front of the West Ham fans following his
              penalty — awarded for Anton Ferdinand's trip on Salomon Kalou —
              Curbishley's side kissed goodbye to the game.</p>
              <p>Joe Cole sent the
              sweetest of half-volleys beyond Robert Green with his left foot that
              merited more than the muted celebrations from the former West Ham
              midfielder.</p>
              <p>Lampard then spotted Michael Ballack's blindside run
              and the Germany captain volleyed the floated pass with the outside of
              his boot beyond the West Ham keeper.</p>
              <p>Three down in 30 minutes, West Ham were dead and buried.</p>
              <p>"If they didn't score three goals, we would have been on level terms at the break," protested Curbishley.</p>
              <p>It seems that sending-off affected everyone.</p>
              <p>Chelsea
              were awesome but even the game's golden moments — Cole and Ballack's
              goals deserve joint billing — were overshadowed by the colossal
              performance of Terry.</p>
              <p>The England captain was back to his very best while outbattling Carlton Cole.</p>
              <p>He
              was immense, but others deserve credit; Ashley Cole returned to the
              side and scored his first Chelsea goal, Ballack was a towering figure
              in midfield, Paulo Ferreira was excellent and Joe Cole can take
              enormous satisfaction from his performance.</p>
              <p>Sadly for the manager, Roman Abramovich is electioneering in Russia and was not at Upton Park.</p>
              <p>"He saw the game on television," claimed Grant. "I know he would see our games — even if he was on an island on the moon."</p>
              <p>It was certainly a performance from another planet. And that didn't just apply to Guy Beale.</p>

              <h1>Ref: Lampard Red A Mistake</h1>
              <h2>Chelsea are likely to see Frank Lampard let-off a suspension after
              referee Peter Walton admitted he was wrong to show the midfielder a red
              card in the 4-0 win at Upton Park on Saturday.</h2>
              <p>The England international instigated the Blues victory by scoring the
              opener from the penalty spot, before playing a part in Joe Cole’s and
              Michael Ballack’s goals. <br><br>However, after half-an-hour the former West Ham youth product
              was sent from the field for reacting to a bad foul by Louis Boa Morte. <br><br>Walton had already given the foul but the assistant referee
              deemed an incident during the minor fracas that ensued as violent
              conduct on Lampard’s part, advising the referee to show the red-card. <br><br>Now though, it is understood that Walton wrote to the FA
              yesterday stating that he had looked at the incident again by video
              replay and concluded that he made an error in judgment. <br><br>Chelsea appealed the decision Monday morning and it will now
              be heard by a four-man judicial commission on Tuesday, with Walton's
              testimony likely to swing the final judgment.</p>

              <p>Though i didn't watch the match so didn't want to comment on it,

              knock, it seems rather heavy and the linesman caught him
              doing it... Another thing is I thought the all important
              first goal was a result from a Kalou dived... Oh well...</p>

              <p>I understand... Just like Paul Scholes took a swing at one of the Pool player and was rightfully sent off tho there was certainly inches between them and definitely no contact, but there was still intent... Thats the point i am making, here i actually think Lampard may have made contact with Boa Morte's face enough for the linesman to bring to the referee's knowledge...</p>

              <h1>Gibson hits out at FA favouritism</h1>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Chelsea midfielder Lampard won his appeal on
              Tuesday against his sending-off in Saturday's Premier League victory at
              West Ham, when he and Luis Boa Morte clashed. He will now not serve a
              three-match ban.</p>
              <p>Boro were furious when their appeal against Jeremie Aliadiere's
              red card at Liverpool the previous weekend was dismissed as
              "frivolous", costing the striker an additional one-game ban.</p>
              <p>Aliadiere was dismissed after slapping Javier Mascherano on the cheek.</p>
              <p>Gibson said in the Daily Star: "I am trying hard to make sense of it all. It astonishes me. The whole system is flawed.</p>
              <p>"It was the right decision by the FA to take way Lampard's dismissal as TV evidence showed there was nothing violent.</p>
              <p>"But how can the FA say that was any different to that involving Aliadiere?"</p>
              <p>An FA spokesman told The Times: "The FA treats all cases on their merits.</p>
              <p>"We would refute any suggestion that one club is being treated differently to another."</p>
