              <p><strong>Emotions will be running high at the San Siro
              on Sunday as AC Milan's fans bid farewell to captain Paolo Maldini
              after 24 years and 901 games for the club.</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.coachgianni.com/about_me_images/maldini-1.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="364"></p>
              <p class="inside-copy"><strong>Having announced his retirement only to change
              his mind over the last few seasons, the 40 year-old Maldini is finally
              hanging up his boots.</strong></p>
              <p class="inside-copy">The match against AS Roma comes a week before
              the last game of the season away to Fiorentina and will bring to an end
              a career in which he has won seven Italian league titles, five
              Champions Leagues and 126 caps for Italy.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">"He is a great player and a great teammate,"
              midfielder Gennaro Gattuso said. "I think the true definition of a
              player like him is a 'gladiator,' a player who when he wears the
              captain's armband goes onto the pitch to give everything.</p>
              <p class="inside-copy">"He is a great player, even when he doesn't
              play. Personally he has helped me a lot and made me understand many
              things. It will be a truly emotional end to his career on Sunday."</p>

                  previously expressed interest in adding to his Italian record

              <p>As he prepares to play his final game for AC Milan, Paolo Maldini has called for Kaka to inherit the club captaincy.</p>
              <p>âI am feeling some strong emotions at the moment,â Maldini told the <em>Milan Channel</em>.</p>
              <p>âI see this final game as a celebration of the past 25 years and I will have my friends and family around me.</p>
              <p>âI hope I have the strength to play well and win as that would be the best way to celebrate with the people who wish me well.</p>
              <p>âThere is a time when a player must take on more responsibility and I
              feel that my departure has brought about that time for Kaka. I think he
              will be here for a long.</p>
              <p>âHe has aspired to being captain and I think he has the right personality to do it.â</p>

              <p>Maldini deserves all the tributes he is receiving. Now we wait for Christian to step up and inherit the No. 3 jersey.</p>

              <p><strong>Totti winner ruins Maldini's San Siro farewell</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Paolo Maldini's last match for AC Milan at San Siro ended in a 3-2
              loss to AS Roma on Sunday, with the 40-year-old defender's side beaten
              by Francesco Totti's late free kick.</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2009/SPORT/football/05/24/italy.milan.maldini/art.maldini.jpg" alt="" width="292" height="219"></p>
              <p><strong>Maldini, who made his Milan
              debut as a gangly 16-year-old substitute back in 1985, has won a string
              of trophies including seven Italian league titles and five European
              Cups with the club.</strong></p>
              <p>But there was no happy ending in front of the
              home fans as his side twice had to equalize before finally being beaten
              by Totti's free kick in the 85th minute.</p>
              <p>John Arne Riise opened the scoring for Roma just before halftime, but Massimo Ambrosini brought Milan level in the 75th.</p>
              <p>Jeremy
              Menez restored Roma's lead five minutes later, Ambrosini drew Milan
              level again, but Totti stepped up to score the winner.</p>
              <p>Ambrosini, who had kept his side in the game, was then sent off two minutes from time for arguing with referee Andrea De Marco.</p>
              <p>Milan's last game of the season takes Maldini and his teammates to Fiorentina next weekend.</p>

              <h1>Milan Ultras Leave Black Mark On Maldini Celebrations</h1>
              <h2>During his final salute to the Milan faithful, the Rossoneri Ultras
              revealed an undeserved stain of contempt towards their most loyal
              servant.</h2>

              <p><strong>AfterÂ Roma had refused to follow the script by running out 3-2 winners
              on Maldiniâs final day out at the San Siro,Â came another twist in the
              party celebrations, as the <em>Curva Sud </em>displayed a banner that was sure to spark controversy.</strong><br><br>As
              the legendary captain did a final lap of honour after the game, the
              Milan Ultras displayed a large banner directed towards another
              legendary captain, Franco Baresi. Under a large number 6, the words <em>âthere is only one captainâ</em> were there for all to see.<br><br>At
              the same time, there were even some whistles from the same section of
              the stands in a display of unbelievable disrespect for a captain who
              has given a life of service to the Rossoneri.<br><br>Despite the disrespect of the <em>Curva,</em> the remainder of the stadium gave a prolonged standing ovation to
              Maldini, who was quite obviously moved by their display of affection.</p>
