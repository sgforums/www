              <p>The Malaysian airline entrepreneur now owns a 66 per cent stake in the club after buying out previous majority shareholders Flavio Briatore and Bernie Ecclestone.</p>
              <p>Fernandes said: "QPR is a raw diamond and hopefully I can contribute into turning it into a diamond.</p>
              <p>"I've always wanted to be involved in football and the appeal of a London club like QPR, was too good an opportunity to turn down.</p>
              <p>"I lived in Uxbridge Road for many years and grew up around the area.</p>
              <p>"Everyone knows I've followed West Ham all my life, but I've always had a soft spot for QPR.</p>
              <p>"Rangers were one of the first teams I watched as a child at Loftus Road.</p>
              <p>"It's funny how life has a way of spinning things round. It goes full circle sometimes."</p>
              <p>Vice chairman Amit Bhatia has returned to the club under Fernandes and will hold the remaining 33 per cent of shares.</p>
              <p>He said: "I'm very excited to welcome Tony to QPR and having spent considerable time with him, know that we share the same vision and values.</p>
              <p>"We have discussed in great detail how to restore pride at the club and I'm very pleased with the outcome of these discussions.</p>
              <p>"It was a very difficult decision to resign from the board when I did.</p>
              <p>"I'm thrilled to be back and would like to thank all those who supported me and my family and look forward to serving the club to the best of my abilities again.</p>
              <p>"Tony and I will work alongside each other to try and make this season as exciting and successful as possible.</p>
              <p>"I love this club and this is a very happy day for me."</p>

              <p>Their former owners are rich, but 2 of them can't get along with one of them... The other 2 only wanted to take them into the premiership then sell them for a profit I guess as they never showed any real interest in wanting to make the club great...</p>
              <p>Tony Fernandes is an interesting fellow and he has even brought back the guy who had really cared for the club Vice chairman Amit Bhatia... Should be a good set-up for them compare to the previous 2 F1 bosses, though very rich but not really interested kind...</p>

              <p><strong>Queens Park Rangers' new owner, Tony Fernandes, has vowed to review contentious ticket price rises before the club's next home match and to reconnect with disenfranchised fans after taking control in a £35m deal.</strong></p>
              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Neil Warnock" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/neil-warnock"><span style="color: #005689;">Neil Warnock</span></a> hailed the deal, which ends the turbulent tenure of Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore, as "momentous", the manager saying it would give him the platform to keep the club in the Premier League. "It's a fantastic day for me personally. As a manager, results determine if you get the sack. You hope you are given a fair crack of the whip and have an opportunity to try."</p>
              <p>Warnock will now target players including West Ham United's Scott Parker. "Up to today I did fear if we had enough structure to progress. To be on a level playing field with a third or two-thirds of the Premier League is a great opportunity for me, my staff and my players."</p>
              <p>Fernandes, with a personal fortune estimated at more than £200m, underlined his support for Warnock and promised to back him in the transfer market, with a renewed bid for Parker already under consideration. The Malaysian, a lifelong West Ham fan who has failed in two attempts to buy the East End club and in the process fell out with David Gold and David Sullivan, said he had always had a "soft spot" for <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on QPR" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/qpr"><span style="color: #005689;">QPR</span></a>, having lived on the Uxbridge Road for "many years".</p>
              <p>But although the AirAsia chief executive pledged funds to invest in the long-term development of the club's academy and infrastructure, and is believed to have promised Warnock around £10m for players, he said fans should not expect a benefactor with limitless funds."I don't believe you can run any venture that isn't profitable. You have to build a proper structure for the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Business" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/business"><span style="color: #005689;">business</span></a> to develop," he said.</p>
              <p>Fernandes, the co-owner of Formula One's Team Lotus, pointed to his experience in that sport in controlling costs and exploring the potential for exploiting social media and new ways of engaging with fans and sponsors.</p>
              <p>"My whole life has been building things. At AirAsia I bought the airline for £250,000 and it was two planes and losing lots of money," Fernandes said. "In the first year we did 200,000 passengers and 10 years on we're doing 32 million. I think football is a fantastic business if run well and it's a fantastic brand-building business for the things that we do."</p>
              <p>His long-term business partner, Kamarudin Bin Meranun, has also invested in the deal and will join the board. Fernandes said QPR were a "rough diamond" in a "fantastic location" and had "huge potential to develop into something special".</p>
              <p>Despite winning promotion to the Premier League, disgruntled fans have been concerned by huge ticket price rises and a lack of investment in the team. Fernandes said they would "definitely" review ticket prices.</p>
              <p>"We will seek views from the management and fans. Talk is easy but implementation is much more difficult. My view is that this is a club for everybody and, if we have to make changes, we will. If we are to make an announcement, it will be before the next home game."</p>
              <p>Amit Bhatia, who resigned as chairman in May after clashing with Briatore over issues including ticket prices, will return to the club as vice chairman. Lakshmi Mittal, the Indian steel magnate with a £17.5bn fortune, has retained his 33% stake in the club. Phil Beard, who was director of marketing for London's successful 2012 Olympic bid and oversaw the Millennium Dome's conversion into the O2 arena, will be the club's new chief executive.</p>
              <p>Fernandes said that he and Bhatia would explore the possibilities for exploiting QPR in Asia and India and said his AirAsia and Malaysian brands would be "heavily involved" in the club. One of them is likely to be emblazoned on QPR's shirts.</p>
              <p>Fernandes, an avid Tweeter, said he hoped to use social media to make bring the club closer to fans. "The power of social media is to be as close to the fanbase as you can. They can interact with you and tell you good and bad. That's the way I want to run the club, I want to be open and transparent." He said he had already received hundreds of messages from fans.</p>
              <p>Warnock, who saw his team beaten 4-0 at home by Bolton Wanderers in their first Premier League match for 15 years, said it was unlikely any new faces would come in before Saturday's match at Everton but he would be "disappointed" if there were none before their match against Wigan Athletic on 27 August.</p>
              <p>"We have got to look to the future now. It gives me a fighting chance to bring the players in that I think are needed to stabilise us at the top level," Warnock said.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I don't think he has the financial muscle to let QPR stay afloat in the long term. Net worth of USD 230m definitely cannot be compared with Abramovich's billions. First he says he's a west ham fan, then now QPR. Very business minded person. Let's see if he stays on when QPR is relegated. The Air Asia logo will see the lesser lights of championship football.</p></div>

              <p>Give them time to settle in, but don't expect them to go against the likes of Chelsea kind... They will be good once they manage to stable the club... Their competitors should be the Sunderland, Blackburn, Fulham, Bolton types...</p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>The talented but occasionally overelaborate Adel Taarabt - Warnock joked he 'did tricks to the invisible man' - started the move after 31 minutes which saw Akos Buszaky feed Smith, who curled a low finish past Tim Howard from 12 yards.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The mood among fans is low after a summer without a signing and Moyes said: 'The crowd probably were disappointed when I took Jermaine Beckford off but as a football person it was the right choice.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'Jermaine had struggled in the game and we got closer to scoring after (Marouane) Fellaini came on.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'People know our current situation. The team will be the ones to make things better or worse and today they couldn't make it better.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I told the players I was disappointed with them, but not Ross. He deserves a pat on the back and looked likeliest to create something.' </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Moyes won't stand in the way of a mega-bucks offer for Jagielka, even if the bank claims all the money as the club try to reduce £45 million debts.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I will do what is right for the club, not because I am stubborn,' he said. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>For Warnock, however, who resembled a tourist on a package holiday as he paraded the touchline in baggy black shorts, the sky's the limit.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Tony Fernandes will make slashing ticket prices one of his first acts as Queens Park Rangers supremo.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Air Asia owner is ready to rubberstamp a range of cuts and, although they have yet to be finalised, it is understood some prices could fall by as much as 25 per cent. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The move will appease fans disgruntled at the previous regime’s decision to introduce a hefty price hike after QPR’s promotion to the Barclays Premier League.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Fans faced the prospect of forking out up to £72 for a seat at Loftus<br>Road this season — an increase of 106 per cent — after Bernie Ecclestone and his business partner Flavio Briatore decided to cash in on the club’s top-flight status.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The controversial move caused Amit Bhatia, son-in-law of the other major shareholder Lakshmi Mittal, to step down from his role as vice-chairman in protest.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/08/22/article-2029006-0D80E29800000578-590_468x300.jpg" alt="Off and running: Tommy Smith (right) scores the only goal of the game" width="468" height="300"></span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>As Sportsmail predicted in July, Fernandes completed his takeover last Thursday — buying out Ecclestone’s 66 per cent share — and Bhatia returned to his vice-chairman role.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Rangers hope to have the new prices in place for their home Premier<br>League clash against Newcastle on September 12.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Fernandes continued his QPR shake-up by appointing Phil Beard,<br>who was part of the successful London 2012 bid, as the club’s chief<br>executive officer.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Boss Neil Warnock is attempting to push through deals for Craig Bellamy, Shaun Wright-Phillips and Anton Ferdinand.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">With Bellamy out of favour at Manchester City, Warnock has targeted the veteran Welshman to spearhead his strikeforce.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">It is not yet clear whether Bellamy would arrive on a loan deal or in a permanent switch given his breakdown in discussions over a pay-off from City.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Wright-Phillips is another City outcast who could end up at Loftus Road.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The England winger has been pushed out of the first-team picture at the Etihad Stadium and would welcome a return to London.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Ferdinand, who is ready to quit Sunderland to make his own return to the capital, is currently in discussions over his move. <br></span></p>
