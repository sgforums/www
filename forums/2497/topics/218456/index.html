            <div class='col-md body'>BARCELONA midfielder Edmilson last night told Jose Mourinho to keep his mouth shut as the bitter war of words between the Catalan club and Chelsea intensified.<br><br><img src="http://images.icnetwork.co.uk/upl/m2/nov2005/5/6/000E48F1-11FF-136F-87490C01AC1BF814.jpg"><br><br><strong>Edmilson blasts Mourinho</strong><br><br>The Blues boss infuriated the Nou Camp club by his claims Barcelona had turned former Chelsea striker Eidur Gudjohnsen into a dive cheat in three months in Spain.<br><br>Mourinho then accused the Barcelona players of provoking Italian referee Stefano Farina to hand out six yellow cards to his team in Tuesday's titanic Champions League draw.<br><br>The Brazilian midfielder Edmilson launched a furious verbal assault on the Chelsea chief. Edmilson said: "The worst thing about playing against Chelsea is to have to listen to the stupidity of Mourinho.<br><br>"He is a little man who has suddenly been created into the owner of the world in his own head. In life it is necessary to be humble and he shows no humility at all.<br><br>"And when you lose against him, it is even worse because you have to hear it all over again.<br><br>"He should spend more time concentrating on his work and shut his mouth."<br><br>Barcelona remained convinced Chelsea had been over-physical, with Edmilson insisting: "We stayed strong and did not fall into their trap." But Blues skipper John Terry said: "I'm not sure why they're so cynical. It's a shame when you see worldclass players trying to get players booked whether it's the last minute or the first."<br><br></div>

"He makes statements like someone who's been promised candy but didn't get it."<br><br>Uefa president, said fining Chelsea was unlikely to have a big impact on the London club. "I do not believe in fines when Chelsea have the money they have to pay it. It must be judged differently," he said.<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42278000/jpg/_42278684_johansson203.jpg"><br><br>"It's like any crime - when it happens the first time you are treated in a fairly decent way but, if you repeat the crime, sentencing is much tougher.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Mourinho moans about the ref again</strong><br><br>Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho lambasted referee Graham Poll after his side lost 2-1 at Tottenham Hotspur in a frenzied London derby on Sunday. Spurs produced a stirring comeback after Claude Makelele had volleyed the champions into the lead as Michael Dawson and Aaron Lennon sealed a first home league win over Chelsea since 1987 and the first in 33 league games against their London rivals.<br><br>However, Mourinho was mystified by striker Didier Drogbas disallowed goal shortly after Makeleles opener and John Terrys 70th-minute dismissal for a second yellow card following an innocuous-looking tussle with Tottenham skipper Ledley King. "Referees should come to the press conference to explain their decision instead of you asking me," Mourinho told reporters.<br><br>"Instead of looking at the ball when Drogba scores Graham Poll notices a John Terry foul 20 metres away. Its fantastic, his vision is perfect, amazing.Two matches with him and five points weve lost," added Mourinho, referring to a 1-1 draw with Aston Villa earlier in the season when he felt Chelsea were denied a penalty. "I dont understand why John Terry was sent off," Mourinho added.<br><br>"Ive seen it on TV and I cant find a reason for that. We didnt deserve to lose, but we lost and afterwards Mr Poll goes home and nobody can ask him the reasons for his decisions. He sends John Terry off for pulling at Ledley King in the box and keeps Hossam Ghaly on the pitch when he elbowed Michael Essien in the face."<br><br>Tottenham manager Martin Jol, whose side are now unbeaten in nine games, was delighted by his teams performance, especially as he used the same starting 11 that played in a 3-1 win over Club Bruges in the UEFA Cup on Thursday. "Its a great week for the club and the fans, first in Europe then against the champions," the Dutchman said.<br><br>"They said weve never beaten a top side which was a bit annoying, but today we did that and I think it was a great performance. Its not easy against a top side like Chelsea when theyve had two more days rest (after playing Barcelona in the Champions League on Tuesday). We had some tired legs but they fought for their lives. I said before weve got to be brave and play with confidence and we did that. Im a very happy man," added Jol.<br><br>"I wasnt nervous at the end but I think my heart rate was 189 which is pretty close to a heart attack." Jol reserved special praise for Lennon, after the teenagers cool finish for the winner. "He had one chance and puts it away," said the Dutchman. "Its very strange, he was very cool and he did it with his left foot. The last two matches hes had seven chances with his right foot and didnt take any of them. Hes one of the most talented players in England."</div>
