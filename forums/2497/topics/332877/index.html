              <h1>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger rejects Roy Keane's Premier League title criticism</h1>
              <h2>After Sunderland manager Roy Keane expressed personal doubts over Arsenal's hopes of lifting the Premier League title this season, Arsene Wenger insists his "unlucky" side can be challengers come May.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01004/arsene_wenger106ge_1004373c.jpg" alt="Arsene Wenger - Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger rejects Roy Keane title criticism" width="460" height="288"></p>
              <p><span class="caption"><em>Falling behind: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger believes his side can challenge for honours following 1-1 draw at Sunderland.</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>A stoppage time Cesc Fabregas equaliser saved Arsenal from their second successive Premier League defeat in a below-par performance at the Stadium of Light on Saturday provoking Keane to question the north London club's lofty ambitious.</strong></p>
              <p>"They are a good team and can challenge. But will Arsenal finish first? I don't think so," said the former Manchester United midfielder, adding: "I think Chelsea and United are stronger."</p>
              <p>The result left Arsenal four points behind the early leaders Chelsea and Liverpool and just two ahead of reigning champions Manchester United, who have a game in hand, going into the international break.</p>
              <p>Rejecting Keane's prediction, Wenger said: "I still believe we have enough quality to win against the top teams."</p>
              <p>The Frenchman conceded he was somewhat disappointed by the team's performance but argued they were having little luck.</p>
              <p>Television replays showed Robin Van Perise was denied a legitimate second half goal by assistant referee Jake Collin, who adjudged Theo Walcott's cross to have gone out of play.</p>
              <p>"There's nothing we can do about that," said Wenger. "We need to win every game but against Sunderland and Hull we have been unlucky - every shot on goal against us at the moment seems to go in.</p>
              <p>"We wanted to be at the top in the early stages of the season but we are not."</p>
              <p>With a small squad in comparison to the rest of the 'Big Four', Wenger admitted Arsenal's recent 4-0 victory over Porto in the Champions League had an adverse effect on his players.</p>
              <p>He said: "We lacked that little bit of extra sharpness and that was maybe down to the fact that we had given a lot mentally on Tuesday night."</p>

              <h1>Arsenal's young talent is bought not brought up, says Sunderland's Roy Keane</h1>
              <h2>The chorus of approval over Arsenal’s exciting group of young players is undeserved because they have been bought rather than nurtured.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01006/vela_1006438c.jpg" alt="Imported talent: Carlos Vela was signed by Arsenal from his native Mexico" width="460" height="288"></p>
              <p><em>Carlos Vela was signed by Arsenal from his native Mexico</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>That’s the view of Sunderland manager Roy Keane, who believes the large sums Arsenal spend on young players is too often overlooked. “You go on about the kids coming through, but a lot of them have been bought from other clubs,” said Keane.</strong></p>
              <p>“A lot of these kids haven’t come through the academy at Arsenal, they’ve been bought. “We have to watch who’s coming to watch our youth team because we’ve had people coming along who should not be there, scouts from other clubs.”</p>
              <p>An Arsenal team with an average age of 19 defeated Sheffield United 6-0 in the Carling Cup last month. Mexican 18-year-old Carlos Vela scored four goals while Arsenal also included young players from Poland, Cameroon, Spain and Ivory Coast.</p>
              <p>Aaron Ramsey, 17, was signed from Cardiff for £5 million, while London-born players like Jack Wilshere and Gavin Hoyte have come through the club’s youth system.</p>
              <p>“That game made me very envious,” said Keane in <a href="http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/football"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">the Express</span></span></a> . “But we’ve got some decent kids here as well. “The word on the street is that Arsenal have a group of kids coming through that will be absolutely outstanding. Anyone who works in youth football will tell you that.</p>
              <p>“They buy a lot of these young players, so as much as we praise them for bringing young kids through they’re buying them from other clubs. “It’s the same with Chelsea and one or two clubs like that. People would be reluctant to spend £3 million on an academy player, but that’s what Manchester United have done, that’s what Chelsea have done and Manchester City.</p>
              <p>“Look at the teams in the FA Youth Cup final last year and not many came through the ranks. Even though they get a lot of credit for it, they’ve actually bought these players. “It’s not all bad stuff,” continued Keane. “If someone goes on to get in the first team who they bought from Millwall for £50,000, that money could keep a smaller club going.”</p>
