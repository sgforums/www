            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Liverpool 3-6 Arsenal</strong><br><br>Stunned Liverpool were humbled in their own back yard by Arsene Wenger's youngsters and sent tumbling out of the Carling Cup on the back of a 6-3 hiding.<br><br>On Saturday they had been knocked out of the FA Cup by Arsenal's senior stars, but four days later Thierry Henry and Co were not needed to secure a League Cup semi-final showdown against neighbours Spurs.<br><br>Liverpool's misery was compounded by seeing Mark Gonzalez and Luis Garcia carried off on stretchers with serious leg injuries, but not even that could explain away such an embarrassment.<br><br>The Kop blamed referee Martin Atkinson for some debatable decisions, but this reverse was too emphatic for that to be used as an excuse.<br><br>Julio Baptista scored four and saw a penalty saved Liverpool's defence was torn to shreds.<br><br>Arsenal have now beaten Liverpool three times this season, and scored 12 goals in the process, underlining their superiority over a shell-shocked Anfield outfit.<br><br>At the weekend boss Rafael Benitez complained that Arsenal had been able to buy expensive match-winners beyond his means, but now the north Londoners have shown their youth production line is pretty good too.<br><br>Arsenal sent out a side with six teenagers in the starting line-up and just two of the team that beat Liverpool 3-1 in the FA Cup on Saturday, but interestingly only Justin Hoyte who had come through their academy system, the rest being young imports.<br><br>Liverpool, also with initially only two retained from their FA Cup exit - and Steven Gerrard would not have played if this tie had not taken on such an importance - were left shell-shocked by a four-goal first-half blast.<br><br>Misfortune started after just five minutes for Liverpool when Gonzalez was carried off.<br><br>The Chile winger attempted a tackle and went down with his left leg buckled under him. He needed five minutes of treatment, oxygen on the pitch and fears of a serious leg injury.<br><br>Luis Garcia was instantly into the fray, giving Liverpool a far more experienced look than Arsenal, even if the Merseysiders had local lads Danny Guthrie and Lee Peltier on show.<br><br>The Gunners were ahead on 27 minutes. Kolo Toure lifted a long ball down the left channel, and Jeremie Aliadiere glided into a massive gap between Peltier and Gabriel Paletta before beating a startled Jerzy Dudek at the second attempt.<br><br>Alexandre Song was booked for a trip on Robbie Fowler, and that paved the way to a Liverpool equaliser five minutes later.<br><br>Fabio Aurelio, in a midfield role, drilled in a free-kick that was pushed away by Manuel Almunia only for Luis Garcia to square the ball for Fowler to neatly flick home from a yard out.<br><br>Arsenal were fortunate to win the free-kick that saw them take the lead on 40 minutes, Denilson making a meal of a collision with Paletta that enraged Gerrard, who was waving angrily for the Brazilian to get on his feet.<br><br>But that did not stop Julio Baptista curling a fine free-kick over the wall and just inside the post, leaving Dudek stranded.<br><br>But the real damage was done in the six minutes of injury time - most of it for Gonzalez - when Arsenal scored twice in front of a stunned Kop.<br><br>First Dudek missed a Cesc Fabregas corner, the ball hitting Sami Hyypia and bouncing into Song before finding the net.<br><br>Two minutes later Aliadiere looked fractionally offside when he played a one-two with Baptista, allowing the big Brazilian to sidefoot into an empty net.<br><br>It could have been worse on 56 minutes when Hyypia was adjudged to have brought down Aliadiere in the box, but Dudek produced a fine save to his right to beat away Baptista's penalty.<br><br>Xabi Alonso was on soon after in place of Stephen Warnock, who was still struggling with a back injury from the first period.<br><br>But Baptista soon had his hat-trick, taking a cross from Aliadiere that evaded Gerrard before driving a 20-yard shot perfectly inside Dudek's left-hand post on 60 minutes.<br><br>There was still some fight left in Gerrard, and he pulled one back with a fine hooked volley from a Paletta pass in the box seven minutes later.<br><br>Liverpool suffered another bad injury when Luis Garcia went down heavily after a challenge by Hoyte.<br><br>The Spaniard was also carried off, his right leg immobilised, Jamie Carragher coming on as substitute.<br><br>Arsenal also brought on Abou Diaby, back after eight months out with a broken ankle, for Theo Walcott.<br><br>Liverpool still kept coming forward and after Gerrard's free-kick had hit the bar, Hyypia headed home Paletta's cross on 80 minutes.<br><br>Peltier had a goal disallowed, Carragher saw a drive tipped over by Almunia, but it was little more than bravado as Arsenal's new generation stormed to an emphatic victory.

The BeastÂ’s fab four mean the Gunners now face old rivals Spurs in a mouth-watering Carling Cup semi-final. And Emirates boss Arsene Wenger is ready to unleash his Young Guns in that two-legged clash.<br><br>After Arsenal became the first side to fire six at Anfield since Sunderland won there 6-0 in 1930, he revealed: Â“IÂ’m tempted to play them. Â“They have earned that right by winning at Liverpool and Everton. It looks good for the future of the club and they look very promising. IÂ’ve said for a long time that I donÂ’t need to buy players.<br><br>Â“I didnÂ’t expect to score six but IÂ’m very pleased with the way we tackled the game. Â“I knew the players had talent but sometimes that can be difficult to transfer into senior games. However, we also showed great mental strength.Â”<br><br>Wenger also paid tribute to Real Madrid loan striker Baptista, who has struggled for form since his arrival in the summer. The French gaffer said: Â“IÂ’ve been impressed by his mental strength and his team attitude and I always believed it would come out at some stage.Â”<br><br>Brazilian Baptista, the first man to grab a four-goal haul at Anfield since Dennis Westcott did it for Wolves in 1946, even missed a penalty Â— after Jeremie Aliadiere was felled. Aliadiere and Alex Song also got on the scoresheet Â— while Robbie Fowler, Steven Gerrard and Sami Hyypia netted for Liverpool.<br><br>This was ArsenalÂ’s second cup victory over the Reds in the space of four days Â— although their team showed nine changes to the side that won 3-1 in SaturdayÂ’s FA Cup third-round clash. Wenger admitted he expected Kop boss Rafa Benitez to field a stronger side after the Spaniard also made sweeping changes.<br><br>The Frenchman said: Â“I was surprised by the team Liverpool played. Perhaps it was due to their Christmas schedule.Â” A dejected Benitez said: Â“IÂ’d like to say sorry to the supporters because they were the best. ItÂ’s difficult to explain Â— but every attempt they had, they seemed to score.Â”<br><br>To cap a night of misery, Kop stars Mark Gonzalez and Luis Garcia were both carried off with leg injuries. Benitez said: Â“We must forget this as soon as possible.Â”<br><br></div>
