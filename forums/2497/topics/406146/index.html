              <p><strong>Manchester City have spent an awful lot of money so far this summer - and not all of it has been on new players.</strong></p>
              <p>Yesterday, in the broiling heat of Spanish Harlem, we saw where some of the rest has gone. The PS72 Elementary School that stands on the corner of 104th Street and Lexington Avenue is not unlike many others in this deprived area of uptown Manhattan. It is large and in rudimentary physical shape.</p>
              <p>These days, however, it boasts an astro-turf football pitch on the roof, which City put there at a cost of more than £500,000. It is 12 flights of stairs up, but for the children of PS72, the climb is worth it. Previously they had to walk 12 blocks to play their favourite sport.</p>
              <p>School principal Tony Hernandez yesterday thanked the club, saying: 'You must realise what this means to us.</p>
              <p>'Of the pupils who come to our school, 89 per cent of them do not have English as their first language. What's more, 88 per cent of them are Hispanic, from countries such as Mexico and Puerto Rico. Soccer is the number one pastime in those countries.</p>
              <p>'As such, we have been dreaming about this moment for years - to have our own facility is incredible. Thank you from the bottom of our heart. This will change our pupils' lives.'</p>
              <p>Some years ago, PS72 was sinking fast, with less than a fifth of the student body passing the standard government tests. Now that figure is above 90 per cent. City cannot take any credit for that, but clearly the money they have spent so far - and the coaching clinics and equipment they will provide in the coming months - will add to the quality of education some of Harlem's young children will receive.</p>
              <p>Spanish-speaking City full back Pablo Zabaleta was one of five players at the opening with manager Roberto Mancini yesterday morning. The temperature hit 32C, but soon that won't matter - City intend to build a roof over the pitch, and a high wire fence around it.</p>
              <p>Zabaleta said: 'It struck me hard when the guy told us how the kids all have to travel across New York just to play football and how this will change that. 'From my own experience in Argentina, you see poor areas and to think they can get a facility like this is fantastic.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>'I grew up in a small city a long way from Buenos Aires. But I suppose the best example in Argentina would be Carlos Tevez, who was born in a really poor area that has a reputation for criminals and trouble. Every time he goes back there he takes shirts and football equipment to the local people. So many players from Argentina and Brazil come from these areas and all they need is an opportunity. It is the same here in New York.</strong></p>
              <p>'This will help us produce the Tevezes and Robinhos of the future. Man City have the opportunity to do this. Maybe it is more difficult for other clubs who need to spend their money on players. Man City have the chance to do many things around football - it makes me very proud to be part of it.'</p>

              <p><strong>City have lately grown used to criticism. They have made mistakes in the two years since they were bought by the Abu Dhabi royal family and they know it. Yet the club retain a sense of community at their heart. It seems the owners have been careful not to let this slide.</strong></p>
              <p>Their Community Soccer Initiative executive director Paul Jeffries alerted them to the opportunity in Harlem and City's commitment to the scheme looks genuine.</p>
              <p>At the school yesterday, there was no shortage of emotion. No country does tears like America, of course, but it was easy to understand here.</p>
              <p>City chief executive Garry Cook said: 'A lot is made about the money the owners have invested in the playing squad, but they very quickly recognised the work the club does in the community and were determined to take that on and invest in projects that can really make a difference to people's lives.</p>
              <p>'Of course we want a hugely successful team on the pitch and we are working towards that. But off the pitch there is a genuine commitment and desire to give something back through football.'</p>
              <p>Cook has not always said and done the right things during his time in English football. This season is another big one for him, as well as for Mancini's squad.</p>
              <p>But yesterday in Harlem, City left an indelible fingerprint on a neighbourhood far from their home in East Manchester. They won't make any money from this. It won't sell them any replica shirts. In terms of image, though, it should do them the world of good.</p>
