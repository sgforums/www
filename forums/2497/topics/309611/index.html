              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Aston Villa defender Curtis Davies has undergone
              successful surgery after suffering a ruptured Achilles during
              Saturday's 1-1 draw at Arsenal.</span></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The 22-year-old centre-back, on loan at Villa
              Park with a view to a permanent move from West Brom in the summer, went
              under the knife in London on Saturday only hours after sustaining the
              setback during the first half against Arsene Wenger's side at the
              Emirates Stadium.</p>
              <p>He will return to the Midlands later on Monday and faces
              several months of recuperation and rehabilitation - but his injury is
              unlikely to affect his £9.5million switch from The Hawthorns.</p>
              <p>Sources close to Villa indicate it will be "around six to seven
              months" before Davies fully recovers from the setback which means it
              could be October before he can contemplate playing again.</p>
              <p>Davies told Villa's official website: "The operation went ahead
              on Saturday evening and the surgeon said it went very well. Obviously
              there's a little bit of soreness there now and I'll just have to rest
              it up and let everything settle down."</p>
              <p>The timing of the injury could not be worse for Davies as he
              was named in England coach Fabio Capello's initial squad for last
              month's friendly international with Switzerland at Wembley.</p>

              <h1>Davies: Achilles ‘Popped’ Like A Gun-Shot</h1>
              <h2>Aston Villa’s Curtis Davies revealed the rather macabre reason why
              he instantly knew he had ruptured his Achilles tendon against Arsenal.</h2>
              <p>"I'd been told by someone who had done it before that you hear it
              and it does sound like a gunshot”, said the giant, who will now be
              out-of-action for six months.</p>
              <p>"It went pop and I knew exactly what it was straight away. I just
              lay there frustrated, because I knew I was going to be out for a long
              time.</p>
              <p>"I was nowhere near anyone but that happens in football. Sometimes you get away with things and sometimes you don't.</p>
              <p>"I'm gutted to be ruled out at such a vital time, but that's football and you have to accept it.</p>
              <p>"I'd just turned to get back into my position. I didn't do anything too strenuous. But I felt and heard it pop.</p>
              <p>"After the surgery it doesn't actually feel too bad. There's not
              much pain there, just a few aches where the blood flow isn't quite
              right. Other than that I'm fine and I just want to focus on getting
              back."</p>
