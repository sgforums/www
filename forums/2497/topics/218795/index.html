            <div class='col-md body'>Glenn Roeder admitted Newcastle had given their worst performance since he took charge during their 1-0 defeat at home to Sheffield United. Danny Webbers header condemned the Magpies to a defeat which left them second-from-bottom and sparked a furious post-match protest aimed at chairman Freddy Shepherd.<br><br>The Toon Armys wrath was not aimed at manager Roeder who acknowledged Newcastle could not afford any more similar performances as he bids to steer the Magpies clear of trouble.<br><br>Roeder told Sky Sports: "It was a poor performance, the worst weve put on since I became involved with the first-team in February. I certainly wasnt expecting that. There was no hint of it coming, and we cant have any more of those. Weve got to make sure that performance is a one-off."<br><br>Asked about the post-match protest by fans, Roeder replied: "I cant comment on the fans disappointment towards the board but I can understand them being disappointed towards the team. We havent performed anywhere near what were capable of doing, and the fans have every right to have a go at the players and to have a go at me as well. I have always faced up to my responsibilities. Its never good for any manager to be at the wrong end of the table, but my personality is not one of someone who panics. Ive always had a lot of confidence and belief in myself - and Ill need that more than ever now. Five or six managers before me here have had problems, and now its my turn to have the problems. Im certainly going to need all my experience. I dont think it would be the right thing to do for me as the manager to start talking about relegation battles. That creates its own problems as far as confidence is concerned."<br><br>Newcastle now face a Carling Cup fourth-round tie against Watford at Vicarage Road on Tuesday, and Roeder added: "I will need to sit down on Monday morning and start again. Part of my job will be to pick the players up from a performance that was unexpected." Roeder revealed Shay Given is back in full training, having been out since mid-September after suffering a perforated bowel in Newcastles 2-0 Premiership win at West Ham.<br><br>A section of the home support made a conspicuously early exit long before the final whistle, and many gathered outside the ground to voice their frustrations. There, they began a series of "Sack the board" chants as they came to terms with the Magpies failure to win at home in the league since the opening day of the season.<br><br>time to go?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
