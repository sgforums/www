            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/design05/images/PH/eto'o.jpg"><br><br><strong>RAFA BENITEZ must win an off-field rematch with AC Milan if he is to land Samuel EtoÂ’o. The Cameroon striker is one of the top targets for Benitez, who plans sweeping changes to turn Liverpool into genuine Premiership contenders. The Barcelona hitman, 26, is the proven scorer the Kop chief feels cost his side in last monthÂ’s Champions League final defeat to the Italian giants. Yet Milan are the first to publicly confirm their interest in the three-time African Player of the Year.</strong><br><br>It was suggested that the San Siro side were close to completing a deal for the Â£30million-rated star. That is some way off but they are keen on taking him. A club statement revealed: Â“EtoÂ’o is a Barcelona player but Milan will make an official approach to Barcelona when the Spanish league finishes. However, this is without any certainty that he will eventually arrive at Milan as the Catalonia club rightly have the final decision on whether to sell or not.Â”<br><br>EtoÂ’o is still to resolve a public war of words with Barca superstar Ronaldinho, sparked by his refusal to go on as a sub against Racing Santander in February. The two made up to some degree and EtoÂ’o said: Â“If it is true that I am a problem for my team then I will go Â— but I am happy here.Â”<br><br>Ronaldinho is being strongly tipped to quit the Nou Camp for Serie A this summer and EtoÂ’oÂ’s future looked to lie with Barca. Now, though, that is shrouded in doubt again after Milan entered the fray, following their announcement that Alberto Gilardino could leave for Â£16m.<br><br>Benitez has drawn up a summer shopping hitlist which includes some of EuropeÂ’s biggest names. And LyonÂ’s Florent Malouda is the first to have given the thumbs-up for an Â£8m move to Anfield. It seemed the Reds might have been gazumped for the French winger earlier this week when his close pal Didier Drogba urged him to go to Chelsea.<br><br>But now Malouda, 27, has broken his silence and admitted the chance to link up with Benitez appeals. He said: Â“There has been contact with Liverpool, although I donÂ’t know as yet if they have shown their interest directly to Lyon. "People make their decisions based on the different leagues in different countries but I would rather decide based on the club. And Liverpool, why not? It is a great club.Â”<br><br>Twelve months ago, he played in all but one of his countryÂ’s World Cup games. And he carried his sparkling form into the domestic campaign, hitting 10 goals in 27 starts. Malouda signed a contract extension last summer, which runs until 2011. But he is keen to test himself overseas and had also been eyed by Milan and Juventus. But yesterdayÂ’s revelations have left Liverpool as red-hot favourites to grab him.<br><br>WIGAN boss Chris Hutchings may make a Â£500,000 swoop for former Reds captain Sami Hyypia. Finnish defender Hyypia, 33, has one year left on his Anfield contract but his chances of playing regularly are likely to be limited.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel it all depends whether Barca will win the La Liga.  If they do, then E'to may not leave else he will.<br><br>I think his preferred destination would be AC MIlan - who can lure him with CL, money &amp; chance to play alongside Ronaldo &amp; Kaka.<br><br>Liverpool for all their glorious history have not much to show for in recent times.  Somemore I don't think its wise for Benetiz to spend all his budget on one player - Liverpool needs a player each in striking, midfield and defense.<br><br>Contrary to reports, I don't think the Americans are really to splurge like what Abramovich did.</div>
