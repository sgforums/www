              <p class="add-linkout"><strong>Mike Ashley will plough back every penny he receives from the St James' Park naming rights to fire Newcastle United back into the Premier League. The Newcastle owner once again came under fire from the Toon Army this week after announcing that their famous stadium was set to be re-named.</strong></p>
              <p class="add-linkout">But a source close to Ashley has told People Sport that the rights will not be flogged off on the cheap. The Ashley camp have also assured Newcastle fans that he is fully committed to taking the club back into the top flight at the first time of asking. And now the owners - dubbed the Cockney Mafia by sceptical Toon fans - have promised that: </p>
              <p class="add-linkout">Potential sponsors will have to fork out £6MILLION a season to take over naming rights of the ground. Manager Chris Hughton will be given EVERY PENNY of that cash to strengthen his squad. None of the club's young talent, such as striker Nile Ranger who was watched by Manchester City talent spotter Brian Marwood during Newcastle's defeat of Doncaster last week - will be sold off. </p>
              <p class="add-linkout">The Tynesiders are in a better financial state than half of the Premier League clubs. The Toon source said: "Mike recognises what the name St James' Park means to the Newcastle fans and he understands why there is some anger. "But all he is asking is for the fans to sit back and take a realistic look at the situation. </p>
              <p class="add-linkout">"It is costing him £3m a month out of his own pocket to run Newcastle and he is trying to look at other ways of raising revenue - the St James' Park name is one of his few valuable assets. "But he is not going to flog the name of the stadium to the first bidder. "He is looking for a significant figure for the stadium naming rights and if he gets it, all the money will go to help Chris Hughton strengthen the team." </p>
              <p class="add-linkout">Ashley has been criticised for a lack of investment since he bought Newcastle in May 2007 and has clawed back £60m in the transfer market. But earlier this week, the club released a statement saying that Ashley was set to plough £20m into the club. </p>
              <p class="add-linkout">Sport revealed last Sunday that Ashley has decided to keep Newcastle United after no-one met his £100m asking price, while on October 4 we told you that caretaker boss Hughton was set to be given the Toon job on a permanent basis. </p>
              <p class="add-linkout">The Ashley source added: "Mike has to run the club as a business and at the moment it is probably in a better state than 50 per cent of teams in the Premier League. "Yes, Mike has made mistakes, none more so than the appointment of Dennis Wise as director of football, but what has not been a mistake is the way the club is now reaping the rewards of unearthing young talent. </p>
              <p class="add-linkout">"Mike is absolutely delighted at the way the likes of Ranger and Andy Carroll have come through." But Ashley hasn't ruled out a sale of the club in the future. </p>
              <p class="add-linkout">The Ashley source added: "If someone with real financial clout came in, like Sheikh Mansour did at Manchester City, then Mike would sell it overnight. </p>
              <p class="add-linkout">"He accepts that the Newcastle fans are never going to love him, not until he gets the club back into the Premier League. "But he just wants the fans to love their team and he has been thrilled by the way they have done this season."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Newcastle have announced that their ground will be known as the sportsdirect.com @ St James' Park Stadium for the rest of the season at least.</strong></p>
              <p>Managing director Derek Llambias has told BBC Newcastle the stadium will be named after owner Mike Ashley's sportswear shops business until a new sponsor is found.</p>
              <p>Llambias said: 'We will showcase Sports Direct until the end of the season. I'm sure we're going to get a sponsor in for next season.'</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">

              <p>The move provoked a furious reaction and a call from some fans to protest at the ground on Saturday before their clash with Peterborough United, the first home game since Ashley confirmed he has taken the club off the market.</p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>Llambias is unrepentant, and as he aims to build bridges with unhappy supporters, Llambias has conceded that the decision to offer the naming rights for the ground could have been handled better.</strong></p>
              <p>He added: 'We could have worded it better, and that's why we came out yesterday to explain what we're trying to achieve. 'With the renaming it was always going to be whatever brand it was, at St James' Park. For the remainder of this season, we already have sportsdirect.com on the Gallowgate so we'd like to take that branding through the rest of the stadium.</p>
              <p>'On the outside - where you see St James' Park - we would like to have sportsdirect.com @ St James', so it can showcase it to whoever is out there that wishes to buy that package.'</p>
              <p>Llambias was also keen to express that the existing St James' Park name was to stay a feature of the site, and believes supporters will see a tangible impact if the scheme is a success in the future.</p>
              <p>'In our reign, absolutely (the name will stay), it's just that we're adding to it,' he said. 'If it brings in a good chunk of money to the club, that goes straight to the team, it's a revenue we should look at.'</p>
              <p>Ashley and Llambias were at Bramall Lane on Monday night to see Newcastle pull off a 1-0 win which took them back to the top of the Championship.</p>
              <p>The pair are also likely to attend the weekend game with Darren  Ferguson's Posh but, after months of fairly subdued protests against the regime, could find this latest announcement provokes even more hostile reaction from home fans.</p>

              <p><strong>In 1892 two football teams joined to form Newcastle United and to play at St James’ Park, and what was once a sloping patch of grazing land became one of Britain’s most famous football grounds.</strong></p>
              <p>The passing years and the legendary players who graced its turf burnished the old name into something more than a stadium: the title spoke of a proud history, of 1950s’ cup victories, of Alan Shearer scoring, of Sir Bobby Robson pacing the touchline, of Kevin Keegan urging his team forward.</p>
              <p>Now the title speaks of an online sportswear company. For the next six months the cathedral of Tyneside football shall be known as sportsdirect.com@St James’ Park.</p>
              <p>The fans are incandescent.</p>
              <p>The names of newer stadiums have been sold for the purposes of sponsorship. Bolton Wanderers play at the Reebok Stadium, York City play at the Kit-Kat Crescent. But the rebranding of St James’ Park is being seen as one more insult in a long period of humiliation that began in 2007.</p>
              <p>That was the year that the man behind the rebranding assumed control of the club. Mike Ashley, the billionaire businessman and founder of Sports Direct, paid £134 million. Fans were cautiously optimistic. He seemed enthusiastic about the club, he was in the stands at games and he certainly knew how to make money.</p>
              <p>He had, however, completed the purchase without undertaking due diligence and did not realise that a change of ownership meant that much of the club’s £70 million debt would need to be repaid.</p>
              <p>His new regime declared that it would take a long-term approach to running the club. Then it sacked Sam Allardyce, the manager, after half a season, and replaced him with Keegan. A heroic figure on Tyneside after an earlier spell in the dugout and his time as a player, Keegan walked away when players that he did not wish to sign were forced upon him.</p>
              <p>Keegan, who had been told to view a new signing on YouTube, was subsequently vindicated in his case for constructive dismissal.</p>
              <p>In his place Mr Ashley hired Joe Kinnear, an out-of-work manager, but when he fell ill, Alan Shearer was appointed on a short-term basis. In spite of Mr Ashley describing it as his “best decision” at Newcastle, the former England captain was not off- ered a full-time contract. Poor results led to relegation and redundancies and attempts to sell the club failed.</p>
              <p>Demoted from the Premier League to the Coca-Cola Championship, fans have gained a brief respite from the troubles under Mr Ashley’s fifth manager, Chris Hughton. Out of the discontent Hughton has forged a team that is top of the Championship.</p>
              <p>But even as the club was confirming that it was no longer for sale and that Hughton had been given a permanent contract, it gave fans another reason to be tearful. At the bottom of that official statement, Newcastle announced that offers for the naming rights to the stadium would be welcomed.</p>
              <p>It unleashed a wave of resentment from fans, who had shown their support in the previous home match, when almost 44,000 attended the game against Doncaster Rovers.</p>
              <p>Petitions have been set up — the Newcastle United Supporters Trust (NUST) has collected more than 16,000 names — and demonstrations are planned for Saturday’s game against Peterborough United.</p>
              <p>Derek Llambias, the club’s managing director, said that the St James’ Park name would remain and that they “could have worded” their statement better. He added that Mr Ashley’s running of the club had been “nearly spot on”. The form that St James’ remains — prefaced by the website of a company of which Mr Ashley is still the majority shareholder — is both peculiar and an affront to most supporters.</p>
              <p>“We strongly believe the name and the soul of our ground is not theirs to sell,” NUSC said. Newcastle will also not receive a penny from Sports Direct in branding fees.</p>
              <p>But it is questionable how many companies will want to be linked with a club suffering such agonies.</p>
              <p>Llambias issued a rallying cry to fans: “The negativity around the city, it needs to stop. You need to concentrate on supporting the team.”</p>
              <p>At the famous sportsdirect@St James’ Park. Or whatever it is called.</p>

              owner, how the hell he appoint dennis wise isnt it. subsequent
              mistake is appointing and then sacking sam allardyce, then keegan
              and wise thingy, then joe kinnear and lastly shearer. who in the
              right mind appoint so many managers in 1-2 seasons.</p>

              <p>well, you are right too, but when he first came, he was cheered right? the owner who will wear the jersey and sit with the fans.</p>
              <p>but the fans wanted more, wanted the free-flowing keagan football in the 90s, the high scoring, but it did not appear. Sam Allardyce was brought in with his scientific approach, and success he got at bolton, did not happen. Keagan, was asked to do his magic, but being out of management for so long, he can't perform, Joe Kinnear, his heart, and Shearer, a passionate but irrational decision which ultimately push the club down.</p>
