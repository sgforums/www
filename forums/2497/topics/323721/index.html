              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>ALEX FERGUSON is on a one-man crusade to stop soccer descending into anarchy. The Manchester United boss believes he is fighting for every club in the Premier League — and throughout the soccer world — by refusing to let Real Madrid take Cristiano Ronaldo.</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Fergie will be horrified that FIFA chief Sepp Blatter reckons Ronaldo should be allowed to leave when he chooses and has claimed keeping him at Old Trafford is akin to slavery. For Fergie, it is not a question of money — however many noughts the Spanish giants throw at United. Instead, it has become a point of principle — and a scrap he does not intend losing.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The battle-hardened Scot believes that allowing players to cut and run as soon as they want a change would open the floodgates to footballing anarchy. Only yesterday Frank Lampard, aged 30 and approaching the twilight days of his career, rejected a four-year deal worth £140,000 a week at Chelsea. Team-mate Didier Drogba has spent all summer insisting he wants out, while Emmanuel Adebayor is adamant he will quit Arsenal and also head for Italy.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea chief exec Peter Kenyon is hardly flavour of the month at Old Trafford, after leaving them for the West London glamour boys. But he and Fergie have become the unlikeliest of allies with matching views about holding players to contracts. Kenyon has even claimed Chelsea will keep Lamps for another season and let him leave on a free in 12 months, rather than bowing to his demands now.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">It is the same story as far as Ferguson is concerned over Ronaldo — and no amount of money will change that. Ferguson is convinced he will not yield and an Old Trafford insider revealed: “It has become a point of principle, not money. “As far as the club are concerned the size of any offer from Real Madrid is totally irrelevant. "It isn’t a question of seeing how much United can get for Cristiano, it is more a case of the repercussions if he was sold.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“There is a genuine fear of where would it all stop if a player is allowed to go as soon as he decides he wants away.” Yet Fergie’s views do not exactly win him unanimous support from across the footballing world. FIFA chief Blatter believes holding players to their contract is modern-day slavery. Fergie, on the other hand, is well aware of the knock-on effect. He reckons bowing to player power is merely laying down the red carpet to any disgruntled star demanding a move as soon as the going gets tough.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">And if Blatter got his way — with players allowed to leave on a whim — what would happen when the boot is on the other foot? Would they allow clubs to cancel contracts if they felt a player wasn’t coming up to scratch? Clearly not — and Ferguson has suddenly become the torch bearer for every club, from top to bottom.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">His stance is that Ronaldo is under contract at Old Trafford and if his employers say he is staying put then that is exactly what he will do. Cynics may point to the fact that Real have twice before raided United for top names — Ruud van Nistelrooy and David Beckham.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The difference then, though, is that they left with Fergie’s blessing. They left as men who, in the Scot’s eyes, had served their purpose of taking United to a new level. With Ronaldo the story is totally different — as he is at the peak of his powers, rather than already heading down the other side of the hill. Fergie is not accustomed to coming off second-best. This time, though, victory could see him held up as custodian of all that is good in the game and defender of the faith.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"><strong>PAUL PARKER</strong> has labelled Blatter ‘disgraceful’ for saying Ronaldo should be allowed to walk out on United. And the former England defender reckons it is time for the FIFA president to stand down and make way for a younger man with a football background.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Blatter reckons Ron should be able to quit United, even though the player has four years left of his contract to run. Parker said: “What Blatter is saying is players can join a new club every year, whatever their contract situation. “That is a disgraceful statement for the president of FIFA to make. “Players already have so much freedom and power. Why should they be allowed to walk out on a five-year deal after just 12 months? It isn’t right. “His ridiculous idea could ruin the game. How are clubs supposed to budget if their players could walk out at any time?</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“I reckon they would have to put up ticket prices to allow for this and that could drive fans away. “But it isn’t the first time Blatter has come out with some daft statement. “His comments show he really hasn’t got any idea about football. “It’s time FIFA followed UEFA’S lead and appointed a visionary from a football background.”</p>

              <p class="story"><strong>Manchester United have taken issue with Sepp Blatter after the Fifa president claimed Cristiano Ronaldo should be allowed to leave Old Trafford if he wants.</strong></p>
              <p class="story">The Fifa president's remarks, in which he criticised a trend towards "modern slavery. United are adamant that Ronaldo will not be leaving, even though the Portugal winger continues to send out mixed messages about his future.</p>
              <p class="story">Real Madrid have made no secret of their admiration for Ronaldo, who is currently recovering from ankle surgery after playing in Euro 2008. The last thing United need is Blatter entering the debate.</p>
              <p class="story">A club spokesperson said: "All our players - like at other clubs - enter into their contracts after an open and free negotiation. "Most of whom do after taking advice from a Fifa-registered agent. Many do so on a number of occasions and enjoy long and successful stays at Old Trafford."</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">UEFA, meanwhile, have attempted to take the heat out of the debate by focusing on the increasing influence of player power in the wake of the Bosman ruling, and slamming the spiralling wages paid to top stars.</p>
              <p class="story">Communications director William Gaillard, who also serves as special advisor to Uefa president Michel Platini, gave a different point of view and claimed salaries are "spiralling out of control". "It would be useful to remind people that slaves in all of the slavery systems never earned a wage," Gaillard said.</p>
              <p class="story">The Bosman ruling came into effect in 1995, allowing players free transfers at the end of contracts, and those coming to the conclusion of their deals have become prey for other clubs. "It seems that both clubs and players are trying to negotiate an exit before the player is free," said Gaillard. "It is a consequence of the Bosman ruling - there is nothing we can do about that. "It is obvious that today players have a lot more power than they did 20 years ago, undoubtedly, and agents have a lot more power than they did 20 years ago."It is true that salaries are spiralling out of control. Many clubs have pointed that out."</p>
              <p class="story">When Blatter was asked if he felt sympathy for Ronaldo's current position, he said: "Absolutely, absolutely. "Definitely as a footballer and the Fifa president, I'm very in sympathy with the player Ronaldo. "I think in football there's too much modern slavery in transferring players or buying players here and there, and putting them somewhere. "I'm always in favour of protecting the player and if the player, he wants to leave, let him leave.</p>
              <p class="story">"The important thing is, we should also protect the player. "If the player wants to play somewhere else, then a solution should be found because if he stays in a club where he does not feel comfortable to play then it's not good for the player and for the club." Blatter also believes the issue raises interesting questions about the way transfers and contracts are dealt with in the game.</p>
              <p class="story">He said: "We are trying now to intervene in such cases. The reaction to the Bosman law is to make long-lasting contracts in order to keep the players and then if he wants to leave, then there is only one solution, he has to pay his contract."</p>
              <p class="story"> </p>
              <p class="story"><span class="subh1">Blatter has his say on...</span></p>
              <p class="story"> </p>
              <p class="story"><strong>Women's football:</strong> "Let the women play in more feminine clothes like they do in volleyball. They could, for example, have tighter shorts. Female players are pretty, if you excuse me for saying so, and they already have some different rules to men - such as playing with a lighter ball. That decision was taken to create a more female aesthetic, so why not do it in fashion?"</p>
              <p class="story"> </p>
              <p class="story"><strong>Match venues:</strong> In 2007 Blatter decided no game should be played 2,500 metres (8,200 feet) above sea level which was later changed to 3,000m. Blatter argues that matches at extreme altitudes are dangerous for players' health although no comprehensive medical studies have proven this.</p>
              <p class="story"> </p>
              <p class="story"><strong>Refereeing:</strong> Valentin Ivanov came under criticism for his performance during a 2006 World Cup clash between Portugal and Holland for issuing a record 16 yellow cards and four red cards.</p>
              <p class="story">"It could have been a yellow card for the referee too. He was not performing at the same level as the players were. It was a match full of emotion, dramatic in the final minutes, but with a rightful winner. It was a great spectacle, but the refereeing did nothing else but ruin the whole thing."</p>
              <p class="story"> </p>
              <p class="story"><strong>Martin Taylor's tackle on Arsenal striker Eduardo:</strong> "It is shocking when you see how this player was attacked. It is not football. Football is a contact game, but it is a game with rules. You have to have respect – and what we witnessed there has nothing to do with football. This is to destroy another player, and that is not the aim of our game."</p>
