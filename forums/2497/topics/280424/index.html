            <div class='col-md body'>I was watching the football focus, and Jamie Reeves (hope I got the name right) touched on a point that I totally agree.<br><br>1) Jose has no full control of the team like perhaps a Sir Alex, RB, or AW.<br><br>2) He has players that he did not want to buy but was thrust in his face.<br><br>3) His boss wants him to play attractive football..<br><br>4) and to add on pt3, still be able to win European cups and EPL titles..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One thing that continue to haunt Jose is his strategic plan..<br>People are questioning what long term plans he has for Chelsea.<br><br>Currently, it is buy-N-Fix approach. Right back not performing, go out and buy.<br><br>but personally, I feel his hands &amp; legs are tied and he can't have free rein to do what he wants.<br><br>I feel put him in another club like ManU, Liverpool or Arsenal where he got more authority, he would maybe be more successful.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>another point, people are also questioning, if you got world class players like Ballack and Sheva, why can't you get the best out of them...<br><br>yes, the argument is that Roman wanted the players, not Jose.<br><br>but if you were given Ballack, Sheva, (I put them as world class due to their previous performance before joining Chelsea), won't Jose be able to harness their abilities???<br><br>What happens if Roman bought Ronaldinho? or even Kaka?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>by Chelsea's last UCL game, where the attendance has dipped, was Chelsea not attractive enough??<br><br>We do see Gunners playing attractive, but we also know that it may not bring the necessary success..<br><br>To be fair, Chelsea is playing more open these days, but injury to their core or untouchables has real hampered them.<br><br>but even if they are all back, do you think Chelsea can play "attractive" football??<br><br>For me, they sold their most attractive players when they sold Robben and Duff.</div>

Reminds me. In my FM dono y suddenly Roman bought Andrea Pirlo for me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> They might go the way of Real Madrid if Roman asserts his authority like how Fiorentino Perez did (Is that how u spell his name?The ex real madrid president who started the galaticos era). Buy and buy players not suited for the team at all, only cause more problems for the manager. Just let the manager run the show. If they think they so smart why hire those high profile managers in the first place?</div>
