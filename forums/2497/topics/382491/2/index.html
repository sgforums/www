              <div><br></div>
              <p>LIVERPOOL</p>
              <p>Pepe Reina - <strong>6</strong> - Rarely called into action, but was safe as houses when he was. Left exposed again by his defence for City's goals.</p>
              <p>Jamie Carragher - <strong>7</strong> - Booked early for a rash lunge on Bellamy but kept his head to produce a sound defensive performance at full-back.</p>
              <p>Martin Skrtel - <strong>8</strong> - Handled Adebayor well, getting tight and refusing to let the Togolese
              striker turn. The Slovak then turned the contest with a close-range
              finish from Gerrard's free-kick.</p>
              <p>Daniel Agger - <strong>N/A - </strong>Carried off inside the opening 10 minutes with a head injury.</p>
              <p>Emiliano Insua - <strong>7</strong> - Coped well with Wright-Phillips, and grew in confidence. Perhaps a little slow to cover for Ireland's goal.</p>
              <p>Lucas - <strong>6 </strong>-
              Passed the ball reasonably well and competed as ever, booked harshly
              after a tangle with Tevez but the young Brazilian continues to improve.</p>
              <p>Javier Mascherano - <strong>7</strong> - Set Liverpool's tempo with his closing down, and looks back to his best form.</p>
              <p>Dirk Kuyt - <strong>6</strong> - Was too fond of the first-time pass in the first half especially, but put a solid shift in on the right.</p>
              <p>Steven Gerrard - <strong>7</strong> - Visibly frustrated during a poor first half, but was always likely to
              produce a decisive moment, and his free-kick brought about Skrtel's
              goal. Faded as the game drew to a close.</p>
              <p>Ryan Babel - <strong>6</strong> - Had started reasonably well but was forced off 18 minutes in with an ankle injury.</p>
              <p>David Ngog - <strong>6</strong> - Looked full of confidence, his touch was fine and he held the ball up
              pretty well at times. Rarely a penalty box threat but a decent
              afternoon's work and he produced the assist for Benayoun's leveller.</p>
              <p><strong>SUBSTITUTES</strong></p>
              <p>Fabio Aurelio - <strong>N/A</strong> - Late arrival for a shattered Benayoun.</p>
              <p>Yossi Benayoun - <strong>7</strong> - A surprise name among the substitutes, but was brought on early. Not
              at full tilt, though his composure and invention was as welcome as
              ever, and he popped up with a vital leveller at 2-2.</p>
              <p>Sotiris Kyrgiakos - <strong>7</strong> - Early replacement for Agger, and slotted in well. Covered superbly,
              won his aerial battles and produced his best performance in a Liverpool
              shirt, though the nature of both City's goals will frustrate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>MANCHESTER CITY</p>
              <p>Shay Given - <strong>7</strong> - One stunning save early on to deny Skrtel, but was not overly exerted afterwards. Helpless with either goal.</p>
              <p>Pablo Zabaleta - <strong>6</strong> - Dallied a couple of times in possession but covered his centre-backs
              well, though it was his foul which led to the free-kick from which
              Liverpool opened the scoring.</p>
              <p>Kolo Toure - <strong>7</strong> - Hampered by a thigh strain, but was competitive as ever and almost
              created a goal for Barry with a fine cross. Withdrawn at half-time.</p>
              <p>Joleon Lescott - <strong>7</strong> - Headed everything that came his way, and was rarely second best.</p>
              <p>Wayne Bridge - <strong>6</strong> - Inconsistent from one minute to the next, covered well but wasted the
              ball a few times and was targeted by Liverpool down their right-hand
              side.</p>
              <p>Nigel De Jong - <strong>7</strong> - City's standout performer in the first half, their version of
              Mascherano mopped up everything and added composure to their play.</p>
              <p>Gareth Barry - <strong>6</strong> - A performance of minimum fuss from the former Reds target, who lasted an hour before being sacrificed for Tevez.</p>
              <p>Shaun Wright-Phillips - <strong>7</strong> - Wasteful at times, but he created Ireland's goal and looked lively in the second half especially.</p>
              <p>Stephen Ireland - <strong>7</strong> - Saw plenty of the ball, and rarely wasted it, except for one poor
              ball at the end of a good break early in the second half. Took his only
              shooting chance clinically.</p>
              <p>Craig Bellamy - <strong>6</strong> - Always lively, though Carragher dealt with him fairly well. Provided the assist for Adebayor's leveller.</p>
              <p>Emmanuel Adebayor - <strong>7</strong> - Frustrating afternoon, the ball didn't stick when it went up to him,
              and it was he who lost Skrtel for the goal. Made amends after 68
              minutes with a confident header from Bellamy's corner, and grew in
              confidence afterwards.</p>
              <p><strong>SUBSTITUTES</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Carlos Tevez - <strong>7</strong> - Given half an hour to change the game, he managed to do so with his selflessness and awareness.</p>
              <p>Nedum Onuoha - <strong>6</strong> - Half-time replacement for Toure, the youngster did well although was not stretched by Liverpool.</p>

              <p>Manchester City manager Mark Hughes has revealed his disappointment in his team drawing with Liverpool at Anfield.</p>
              <p><br>The Citizens had led through a Stephen Ireland goal after Emmanuel Adebayor had leveled Martin Skrtel's opener.<br><br>However,
              Youssi Benayoun was allowed to quickly reply with a close-range tap in
              and Hughes was left to wonder what could have been as he watched his
              side relinquish a lead once again.<br><br>"We're disappointed because I think we were the better team today,'' he told <em>Sky Sports</em>.<br><br>"We showed great character to come from a goal down.<br><br>"We
              were in a winning position and that's the frustration for us at the
              moment, allowing those winning situations to go away from us. That's
              the disappointing thing. Really, Liverpool had not caused us too many
              problems.''</p>
