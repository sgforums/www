              <p><em>Adebayor is still being booed by fans</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="addStoriesLink" rel="1050730_3" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1050730/Arsenal-boss-Wenger-tells-fans-lay-striker-Emmanuel-Adebayor.html"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger has offered an impassioned defence of Emmanuel Adebayor and pleaded with Arsenal fans to stop booing the man who could hold the key to their success this season. Adebayor has been targeted since a summer of speculation, when he showed interest in a move to AC Milan or Barcelona before signing a new, improved four-year contract with the Gunners worth £60,000 a week.</strong></p>
              <p>Wenger admits the Togo international had made a public relations blunder in his bid to secure a pay-rise, which was thoroughly deserved after a 30- goal season, but fears the angry reaction of some supporters may have knocked Adebayor's form. 'I feel that is very hard for him to take,' said the Arsenal boss. 'He needs the fans behind him. He's under pressure always to score goals but we want him to feel relaxed and play like he loves it.'</p>
              <p>Adebayor, 24, started Wednesday's Champions League qualifier against FC Twente on the bench but was jeered when he replaced Robin van Persie. He has not scored in three appearances since the first leg against Twente but struck four times last season against today's opponents, Newcastle.</p>
              <p>'We have to be realistic,' said Wenger. 'A player like that is wanted and it is an honour for Arsenal that he decided to stay. The fact he made financial sacrifices to stay is also an honour. On top of that, we turn against him. 'I saw him many times and he always said he wanted to stay. Of course, if you only earn 10 here and 130 there, you're ready to stay for 60 but not for 10.</p>
              <p>'If he made mistakes, they were PR mistakes, but I like a footballer who is not PR. When they become PR they behave right on the outside and wrong on the inside. They have a series of things people want to hear and they never behave like they talk. I prefer the reverse.</p>
              <p>'In Adebayor's case, what is really important is the way he practised, the way he worked, the way he behaved. Credit to him. We have to be intelligent enough inside - the fans as well - to support him.' After losing four senior players - Gilberto, Jens Lehmann, Alexander Hleb and Mathieu Flamini - Arsenal need experienced Adebayor playing well.</p>
