              <p>Don't happy too early.</p>
              <p>I think is more on Everton defensive error than Arsenal brilliant. Yes, Arsenal pass well and shoot well. But with good deployment of defensive midfielder. Such things can be subdue.  Ytd night, David Moyes only deploy Striker and defender. Such a massive gap in central midfielder.</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Arsenal boss Wenger beams: I told you so!</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsene Wenger</span></abbr> was beaming with pride after their 6-1 thrashing of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Everton</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Wenger said: "I was surprised by the result, especially at Goodison. <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Everton</span></abbr> were not at the level we usually face. The international week clearly disrupted them and their preparation.</p>
              <p>"But we showed cohesion, attitude, team spirit and desire to play together, all these things were the reasons that we won.</p>
              <p>"We have lost two good players, two great players (in Kolo Toure and Emmanuel Adebayor) in the summer to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr>, but when great players leave that allows space for other players to come in and prove they are good enough.</p>
              <p>"People have been writing us off. But what is important is not what others say, but what we do.</p>
              <p>"From being told we were not competitive before the game to now being
              told we are super-favourites is strange. But it is right to say that
              this is just the first game and we aim to continue to give our best.</p>
              <p>"We have matured and this is a good basis to continue like that and to show what we want to do.</p>
              <p>"Before the game we were seemingly being ruled out by everybody, and now we have won 6-1 there are two very big extremes.</p>
              <p>"We are told we do not have the squad, well we want to show that we do have the squad."</p>
              <p>He added: "<abbr><span class="glossary-term">Everton</span></abbr> were not at their usual standards. But we did take every chance that
              came our way in the first half. They seemed flat, physically, usually
              their energy level is very high.</p>
              <p>"That was not there and we were able to dominate physically from the start."</p>

              <p>can see anger in fabregas. can see bendnther attacking defenders. can see vermalen and gallas forming a good partnership.</p>
              <p>can see denilson shooting ball when getting a chance. can see sagna making more accurate crossing this days.</p>
              <p>however everton are really bad aginst arsenal maybe due to lescott saga. whether arsenal can cope after they lose the first game of their season.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Arsenal yesterday were really impressive. I like the way bendtner plays. He is the target man and always seems to be able to get the long high balls down and play it to his team mates. His ability to dribble at defenders is quite good. I seriously hope he would be given a chance to shine this season now that the money faced adebayor is gone.</p>
              <p>Against Everton at goodison park is never easy. Everton play well too. Fellaini and Pienaar played very well. But Arsenal managed to win the game quite easily. This is just the first game, there are 37 more games to go and hopefully arsenal can last the long battle.</p>
