            <div class='col-md body'>NEWCASTLE striker Obafemi Martins last night told of his terror after a gang of masked gunmen fired at his car Â— wounding a pal.<br><br>His Mercedes was sprayed with bullets and his passenger hit in the hand and shoulder.<br><br>Shocked Martins, 22, said: Â“They shot indiscriminately and tried to kill all the occupants of the car. They werenÂ’t there to rob me but to finish me off.<br><br>Â“I thought I was going to die. They executed it like professional hired assassins.<br><br>"They didnÂ’t say anything to me but just started shooting at the car. It was hell. I was dead in my heart and soul. It all happened like in the movies.Â”<br><br>The horror ordeal began when three masked gunmen surrounded Martins at a petrol station near his plush apartment in Lagos, Nigeria, late on Monday night.<br><br>The player, who is now recovering in Italy, said: Â“I didnÂ’t know their mission but they looked scary and mean. My nerves were completely dead when I saw the guns.Â”<br><br>The terrified Magpies ace tried to reverse his car to get away but was blocked by another car parked behind him.<br><br>Gunshots were fired at the windscreen and through the passenger window. MartinsÂ’ mate Remi Onipede was hit but the St JamesÂ’ Park hero managed to run for cover before cops arrived.<br><br>The gang did not steal the car and Martins now believes their motive could have been murder Â— as payback for him missing a recent international Â— rather than robbery.<br><br>He said: Â“If you are attacked by armed robbers, they only threaten you and take whatever they want but these guys were only after my life.<br>*<br>Click here to find out more!<br><br>Â“How I managed to escape is still shocking and unbelievable.<br><br>Â“Maybe someone up there loves me more than I could imagine because only he could explain what happened.<br><br>Â“But my mother is scared they could come back again.<br><br>Â“She almost passed out when she saw the car. She just kept asking who wants me dead.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t feel safe in Lagos any more and donÂ’t think I want to return so fast.<br><br>"I was born in Lagos, I am a Lagosian. But when I donÂ’t feel safe in my hometown then something must be wrong.<br><br>Â“I am not running away from armed robbers but people who want to take the life of Obafemi Martins.<br><br>"ItÂ’s a great thing to play for your country, put smiles on the faces of people and also feel safe among your family and fans.<br><br>Â“But when the situation gets out of hand, I donÂ’t think coming home is something I can even contemplate.Â”<br><br>HORROR ... Martins' car sprayed with bullets<br>HORROR ... Martins' car sprayed with bullets<br><br>Onipede, speaking to The Sun from his hospital bed, said: Â“I am grateful to God for his favours because I could have been a dead man by now. But IÂ’ve had X-rays and doctors say I will be fine.<br><br>Â“Those people were merciless, they just kept shooting at us.Â”<br><br>MartinsÂ’ mum Alhaja added: Â“Obafemi is the breadwinner of my family and some evil people want him dead.<br><br>Â“Tell me why he should continue to stay here.<br><br>Â“I have told him to return to Europe and I will join him there when I feel like seeing him.<br><br>Â“They might return to haunt him, so it will be stupid of him to stay.Â”</div>
