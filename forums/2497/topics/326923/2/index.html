              <p>spurs once again prove that they aim and talk big. but come performance wise, never become big.</p>
              <p>although early in the season, i wonder how many games can big four afford to lose in the whole season. and spurs just lost it.</p>

              <p>To be honest Liverpool haven't been very impressive le . Very inconsistent most probably due to the fact that Rafa rotates the team and deploying different formations every week . And also I don't know what you meant by bringing in players "of not so high" standard . I thought players like Fernando Torres and Mascherano came with a reputation</p>

              <p><br>i think you got to know the price of our wingers, yossi costing less abit more than 10m, jamine cost 5m, we are playing with players that belongs to country 2nd choice player or either they are rejections from other clubs. true enough, liverpool have not been performing up to standard, instead i find their playing style dull.</p>
              <p>it caught me falling asleep while watching them take on sunderland in the season opener. but what im so please about rafa, is the way, he uses players of not so entertaining and creative to play at european level. it's true we are a weaker side compare to arsenal, chelsea and man utd. but at the same time, got to look at our players's worth and theirs. only torres, gerrard, macherano are worthly watching. look at reina, LOL! spain 3rd choice -.- but he's doing perfectly fine at club level.</p>

              <p>as we all know since the beginning of season. spurs will never be in top 4 this season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as long as the purchasing of player are control by Levvy, ramos will not be able to built a team of his own.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>look at the clubs at the top 4 less chelsea.</p>
              <p>most of the players purchases are done and decided by the manager not directors of clubs or GM or whatever.</p>

              <p>I think Benayoun costed lesser than Pennant, who was about 6m.</p>
              <p>But when Benayoun is on the pitch, he gives us a lot of options with his passes. Benitez just doesn't ultilise him enough.</p>
              <p>Actually we have stars in every part of the field, just that they don't get as much media coverage.</p>
