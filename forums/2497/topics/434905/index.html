              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Mario Balotelli is facing up to a player backlash at Manchester City after his latest gaffe provoked an angry reaction among his team. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Italian striker incurred the wrath of several first-team stars, as well as his manager Roberto Mancini, after wasting a glorious opportunity to score in a friendly against LA Galaxy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Rather than take on a simple shot when clean through on goal, Balotelli attempted a bizarre pirouette and backheel which spectacularly failed much to the bemusement of everyone around him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Midfielder Nigel de Jong was unhappy at his team-mates showboating and backed Mancini's decision to haul the striker off within minutes of the incident. He suggested the entire team agreed it was the right thing to do despite just half an hour being on the clock.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He said: 'Everybody's seen it, it wasn't a great action and the coach took a decision to take him off. That's a decision that's been made and that's a statement that the group is behind him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'If you are near the target, you should make an attempt to score. Everybody knows that, and Balotelli too. I hope he learns from this moment and that we as a group to emerge stronger.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Former Aston Villa man James Milner, who was sent on in place of Balotelli by an irate Mancini, was equally disappointed not see the 20-year-old at least attempt to find the target sensibly.</span> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Obviously I would like him to put that into the back of the net, but Mario is Mario, he does some strange things sometimes,' Milner told Sky Sports News.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I think he's shown since he's been here he has obviously got great potential, but he's still young and still learning and hopefully he will get better and maybe learn from these sort of experiences.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">City led 1-0 at the time through a Balotelli penalty but conceded shortly after half-time and required a penalty shootout to eventually overcome David Beckham's MLS outfit. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Mike Magee, who equalised in stunning fashion, also weighed into the argument.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He said: 'It's not something I would do. We might be a step down from the Premier League as far as leagues and stuff, but we know we're good. If that was a 6-0 game and he does that, probably someone would have whacked him. Me, personally, I don't care what the guy does.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Balotelli reacted furiously to being substituted and become involved in a heated exchange with his manager. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Speaking afterwards, Mancini said: 'We need to be always professional, always serious, and in that moment I did not think Mario did this. That is why I took him off.</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>‘He knows he made a mistake. In football you should always be serious and if you have a chance to score, you should score. I hope he has learned his lesson. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘It is punishment enough for him to be substituted after 30 minutes. But for me it is now finished.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘But Mario is young. Sometimes he makes mistakes. But I want to help him always. If Mario is serious, he can play for 90 minutes. If not, then he will join me on the bench, as he did. It is the same for all players.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Asked what Balotelli had said to him, Mancini replied: 'It was in Italian. In English I would find it difficult to give you the translation. But Mario is streetwise, he knows he was not offside.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Galaxy coach Bruce Arena said: ‘I thought it was odd. I don’t know what the player was thinking, whether he thought he was offside or not.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Elsewhere, Newcastle midfielder Joey Barton took to Twitter to share his thoughts on the incident. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He wrote: 'Mario Balotelli is fully off his barnet... from now on am referring to him as "The Renegade"... he amuses me greatly with his antics.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Later he added: '"The Renegade" is definitely mentally unstable, some of his stunts are the ultimate in lunacy. How do u [sic] manage such a complex person??'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">In another tweet, he said: 'Am genuinely worried that "renegade" might harm himself if this perverse behaviour, is not addressed. He needs understanding not undermining.'<br></span></p>
