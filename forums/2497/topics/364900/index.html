              <p><strong>Following contact received from
              Carlos Tevez’s advisors last night, in advance of the deadline the Club
              set for concluding negotiations, Manchester United announces that
              Carlos will not be signing a new contract with the Club.</strong></p>
              <p>The
              Club agreed to pay the option price of £25.5m and offered Carlos a
              five-year contract which would have made him one of its highest paid
              players.</p>
              <p>Disappointingly however, his advisors informed the Club
              that, despite the success he has enjoyed during one of the Club’s most
              successful periods, he does not wish to continue playing for Manchester
              United.</p>
              <p>The Club would like to thank Carlos for his services over the last two seasons and wishes him good luck for the future.</p>

              <h1>Tevez wanted time to consider offer</h1>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Kia
              Joorabchian has revealed Carlos Tevez had to leave Manchester United
              because he was not given enough time to consider their offer. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/09/05/330/Carlos-Tevez_2312038.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p><strong>United announced on Saturday morning that Tevez would be leaving Old Trafford following a two-year loan spell with the club. </strong></p>
              <p>The Red Devils had agreed to pay the £25.5million fee required
              to secure Tevez's services permanently and offered the striker a
              lucrative five-year contract.</p>
              <p>However, he rejected the proposal and is now expected to join either Manchester City or Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Joorabchian has now clarified the situation by insisting that money was not a factor in the Argentine's decision.</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old's advisor has also stressed that Tevez was left
              with no choice but to turn United down as he was not given enough time
              to make his mind up.</p>
              <p>"When Man United made their offer about 10 days ago, for the
              first time in two years, we never went back to them to ask about
              money," Joorabchian told Sky Sports News.</p>
              <p>"We just asked for some time to think about it. Obviously they
              have had two years to think about it and Carlos had to make a decision
              based on his family.</p>
              <p>"Just to make it clear, this has been Carlos' decision. Nobody else would make this decision for him."</p>
              <p>Joorabchian added: "We didn't actually reject the offer. Manchester United have ruled themselves out of the running.</p>
              <p>"We actually asked for more time and if they could not give that we would have to walk away.</p>
              <p>"He wants time to digest it and to know which club would suit
              him because now he is committing the next five years of his future."</p>

              <p>I think Pool can afford the $25.5m transfer fee but I doubt they can afford his weekly salary of $140k per week as reported what City was offering... As even Torres and Gerrard are reported to be on $120k per week I think...But Chelsea being the only club able to match that $140k, so they are still left in there.</p>
              <p>But all that talk of... "He has a lot of respect and a lot of love for the fans of Man United and I think he would rule Liverpool out as being the biggest competitor."  is just rubbish... City and Chelsea... Whats the difference with Pool?</p>
              <p>Presently, only the money... 2 of them can pay what Pool can't.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">MANCHESTER CITY have already opened talks about signing Carlos Tevez, according to his agent Kia Joorabchian.</h2>
              <p class="article">Joorabchian confirmed that City and Chelsea are set to battle it out for Tevez now that he has quit Manchester United. And he revealed that he has spoken to City boss Mark Hughes and chief executive Garry Cook. But he added: "Out of respect for United, we never discussed a contract for Carlos."</p>
              <p class="article">Joorabchian also insisted that money would not dictate the next move fior Tevez.</p>
