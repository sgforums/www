              <p>And boss Arsene Wenger now believes he can beat rivals Chelsea to the 18-year-old striker's signature.</p>
              <p>SunSport can reveal Lukaku's agent Christophe Henrotay met Arsenal officials in London yesterday.</p>
              <p>He was then expected to fly to Portugal where the Belgian club are based during pre-season, to talk to the teenager<em>.</em></p>
              <p>Chelsea were hot favourites to land the 6ft 3in starlet, who is rated one of the top young players in Europe.</p>
              <p>He has hit 31 goals in just 71 games for Anderlecht and has already played nine times for Belgium.</p>
              <p>It would represent a major coup for Wenger if the Arsenal manager can pull off the deal.</p>
              <p>Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona also made inquiries but Lukaku looked sure to sign for Chelsea until Arsenal moved in.</p>
              <p>Anderlecht are prepared to let him go for less than their £18m asking price.</p>
              <p>But a major stumbling block to any deal could be the fact that Lukaku's dad Roger stands to pocket 25 per cent of any fee.</p>
              <p>Arsenal are on a money-spinning tour in the Far East but Wenger promised he is working day and night to strengthen the team.</p>
              <p>It is understood that Gunners executives first spoke to Henrotay several months ago but only decided to firm up their interest in the last few days.</p>
              <p>The news will be a huge boost to Emirates fans who are waiting for a conclusion to the saga of Cesc Fabregas' move to Barcelona next week, after the squad return from China.</p>

              </span></p><p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Chelsea's chances of signing Romelu Lukaku this summer have receded after the Anderlecht striker said he is happy to remain in Belgium.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The 18-year-old has been the subject of a £20million bid from the Stamford Bridge club as they seek to add youthful vigour to their ageing strikeforce.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But Lukaku has denied he has his heart set on a move to London.</span></p>
              <p class="imagecaption" style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I want to go to a club where I can develop further. It’s not that I just want to be transferred to Chelsea,' he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'At the moment I am patient. I remain at Anderlecht and I am not thinking of a transfer.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Lukaku added that if he did leave Anderlecht he wouldn't join a club that would then loan him on.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Recent Chelsea signing, goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, was immediately sent to Atletico Madrid.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'When I do leave, it will not to be lent on as Thibaut Courtois has been,' Lukaku stressed.</span></p>
              <p><em><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Sportsmail </span></em><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>revealed last month that Anderlecht general manager Herman van Holsbeeck had been in London for talks with Chelsea about a fee for a player dubbed the new Didier Drogba.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The negotiations led to an opening offer but there has been no movement since.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Lukaku admitted earlier this year that he dreamed of playing for Chelsea when he filled in a questionnaire for school children.</span></p>

              <p>Lukaku, 18, has been linked with the Blues throughout the summer, but appears set to finally seal a switch to the three-time Premier League champions.</p>
              <p>"An agreement has been reached with Anderlecht for the transfer to Chelsea of striker Romelu Lukaku," a statement on Chelsea's official website said. "The move is now subject to the player passing a medical and agreeing personal terms.''</p>
              <p>Anderlecht also confirmed the news on their official wesbite: "RSC Anderlecht and Chelsea have reached an agreement regarding the transfer of Romelu Lukaku.</p>
              <p>"Subject to the results of medical tests and the conclusion of negotiations between the player and the English club, Romelu Lukaku will therefore move into the colours of the London club.''</p>
              <p>Anderlecht general manager Herman van Holsbeeck added: "We regret the departure of Romelu...but the agreement is a win-win situation for the player and RSC Anderlecht. The club's management is committed to finding a good replacement in the short term. We wish him every success for the rest of his career.''</p>
              <p>The player posted a comment on <em>Twitter</em> which read: "I have an announcement to make...Next week I'm going to London for the medical tests.''</p>
              <p>Chelsea boss <span style="color: #000000;">Andre Villas-Boas</span> is now closing in on the third signing of his reign, and admitted after Saturday's friendly against Rangers that a deal was close.</p>
              <p>"He is a very interesting young prospect and the situation is now that we have to position ourselves to maybe get this kind of talent," Villas-Boas said. "So I would say that anything can happen.''</p>
              <p>Lukaku scored 16 goals in 37 league appearances last season and already has two to his name in two games in the current campaign for the Brussels club.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">DANIEL STURRIDGE hit a brace to stake his claim in the Chelsea striker war.</h2>
              <p>The young hotshot bagged two first-half goals after Rangers' Nikica Jelavic had opened the scoring.</p>
              <p>Sturridge dazzled on loan for Bolton last term but is down the pecking order with Didier Drogba, Nicolas Anelka and Fernando Torres in residency at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>But his double gave a nudge to boss Andre Villas-Boas, who saw Florent Malouda hit a third to wrap up the win.</p>
              <p>Jelavic had broken the deadlock after just six minutes. Steven Naismith picked the ball up on the right and crossed for the Croat, who ghosted in at the far post and nodded home.</p>
              <p>The Gers' lead did not last long, however, and Sturridge cashed in on Lee Wallace's 21st-minute blunder.</p>
              <p>Dozy Wallace slipped up with Sturridge lurking, and the striker picked up the ball and rifled home.</p>
              <p>The former Manchester City man hit the jackpot again eight minutes later — this time leaving Kirk Broadfoot red-faced.</p>
              <p>Broadfoot's clearance was charged down by Sturridge, who then muscled into the box and thundered past Allan McGregor.</p>
              <p>Malouda made it 3-1 on 71 minutes, nodding home Anelka's cross from the right.</p>
              <p>Drogba was then poleaxed by Juan Manuel Ortiz in the box — only for Frank Lampard to miss from the spot.</p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Romelu Lukaku was planning to fly in to Heathrow before making the short transfer to Chelsea's Cobham training ground for the formalities of undergoing a medical and putting his name to a five-year contract.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Instead, he opted for rail as his preferred method of transport, drawing quizzical looks from early-morning commuters, as he boarded the 8.05 Eurostar from Brussels along with his agent Christophe Henrotay.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Arriving at St Pancras just under two hours later, the pair were met by a Chelsea official for a chauffeur-driven ride to Cobham, where the 18-year old was due to have a medical and sign his long-term deal.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Chelsea started chasing Lukaka long before Andre Villas-Boas took charge at Stamford Bridge but the youngster is looking forward to working with his new boss. He said: 'He's a good man.'</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>After pursuing him for over two years, persistence has finally paid off for Chelsea - but at a cost. They are paying Anderlecht an initial £13m, with a potential £6m to follow, depending on appearances and achievements. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>They are stumping up a further £3.3m - 25 per cent of the initial outlay - for Lukaku's family, in an agreement struck between the striker and his former club, and are even understood to have agreed to meet the cost of the agent's fee.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>For that, they will be recruiting a powerful, pacey frontrunner who has been widely likened to Didier Drogba and has already shown an appreciation of his new responsibilities.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Despite being pressed to share his thoughts with members of the Belgian media on his way over, he remained tight-lipped, after being told by Chelsea that his first interview must be with the club's in-house TV station.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Lukaku must be back in Brussels by 10am on Tuesday at the latest, in time for a late-morning training session prior to the squad flying out to Slovenia in the afternoon, ahead of Wednesday night's friendly international.</span></p>

              <p>The Belgium international, 18, said: "It's a dream come true.</p>
              <p>"I dreamed to play here since I was 10, thinking about shaking hands with all those players like John Terry, Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba.</p>
              <p>"It's amazing to arrive here in a big club with big ambition. It was just what I was searching for."</p>
              <p>Lukaku has scored twice in 10 appearances for Belgium and played 60 minutes in their goalless draw with Slovenia earlier this week.</p>
              <p>He made his club debut at the age of 16 and netted 16 goals in 37 league games last season.</p>
              <p>Lukaku, who goes straight into Villas-Boas' squad for Chelsea's opening home game against West Brom, is also keen to live up to his billing as 'the new Drogba'.</p>
              <p>He added: "The comparison is nice, I like it a lot.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Romelu Lukaku has revealed his dream is to play at Chelsea alongside his brother Jordan - and urged the Blues' scouts to take a look for themselves. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The 18-year-old Belgium striker made his Chelsea debut against Norwich on Saturday as a second-half substitute for Fernando Torres after joining the Stamford Bridge outfit for £18million from Anderlecht earlier this month. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Lukaku has a bright future ahead of him and has been hailed as the new Didier Drogba due to his powerful physique and eye for goal. But the elder brother reckons that Jordan, a 17-year-old pacy winger also at Anderlecht, might be even better than he is. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Romelu told reporters: 'I have loved Chelsea since I was a boy. Now that I have fulfilled a dream by joining Chelsea, my final one is to have my brother join me one day. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'It is our dream to play in the same team. We have done it in friendly games but, one day, we hope to do it when it matters.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He added: 'Technically he is better than me. He is a left winger who is very skilful and strong. 'I think when the scouts see him, they will see what he can do.'</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The Belgium striker joined the Blues for £20million from Anderlecht earlier this month but faces big compeition for first-team football at Stamford Bridge.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Boss Andres Villas-Boas was willing to send him on loan to the Britannia Stadium for six months to have him ready for Chelsea in the second half of the season.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But Premier League rules state that a player bought by one club cannot be loaned to another in the same transfer window.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>With Didier Drogba expected to head out to the African Cup of Nations in January, Lukaku is likely to be required back at the club.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The 18-year-old is regarded as one of the world's hottest properties and was tracked by Real Madrid before eventually opting for his boyhood club Chelsea.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Tony Pulis has built a big and powerful line-up at Stoke and the addition of 6ft 4in Lukaku would have only boosted their strength.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>He currently has Kenwyne Jones, Jon Walters, Ricardo Fuller and Mamady Sidibe to call on, but would like a top-class striker to beef up his attack.  Peter Crouch remains a possibility.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>New signing Ulises Davila will spend a season on loan at Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem.</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Davila, who impressed for Mexico at the Under 20 World Cup this summer, is the second Chelsea player to join Vitesse after teenage defender Tomas Kalas also joined on loan.</span></p>
