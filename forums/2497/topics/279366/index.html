Hopefully we will get some answers," she added.<br><br>Nielsen said Denmark officials called security after finding two men with "large cameras" she said were "hiding" in a building at the team's training ground.<br><br>"The men said they did not know it was a closed training session," Nielsen said.<br><br>The following day, Denmark officials found two men with a camera in a room behind a mirror facing a meeting room in which the team were having a "tactical session".<br><br>Nielsen said officials discovered the men after joking that there might be spies monitoring them from behind the mirror.<br><br>Upon being discovered, the men refused to come out, Nielsen said, adding that the men were Chinese. "But we have no idea who they were."<br><br>She said Denmark contacted FIFA, who sent officials to the hotel.<br><br>"They saw the men and spoke to them," she said.<br><br>Denmark lost 3-2 to China in Wednesday's match after a late strike by midfielder Song Xiaoli gave the hosts victory.</div>
