Is he the new "Tinkerman"? </span><br><br><strong>Jim Mansell, a fervent but despairing Liverpool fan, pens an open letter to his club's manager after their humiliating Champions League defeat to Marseille at Anfield: Dear Mr Benitez, I felt compelled to write to you following Liverpool's abject display against Marseille. I have a fear that you are blind to the one key element which is vital to any successful team - consistency.<br>In my view the Champions League defeat on Wednesday hardly matters a jot - though not to qualify for the knockout stages would be humiliating enough - but was a clear manifestation of the problems thrown up by your baffling rotation system.</strong><br><br>Let's be frank. Your changes are infuriating Liverpool fans. I haven't spoken to one who thinks it's the right policy or that it will wn us the prize we most cherish - the Premier League. We've been waiting since 1990 for a sniff of the Holy Grail - and gritted our teeth as Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea have dominated. They have done it by moulding teams which play at a high level of consistency. Barring loss of form and injury, the manager has picked virtually the same players week in, week out. They became teams and a developed a pattern of play to suit.<br><br>Currently, this does not seem to apply to Liverpool. You made another bucketload of changes for the Marseille game from the team that scraped a 1-0 away win at Wigan. Not surprisingly, they played like strangers. As Robin van Persie said this week Arsenal benefit by having the same team because the players like it that way. How can Crouch be expected to perform if he's hardly given a look-in? How can Torres be the 20-goals-a-season striker the team desperately needs if he's not in the starting line-up for games against the likes of Portsmouth and Birmingham? How can the midfield develop an understanding if it's chopped and changed so much?<br><br>I heard you say in an interview recently that your policy was designed to ensure the players were in peak fitness for the run-in to the Champions League and the title. That's no good if the team are not in contention for either due to poor performances in the rest of the season.<br><br>Your summer buys gave us hope that the title would be a realistic target. The season started brightly. Don't let that flicker of hope be extinguished so quickly. On behalf of all title-starved Liverpool fans, pick a team to win the league and stick with it. You gave us a truly unbelievable triumph in Istanbul. And a memorably nerve-wracking FA Cup success. But, Mr Benitez, we're desperate to be the best team in the Premier League.<br><br>What we can't stomach is a rotation policy which will see the names of just United, Chelsea and Arsenal on the Premier League trophy for another 17 years! Yours in hope<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://clientimages.teamtalk.com/07/08/Others/135691.jpg"><br><span class="small">The month of October will be an important one for Benitez as Spurs, Everton, Arsenal and Besiktas lie in wait for Liverpool.</span><br><br><strong>Reeling from what Rafa Benitez admitted what was the worst performance of his tenure, Liverpool are now facing up to a run of fixtures that will inevitably be billed as a 'make-or-break' period in their season. </strong><br><br>The cacophony of boos that greeted the Reds' first-ever defeat to French opposition at Anfield will have been followed by the harsh sound of alarm bells ringing for Rafa Benitez. Unable to spare any of his players from criticism after Marseille's deserved victory, the Spaniard vowed to "analyse everything".<br><br>Yet it is Benitez's refusal to select a settled team - he included squad player Sebastian Leto and an off-form Mohamed Sissoko against the French side on Wednesday - that remains under closest scrutiny.<br><br>It would be remiss to suggest that Benitez's policy of rotation was the sole cause of the humiliating defeat, yet it must have been a contributing factor to a woeful performance that lacked purpose or cohesion. In attack, Fernando Torres and Peter Crouch, Liverpool's sixth different strike partnership in a campaign barely six weeks old, resembled two strangers speaking different languages. Which is probably what they really are.<br><br>Even without the benefit of hindsight, it is not difficult to paint the 'shock' defeat against a side fourth-bottom in the French first division as an accident waiting to happen. The Reds' last performance of positive note occurred over a month ago against whipping boys Derby. And no side in the Premiership has yet to enjoy anything but a positive result on home territory against Derby this season. Since then, stodgy draws with Portsmouth and Birmingham have stalled Liverpool's domestic momentum and a wretched display against Porto may have been the cause of Marseille's surprisingly adventurous outlook this week.<br><br>Tottenham are the next visitors to Anfield in a match that kicks-off what would be a daunting run for Liverpool even if Benitez's side were in the rudest of health. The post-international Premiership league resumption will then see Liverpool face their most challenging week of the year: a Merseyside derby with Everton on October 20, a trip to Besiktas on October 24, and then a date with Arsenal four days later. By the time of November 3's Premiership fixture at Ewood Park, Blackburn Rovers could be picking off a battered carcass unless Benitez's relentless tinkering finally produces a winning formula.<br><br></div>
