              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">BIG Phil Scolari’s job is on the line in the wake of an astonishing bust-up with Nicolas Anelka. The Blues board were stunned by Chelsea’s shocking display in Sunday’s 3-0 defeat at Manchester United which left them four points behind leaders Liverpool. </h2>
              <p class="article">And we can reveal the Blues boss has clashed with French striker Anelka, who is fuming at being dumped on the bench for the last three games. The two rowed at training with Scolari telling Anelka he would start at Old Trafford only if he agreed to play on the left. </p>
              <p class="article">But the sulky Frenchman, the Premier League’s 14-goal top scorer, refused and demanded to be used down the middle. A Chelsea insider confirmed: “Nothing is going right at the moment and there are suddenly a lot of questions being asked about Mr Scolari’s management style.” </p>
              <p class="article">Scolari’s problems could deepen tomorrow when Chelsea face a tricky FA Cup third-round replay at Southend. Defeat is virtually unthinkable — especially with a board meeting scheduled for Thursday at which Scolari will have to explain Chelsea’s wretched form. </p>
              <p class="article">The board had been hugely supportive of Scolari but are losing faith. SunSport has revealed Chelsea players think Scolari’s training regime is not intensive enough. </p>
              <p class="article">His decision to institute a range of fines, including one about diet, has annoyed many and there is a lack of trust between manager and team. Scolari said: “I need to talk with the players. They have to ask in their own minds if they believe we can still do it. </p>
              <p class="article">“There are two options. Either I stick with the players and they raise themselves or I try different players.”</p>

              <p>Anelka always had a problem... Where got a player went the manager ask you to play in a another position he can don't want? Even in the CL asked him to take the 5th penalty he can don't want also... This type of players are hopeless and should get rid off cos they only think for themselves rather than the team...</p>
              <p>Look at Rooney, Fergie asked him to play left, he play left... Asked him to play right, he play right... Where can say always want to play centre only...</p>

              <p>AW made T. Henry play as an striker even thou 1/2 his life was being a winger, so i guess its just the manager's opinion, might work out for some, might backfire for some too..</p>
              <p>just as Big Phil said, he need a left winger hence he is trying to convert Anelka into one but Anelka being the sulk is not known to listen to others so its going to be tough for Phil, but i'll say f him, either you play my position or you'll be ship out on the next availble date, but of course he'll have to have backing from the board as well being able to iron out result and when result is shown, fans being as fickle minded as they always had and always be will forget about Anelka and worship Phil like he is the best that Chelsea had ever had.. </p>

              <p>That's the problem with buying established players... They can't get better, only worse as age catches up with them within 3 to 5 yrs... I would say Mourinho got the long end of the stick and Big Phil unfortunately the shorter...</p>
              <p>When Mourinho first came in, he could buy almost anyone he fancies, money was not a problem... If a club didn't want to sell, throw more money at them until they accept... If he bought flop players at high prices, he could exchanged for another within 6 months... (Boulahrouz, Del Horno, Jarosik...) He didn't need to keep them as the club was rich and could go out and buy another... But these days, Scolari don't have this special privilege unlike Jose... Jose came in and spent about $80m in his first season while Scolari spent about $8m... That a big difference.</p>

              <p class="small bold">BRAZIL NUTS ... Phil Scolari is furious with his Chelsea flops</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">BIG PHIL SCOLARI has slammed his fading Chelsea stars in the wake of their 3-0 humiliation at Manchester United. And he accused some of playing at no more than 35 per cent of their potential. </h2>
              <p class="article">Scolari’s job at Stamford Bridge will be on the line if he cannot turn the tide threatening to engulf the Blues, who have managed just one win in their last six games. </p>
              <p class="article">He accepts the criticism but says it is now time for his team to listen and do things his way — starting with tonight’s FA Cup third-round replay at Southend. Changes will be made in tactics and personnel as Chelsea switch back to Scolari’s preferred zonal marking system and big names like Ivory Coast hitman Didier Drogba are dumped. </p>
              <p class="article">If that does not work, Scolari is ready to take the blame because he knows the zonal tactic is unpopular with his defenders. The Brazilian gaffer admitted: “In the last five games we played at 50 per cent of our potential, no more than this. </p>
              <p class="article">“Some players have been at 75 to 80 per cent, while others have been at 35-40 per cent. “But the balance for our team as a whole in the last five games has been 50 per cent. </p>
              <p class="article">“If you ask me if this team are ready to win things, then ‘no’. They are <strong>NOT</strong> ready to win a trophy — and they know this. “They might not say things publicly but they know we are not ready. </p>
              <p class="article">“They need to understand that now and we need more work. Sometimes when we are wrong we need to pay more attention. We need a win — now.” </p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea are second in the Premier table, four points behind Liverpool and one point ahead of United, who have two games in hand. And Scolari added: “I understand people don’t have a very good opinion about me because we have just lost a game 3-0 against Manchester United at Old Trafford. </p>
              <p class="article">“And I know that I need to work more than before with my players. All the players have had their chance. I have given every one of them at least five or six games to impress. </p>
              <p class="article">“We will start with one team against Southend United and maybe I will start with the same team against Stoke City. “But I need answers from the players. I will give them their chance and I need answers. </p>
              <p class="article">“In the last three or four games — we need to talk about the fact that we have lost goals from set-pieces. “Against Southend, we must not make the same mistakes. “But what has happened is a lesson for us — in 25 games we had no mistakes and then we have in the last three or four. </p>
              <p class="article">“My team knows it’s not normal to have so many mistakes. “Eight times we have made mistakes and have conceded in five games. “When I arrived we marked zonally but then we changed to a man-to-man system. Now with the new system if things go wrong it will be my fault — not the players’ — because it is my system.”</p>
              <p class="article">Scolari added: “In the last four games, we are wrong. “We need to admit to the people, to the critics and to the fans what has happened. “We need to explain it and there is nothing more than this to say. “The players have been trying hard, I know that. </p>
              <p class="article">“Do you think that any player will go on the pitch in front of 75,000 people like at Old Trafford and not want to play? Never. Sometimes they make mistakes because they are not in a good condition but not because they do not want to play. </p>
              <p class="article">“If this happened then they would be finished. “I am a good man but I am not a fool. Sometimes I’m a fool but not every time. “And if Chelsea lose a game it’s not just me — it’s the whole of the team. We are in the same boat.” </p>
              <p class="article">What boat’s that, Phil? The Titanic?</p>
