              <p><em>Portsmouth manager Avram Grant has launched a stinging attack on 
                  former club Chelsea, insisting he will never forget the way they 
                  unceremoniously dumped him.</em></p>
              <p>Grant took over from Jose Mourinho in 
                  September 2007 and was handed a four-year contract at Stamford Bridge 
                  three months later. Under the Israeli Chelsea lost just two league 
                  games, narrowly missing out on the Barclays Premier League title to 
                  Manchester United, who also beat them in the Champions League final on 
                  penalties.</p>
              <p>"If I had been manager at the start of the season and 
                  we had played as well as we had finished the campaign, Chelsea not 
                  Manchester United would have been Premier League champions," Grant told 
                  the Mirror. "And how close were we from winning the Champions League? A 
                  penalty away."</p>
              <p>He added: <strong>"So I can tell you with total honesty 
                  that I was not happy with the way they treated me in the end."</strong></p>
              <p>"There were a lot of negative things that happened, things I didn't 
              like and find hard to forget.</p>
              <p>"I was very proud of what I achieved
               at Chelsea but their big mistake was to take what I did for granted.</p>
              <p>"I
               felt it was important the club had continuity and was looking towards 
              long-term stability. I always believed that it would be easier in the 
              second season. But I was never given the chance."</p>
              <p>Grant will meet 
              his former club next weekend when Portsmouth take on Chelsea in the FA 
              Cup final.</p>
              <p>Despite his broadside, Grant claims he still has many 
              friends at Chelsea, including billionaire owner Roman Abramovich.</p>
              <p>He
               added: "I appreciate the owner gave me the chance to manage and then he
               offered to make me a director which I declined. I don't forget that. 
              There were many good things at Chelsea and I still have a great 
              affection for the club. After Portsmouth beat Tottenham in the 
              semi-final most of the Chelsea players sent me text messages."</p>

              <p>i found it strange that they fired him... he was achieving results albeit kinda dull in their play...</p>
              <p>mourinho also got the team playing like that.. but then, he provided the fireworks off the pitch with his interviews and stuff.. Grant was just kinda dull and grey.. maybe they didn't like it that way coz i remember they wanted "sexy football" as well as results?</p>

              <p>I can understand why he's still pissed....</p>
              <p>After all, Chelsea had a pretty good run under him.... they came close to winning the BPL, and they lost the Champions League final only through penalties.</p>
              <p>Yeah, their football wasn't pretty, but 2nd place for both BPL and Champions League is not a bad result by any measure. </p>
              <p>Fergie himself took several years to produce results. Some people just don't seem to understand that you can't always get good results overnight.</p>

However the team are made up of professional players, they were kind of auto mode. Also Avram Grant was not able to get the result from the main rival, i.e he lost to Man United, wasn't that the factor why the BPL was lost. Pts are important against the main rivals.</p></div>
