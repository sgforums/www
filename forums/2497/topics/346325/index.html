              <p>Liverpool striker Robbie Keane is on his way to Tottenham today.</p>
              <p>The <em>Daily Mail</em> says Tottenham had a £15million offer
              for Keane accepted by Liverpool on Sunday night and he is expected to
              sign on at White Hart Lane on Monday.</p>
              <p>It will complete one of the most spectacular deals of the transfer window.</p>
              <p>Just six months after Keane’s £20.3m move north, the striker
              left out of Liverpool’s squad for the 2-0 victory over Chelsea at
              Anfield on Sunday will return, giving Spurs a £5.3m profit on the deal.</p>
              <p>Keane’s £90,000 a week salary was proving to be problematic but a solution has been found.</p>
              <p>Tottenham’s highest paid player is Jonathan Woodgate on £70,000
              a week, although £20,000 of that is still being subsidised by his
              former club Middlesbrough as part of the arrangement to sell him last
              January.</p>

              <h1>Liverpool reject £15m Spurs offer for Robbie Keane</h1>
              <h2>Liverpool on Sunday night rejected a £15 million offer from Tottenham to take striker Robbie Keane back to White Hart Lane.</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01251/robbie-keane_1251088c.jpg" alt="Sitting it out: Liverpool's Irish forward Robbie Keane (C) takes his seat in the stand before the match with Chelsea at Anfield" width="460" height="296"></p>
              <p><span class="caption"><em>Sitting it out: Liverpool's Irish forward Robbie Keane (centre) takes his seat in the stand before the match with Chelsea at Anfield.</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Although Anfield sources said they would consider selling the player if Spurs increased their offer considerably, Rafael Benitez's confidence that Keane will remain a Liverpool player after the 5pm transfer window closes this evening looks well placed.</strong></p>
              <p>The Republic of Ireland international's future has been the subject of intense speculation for weeks now. He played only eight minutes of Liverpool's three key games last week and did not even merit a place on the bench for last Monday's Mersey derby or Sunday's 2-0 win over Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Manchester City are also believed to be monitoring the situation in the hope of tempting the boyhood Liverpool fan away from Anfield just six months after he arrived.</p>
              <p>However, any move appears unlikely, given the lack of time available to Liverpool to bring in a replacement, and Benitez said he expected to have Keane available for Wednesday's FA Cup replay at Goodison Park. He said: "I think he will be here at the end of the month, yes. I spoke with him about the game before, not about his future, and he is OK."</p>
              <p>Unlike last Monday's match, Keane attended Sunday's game, politely applauding Fernando Torres's double salvo and leaving his seat just before the final whistle.</p>
              <p>He was joined in the stands by the club's co-owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks, the first time the two Americans have come face-to-face since August and their first trip to Anfield since December 2007.</p>
              <p>Both sat, accompanied by their families, in the directors' box, separated by around a dozen seats. They will meet Benitez and the club's chief executive Rick Parry this week and are believed to be ready to offer the Spaniard a four-year deal worth around £20 million, complete with full control over the club's transfers.</p>
              <p>Under the latest terms to be drawn up, Parry will be given a brief more concerned with the club's commercial activity. Beating Chelsea has not been Benitez's only significant victory this week.</p>
              <p>The former Valencia manager did not comment on his contract, insisting he was focused solely on enjoying a win which reignites Liverpool's title challenge.</p>
              <p>He said: "It is always important to win, regardless of who is sitting in the crowd. We deserved to win.</p>
              <p>"I haven't seen the replay of the red card, but I am sure that it was not a foul by Xabi Alonso, if that is what [the Chelsea manager] Luiz Felipe Scolari is saying.</p>
              <p>"Before, we were in a good position in the title race. Now we are in a better position. But that can change almost every day, so what you have to do is make sure that you always win."</p>

              <p><strong>Robbie Keane is on his way back to Tottenham after agreeing personal terms with his former club.</strong></p>
              <p>Liverpool and Spurs last night agreed a £15million deal for the striker, who was undergoing a medical at White Hart Lane today.</p>
              <p>Sources close to the deal believe that the transfer is virtually done after Anfield officials accepted Tottenham's £15m bid.</p>
              <p>The sensational transfer comes just six months after Keane’s £20.3m move north.</p>
              <p>The striker was left out of Liverpool’s squad for the 2-0 victory over Chelsea at Anfield and the move will produce Spurs a £5.3m profit.</p>

              <p><strong>Keane becomes a Spurs player again</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/liverpool/keane_chase.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>Robbie Keane has ended his Liverpool career and returned to Tottenham after just six miserable months at Anfield. </strong></p>
              <p>Keane becomes the third former Spurs player to move back to White
              Hart Lane during the transfer window, following in the footsteps of
              former strike partner Jermain Defoe and France defender Pascal
              Chimbonda.</p>
              <p>Keane was hailed as the missing piece of Rafa Benitez’s jigsaw when
              he signed for what he described as his ‘boyhood club’ in July of last
              year but has since struggled to justify the £20 million plus fee that
              he commanded.</p>
              <p>He has become increasingly out of vogue under Benitez’s charge and
              has been left out of two of the Spaniard’s matchday squads altogether
              in recent weeks. </p>
              <p>Half an hour after the 5pm Monday deadline had passed, Spurs
              confirmed the return of a player who has previously made 254
              appearances for the club.</p>
              <p>"We never wanted Robbie to leave in the summer, we acknowledged the
              six years dedicated service he gave this club and reluctantly let him
              go,” said chairman Daniel Levy on the club’s official website.</p>
              <p>“I am delighted that he has chosen to return to us. We can all
              recall the passion and fight he displayed during his previous seasons
              with us. I know he is determined to give us his full commitment.”</p>
              <p>Keane was equally upbeat over his arrival back in North London, admitting that his move to Merseyside had failed to pay off.</p>
              <p>"It was a difficult decision to make to leave Tottenham in the summer,” he said. “It proved not to be the right move for me.</p>
              <p>“I know some Spurs fans will feel I let them down by leaving but I
              can assure them I shall be giving my all for this club - this club has
              terrific fans and I want to repay them for all their support. We've got
              to get on and fight our way up that league table."</p>
              <p>Benitez looks to have offloaded Keane without replacement, a
              decision which will surely leave him open to criticism should The Reds'
              title tilt begin to waver.</p>
