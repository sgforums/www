              <p>Acrdg to some reports, Is it really true that the Keane signing was the board's decision, not Benitez?</p>
              <p>Alot of people will label Keane as a expensive flop and i really feel sorry for him. He had not been given the chance to prove himself at his dream club. Just when he is finding his feet in the team, he's dropped again for no apparant reason. I really cant figure out how Benitez would rather have Ngog on the bench than him, there might be something between them that was not made public.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">ROBBIE KEANE will return to White Hart Lane as an Anfield fall-guy who failed to make an impact. Yet arguably the Irishman’s biggest mistake was quite simple — he was not called Gareth Barry. </h2>
              <p class="article">Boss Rafa Benitez, for all his veiled suggestions to the contrary, <strong>DID</strong> want Keane. He was <strong>NOT</strong> merely an alternative when attempts to land Barry from Aston Villa were scuppered. </p>
              <p class="article">Benitez had identified the then-Spurs frontman as a key addition last season. The Spaniard was determined to bring him <strong>AND</strong> Barry to Liverpool, with the sale of Peter Crouch and Xabi Alonso funding it. </p>
              <p class="article">When Crouch joined Portsmouth, in came Keane to fill the gap up front. When Alonso stayed put, the Kop boss was told the money was not available to bring in the Villa skipper too. Benitez was not pleased and — if he had to choose just one — Barry would have been the man. </p>
              <p class="article">From that moment Keane, very much a pawn in the political game which is tearing Anfield apart, was on a hiding to nothing. Last night it led to Liverpool taking an £8million hit on the deal when he rejoined Spurs for just £12m. </p>
              <p class="article">But while Keane, 28, himself would admit he has never hit the heights, there are certain excuses for his failing. After arriving as supposedly the perfect partner for Fernando Torres — backed up by their display in a stunning pre-season win at Rangers — he was then used on the right in another friendly win over Valerenga. </p>
              <p class="article">Benitez likes his players to perform in a variety of positions. Witness Dirk Kuyt’s role as the prime example, going from central attacker to right wing. </p>
              <p class="article">Keane simply was not a wide man, so that was one box left unticked. True, he did not make the immediate impact everyone hoped and expected for a man who cost £20m. But it took Peter Beardsley three months to take off when he signed, in 1987, yet no one farmed him out as a flop. Torres’ battles with injuries meant the partnership never got off the ground.</p>
              <p class="article">So how ironic that when the Spaniard rediscovers his shooting boots, Keane is sold the next day. When Keane slipped a superb through ball for David Ngog to score against PSV Eindhoven in December, fans were salivating at what he would provide for Torres when he was back. </p>
              <p class="article">It was a chance that never came. If, heaven forbid, Torres’ hamstring does sideline him at any stage in the second half of the campaign, it will hardly be the most potent strikeforce Liverpool have ever taken into Europe. </p>
              <p class="article">Should that be the case it is a safe bet the Koppites who have sided with Benitez through all the in-fighting will not be belting out his name with quite as much gusto. To say the least.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Keane gets a new number...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>At least Robbie Keane had the guts to admit </strong><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>his move to Liverpool didn't work out</strong></span><strong><span style="color: #000000;">.</span> I wonder if Rafael Benitez would say the same.</strong></p>
              <p>Apart from Keane though, who is the winner? Benitez will forever have the £20.3million price tag that he paid for the striker hanging round his neck like a wing-clipped albatross. He is also left with only the one top class striker to lead Liverpool's title charge - <span style="color: #000000;">and that could depend on Fernando Torres's hamstrings</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span> Selling Keane at a mighty loss will also not endear Benitez to his employers, who are somewhat strapped for cash already.</p>
              <p>Tottenham, on the other hand, are signing a player they know can have his head turned. Nine goals in 31 games suggests his edge has been blunted since moving to Anfield.</p>
              <p>Then there is the make-up of the squad he is rejoining. Keane was at his best alongside Dimitar Berbatov, a player whose talents have long since been utilised far, far away from the perils of White Hart Lane. With Jermain Defoe out for a lengthy spell Keane will have to strike up a partnership with Roman Pavlyuchenko or Darren Bent. Would you be excited about that?</p>
              <p>So who's got the better end of the stick - Benitez or Redknapp?</p>
