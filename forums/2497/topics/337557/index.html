              <h1>Calderón Ready To Make Or Break Schuster - Reports</h1>
              <h2>Ramón Calderón will decide whether Bernd Schuster stays or goes at Real Madrid before the club's annual assembly on December 7 and the fans' reaction next weekend could make his mind up, according to a report.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/12151_news.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Los Merengues' president is becoming the target for the supporters and hopes to avoid being blamed for the current problems by ensuring that the spotlight remains on the coach.</strong></p>
              <p>Barça-biased El Mundo Deportivo believes that Calderón and sporting director Predrag Mijatovic will see whether the fans jeer or applaud the team and Schuster after the game against Recreativo.</p>
              <p>If it is favourable then, he will stay in place. If not, a new man will be found and presented before the president has to speak at the assembly in December.</p>
              <p>The Catalan daily believes that while names such as Roberto Mancini, Juande Ramos and Frank Rijkaard have all been considered, former player and B team coach Michel would be a popular choice.</p>
              <p>While some players have voiced their support for Schuster, others have reportedly let it be known that they are keen to see the back of the German and hope his exit comes soon.</p>
              <p>In Madrid, Marca have gone against AS, who appear to be favouring the coach's exit, and held a poll which has clearly come up showing that fans blame Calderón.</p>
              <p>Robinho's exit, coupled with the focus on Cristiano Ronaldo at the expense of looking into other additions, has added to the feeling of discontent already in place after the president failed to live up to his pre-election promise to sign Kaká and Cesc Fàbregas.</p>
              <p>Madrid are still in the top four, but the defeats by Juventus in Italy and Spain, allied with the Copa del Rey defeat by Real Unión, has meant that the loss at Real Valladolid has created anxiety that will now mean changes have to be made.</p>
              <p>Schuster has insisted that his squad is unbalanced and that a new striker and some more wide players are needed, and it appears that many supporters are beginning to share his frustrations.</p>
              <p>If Calderón does try to escape from any blame by installing a new trainer within two weeks, it could be a risky strategy, as calls for him to go are already being made.</p>
