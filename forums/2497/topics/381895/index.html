              <p>Well... Just do the maths and I guess its the right time to go considering the new tax rate of 50% comes into play in April...</p>
              <p>Going to Barce in the new season will see him get tax only 23%. Somemore with a higher weekly salary of €120k a week compare to what he is getting now roughly on around $80k weekly... So I guess its a no brainer to stay... cos even if the "Beckham rule" was to be abolish in Spain, he will still be tax at only 40% of his new improve salary... compare this to his lower pay at $80k and higher taxation in England... The wife also becomes a convenient piece of excuse...</p>
              <p>We just have to assume he gets €120k a week at Barce, after 23% tax he will still take home = €92 400.</p>
              <p>Even if after 40% tax, he still takes home = €72 000.</p>
              <p>At Pool, he currently gets around pounds $80k, after current 40% tax, he takes home $48k a week... But if its 50% tax... It wll mean he takes back $40k a week only...</p>
              <p>So which ever way you look at it, its still a good deal to go unless Pool give him a big pay raise cos the pounds and the euros are almost about the same this days...</p>

              <p>32 million euros comes up to around 28.6 million pounds, which is ALOT of money for a diving/play-acting buck-tooth sissy who winces on the ground under minor challenges.</p>

              <p>IMHO, roy evans is the best liverpool manager in recent times (yes, i'm not kidding), and this is coming from a neutral fan's point of view. At least the football is more entertaining during his reign, even though they didnt win anything under him.</p>
              <p>Houllier came in shortly after to co-manage with Evans. His early days in charge are okay. Once he's in sole charge, the pressure sets in and the football was shit, much worse than what Rafa is putting up now. (remember the long balls to Heskey and Owen?) Still remember the classic line from him, "We have turned the corner!"</p>
