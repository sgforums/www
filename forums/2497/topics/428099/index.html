              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Arsenal</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> look increasingly likely to end a sixth consecutive season without a trophy after they were held to a dramatic 1-1 draw by </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> at the Emirates this afternoon. </span></strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>Robin van Persie looked to have clinched Arsenal a valuable three points with an injury-time penalty, but Emmanuel Eboue then rashly challenged Lucas Leiva to present Dirk Kuyt with the chance to equalise with the last kick of the game.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>Both Arsene Wenger and Eboue were left angrily remonstrating with referee Andre Marriner as they left the pitch. Arsenal are now six points adrift of Manchester United at the top of the Premier League table with only six matches of the season remaining.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>The goalless draw was not without potentially damaging consequences for Liverpool, for whom two key players had their contributions restricted by injury.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>Andy Carroll jarred his leg as he stretched for a second-half pass and, while he did initially attempt to play on, it appeared that his knee was giving him significant discomfort.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>Jamie Carragher was also stretchered off in a neck brace after an accidental clash of heads with his team-mate John Flanagan.</p>
              <p>Encouraging, Liverpool had confirmed by the end of the match that Carragher was fully conscious and speaking to club staff in the dressing-room.</p>
              <p>With Wojciech Szczesny, Johan Djourou and Theo Walcott all returning to the Arsenal starting line-up following recent injury, the question was whether it would be too little and too late for Arsene Wenger’s team. Those players were clearly missed during costly draws against Sunderland, West Brom and Blackburn and, although it will take time for them to recover full match fitness, an improvement was initially obvious. Walcott caused Fabio Aurelio immediate problems with the pace and timing of his runs, while also providing an early test of Pepe Reina.</p>
              <p>Aurelio eventually hobbled off after 21 minutes, leaving teenage full-backs Jack Robinson and John Flanagan to deal admirably with the respective threat of Walcott and Samir Nasri.</p>
              <p>Indeed, just as in the recent home games against Sunderland and Blackburn, Arsenal found themselves struggling to break down opponents who got players behind the ball and focussed on restricting their passing from midfield.</p>
              <p>Cesc Fabregas was particularly quiet, with his only first-half sight of goal arriving after an exchange of passes with Van Persie.</p>
              <p>The closest Arsenal came during an uneventful first-half was from a set-piece when Laurent Koscielny headed Van Persie’s corner against the crossbar.</p>
              <p>Liverpool were content to stifle Arsenal’s pressure and look for their chances on the counter-attack. Luis Suarez tested Szczesny with a free-kick while Jay Spearing might have won a penalty after a slightly clumsy challenge from Djourou.</p>
              <p>The general pattern continued early in the second-half, although the match was halted for two significant periods to deal with the injuries both to Carroll and, most worryingly, Carragher.</p>
              <p>As the time ticked down, Wenger made positive substitutions, bringing on Andrei Arshavin and Nicklas Bendtner. There were chances at both ends, with Van Persie and Suarez having shots well saved by Reina and Szczesny before the controversial finale.</p>
              <p>Boos rang out on the final whistle; an unhappy soundtrack for a watching Stan Kroenke at the end of what was his first Arsenal game since assuming majority control of the club.</p>

              <p>well, was reading reports that MU fans are asking for FA action on King Kenny(KK)'s comments given how FA 'treated' rooney.</p>
              <p>Some Reds (pool) fans are crying foul that Pool just gave MU a boost and they turned around to ask for KK's head.</p>
              <p>For me, I think Pool did their job for their own european aspirations, (they did beat MU). And if the FA is impartial, they should look @ KK's case on its own.</p>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Kenny Dalglish insists Liverpool remain the "best club in English football, if not world football" despite pushing great rivals Manchester United a step closer to a record 19 domestic championship titles after snatching a dramatic 1-1 draw with the last kick of the Premier League game at Arsenal. </strong></p>
              <p>Dirk Kuyt's penalty with the last kick of the game secured a point for the Reds, who had earlier seen captain Jamie Carragher knocked out after a clash of heads with John Flanagan and carried off on a stretcher.</p>
              <p>Just moments earlier, though, it had seemed as if Arsenal would keep up the pressure on United when Robin van Persie scored from the spot deep into eight minutes of stoppage time.</p>
              <p>With United now six points ahead of the Gunners, it seems the championship is set to return to Old Trafford, which would see the Red Devils eclipse the achievements of their rivals from Merseyside.</p>
              <p>However, for Dalglish, that would not take anything away from Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"Sadness? In my eyes we are still the best club in English football, if not world football, so I am not very sad at that," said the Scot, in his second stint as manager at Anfield, where he won a plethora of honours as a player.</p>
              <p>"The surprise is that they [Liverpool] have not won the title for a long time, that is the surprise, but it's not sadness, it's just a fact of life.</p>
              <p>"They never acquired enough points in any season since 1991 to win it.</p>
              <p>"They came close a couple of years ago when Rafa (Benitez) went close, had a fantastic record against the so-called top four, but just couldn't get it over the line."</p>
              <p>Dalglish added: "It will be fantastic to get back there, but you need to hit the standards other teams have set.</p>
              <p>"That is four games - United, [Manchester] City, Arsenal and Chelsea. We only dropped two points and that was here."</p>
              <p>Dalglish believes his injury-hit squad can take great heart from recent displays.</p>
              <p>"I don't think there's any team anywhere that's shown the same attitude and commitment that our team showed," said Dalglish, who took £35million striker Andy Carroll off as a precaution after he jarred his knee.</p>
              <p>"Losing Fabio Aurelio early on, putting a 17-year-old on at left-back, losing our captain, having right-back at only 18 with his second game, we have lost our centre forward, we've lost a goal and eight minutes into injury time they still didn't want to accept that were going to get nothing from the game.</p>
              <p>"You can't speak any higher about them than that."</p>
              <p>Dalglish was quick to play down a touchline spat with Wenger at the final whistle.</p>
              <p>"That would be sad too if that was reported," he said.</p>
              <p>"I just told him there I still owe him dinner. There's no problem."</p>
              <p>Carragher, meanwhile, maintained there was no cause for alarm over his head injury despite being carried off on a stretcher, his neck in a brace and given oxygen.</p>
              <p>However, after treatment at the Emirates Stadium, the veteran Reds centre-half had recovered enough to join in the celebrations at the final whistle.</p>
              <p>"It was a little clash of heads and these things happen in football. As soon as I came round I was absolutely fine," the 33-year-old said.</p>
              <p>"I watched their penalty in the dressing room and then saw that we got our own.</p>
              <p>"I was just praying that we scored because to get four points out of six from the last two games is fantastic.</p>
              <p>"I went out onto the pitch at the end because I wanted to celebrate with the lads."</p>
              <p>Carragher added: "Some of the players we had out there, because of the injuries we had, still qualify for the youth team so it was a really good team performance."</p>

              <p>well, was reading reports that MU fans are asking for FA action on King Kenny(KK)'s comments given how FA 'treated' rooney.</p>
              <p>Some Reds (pool) fans are crying foul that Pool just gave MU a boost and they turned around to ask for KK's head.</p>
              <p>For me, I think Pool did their job for their own european aspirations, (they did beat MU). And if the FA is impartial, they should look @ KK's case on its own.</p>

              <p>There is no comparison between Rooney and KK. KK was caught on camera swearing at Wenger while Rooney ran off to the camera and deliberately swear for the whole world to see. I actually heard the word very clearly at that time. Nothing wrong with that to be honest but because he is "Rooney" and the fact that he shouted directly at the camera actually made it an offence. Players always swear at every game anyway..you can read their lips; they swear all the time.</p>
