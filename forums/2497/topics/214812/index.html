            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Arsene: I'm being robbed</strong><br><br>ARSENE WENGER has accused international bosses of behaving like car thieves. He says they push players to the limit without worrying about the consequences.<br><br>Wenger said: Â“I feel like a man who has given the double of his key to a mate. The guy comes, takes your car, uses it for 10 days and leaves it in the middle of a field without any petrol.<br><br>Â“National team managers have the law with them and they have practically all chosen to act the same way. The easy way.<br><br>Playing 12 or 14 qualifying games in 10 or 12 months is madness.Â”<br><br>Surprisingly, Wenger revealed ex-England boss Sven Goran Eriksson did show respect for clubs.<br><br>Wenger added: Â“Sven is the only one who called regularly, who came by and talked. But he had managed big clubs and knew their problems.<br><br>Â“I never have the others on. They give you back the players and you never know what state theyÂ’re in.Â”<br></div>

The Frenchman insisted that Walcott be left to concentrate on football for the first six months of his time at Arsenal and did not give him a first-team debut until this season.</div>

He said at the end he didnÂ’t want to talk about it anymore.<br><br>Â“He was happy to talk about other stuff with the boss but not that.<br><br>Â“It was a clear goal from me, whatever you want to say about it.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m sorry but, once again, I donÂ’t know what to say about that. To give me a yellow straight away Â— please, look at the replay.Â”<br><br>Henry also hinted Arsenal are short-changed by European referees who give favourable decisions to the big teams.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>frankly, if one reads into the football matches, be very afraid of this current crop of players in Arsenal..<br><br>their captain is at his prime and he will be for a couple more years..<br><br>the rest of the team are still learning their craft and are still maturing.. and are already playing astounding football..<br><br>the hard time Chelsea took to overcome Reading which was nonchalantly taken apart by Arsenal's young squad, speaks volumes...<br><br>you may be looking at a squad which may dominate in the next few years.. and looking at the young age of most of the squad, they may be dominating for a long time if they can manage to keep these players..</div>
