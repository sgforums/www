Perhaps its because the club is perceive to lack the prestige thats why other clubs thinks they can come around and raid its squad.<br><br>Since the days of Nicolas Anelka, they seem to lose their star player almost every year... Marc Overmars, Emmanuel Petit, Sylvain Wiltord, Edu, Ashley Cole, JosÃ© Antonio Reyes... all these players made a name for themselves at Arsenal but left them when they became well-known... Maybe a Chelsea, a Real Madrid or a Barcelona would come picking Wenger's best players away. It has become almost like a every year event. Even their current captain almost left for Barcelona too if you can recall.<br><br>And i won't be too surprise if they lose Francesc FÃ bregas, Robin van Persie, Emmanuel Adebayor... in the next few years cos contracts are not really full-prove these days.<br><br>The only player that stayed back without ever considering leaving was Dennis Bergkamp.</div>

These so called "bigger clubs" like Barce &amp; Real always pick on Arsenal. I don't recall Liverpool &amp; Utd getting pick on over the last few years.<br><br>Long contracts are not really full prove already, just look at Reyes... he came as an almost unknown and when he became a better player after 2 yrs with the gunners... Real came in for him. To add insult to it, they paid almost $17m for him and Real only offered $8m for him  when he became a better player cos they knew he wants to join them even tho his contract still has 3 yrs to run.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They really need to find ways to breakdown a defensive play by opponent, not always they can enjoy free flowing attacking football. They are moving to fast and always use counter attack which many teams had learnt to counteract this kind of play. Not like Man U and Chelsea where they dun really play counter attack football, but with crosses which Arsenal dun really do.<br><br>4-5-1 is a very good formation to play against big team, which infact is a negative tactic but it work very well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Updated: Nov. 10, 2006<br><strong>Fabregas slates the 'anti-football' of Premiership rivals</strong><br><br>Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas has slated the Gunners Premiership rivals for playing 'anti-football'.<br>He said: 'Teams just defend, defend and defend, they try to waste time.<br>'I call it 'anti-football' - but we have to accept this happens and break teams down.<br><br>'From my experiences in the Premier League, I would have to say that I could never play like that because I am only really happy if we are winning games and playing good football, not being so happy to draw and play in such a negative way with 10 defenders.'<br><br>Despite the frustrations of what he sees as other teams' negativity, and their failure to counter Arsenal's fast-flowing football with anything except classic English tenacity, the Spanish international has stated how content he is with the North London club.<br><br>'I love the people here, all of the players and all of the staff. We play fantastic football under Arsene Wenger, football which I really think suits me. I really enjoy every game and training sessions because of the way we play. Everything I want is here and I feel important at Arsenal. I have renewed my contract for eight years and I have the longest contract in Premiership history.'<br><br>But his comments are unlikely to find favour with rival players and fans, who can point to the fact that Arsenal are languishing ten points off the top of the league as evidence that playing the beautiful game successfully can involve more than making it look attractive.</div>
