              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>LONDON - The English
              Premier League, under pressure from football's authorities and the
              British government, plans to bolster its financial regulations, notably
              toughening rules on who can own or invest in a club.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The proposals are in response
              to a request from British Sports Minister Andy Burnham to the high
              profile league and the Football Association for plans to curb debt and
              increase financial transparency as the game comes to terms with the
              worst economic slump in nearly 80 years.</p>
              <p>English clubs have amassed
              debts of around three billion pounds with nearly a third of that owed
              by the top four, Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal,
              sparking criticism from lawmakers and politicians.<br> <br> The proposals announced by Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore on Monday, include:</p>
              <p>- an independent audit of club accounts to determine whether a club is a "going concern", in other words financially viable.</p>
              <p>- an annual requirement to
              demonstrate that the club does not have outstanding debts to other
              clubs, in income tax or National Insurance payments.</p>
              <p>- improve ownership rules such
              as requiring disclosure of any interest in a club above 10 percent and
              an extension of the rule whereby conviction for certain offences leads
              to ineligibility for directorship.</p>
              <p>- the range of these offences
              will be widened and would exclude persons who have been sentenced to at
              least a year in prison or convicted of a so-called dishonesty such as
              fraud, ticket touting or hooliganism.</p>
              <p>"These regulations go above and beyond the laws of the land," Scudamore told a panel of reporters.</p>
              <p>"Clubs have bought into this
              and I am confident we can have further progress in the future. These
              rules will help to steer us through what could be choppy waters."</p>
              <p>FIFA president Sepp Blatter
              said on Saturday debt-laden Premier League clubs could be hardest hit
              by the global credit crunch, while Michel Platini, head of European
              football body UEFA, said the game was ready to financially implode.</p>
              <p>"Clubs are smarter and more in tune than some of the rhetoric we have heard," Scudamore said.</p>
              <p>"The professionalism of clubs,
              such as their accountants and lawyers, has never been better. We have
              not shied away from our responsibilities."</p>
              <p>Scudamore said the new guidelines, if approved by the league's 20 clubs, should come into force for the start of next season.</p>
