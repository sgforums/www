              <p> </p>
              <p>I have been a long time supporter of the Sky Blues and some of you may know that *we* are among the most passionate supporters of the club.  Having followed them for the longest time, it is no surprise that City often fails at the last hurdle or shoots itself in the foot or whatever ... we kinda expect City to do these things but still love the club to bits even tho it has gone down to Div 2 at one point.</p>
              <p>Like the majority of you guys, we are also surprised (maybe a little embarrassed) about what has been going on for the last few seasons or so.  The recent money moves bankrolled by Abu Dhabi have thrust us under a new spotlight and created amix of awe, animosity and jealousy but to us City faithful, the feeling of incredulity.</p>
              <p>Many of you in this forum have dissed what has happened in the last 6 mths starting with the Kaka saga.  The reality is that we have new owners now ... and they should be able to decide just how they want to spend their money.  Surely it is not up to anyone like Sepp Blatter or Rafa to say just how we should do it.  Many have done this before but just because they come from the top 4 clubs then it is *expected*  of them?</p>
              <p>Many have said that buying players is one thing but getting them to gel is another.  Don't worry - we the long suffering faithful are aware of this ever since Roman started his moves all those years back.  We said the same things then and are careful not to say we will win.</p>
              <p>In fact no City supporter has said that outright.  We know better from our earlier bungling days.  Sparky has never said it would be easy but yet many have questioned us about having 10 strikers, no defence, too many players on the payroll without CL soccer.  We know all that but need to trust in MH to do it.</p>
              <p>Many of you have said we would not win the Premier League or might not even be in the top 6 or other similar statements.  If you have been a City supporter as long as some of us have, you would know that we would be grateful just to remain and not get relegated.  The events of this summer should enable us to be on a better footing but we remain hopeful of glory.</p>
              <p>The people who have ranted against us typically come from supporters of the Big 4.  Old Purple Nose's comments come across as deeply satisfying.  If MC are such a small club, why does he bother?  The same goes for Rafa and Chelsea (over the JT saga).  Why do they feel threatened?  Ironically others like MON or Wenger have been more analytical in their comments and are adopting a more cautious tone.</p>
              <p>So relax guys.  Spare a thought for the City supporters who want their club to do well.  Don't you want the same?</p>
