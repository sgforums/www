              <h1>Rafa Benitez: I want Fernando 
              Torres cash - showdown talks key to future of Liverpool boss</h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Rafa Benitez will 
              hold crunch talks with 
              Liverpool chairman 
              Martin Broughton 
              today with his tenure 
              as manager in the balance and 
              the club reeling from Chelsea's 
              bold move for Fernando 
              Torres.</p>
              <p>As Chelsea prepare to offer Â£70million for Liverpool's star striker, 
              Benitez will meet Broughton in London 
              and demand written assurances 
              that all money raised from player 
              sales can be used to sign new ones.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/05/article-1273400-06F59740000005DC-978_468x302.jpg" alt="Chelsea and Manchester City are chasing Liverpool's Fernando 
              Torres" width="468" height="302">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Hot shot: Chelsea and Manchester City are 
              chasing Liverpool's Fernando Torres</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Benitez believed he had been given such a guarantee when he signed 
              his new contract last year, but monies from sales have since been used 
              to service the club's debts.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, Broughton is unlikely
               to be able to give 50-year-old Benitez the promise he is seeking, due 
              to the chairman's non-executive role and the club's delicate financial 
              state. That will frustrate Benitez further and push him into a corner 
              over his future, which is still very uncertain with Juventus waiting for
               him to decide if he is keen to move to Turin at the end of the season.</p>
              <p>Privately, Chelsea are surprised that their discreet move for Torres 
              has become public. Yet the rumbling confusion over Benitez's future has 
              encouraged them to believe they can be successful in their battle with 
              Manchester City for the 26-year-old rated the world's best striker.</p>
              <p>The divide between Benitez and the club's hierarchy seems to be growing
               wider with every day and the stark realisation that the talismanic 
              Torres could be sold has brought the club's dramatic slide into sharp 
              focus.</p>
              <p>Juventus are waiting patiently for an answer on their 
              four-year contract offer for Benitez, but the Spaniard is believed to 
              have reservations about taking on the challenge in Turin with the club 
              in such a state of transition. However, the sale of Torres would leave 
              Liverpool in a similar situation and most probably turn dwindling public
               support against the manager.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/05/article-1273400-09670023000005DC-451_468x379.jpg" alt="Rafa Benitez will hold crunch talks with Liverpool chairman Martin
               Broughton" width="468" height="379">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Show and tell: Rafa Benitez will hold crunch 
              talks with Liverpool chairman Martin Broughton</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>If, as seems likely, Benitez does depart, the presence of Kop idol 
              Kenny Dalglish as an intermin manager will at least appease fans as the 
              club searches for a suitable replacement. However, the pressure will be 
              on for them to make giant str ides quickly after such a disappointing 
              season on all fronts.</p>
              <p>The sale of the club is paramount to those 
              changes, but the project Benitez began in 2004 seems no closer to 
              completion. Although Liverpool have made plans to sign new players, the 
              extent of that recruitment is difficult for them to predict.</p>
              <p>The 
              club have held preliminary talks with Real Madrid about Rafael van der 
              Vaart and were linked with Real's Royston Drenthe and Guti yesterday, 
              but any such moves are likely to be shelved until Benitez and Torres final ise their futures. Dutchman Drenthe has potential but Guti - 
              although a free transfer - would be unlikely.</p>
              <p>Fiorentina have 
              expressed an interest in Liverpool midfielder Alberto Aquilani, although
               his agent Franco Zavaglia said: 'I don't think there is anything 
              concrete. It is still too early to tell if a deal is possible.</p>
              <p>'First of all, the priority is to finish the season well. Then we will 
              know what will be the future at Liverpool.'</p>

              <p>I get the feeling that Rafa is doing everything himself to get himself sacked.Â Playing hardball with the management and airing dirty laundry in public seems to be indicative of that.</p>
              <p>After all, if Rafa gets sacked, he has to be given the golden handshake. If he were to resign, he may not get any compensation and may in fact have to pay a penalty for tearing up the contract prematurely.</p>
              <p>Seriously, are his current statements indicative of a manager who really wants to stay out of a true sense of duty to the club?</p>

              <h1>Fernando Torres: If Rafa Benitez is too 
              slow, I'll leave
                                      Liverpool (for Â£70million)<br></h1>
              <p>Fernando Torres was anxiously awaiting news 
              of Rafa Benitezâs
                                      meeting with<br> Liverpool chairman Martin Broughton last night 
              after deciding he
                                      wants his uncertain Anfield future resolved in 
              the next week.</p>
              <p>Liverpoolâs record Â£21million signing is in 
              demand after it
                                      became clear Anfield bosses may have to cash in 
              on him, with
                                      Chelsea, Manchester City and Barcelona all 
              waiting for any
                                      encouragement to open a bidding war that could 
              send the fee soaring
                                      to Â£70m.</p>
              <p>While Benitez presented his argument to 
              Broughton over why any
                                      proceeds should go towards strengthening his 
              squad, rather than
                                      servicing the clubâs debt, Torres was agonising 
              over his next
                                      move.</p>
              <div><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/06/article-0-0970725F000005DC-453_468x313.jpg"><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/06/article-0-0970725F000005DC-453_468x313.jpg" alt="Deadline set: Torres (left) wants no distraction as he gets ready

              <p><em>Deadline set: Torres (left) 
              wants no distraction as
                                      he gets ready for the World Cup</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Alarmed at the way Liverpoolâs campaign has 
              petered out and left
                                      them lagging behind their main rivals, he wants 
              answers on whether
                                      Benitez is staying and evidence of a strategy to
               guard against any
                                      repeat of this seasonâs failings.</p>
              <p>Eager to avoid any unwanted distractions 
              ahead of next monthâs
                                      World Cup, he has made it clear he needs to know
               Liverpoolâs
                                      intentions before he leaves Merseyside next 
              week, in readiness for
                                      linking up with the Spain squad. He may be 
              prepared to tolerate one
                                      more season without Champions League football 
              but is ready to move
                                      on, should Liverpool deem a Â£70m offer too good 
              to turn down.</p>
              <p>Chelsea remain keen, as revealed in <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span> earlier this week, though
                                      Cityâs hopes appear to have been dashed by the 
              1-0 defeat by
                                      Tottenham.</p>
              <p>Liverpool issued a statement last night that 
              appeared to cast
                                      further doubt on the prospects of Benitez 
              leaving to take over at
                                      Juventus. It claimed the talks, attended by 
              managing director
                                      Christian Purslow as well as Broughton and 
              Benitez, had been
                                      âconstructiveâ but added it was only the first 
              of a series of
                                      planned meetings.</p>

              Benitez be next
                                      season?</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>With Juventus wanting an answer from the 
              Liverpool boss by the
                                      start of next week, they may finally abandon 
              their pursuit of him
                                      and turn to alternative targets, such as 
              Fiorentinaâs Cesare
                                      Prandelli.</p>
              <p>Jamie Carragher, meanwhile, explained why he 
              was happy to shelve
                                      negotiations over his future until the start of 
              next season, even
                                      though, by then, he will have less than a year 
              to run on his
                                      contract.</p>
              <p>The 32-year-old defender said: âI understand 
              that, at my age,
                                      you can only make decisions season on season.â</p>

              <p>I dun expect Ah Ben to stay around as he already used up all his excuses and there are no funds for him to buy new players.</p>
