              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Sami Hyypia has spoken of his disappointment at
              being omitted from Liverpool's Champions League squad - but hopes to
              play a part this season.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>New regulations dictate that clubs must include at least eight home-grown players in their 25-man party.</p>
              <p>Finnish defender Hyypia has been one of the unlucky imports to
              miss out and will be left in England as the Reds get their European
              campaign underway against Marseille next Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The veteran centre-half admits he is shocked to have missed the
              cut, but still hopes to play a crucial role for the club this season.</p>
              <p>"The manager's decision to leave me out of the squad is a big disappointment for me," he told the Liverpool Echo.</p>
              <p>"I understand it's partly because of the UEFA regulations, but despite that, the news came as a surprise to me and a shock too.</p>
              <p>"But the club had a 'perfect' timing for this: they didn't want
              me to move elsewhere, so that's why I was told the news of having been
              left out, just after the transfer window had closed.</p>
              <p>"The club went public to say there had been offers for me, but
              turned them down. So perhaps that means I am still part of the plans
              for this season.</p>
              <p>"I don't know if I would have wanted to move on, had I heard the news about the squad when the window was still open."</p>
              <p>UEFA regulations stipulate four players must be 'association
              trained' (produced by an English academy) while four must be 'domestic
              association trained (produced by the club's academy).</p>
              <p>As such, Liverpool have named Jamie Carragher, Steven Gerrard,
              Jay Spearing and Stephen Darby as their 'domestic' players, with Robbie
              Keane, Jermaine Pennant, Steven Irwin and Martin Kelly filling the
              other spots.</p>
              <p>While Hyypia is disappointed to miss out at this juncture, a
              new list will be submitted prior to the knockout stages - should
              Liverpool make it that far.</p>

              <h2 id="ctl00_ctl00_Full_Main_Main_stcArticleBodyNew_hHeader" class="football">Rafa red in the face over Uefa ruling</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.setantasports.com/upload/Sport/Football/Premiership/liverpool/hyypia_red.jpg" alt="" width="356" height="190"></p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez has lambasted the Uefa ruling which he
              says forced him to leave Sami Hyypia out of his squad for the Champions
              League.</strong></p>
              <p>The Spaniard has had to abide by the new statute which dictates that
              eight ‘homegrown’ players must be part of the 25-man squad submitted
              for European competition.</p>
              <p>Hyypia was sacrificed by Benitez and the Reds boss could not hide
              his contempt for the new rule, calling it a “mistake” and questioning
              its validity.</p>
              <p>"Clearly I think it (the new Uefa rule) is a mistake," Benitez told Liverpool's official website.</p>
              <p>"When you play in the Champions League, you need the best players
              you have on the pitch. It is not about where you are from, it is about
              the best players.</p>
              <p>"I would understand if this rule came in for The Premier League, but not for the Champions League."</p>
              <p>Jamie Carragher, Daniel Agger and Martin Skrtel are Benitez’s centre
              back options for this season’s competition, and he says leaving
              34-year-old Hyypia out was a wrench given his vast experience.</p>
              <p>"It was a really difficult decision, but we had to do it. With the
              rule saying that you need more or less eight British - or local -
              players in the squads, we needed to decide which three centre backs to
              have for the Champions League," Benitez added.</p>
              <p>"We now have four centre backs who are good enough so they have to compete.</p>
              <p>"And obviously it depends on the number of games we play and how we
              progress in the cup competitions too, so there could be a lot of games
              for many of our players."</p>
