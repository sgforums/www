In 20 years' time, yes, I would love to come," said Mourinho, who is currently in America with Chelsea as they continue their pre-season preparations.<br><br>"Beckham is at the end of his career as a player and when I am at the end of my career as a coach I would love it.<br><br>"The country is amazing and I think it is a big challenge to help soccer to become more important in this country.<br><br>"But Beckham's the one to do it, the best one to do it.<br><br>"European football will miss him because he has more than enough quality to play the European game, but for the objectives of him to come here I think he is the perfect player.<br><br>"If the objective is to bring soccer up in the US then I think they couldn't choose a better player for that.<br><br>"I think what he means to the world of football is more than a football player."<br><br>Chelsea have travelled to America for the previous three pre-seasons and Mourinho believes he has already seen a positive change in attitude towards football in that time.<br><br>"The players in American teams have quality, tactical quality, and they have passion. I think a lot of kids love the game here," Mourinho concluded.</div>
