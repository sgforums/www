              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Tottenham have lodged an official complaint to
              the Premier League over the transfer window conduct of Manchester
              United and Liverpool.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Sir Alex Ferguson has confirmed United have made a bid for Dimitar Berbatov and eventually expects the deal to go through.</p>
              <p>Spurs have also been angered by the comments of Liverpool
              manager Rafael Benitez, who went public last week by revealing Republic
              of Ireland captain Robbie Keane as a target.</p>
              <p>Spurs chairman Daniel Levy has issued the following statement
              on his club's official website: "Today's public comments by Manchester
              United's manager, announcing that he has made an offer for Dimitar and
              is confident that the deal will go through with time working in their
              favour, is a blatant example of sheer arrogance and interference with
              one of our players.</p>
              <p>"It is also probably one of the worst offences by any manager
              in the Premier League to date and is unbelievably hypocritical given
              his recent comments in respect of Cristiano Ronaldo and Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>"This comes after a series of events, dating back to last
              summer, which have shown Manchester United to be in breach of Premier
              League rules.</p>
              <p>"As a result, we have today made an official complaint to the Premier League about the conduct of Manchester United.</p>
              <p>"Benitez made similar comments in respect of Robbie recently and
              we made an official complaint to the Premier League about the conduct
              of Liverpool earlier this week.</p>
              <p>"The behaviour of both clubs has been disgraceful. We told both
              clubs very early on that we had no interest in selling Robbie or
              Dimitar, respectively, and that they should refrain from pursuing the
              player.</p>
              <p>"Both clubs arrogantly chose to ignore this request and we now
              have evidence that both clubs have systematically been working to prise
              the players away from us, outside of Premier League rules of conduct.</p>
              <p>"Our subsequent position has been severely compromised by both
              clubs making their intentions widely known and indeed making contact
              with the players and their agents, without the club's permission.</p>
              <p>"I have absolutely no wish to sell either player and to date we have not accepted any offer for either.</p>
              <p>"However, when a player's head is turned and their commitment is
              absent, particularly when they occupy key positions such as that of
              striker, they become a negative influence in a team dressing room in
              which they were once a positive addition and influence.</p>
              <p>"This is the situation we now have on our hands, with both
              Dimitar and Robbie having made it clear that they wish to leave for
              Manchester Utd and Liverpool respectively.</p>
              <p>"Irrespective of the outcome and futures of Robbie and Dimitar,
              we are continuing to seek to bring in quality, talented players for the
              future, who want to play in a Spurs shirt."</p>
              <p>Benitez and Spurs have clashed before, in March 2006, when the
              Liverpool boss claimed Spurs were "desperate" to sell Jermain Defoe and
              take Djibril Cisse.</p>
              <p>It led to Benitez's professionalism being questioned by Spurs
              officials, and the latest fall-out is unlikely to help the relationship
              between the clubs.</p>
              <p>Aston Villa had already been upset this summer by Benitez's comments regarding Gareth Barry's potential move to Anfield.</p>
