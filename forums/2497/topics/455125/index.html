              Robin van Persie has revealed that he will not sign a new contract at Arsenal and expects to continue his football career away from Emirates Stadium.
              
              Van Persie, 28, whose current contract with the Gunners is due to expire in 12 months' time, met with the club's hierarchy over an extension before Euro 2012, with talks subsequently postponed until after the Dutchman returned from his summer holidays.
              
              The striker has had time to reflect on those talks - which he says did not centre on his own personal terms, but rather the direction the north London club is heading - and has now decided not to renew his contract, believing the club do not share his ambitions for the future.
              
              "As announced earlier this year I had a meeting with the boss [Arsene Wenger] and Mr [Ivan] Gazidis after the season," said Van Persie in a statement. "This was a meeting about the club's future strategy and their policy. Financial terms or a contract have not been discussed, since that is not my priority at all.
              
              "I personally have had a great season but my goal has been to win trophies with the team and to bring the club back to its glory days. Out of my huge respect for Mr Wenger, the players and the fans I don't want to go into any details, but unfortunately in this meeting it has again become clear to me that we in many aspects disagree on the way Arsenal should move forward.
              
              "I've thought long and hard about it, but I have decided not to extend my contract. You guys, the fans, have of course the right to disagree with my view and decision and I will always respect your opinions.
              
              "I love the club and the fans, no matter what happens. I have grown up and became a man during my time with Arsenal. Everybody at the club and the fans have always supported me over the years and I have always given my all (and more) on and off the pitch.
              
              "I am very proud of being part of this fantastic club for the last eight years. As soon as Mr Gazidis is back from his two-week holiday in America further meetings will follow and I will update you if and when there are more developments."
              
              Arsenal later issued a short statement on their official website which read: "We have to respect Robin's decision not to renew his contract. Robin has one year to run on his current contract and we are confident that he will fulfil his commitments to the club.
              
              "We are planning with ambition and confidence for next season with Arsenal's best interests in mind.''
              
              Van Persie was named the PFA footballer of the year for his performances last season, which saw him score 37 goals in all competitions for the club.
              
              The striker has been linked with Manchester City, Juventus, Real Madrid and Barcelona since his contract situation became an issue.
              
              Van Persie's exit would continue a worrying trend of Arsenal losing their best players - with Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri both leaving Arsenal last summer, after the club lost the likes of Emmanuel Adebayor and Kolo Toure 12 months prior.
              
              The Gunners have already boosted their attacking options this summer - signing Lukas Podolski and Olivier Giroud, in a bid to both improve the playing staff and convince Van Persie of the club's ambition. However, Wenger and Gazidis will now have to decide whether to allow Van Persie to leave for nothing next summer, or cash in on the Dutchman while they still can.

              <p>Kind of expected... He will end up at City as most of gunners stars do... lol.</p>

              <p>But i think Wenger also expected already otherwise why he signed so many new top strikers for, French league top scorer <span style="color: #000000;">Giroud </span>and Germany forward Lukas Podolski...</p>

              many arsenal fans are complaining and i dont understand why.
                  
                  arsenal has shown little or no interest in challenging for the title.  they just want to qualify for the CL.
                  
                  and they dont pay enough compare to the other top clubs.
                  
                  so how can they expect top players to stay?
              
              and i am sick of players saying they want to leave for CL football.  
              
              frankly, i dont for one second believe that.

              <p><span><strong>However, it is understood the Gunners board and management team are all very committed to the current direction, with a firm belief that the self-funding model will bring long-term success, both on and off the pitch.<br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The claims by RWS follow on from the announcement by Van Persie, in a carefully worded statement on his official website, that he would not be extending his current deal, which runs out next summer.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>The 28-year-old netted 37 goals in all competitions as Arsenal eventually secured third place, and manager Arsene Wenger recently declared the club must retain their talisman 'at all costs'.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>However, despite meeting with Wenger and chief executive Gazidis at the end of last season and the signings of Germany striker Lukas Podolski as well as France forward Olivier Giroud, Van Persie remains unconvinced he can fulfil his ambitions with the club he joined as a raw talent from Feyenoord in May 2004.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Van Persie will turn 29 in August, and the next contract he agrees could well be his last at the highest level.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Serie A winners Juventus, Paris St Germain and Barclays Premier League champions Manchester City are said to be ready to test Arsenal's resolve with a £20million-plus bid.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>However, the Gunners - who last summer saw both Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri leave - could also look to hold Van Persie to the terms of his deal.<br></span></p>

              <h3>ARSENAL want to report Manchester City for allegedly ‘tapping up’ star striker Robin van Persie.</h3>
              </div>
              <div id="column3">
              <div id="social-media" class="cf">The club are convinced that Van Persie’s agent Kees Vos has already been in touch with the Premier League champions.</div>
              <div class="cf">.</div>
              </div>
              <div class="clear-left">
              <div id="bodyText">
              <p>Manager Arsene Wenger and chief excutive Ivan Gazidis called Vos yesterday to express their fury at how RVP announced he would leave on Twitter.</p>
              <p>In more embarrassment for the shell-shocked Gunners, their second-largest shareholders launched a scathing attack on the club in an open letter.</p>
              <p>Usbek oil magnate Alisher Usmanov and Farhad Moshiri, who hold around 30 per cent of shares, blasted the club over losing Van Persie, just like they lost Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri last summer.</p>
              <p>They wrote: “This policy is leading to the loss of our best players, often to our main competitors and even causes the players themselves to question their future at the club and the club’s ambitions.</p>
              <p>“The situation with our captain and outstanding performer of last season, Robin van Persie, sums this up.”</p>
              <p>Most of the players return to training next Monday and Wenger and Gazidis (right) must now decide whether to lodge an official complaint over the alleged tapping up.</p>
              <p>No club has invoked the Prem’s Section K rule on illegal approaches since Chelsea were fined £300,000 for their part in Ashley Cole’s move from Arsenal in 2005. City are adamant they have done nothing wrong.</p>
              <p>SunSport told yesterday that the Gunners felt Van Persie was trying to plot a way out of the club.</p>
              <p>Arsenal insist they will hold the Dutch star to the last 12 months of his contract, although the reality is they will let him go for £30million.</p>
              <p>City will make an opening bid of only £15m for the 37-goal Footballer of the Year who can pocket £200,000-a-week wages at the Etihad.</p>
              <p>Usmanov and Moshiri, through their Red &amp; White Securities Limited, want to put Arsenal in a position where they can retain and sign top stars.</p>
              <p>They wrote: “It doesn’t help to turn a blind eye and keep thinking we are in the same league as Real Madrid, Chelsea, Man City and Barcelona.</p>
              <p>“To have a chance of success, which means winning trophies, we need to match them in every aspect.”</p>
              <p>Arsenal expect Van Persie to go on their Far East tour. He could even face City in a friendly in Beijing’s Olympic Stadium on July 27.</p>

              <div id="article-body-blocks">
              <p><strong>The <span style="color: #000000;">Arsenal</span> chairman, Peter Hill-Wood, has staunchly defended the running of the club against the vitriolic criticism levelled against the board by the 30% owner, the Uzbek billionaire Alisher Usmanov. Hill-Wood maintained that Arsenal's policy of spending only what they earn is correct, as is the stance that the American majority owner <span style="color: #000000;">Stan Kroenke</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span> and former shareholders such as Hill-Wood who made millions selling their shares to Kroenke, should not be expected to put money into the club. Hill-Wood described Usmanov's attack on this approach, which Arsenal call a self-financing model, as "not at all helpful".</strong></p>
              <p>The chairman, who made £5.5m selling his shares to Kroenke, said the club provides Arsène Wenger with as much money as possible for players, but cannot compete with Manchester City's Abu Dhabi-backed wealth. At the end of a week in which Arsenal's captain, Robin van Persie, announced he will not sign a new contract, citing a lack of ambition for success, Hill-Wood said: "We don't have the same oil wealth that [City's owner] Sheikh Mansour has. He is prepared to pay astronomical figures for players; we cannot pay that sort of money, and we can't compete."</p>
              <p>In his open letter to Arsenal's board on Thursday, Usmanov was scathing about the self-financing model, arguing it was, in effect, engineered by the former English shareholders, including Hill-Wood, to make personal fortunes. The owners' policy of not investing their own money in the club, Usmanov argued, meant Arsenal borrowed to build the Emirates Stadium (£260m), charge supporters very expensive ticket prices, yet still leave Wenger short of money to retain and sign star players.</p>
              <p>"The self-financing model … allowed the major shareholders of the time … to benefit from [an] increase in the value of their holdings," the letter said. "All of these shareholders and board directors sold 100% of their holdings and cashed out at vast profits."</p>
              <p>Alongside Hill-Wood pocketing £5.5m, the longstanding shareholder Richard Carr made more than £40m selling to Kroenke in 2009. Lady Nina Bracewell-Smith, who also inherited her Arsenal shares, made £116m selling them to Kroenke last year. Danny Fiszman, who bought into Arsenal in the 1990s, first with a portion of the former vice-chairman's David Dein's stake, made £160m, the final sale to Kroenke made just before Fiszman died last year.</p>
              <p>Hill-Wood said making so much money from selling his shares was "nice", explaining: "You wouldn't say no to a few million pounds." But he rejected as "complete and utter rubbish" the accusation that the club was run deliberately to increase the value of his and the other owners' shares, at the expense of supporters and a robust budget for Wenger.</p>
              <p>"It was nice to make that money, but I was never involved in Arsenal for that reason," Hill-Wood said. "I was involved because I have been brought up to love Arsenal and that is my only concern."</p>
              <p>Of Usmanov's intervention, the Arsenal chairman said: "I do not know what is trying to do really, I don't think he is right."</p>
              <p>Arsenal's summer has been disrupted by Van Persie's public announcement that he does not intend to renew his contract after, he said, being left unconvinced by the club's plans to compete for trophies. The departures of Gaël Clichy and Samir Nasri last summer to City, where they did win the Premier League, and of Cesc Fábregas, the previous captain-talisman, have left Arsenal looking like a selling club in the age of big-spending plutocrat owners. Usmanov argued that the owners should invest by paying off the stadium debt, which was still £98m and cost £15m in interest last year.</p>
              <p>However Hill-Wood argued, as does the chief executive, Ivan Gazidis, that the financial penalties due for early repayment make that unviable.</p>
              <p>"It's simple to say we should put some money in, but it doesn't make any sense," Hill-Wood said. "We can't pay off the debt without huge penalties, and putting money in for any other reason doesn't make any sense at all. We give the manager as much money as we possibly can, and all we can do is continue. We have run the club sensibly, and we haven't done badly; it's not as if we have been relegated."</p>
              <p>Usmanov, with whom Kroenke does not communicate, is also critical of the executive team, who brought in £33m commercial income last year, £70m less than Manchester United. He points to the board too, saying it would benefit from younger people with more football and major sports club experience. Gazidis, 47, is Arsenal's youngest director; Kroenke is 65 this month, Hill-Wood 76, Sir "Chips" Keswick 72, Lord Harris of Peckham 69 and the long-serving administrative stalwart Ken Friar is 78.</p>
              <p>Hill-Wood acknowledged: "It would be good to have some young people on the board, but it is not as easy for young people who have full-time jobs to do that now as it was when I was a young man. However I do not think there is anything different we can be doing in the running of Arsenal."</p>

              just admit the way arsenal is being run only benefits the shareholders.  of course in the long run (until all debts are cleared) it'll only be good for the club.
              
              but for the fans who buy merchandise and pay for tickets its rather frustrating the club are not winning any trophies.
              
              if arsenal fans are comfortable with it then they shouldnt kpkb when their top players leave for 'better' destinations.
