              <div id="slide-description">
              <p>Many in the footballing world have heard of the new proposed "6+5 rule."</p>
              <p>The
              6+5 rule means that at the beginning of a match, the starting lineup of
              both teams must consist of at least six players who can play for the
              national team of the club's country.</p>
              <p>However, out of
              the three subs allowed to be fielded, there is no limit to the number
              of foreign subs a team can field; and there is no limit to the number
              of players with contracts with the club.</p>
              <p>Starting in the
              2010-11 season, clubs must field at least four players who may
              represent the country of the club. The next season, they must field
              five players; and the following season it will be increased to a third
              and final time to six, meaning at the start of the 2012-2013 season,
              the full 6+5 rule will be implemented.</p>
              <p>The purpose of
              this rule is to protect the national identity of the clubs, level the
              playing field a bit, and to lower the spending on high cost
              internationals (like Real Madrid and Manchester City have been doing).</p>
              <p>Now whether you agree on the rule or not  won't matter, because odds are the plan will probably be carried out.</p>
              <p>But what would happen to the big name clubs if the full rule were implemented immediately?</p>
              <p>Would any of the teams have to switch there lineups around? And would their results differ from their previous form?</p>
              <p>For this article I will assume that all players are healthy to reduce complications. Let's check it out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 id="slide-title">Manchester United</h2>
              <div id="slide-description">
              <p>Assuming that all players are healthy,
              Manchester United shouldn't have much of a problem dealing with this
              rule, especially since Sir Alex Ferguson is a supporter of the rule.</p>
              <p>Between the sticks we can see Dutch international Edwin Van der Sar in his last season for the Red Devils.</p>
              <p>The
              center of the back line will be headed by the rock solid pair of
              Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand. At right back we see Wes Brown and at
              the left we see the familiar Patrice Evra.</p>
              <p>In the
              defensive midfielder slot is Owen Hargreaves while Michael Carrick can
              play right in front of Hargreaves. The wings are manned by Nani and
              Antonio Valencia, while the strike duo of Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney
              can play up front.</p>
              <p>The subs are up to Sir Alex but I
              will point out that one foreign sub for each outfield position is
              allowed, meaning players like Berbatov, Fabio or Rafael, and Anderson
              can be introduced.</p>
              <p>Since the lineup doesn't really
              change from their current one bar the introduction of Owen Hargreaves,
              their match results probably won't change either, nor will their form.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 id="slide-title">Chelsea</h2>
              <div id="slide-description">
              <p>Chelsea, unlike Manchester United, may
              have some problems. It is true that the Blues have seven Englishmen on
              the team, but three of those players are too inexperienced to field
              leaving them with only the four (Lampard, Terry, and Ashley and Joe
              Cole), in need of two.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's results will probably differ because of the absence of two foreigners and introduction of two Englishmen.</p>
              <p>Depending
              on which two foreigners are taken out of the lineup will probably
              determine if their results stay the same, get better, or worse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 id="slide-title">Arsenal</h2>
              <div id="slide-description">
              <p>Arsenal have the same problem as their London rivals Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Arsenal
              have only four Englishmen (Manuel Almunia, Theo Walcott, Kieran Gibbs,
              and Jack Wilshire) in their first team squad, and two of the four (Jack
              Wilshire and Kieran Gibbs) are inexperienced and hard to count on.</p>
              <p>With
              only four players in the first team squad eligible for the English
              national team, it looks like if the 6+5 rule were adopted now, then the
              Gunners would probably have to buy more Englishmen or dip into their
              reserve squad.</p>
              <p>Their results would probably fare the
              same as Chelsea meaning the results would depend on who was taken out
              of the starting lineup, although their form probably wouldn't change if
              they managed to keep in crucial players such as Fabregas and Arshavin.</p>
              <h2 id="slide-title"><br></h2>
              <h2>Liverpool</h2>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div id="slide-description">
              <p>With eight Englishmen on the team, one would think that Liverpool shouldn't have a problem with with the 6+5 rule.</p>
              <p>However,
              only three (Gerrard, Carragher, and Glen Johnson, all of which have
              plenty of experience) of those eight have experience. The others are
              young and have barely played any matches at all.</p>
              <p>It is
              true that youth can win titles, as certain managers have shown in the
              past, but more experience is required when up against the big teams
              such as Manchester United, Arsenal, or Barcelona.</p>
              <p>Two
              of the youngsters, Jay Spearing and Martin Kelly, look to be competent
              enough to play against strong teams. Spearing has made appearances
              against PSV Eindhoven and Real Madrid; while Rafa Benitez has said that
              the departure of Hyppia may open the door for Kelly.</p>
              <p>Once
              again, results will differ according to which players are taken out and
              which are put in, although Liverpool may have to take out some decisive
              players which could lead to poor results.</p>

              <h2 id="slide-title">Real Madrid</h2>
              <div id="slide-description">
              <p>By now everyone should know about Real Madrid's spending spree on foreign stars.</p>
              <p>But
              suprisingly, they shouldn't have much of a problem with this rule, even
              if they wanted to fit in their stars in the starting XI.</p>
              <p>They
              can actually fit in some extra Spaniards in the lineup and still have
              space to fit in stars Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka, and Karim Benzema. The
              fact that they signed three Spaniards (Raul Albiol, Xabi Alonso, and
              Esteban Granero) in their summer spending spree helps very much.</p>
              <p>Considering
              that they don't have to change anything around in their lineup, then
              their current form should continue the way it's been going.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 id="slide-title">Barcelona</h2>
              <div id="slide-description">
              <p>Everyone knows that European champions Barcelona shouldn't have a problem with this.</p>
              <p>They
              have nine Spanish players on their team; meaning, like Real Madrid,
              they'll have Spaniards left over that they can still use even if one of
              their other home grown players is injured.</p>
              <p>With the
              team they have, they can even boast an entirely international front
              like, headed by Ibrahimovic, Messi, and Thierry Henry.</p>
              <p>And their current form will probably continue since they don't have to change their lineup around one bit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div id="controls-title" class="span-14"><a id="control-next" class="control control-next" href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/239002-what-would-happen-to-big-clubs-if-the-65-rule-was-implemented-now/page/3"></a>
              <h2 id="slide-title">Inter Milan</h2>
              <div id="slide-description">
              <p>If the 6+5 rule were enforced now, Inter would have a problem.</p>
              <p>It's
              true that they have six Italians on the team, but two of those players
              are goalkeepers and two others are inexperienced, meaning if Inter went
              up against another strong team in something like the Champions League,
              then the youngsters probably wouldn't be the best choice.</p>
              <p>This
              means that their match results may not be as great as they have been,
              since instrumental midfielders and top strikers would have to be taken
              out to make room for more Italians.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 id="slide-title">AC Milan</h2>
              </div>
              <div id="slide-description">
              <p>Of all the teams in this article, AC
              Milan is the least likely to suffer as a result of this rule, so I
              won't spend much time on them.</p>
              <p>Milan have many Italian
              defenders so they can opt for an entirely Italian defense and goalie,
              with foreigners in midfield and offense; or they can distribute their
              players evenly throughout.</p>
              <p>They're current form would probably continue as they don't have to do anything at all to their team.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div id="controls-title" class="span-14"><a id="control-next" class="control control-next" href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/239002-what-would-happen-to-big-clubs-if-the-65-rule-was-implemented-now/page/3"></a>

              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div id="slide-description">
              <p>Juventus, their Italian rivals AC Milan, won't have a problem with this rule at all, since they have many Italians on the team.</p>
              <p>The easiest way for Juve to go would be Buffon as goalie, two Italian defenders, one midfielder, and two strikers.</p>
              <p>This team's form would probably continue as it's been since they also don't have to change their lineup around.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 id="slide-title">Conclusions</h2>
              <div id="slide-description">
              <p>Now this article only summarizes what probably would happen to big clubs if the rule were instituted currently.</p>
              <p>However,
              the full 6+5 rule will be implemented at the beginning of the 2012-2013
              season, meaning clubs would be given time to add players that fulfill
              the requirements of the rule.</p>
              <p>I don't know what will
              happen in the future. Odds are, clubs having trouble will probably buy
              more players so that their team may play according to this rule.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>But
              do keep an eye on the teams having trouble right now and the teams
              spending much on foreign players; they may be the teams who have
              trouble later on when the rule is instated.</p>
