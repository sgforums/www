              <p>The Kop boss said: "Dirk's got a good record against Everton and will certainly be in the squad. Obviously he enjoys the game and they don't enjoy playing against him."</p>
              <p>Steven Gerrard is also hoping for his first start in six months after groin surgery, but is set to be on the bench again, as Dalglish concentrates on his skipper's long-term fitness.</p>
              <p>Gerrard admitted: "I haven't been out for two or three weeks with a hamstring. I've had a reconstruction of my groin and it is going to take time.</p>
              <p>"To be fair to Kenny and the medical staff, they have handled me perfectly so far."</p>

              <p>When Dalglish was asked during the post match interview, if it was a sending off offence, he said he didn't see, how convenient... lol.</p>
              <p>For me, I was shock when the referee took out his red card as I thought it wasn't even worthy of a yellow card offence honestly... Suarez play acted in that moment.</p>
              <p>That one bad decision alone changed everything and gave a huge advantage to Liverpool who was on the receiving end of an Everton good showing...</p>
              <p>Looks like Kenny's complaint to the referee boss has help cos against Wolves last week they also got lucky decisions too when their first goal should have been a foul by Carroll on the Wolves defender before Adam scored...</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">
              </span></p><p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>As the final whistle was blown and the teams prepared to leave the pitch, the roar went up and in unison the ground acclaimed their heroes.</span></strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/everton.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Everton</span></a>, Everton, Everton,' they sung, for it was that kind of the day. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The statistics will record that Everton lost 2-0 at home to their neighbours <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool</span></a> but that barely tells the story of the match. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>There was anger and frustration aplenty at Goodison Park but clearly a degree of pride about how their team had competed against richer rivals from across the park.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'Look, the team did everything,' said Everton manager David Moyes, exasperated. 'It was a hard, tough game for us today and it became tougher but the players kept at it. I just thought it ruined the game.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>He was referring, of course, to the 23rd-minute dismissal of Jack Rodwell. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The fact the game remained competitive for another hour after that was only because of the shift his players put in.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>For Rodwell was hard done-by.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>His sliding tackle was undoubtedly strong, but he never appeared to lose control or come off the ground as he slid in on Luis Suarez. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The fact that he won the ball is, these days, irrelevant, for if the referee deems that excessive force is used, a red card must be shown.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>However, it was bewildering to see how Martin Atkinson had come to that conclusion. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The red card was immediately produced. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I'd have been disappointed if it had been a free-kick,' said Moyes, echoing the views of most. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>It was a great shame because a feisty derby had been developing.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Goodison was at its most ferocious, in a positive way. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Not so later, when missiles were thrown at Liverpool. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But the initial stages of the game justified the crowd intensity.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>In a thrilling 60-second sequence, starting in the eighth minute, Dirk Kuyt managed to out-wit Phil Jagielka and hook the ball in to Luis Suarez, who should have scored with a header. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But Everton broke back, with Seamus Coleman crossing for Tim Cahill, whose header was superbly tipped over by Pepe Reina. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Sylvain Distin and Louis Saha then both went close for Everton before the turning point arrived.</span></p>

              <p><br>Traditional centre forward as you call it has its plus and minus and I won't go as far as to call them uniquely English...</p>
              <p>Over the years there are many who came out from Europe like currently <span style="color: #000000;">Mario Gomez</span><span style="color: #000000;">, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Johan Elmander,</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #000000;">etc... just to name a few notable ones... Even those mentioned like Drogba and Demba Ba... Their main strength is their physique and height then follow by technique... They used these to their advantage first and very successful too...</span></p>
              <p>Why i even include <span style="color: #000000;">Peter Crouch is because he is in that cluster with many coach/managers when wanting a 'big/small' combo will think of him... Those in the likes are probably Nwankwo Kanu, Kennet Andersson... Even Ruud Van Nistelrooy can be included in those class as he is a big guy who uses his strength and height to his advantage but does very little from the midfield downwards...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Then there are those 'little guys' like Rooney, Bellamy, Lucas Podolski, Tevez etc... All lack of a good height but with good physical strength... So they make up for a lack of height with good aggressive play and technique...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The most important thing i feel is, if a player is bless with these attributes, why not utilise them to their full potential? Be it in height, physique or technique... I am sure there is a demand and need of a different style in present day or in the future...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Both style has its good, I think it's how one uses it to its full potential that matters... Sure you want to compare it to Barcelona, but how many Barcelonas are there? I am not even sure if they can continue this style when their current group of players time is over... Mainly Messi, Xiva and <span style="color: #000000;">Iniesta. Already currently Iniesta is out and they are showing they are not as good as last season... Iniesta is 27, Xiva 31 coming to 32... Give them another 3 yrs i say cos Messi alone won't be enough.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Then we look at Arsenal, they are probably one of the best passing team in the last few years apart from Barce but when came up against the Bolton, the Stoke or the Blackbures type, we have seen what happened...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">So i still belief both style has its place and usefulness... It's to fully utilise it that matters... Even Singapore have that Durich or something guy... and we have witness how many games he has help Singapore win... Those small Malaysians players no fight... cos how to mark a giant... lol. </span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>haha ok tks for the inputs. I've been watching liverpool games and carroll has always been missing until he scores a goal; and this being his second goal of the season. He would often wait for the ball with his physique but then again, his positioning is not always there. I think the 50m pounds paid for him is at least 5 times overrated. The target man these days is not always effective......link up play is a must.</p></div>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">EVERTON last night slapped in an appeal to the FA over the refereeing clanger which saw Jack Rodwell sent off.</h2>
              <p>The midfielder was dismissed after 23 minutes against Liverpool, in a match the Toffees went on to lose 2-0.</p>
              <p>Referee Martin Atkinson showed the 20-year-old a straight red after a challenge on Luis Suarez, but television replays appeared to show Rodwell won the ball and made minimal contact with the Uruguayan.</p>
              <p>Suarez went down heavily following contact with Rodwell, but the striker's reaction was criticised for being excessive in some quarters.</p>
              <p>Everton, having reviewed the incident, now feel they have a chance of getting the decision reversed and will submit written documentation to the FA.</p>
              <p>Even a booking would have been harsh and TV replays proved Atkinson got it hopelessly wrong.</p>
              <p>Goodison chief executive Robert Elstone said: "We believe the decision to be wrong and will be contacting the FA requesting that the red card is rescinded."</p>
              <p>Everton boss David Moyes had originally questioned Atkinson's decision in his post-match comments, suggesting that far from being a red card offence, it was not even a foul.</p>
              <p>"I would have been disappointed if it had been a free-kick and if he had given a yellow card you would have said 'what is that for?'."</p>
              <p>"I'd expect the people in power to stand up and say 'We got it wrong'.</p>
              <p>"Good people admit their mistakes. I've had apologies from refs in the past.</p>
              <p>"You don't get these things overturned. The FA very much keep together with the Professional Game Match Officials. I didn't think it was even a free-kick.</p>
              <p>"Because of the decision the ref actually ruined the game."</p>
              <p>FA chiefs are waiting to receive ref Atkinson's report today before deciding whether to take action over missile-throwing incidents during Liverpool's 2-0 win.</p>
              <p>A coin appeared to be tossed at Suarez and more than one bottle was launched at his Kop team-mate Craig Bellamy while the strikers took second-half corners.</p>

              <p>I agreed that carroll is not showing any promise at the moment and Ah Ken is providing him a lot of chances to get used to the Liverpool team.</p>
              <p>The pressure will alway be on him whether he make it or not.</p>
              <p>He is getting more involved for past few matches and move around the field more often.</p>
              <p>But, Ah Ken have to select a faster mid field instead of fielding only UK players.</p>
              <p>Liverpool struggle to impose themselves before the substitution and playing against 10 men.</p>
              <p>They have lots of catching up to do as compared to Spurs.</p>

Keeps that ponytail, talks about dating some celebrity (forgot who) after he scored a couple of goals, drinks heavily until Terry had to advise him....and did he beat up his gf? lol.

              <p><strong>The 20-year-old was sent off by referee Martin Atkinson in the 23rd minute for a challenge on Luis Suarez which appeared neither dangerous nor reckless.</strong></p>
              <p>Everton lodged a claim for wrongful dismissal with the Football Association and the governing body's appeals panel have upheld that claim.</p>
              <p>It means Rodwell's three-match suspension, which would have been imposed for an offence of serious foul play, has been withdrawn.</p>
              <p>A statement from the Football Association said: "Everton's Jack Rodwell has had his claim for wrongful dismissal upheld.</p>
              <p>"As a result, the three-match suspension handed to him has been withdrawn.</p>
              <p>"Rodwell had originally received a red card for serious foul play in the Merseyside derby against Liverpool at Goodison Park on Saturday October 1."</p>
              <p>Immediately after the match, which Everton lost 2-0, Toffees boss David Moyes expressed his amazement at Atkinson's decision.</p>
              <p>"I thought it ruined the game. That wasn't down to a bad tackle," said the Scot.</p>
              <p>"I would have been disappointed if it had been a free-kick. I don't think anyone in this world thought it was [a sending off]."</p>
              <p>Everton's chief executive Robert Elstone welcomed the overturning of Rodwell's red card but said it meant little in the wake of a defeat.</p>
              <p>"Whilst we welcome the correct decision the FA panel has reached, it's of course an outcome which will provide little consolation whatsoever to the 37,000 Evertonians packed into Goodison on Saturday to watch the 2-0 defeat," he told evertonfc.com.</p>
              <p>"The Merseyside derby is a special occasion and many of our fans will have made financial sacrifices to make sure they were there to support the team.</p>
              <p>"From the press, radio and television reports that surfaced in the aftermath of Saturday's events, they were almost unanimous in their verdict and we are pleased with the news that quite rightly the red card has been rescinded."</p>
              <p>Everton chairman Bill Kenwright added: "One of the biggest tragedies was for Jack himself.</p>
              <p>"He has had a terrific season and was by far and away the most influential midfielder on the pitch up to that point.</p>
              <p>"To deny him the opportunity to continue on such an important occasion must have been incredibly difficult for Jack - as it was for his team-mates, manager and, of course, the fans."</p>

              <p>Everton's chief executive Robert Elstone welcomed the
              overturning of Rodwell's red card but said it meant little in the
              wake of a defeat.</p>
              <p>"Whilst we welcome the correct decision the FA panel has
              reached, it's of course an outcome which will provide little
              consolation whatsoever to the 37,000 Evertonians packed into
              Goodison on Saturday to watch the 2-0 defeat," he told
              evertonfc.com.</p>
              <p>"The Merseyside derby is a special occasion and many of our fans
              will have made financial sacrifices to make sure they were there to
              support the team.</p>
              <p>"From the press, radio and television reports that surfaced in
              the aftermath of Saturday's events, they were almost unanimous in
              their verdict and we are pleased with the news that quite rightly
              the red card has been rescinded."</p>
              <p>Everton chairman Bill Kenwright added: "One of the biggest
              tragedies was for Jack himself.</p>
              <p>"He has had a terrific season and was by far and away the most
              influential midfielder on the pitch up to that point.</p>
              <p>"To deny him the opportunity to continue on such an important
              occasion must have been incredibly difficult for Jack - as it was
              for his team-mates, manager and, of course, the fans."</p>
