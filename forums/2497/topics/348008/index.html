              <h1>Bed card for Frank Lampard</h1>
              <h2>Fiancee Elen just couldn't live with star any more</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00027/frank_27389a.jpg" alt="SPLIT: Frank with Elen and daughter Luna" width="516" height="300"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>ENGLAND ace Frank Lampard has been DUMPED by his Spanish fiancée. </h3>
              <p>Stunning Elen Rives is moving out of their London home with their two children. A pal said: “The passion has gone.” Elen gave the England ace the boot after a heartbreak holiday away from him in Florida, we can reveal. When she returned the Chelsea star pleaded with his fiancee to stay with him for the sake of their little daughters . . . but Elen, 30, insisted there was no way back. </p>
              <p>Now Lampard has bought her a house ten minutes from their £3 million family home so he can stay close to Luna, two, and one-year-old Isla. His spokesman told us last night: “No one else is involved.” But the wayward midfielder, also 30, has twice been caught cheating on Elen since they got together in 2001. And a pal close to the couple said: “It’s the saddest thing Elen’s ever had to do, but the love has gone. </p>
              <p>“She was the one who ended it and she’s the one who’s moving out. “Frank will continue to play a very active role in his children’s lives and see them every day. But he and Elen have grown apart. The passion has gone out of the relationship. </p>
              <p>“There have been no huge rows—though obviously there were massive problems when he was splashed over the papers with other women.” The split comes 19 months after the News of the World caught the midfielder picking up a mystery brunette at a Las Vegas casino. And just nine months before that he bedded blonde driver Montserrat Lucas, 36, behind the back of sultry beauty Elen.</p>

              <div class="caption"><em>CHEAT: He bedded Montse in Barcelona and showed her pictures of his family</em></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our source said: “Elen’s a sensitive, bright and proud woman who hated the humiliation of Frank’s betrayal but was prepared to give it another go. </p>
              <p>“However, in recent months they have drifted apart.” Ex-model Elen finally made up her mind during a sunshine break in Florida last month with the children, a friend and nanny. </p>
              <p>While she bronzed herself on the beach, Lampard—whose form has nosedived—was enduring a humiliating 3-0 Chelsea defeat at the feet of arch-rivals Manchester United. </p>
              <p>Lampard was last seen out with his family in December at the Winter Wonderland attraction in London’s Hyde Park. In January, he and Elen enjoyed a last public meal at Knightsbridge restaurant Zuma as the Chelsea team bade farewell to Manchester City-bound defender Wayne Bridge, 28. </p>
              <p>That night, Elen went on with him to the swanky Whisky Mist nightclub on Park Lane but left early while Lampard and his pals lived it up in the VIP area. The source went on: “Even then things between them weren’t looking great. “Elen left without Frank. Then he and the guys spent a fortune on drinks and were obvious targets for a lot of single women. </p>
              <p>“Frank was getting attention but seemed perfectly well-behaved. With his track record, though, Elen must always have a nagging doubt.” That track record kicked off in December 2006 when Lampard—who had previously been caught on film while single in 2000 enjoying an orgy at a Cyprus hotel—bedded driver Montserrat ‘Montse’ Lucas in Elen’s home city Barcelona. </p>

              <p>Montse said: “One minute he was showing me photos of his family, the next we were in bed. “The pictures were of his baby girl Luna and her mother Elen. I loved the fact that he was so proud of his daughter—it’s something any woman finds very sweet. “But he seemed quite drunk, and I couldn’t tell if it was lust for me or he’d been drinking a lot.” </p>
              <p>In July 2007, just two months after Isla’s birth, the News of the World caught Lampard in a tryst with a dark-haired East European beauty in her thirties. He picked her up at the blackjack table of the five-star Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas.</p>
              <p><strong>Sobs </strong></p>
              <p>After the couple spent more than two hours alone in a suite together, grinning Lampard emerged with his arm around her at about 2am. </p>
              <p>As they strolled back to the gaming tables Lampard looked about, then tenderly stroked the girl’s shoulder before kissing her goodnight on the cheek and heading off to find his pals. </p>
              <p>But just minutes later the beauty’s smiles turned to sobs when the News of the World told her the truth about her dashing date. With tears streaming down her face, she said: “He didn’t tell me he had a girlfriend and two daughters. This is terrible.” </p>
              <p>Elen reacted to the revelations by giving back the engagement ring Lampard gave her in June, 2004. </p>
              <p> </p>

              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But, again, she forgave him and they patched things up. </p>
              <p>The agony of their split could hardly contrast more with the elation the soccer star felt about finding love with Elen in April 2002. </p>
              <p>Describing how he first laid eyes on “intelligent, funny, intuitive” divorcee Elen—his first proper girlfriend—Lampard said: “Elen stopped me in my tracks. We met in a nightclub through mutual friends. </p>
              <p>“A seething, noisy throng is not the ideal start to a relationship, yet the moment I saw her I was smitten.” Their relationship started shortly after Lampard’s £11 million transfer from West Ham United to Chelsea, and he credits it with making him a man. </p>
              <p>In his book, Totally Frank, he said: “I knew Elen was right for me—my heart was shouting it out.” Last year the star suffered personal heartache with the sudden death of his mother Pat last April. </p>
              <p>Our source said: “Frank may well have moved on but Pat’s death left him needing his family more than ever. “There are a lot of factors behind the break-up. It’s enormously sad. Elen will move out very soon. Obviously Frank will make sure the kids don’t want for anything. It is all very amicable.” </p>
              <p>The couple also have a £4million detached home in Esher, Surrey, as well as the London townhouse. “They are not married—so there is no messy divorce to go through,” said the source. “This is as straightforward a break-up as you can get.” </p>
              <p>A spokesman for Lampard confirmed the split to the News of the World. He said: “Frank and Elen have separated. No one else is involved—they have simply grown apart. This is private matter and they won’t be making any further comment.”</p>
