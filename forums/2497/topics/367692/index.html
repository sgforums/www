              <p class="small bold"> </p>
              <h1>Sir Alex Ferguson - Denis Law</h1>
              <p class="article">ALEX FERGUSON said: "Denis was my hero. I idolised him. When I first met him I 
              was so excited. It was at a game in Paris, he had played in the first half 
              and we went for a cup of tea afterwards. I thought, 'This is it, I've made 
              it!'</p>
              <p class="article">"He epitomised everything a Scotsman is about. He was daring and courageous, 
              he had that bravado about him and he had style. He was a truly fantastic 
              footballer."</p>
              <h1><strong>Jonny Evans - Roy Keane</strong></h1>
              <p class="article">DEFENDER Jonny Evans said: "I reckon 80 per cent of young players who 
              supported Manchester United when they were growing up would tell you that 
              Roy Keane was their hero - just because of the way he was and the character 
              he is.</p>
              <p class="article">"Keano was an awesome player - and an incredible leader."</p>
              <h1><strong>Gary Neville - Bryan Robson</strong></h1>
              <p class="article">CLUB skipper Gary Neville explained: "I always thought Bryan Robson was 
              everything that a United player should be - and I still do.</p>
              <p class="article">"Even when I watch footage of him in action now, I always think of him giving 
              everything for the cause. Blood, guts and thunder - with real class as well."</p>
              <h1><strong>John O'Shea - Paul McGrath</strong></h1>
              <p class="article">MIDFIELDER John O'Shea said: "Paul McGrath was a big favourite.</p>
              <p class="article">"He was as comfortable playing in midfield as he was at centre-back. It wasn't 
              a problem to him. He was the versatile type.</p>
              <p class="article">"And not only did he have great ability he was also very calm on the ball. He 
              was a special player."</p>
              <h1><strong>Ben Foster - Peter Schmeichel</strong></h1>
              <p class="article">KEEPER Ben Foster said: "Peter Schmeichel was a cut above the rest in his era 
              and changed the face of goalkeeping.</p>
              <p class="article">"I still try to model myself on him and use aspects of his game in mine.</p>
              <p class="article">"He produced some truly unbelievable saves. I still watch them on YouTube."</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <h1><strong>Anderson - Rivaldo</strong></h1>
              <p class="article">MIDFIELDER Anderson goes for fellow Brazil playmaker Rivaldo.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "His passing and his aggressive way of playing was great.</p>
              <p class="article">"I'm definitely a big admirer of his technique."</p>
              <h1><strong>Rio Ferdinand, Ryan Giggs, Wayne Rooney - Maradona</strong></h1>
              <p class="article">DEFENDER Rio Ferdinand said: "My inspiration to play football was probably 
              Diego Maradona.</p>
              <p class="article">"He's the first memory I have of someone doing something really great. I had 
              all his videos and loved watching him."</p>
              <p class="article">Midfielder Ryan Giggs added: "I always used to look out for left-footers and 
              John Barnes and Maradona were always the ones that I looked up to when I was 
              a kid.</p>
              <p class="article">"I remember Maradona in the 1986 World Cup. He was such a great player. That 
              goal he scored against England - not the Hand of God goal - was absolutely 
              amazing."</p>
              <p class="article">Hitman Carlos Tevez added: "Maradona is the greatest player of all time. 
              Diego, for all Argentinians, is God. And he always will be.</p>
              <p class="article">"I have a great relationship with Diego.</p>
              <p class="article">"My family also has a great relationship with his family and I have a really, 
              genuinely warm bond with him."</p>
              <p class="article">And fellow striker Wayne Rooney said: "My favourite player is Maradona.</p>
              <p class="article">"I've watched lots of videos of him in action and I just love the way he 
              played.</p>
              <p class="article">"In my eyes, he's the best player of all time."</p>
              <h1><strong>Dimitar Berbatov - Ivan Berbatov, Marco van Basten and Alan Shearer</strong></h1>

              Basten and Alan Shearer.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "My father Ivan taught me so I've lots to thank him for. When you 
              hear the other names you don't need to be told why they were great."</p>
              <h1><strong>Michael Carrick - Peter Beardsley, Gazza and Ian Wright</strong></h1>
              <p class="article">MIDFIELDER Michael Carrick selects Peter Beardsley, Gazza and Ian Wright.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "I loved the way Beardo played the game. Gascoigne was an absolute 
              genius.</p>
              <p class="article">"Wright I enjoyed watching more for his goal celebrations."</p>
