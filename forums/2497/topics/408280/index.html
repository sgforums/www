              <p>Craig Bellamy is threatening to sign for Championship club Cardiff in a bid to end his Manchester City misery.</p>
              <p>City gave the striker permission to train with Cardiff, who are hoping to agree a six-month loan, although Everton and Fulham still believe they can persuade Bellamy to stay in the top flight.</p>
              <p>The
               fiery Welshman has been told to stay away from City's training ground 
              and has struck a deal to stay fit with Dave Jones's team. Cardiff, 
              however, believe Bellamy could agree to aid their promotion bid.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Liverpool have also asked about their former forward, but were told 
              by City they will not consider loaning him to one of their rivals. A 
              move to Tottenham has been rejected on the same grounds.</p>
              <p>'He's really thinking of joining Cardiff,' one Premier League club 
              official told <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span>.</p>
              <p>'This is crazy. He has so much to offer the Premier League. What is 
              he trying to prove? Let's hope he comes to his senses.'</p>
              <p>Bellamy has been axed by City following a series of rows with boss 
              Roberto Mancini - culminating in the striker's claim last week that the 
              Italian hasn't spoken to him 'for months'.</p>
              <p>He has been a Cardiff fan since he was a boy and the prospect of 
              playing for them appeals to him.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>End of the road: Craig Bellamy appears to have played his last game for Manchester City</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Bellamy has given Cardiff encouragement that he will stay, but will 
              delay his final decision.</p>
              <p>And Fulham manager Mark Hughes feels he can convince Bellamy not to 
              drop out of the Premier League, where the forward has become 
              disillusioned and talked of quitting the game.</p>
              <p>The 31-year-old will enjoy a warm welcome in South Wales, where many 
              of his family still live. And any loan deal would guarantee Dave Jones's
              team huge crowds as they push for promotion.</p>
              <p>Celtic manager Neil Lennon has also expressed an interest in luring 
              Bellamy back to Glasgow for a second loan spell.</p>
