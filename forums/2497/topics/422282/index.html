              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">PEPE REINA last night sensationally opened the door to a £20million summer move to Manchester United.</h2>
              <p>Liverpool keeper Reina stunned the Kop by refusing to rule out a move to Old Trafford in the close season.</p>
              <p>With Edwin van der Sar hanging up his gloves, speculation has been rife that United boss Alex Ferguson will try to snatch the stopper by paying the £20m get-out clause in his contract.</p>
              <p>Asked directly about United's interest on Spanish radio station Onda Cero, Reina dropped a massive hint that it could happen.</p>
              <p>He said: "Yes, well Van der Sar will hang up his gloves in the summer so of course they are looking.</p>
              <p>"I can't do anything. I can't say anything logically as I have a contract with Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"Of course one likes to fight for titles and be in a team that does that.</p>
              <p>"We always fought to be in the Champions League and try to win the title.</p>
              <p>"But unfortunately it hasn't been the case in the last couple of years."</p>
              <p>Reina also refused to rule out quitting Anfield if Liverpool finish outside the top four.</p>
              <p>He said: "I won't lie, I want to play in the Champions League and challenge for titles."</p>

              <p><br>Well... Let's just say I had the same reaction from Pool fans with the Torres news too...</p>
              <p>They (The Sun) were the first ones who broke the Torres news... And before it happen, some Pool fans were reacting the same way as you right now... Impossible, Torres wouldn't join Chelsea or Pool wouldn't sell to a fellow rival kind of stuff... I even mentioned Torres was going to hand in a transfer request and a Pool fan said there was no truth and all lies questioning the report... Until the unbelievable became a reality...</p>
              <p>This one is probably harder to deny cos the guy went on radio...</p>

              <p>Be it top keepers, good keepers, the problem they all usually have is settling into the premier league. The guy may be very good in Europe but once he come to the premier league, it may be a different ball game altogether... Non more famous than Fabien Barthez... Great performance at the WC and Euro...  But came to the PL...  Not bad but not great also...</p>
              <p>Then there was others like Tim Howard, Given, Gomes and even Reina himself...  had problems at the start but after 2, 3 seasons, they finally come good. So to get a premier league experienced keeper isn't all that bad... Cos a new keeper from outside may take 2, 3 seasons before they come good... Even United's very own Great Dane took some time before he came good...</p>

              <p>Are you for real? <br>Actually, he was interviewed by spanish media together with David Villa...the interview was more focus on spanish team but it drifted into Torres. David Villa mentioned that Torres has wanted to move to Chelsea for some time but added that Liverpool has signed 2 great young players in Andy Carroll and Suarez (clever guy to be honest, did not offend either his friend or Liverpool).</p>
              <p>And the topic drifted into Van Der Sar's retirement.</p>
              <p>He said <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">"Yes, well Van der Sar will hang up his gloves in the summer so of course they are looking," Reina told Spanish radio station Ondo Sera. "I can't do anything. I can't say anything logically as I have a contract with Liverpool. <br><br>"Of course one likes to fight for titles and be in a team that does that. We always fought to be in the Champions League and try to win the title. But unfortunately it hasn't been the case in the last couple of years."</span> </strong></p>
              <p>The media took his word and twisted it a little bit and came out with Reina wants to join ManU!!! Well, anything is possible though after Torres move...But I don't think Liverpool will sell him to ManU...remember Heinze??</p>

              <p>I don't think it matters how good you were or are outside United, but when in the team you have to live up to those expectations... Barthez was a WC winner, and one of France's star player in that tournament... They don't come any bigger than this I think.</p>

              <p>I don't think it matters how good you were or are outside
              United, but when in the team you have to live up to those
              expectations... Barthez was a WC winner, and one of France's star
              player in that tournament... They don't come any bigger than
              this I think.</p>

              <p>Are you for real?<br>Actually, he was interviewed by spanish media together with David Villa...the interview was more focus on spanish team but it drifted into Torres. David Villa mentioned that Torres has wanted to move to Chelsea for some time but added that Liverpool has signed 2 great young players in Andy Carroll and Suarez (clever guy to be honest, did not offend either his friend or Liverpool).</p>
              <p>And the topic drifted into Van Der Sar's retirement.</p>
              <p>He said <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">"Yes, well Van der Sar will hang up his gloves in the summer so of course they are looking," Reina told Spanish radio station Ondo Sera. "I can't do anything. I can't say anything logically as I have a contract with Liverpool.<br><br>"Of course one likes to fight for titles and be in a team that does that. We always fought to be in the Champions League and try to win the title. But unfortunately it hasn't been the case in the last couple of years."</span></strong></p>
              <p>The media took his word and twisted it a little bit and came out with Reina wants to join ManU!!! Well, anything is possible though after Torres move...But I don't think Liverpool will sell him to ManU...remember Heinze??</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>I don't think they said Reina wants to join Man United, they just said he "opened the door" to that option or leaving Liverpool for CL football for that matter cos they asked him a simple question about Vds retiring and would he be interested in the position should United came in for him... And he never deny it... Actually if we read his reply carefully, he was evasive where he could simply said "No" and everything wouldn't have as they say, 'legs'...</p>
              <p>And you are quite right I don't think Pool would want to sell him to United either but maybe Arsenal? Not quite sure how many players are there who cross over directly, but I don't think there are many to date...</p>
              <p>The only difference here between Heinze and Reina is, while United were able to deny Heinze, the player also was more than happy not to insist and take a 'step up' to Real Madrid instead.</p>
              <p>Liverpool doesn't have that option at least not yet... And to make matters worse, It is believed Reina has a buy out clause on his contract put in last season... So anyone who meets that sum, Pool can't stop him from leaving... Or joining anyone of his choice I belief... Just like in the Torres case where Chelsea met the 'buy out'. Cos I don't think they would have like to sell to Chelsea too... But had no choice.</p>

Schmeichel was once again 
              named "The World's Best Goalkeeper" in 1993. In January 1994, Schmeichel
               fell out with Ferguson, as United had squandered a 3–0 lead to draw 3–3
               with <a title="Liverpool F.C." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.">Liverpool</a>. The two had a row where Schmeichel "said the most horrible things",<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Schmeichel#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> and he was subsequently sacked by Ferguson. A few days later, 
              Schmeichel made an improvised apology to the other players. Unknown to 
              him, Ferguson was eavesdropping on this, and he let Schmeichel stay at 
              Manchester United.<sup id="cite_ref-mbe_13-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Schmeichel#cite_note-mbe-13"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> Schmeichel and United repeated the Premier League championship win at the end of the season."</p>

              <p>I dun understand why only schmeichel and van der sar seem to get second chances when they make mistakes whether on or off field, you have mark bosnich whose only mistake was his goal kicking was poor before fergie dropped him and replaced him with barthez who isn't any better goal keeping wise...and then you have tim howard who made mistakes in a run of 2-3 games and he never plays again for man u...but both schmeichel and van der sar has made similar mistakes too...</p>
