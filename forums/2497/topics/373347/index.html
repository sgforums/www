              <h1 class="titlestory">Arsenal boss Wenger: Lose to Celtic and we're ZEROES</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsene Wenger</span></abbr> has warned his players they will all be "ZEROES" if they fail against Champions League opponents <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Celtic</span></abbr> tonight.</p>
              <p>The Frenchman said: "If we drop points against Man United, you can
              always get them back. We still have 35 games to go. But lose this one
              and we are zeroes. There IS no way back.</p>
              <p>"That's why it is a more important game than Old Trafford for this club - by far.</p>
              <p>"It's not the financial blow that will matter if <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Celtic</span></abbr> beat us, it's the fact we wouldn't be in the Champions League. You have to see how big this tournament is now.</p>
              <p>"Only two English clubs have played for the last ten years consecutively and even <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Real Madrid</span></abbr> have not made the last 16 for the past five years.</p>
              <p>"So there are no guarantees, not for anybody. You have to fight for what you want. At <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Celtic</span></abbr> we did that, we fought very hard.</p>
              <p>"There's no reason why it will be any different at home. It is not job done, it's job still to be done.</p>
              <p>"We have been in the quarter-final, semi-final and final of the
              Champions League in recent years, so that means that we are not far
              away.</p>
              <p>"But it all counts for NOTHING if we do not finish the job we started in Glasgow last week.</p>
              <p>"You have to reach the group stages and then see what we do from there."</p>

              <p class="article">Not unless he has developed a taste for hospital food. </p>
              <p class="article">Arsenal's Croatian international striker has already spent more than enough time in plaster following his horrific leg break last year. But that would be nothing compared to the damage he would suffer if the angry Celtic fans could get their hands on him. </p>
              <p class="article">For those travelling supporters will return to Scotland this morning convinced their team have been cheated of the chance to compete with Europe's elite. And who can blame them, after Eduardo's outrageous first-half dive to con Spanish referee Manuel Mejuto Gonzalez? </p>
              <p class="article">All 2,600 Celtic supporters in the Emirates' away end had a bird's eye view of the appalling act of simulation which led to Arsenal's decisive penalty. </p>
              <p class="article">Unlike Senor Gonzalez, they could clearly see there was no contact between Eduardo and keeper Artur Boruc before the Brazilian-born lightweight threw himself to the ground. </p>
              <p class="article">It was so blatant even the infamously myopic Arsene Wenger conceded it was never a penalty. </p>
              <p class="article">No wonder Boruc went loco when Gonzalez pointed to the spot. It was almost enough to make you feel sorry for our Caledonian chums. Almost. </p>
              <p class="article">To add insult to injury, it was Eduardo who dusted himself off to send Boruc the wrong way with his unerring 27th-minute penalty. </p>
              <p class="article">It was a travesty of a goal and one which allowed Celtic to claim they had been the victims of an appalling miscarriage of justice.</p>

              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger has suggested that Eduardo dived to win a penalty against Celtic because he was 'cautious' after his horrendous injury.</strong> </p>
              <p>The Croat tumbled despite not being touched by Hoops keeper Artur Boruc and converted the spot-kick for Arsenal's first home goal in their 5-1 aggregate win. </p>
              <p>Wenger admitted it was not a penalty but made excuses for Eduardo because of his horrific broken leg. </p>
              <p>"Having seen it again on television it doesn't look to be a penalty but we were likely to score the first goal and we always looked in control of the game," said Wenger. </p>
              <p>"I believe it was not a penalty but I'm not sure if the keeper touched him. Eduardo might be a bit cautious because of the injury that he had. He might have jumped out of the way. </p>
              <p>"I never asked in my life any player to dive to get a penalty but sometimes the player goes down because there is no way to get out of the way."</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Celtic players want Arsenal's Eduardo BANNED</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Celtic</span></abbr> midfielder Massimo Donati has demanded a UEFA ban for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> striker Eduardo over the way he won a penalty in last night's Champions League clash.</p>
              <p>"It is not good when a guy does that," Donati said. "Artur pulled
              away from him and it was not a penalty. Everybody knew it. It is part
              of football and you can do nothing once the referee gives it. Eduardo
              said nothing to us - he could say nothing. My idea for life, not just
              for football, is to be honest but sometimes people are not honest.</p>
              <p>"He could maybe in trouble for it. For me, it is the same as other incidents in the past. You have seen it a few times with the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rangers</span></abbr> player and the other player - they were banned. If they UEFA think it is the same situation, he will probably be in trouble."</p>
              <p>Boruc protested vociferously and even confronted Eduardo over
              his blatant deception. "It was not a penalty," said the simmering Pole
              afterwards. "I do not remember what I said to him - maybe I should
              learn more Croatian - but it changed the whole game."</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Scottish FA join Celtic call to ban Arsenal's Eduardo</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p>The Scottish FA have jumped into the row over <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> striker Eduardo's penalty won against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Celtic</span></abbr> last night.</p>
              <p>SFA chief executive Gordon Smith has urged UEFA to punish the Croatia international.</p>
              <p>Eduardo won a penalty in the Gunners' 3-1 win at the Emirates Stadium
              on Wednesday night after appearing to throw himself to the ground in
              the area.</p>
              <p>Smith wants UEFA to act retrospectively to punish the Croatia
              international, in the same way they dealt with Lithuania striker
              Saulius Mikoliunas, who cheated to earn a spot-kick against Scotland at
              Hampden Park in September 2007.</p>
              <p>Video evidence was used to sanction Mikoliunas, who was banned
              for two matches. The SFA recently applied that precedent to punish <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rangers</span></abbr> striker Kyle Lafferty, who feigned being headbutted by Aberdeen defender Charlie Mulgrew during a Clydesdale Bank <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> game in May.</p>
              <p>Smith said: "Eduardo is a terrific player who has battled back from a serious injury to resume playing at the highest level.</p>
              <p>"However, last night he showed disrespect to the game by his actions in winning a penalty against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Celtic</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>"Since I came into this post, I have raised the issue of simulation
              time and time again - both here in Scotland and with FIFA and UEFA. I
              don't think that I have received enough support in my efforts to
              eradicate what I believe to be one of the most serious threats to the
              integrity of football. Last night showed exactly why we must take this
              issue seriously.</p>
              <p>"We have shown the courage to use retrospective punishment when
              it comes to simulation and I would urge UEFA to do so in this instance.
              Everything that can be done to stamp it out must be done - starting
              right now. Last night's incident also brings the whole issue of video
              evidence to the fore.</p>
              <p>"I see absolutely no reason at all why we cannot use technology
              to assist referees - particularly in live games. I know that some
              people say that TV evidence would damage the flow of a game, but I
              believe the proposal that I put forward to both FIFA and UEFA whereby
              football would adopt a similar approach to tennis in offering a set
              number of challenges can work.</p>
              <p>"We need a serious debate on these issues. Everyone in football
              has a responsibility to set the right example to our youngsters. We can
              talk all we want about Fair Play campaigns, but taking action would be
              a much more powerful deterrent and would send the right message to
              players everywhere."</p>
