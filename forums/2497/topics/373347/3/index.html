              <h2><img src="http://img.skysports.com/09/08/134x100/Andy-Gray-800_2344464.jpg" alt="" width="134" height="100"></h2>
              <h2>Andy Gray: A staggering decision</h2>
              <blockquote>
              <p class="first">I am staggered by the UEFA decision to charge Arsenal striker Eduardo for 'deceiving the referee'.</p>
              <p>It was a very strange ruling and especially considering it was for something that was unclear.</p>
              <p>For
              all we know Eduardo might have been touched by the keeper - and in the
              laws of the game you don't have to be hammered, there only has to be
              the intent to tackle for a foul to be awarded - or he may just have
              been trying to protect his leg he injured last year.</p>
              <p>In the modern game it is so difficult to decide if it is a dive -
              footballers travel at such a pace it only takes the slightest nudge to
              put them off balance. It is a really strange one for me.</p>
              <p>It has
              also opened a massive can of worms. It encourages people to complain
              about and contest every decision. For instance, when a guy claims for a
              corner when he knows it isn't a corner - that's trying to deceive the
              referee, isn't it?</p>
              <p>All the Bristol City players who said Freddie Sears' 'goal' for
              Crystal Palace didn't go in were deceiving the referee - do we go back
              and charge all of them?</p>
              <p>Arsene Wenger thought Ryan Babel went
              over softly in the Champions League two seasons ago to win a penalty
              late on - do we go that far back? Should Babel be retrospectively
              charged?</p>
              <p>I saw Howard Webb book a young Fiorentina player in
              midweek for trying to win a penalty. I actually thought it was a
              penalty but he was shown a yellow card for simulation - so Eduardo does
              the same and could get a two game ban? Was the Fiorentina player not
              deceiving Howard Webb by diving?</p>
              <p>All I can say is let's hope if
              we see a Barcelona, Real Madrid or Milan player do a similar thing this
              season UEFA are as quick to react as they were with Eduardo. It's not
              for me to say but their dislike of the English sides' dominance is well
              documented.</p>

              get rid of diving. That is the biggest pain and problem in the game.</p>
              <p>"There is a responsibility, we do not believe in cheating. I think that is wrong. There should be video evidence for diving.</p>
              <p>"That would be the biggest thing that would help the referees.
              It is very difficult at times to judge what is a good tackle and what
              isn't. If there is anything video footage should come in for it is
              diving."</p>

              prosper.</p>
              <p>"Who is to say who is right or wrong? If you have a huge amount
