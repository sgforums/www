              <p>Yes, its a dive... but the villification of the man made from some quarters is just too mind-boggling... when was the last time the english media came out with all guns blazing on say steven gerrard?</p>
              <p>Moreover, the dive wouldn't have made a difference to the result anyway... celtic have created almost zilch in 2 legs ... 2 shots on target over the 2 legs... arsenal were the better team ... it's just a shame the so-called "match deciding" opening goal had to come in such a fashion</p>

              <p><strong>Arsenal striker Eduardo could face a two-match Champions League ban if UEFA decide to charge him with diving.</strong></p>
              <p>UEFA disciplinary officials are reviewing the incident when the Croatia striker won a penalty against Celtic on Wednesday night before deciding whether he will be charged.</p>
              <p>A UEFA spokesman said: "We are reviewing the match to see whether a disciplinary investigation should be launched."</p>
              <p>Under UEFA rules, if charged and found guilty Eduardo could face sanctions up to a two-match ban in European competition.</p>
              <p>Scottish Football Association chief executive Gordon Smith has called for Eduardo to face action and UEFA president Michel Platini confirmed he could be suspended.</p>
              <p>Platini, speaking in Monaco, said: "There are disciplinary procedures at UEFA and the procedure could be taken to suspend the player.</p>
              <p>"Scotland often start such procedures, last time it was a Lithuania player who was sanctioned."</p>
              <p>Platini said his plan of having two additional assistant referees, one behind each goal-line, would cut down on diving. The scheme is being trialled in this season's Europa League.</p>
              <p>He added: "One day players will give up simulating because referees will see them. For years players have cheated because the referees were not of a good enough quality.</p>
              <p>"I am convinced if you have referees close by that will prevent players from simulating and players will take the right decision. I have always said better to have more referees than a multiplication of disciplinary procedures."</p>
              <p>SFA chief Smith wants UEFA to act retrospectively to punish Eduardo in the same way they dealt with Lithuania striker Saulius Mikoliunas, who cheated to earn a spot-kick against Scotland at Hampden Park in September 2007.</p>
              <p>Video evidence was used to sanction Mikoliunas, who was banned for two matches. Smith said: "Eduardo is a terrific player who has battled back from a serious injury to resume playing at the highest level.</p>
              <p>"However, last night he showed disrespect to the game by his actions in winning a penalty against Celtic.</p>
              <p>Celtic midfielder Massimo Donati also called for Eduardo to be banned. "If it is clear on TV then UEFA must act against Eduardo and ban him," said Donati. "I think he should get a two-match ban because it wasn't a penalty. I told him that and everyone in the Celtic team told him that."</p>
              <p>Wednesday night's game was still 0-0 at the time, though Arsenal held a 2-0 advantage from the first leg. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger acknowledged Celtic goalkeeper Artur Boruc did not bring down Eduardo in the penalty incident but claimed his forward was taking evasive action.</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">UEFA president Platini: I would have dived like Eduardo but I will back ban</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p>UEFA president Michel Platini admitted he would have dived like Arsenal’s Eduardo did against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Celtic</span></abbr> on Wednesday night but has backed any penalty given to the player.</p>
              <p>In a conflicting argument, the France legend says that diving needs to
              be stamped out of the game but also revealed that if he was in the same
              position as a player, he would have ‘simulated’ to win a penalty.</p>
              <p>“I know why players do it - because I’ve dived myself,”  he said.</p>
              <p>“I did it because I knew the referee wouldn’t see me trying it
              on and also because there were no cameras either. If we thought we
              could get away with it, we would.</p>
              <p>“I can tell you, in the World Cup semi-final in 1982 against
              Germany, if I could have dived to get a penalty and win the game I
              would have done it, to make up for what happened between Patrick
              Battiston and Toni Schumacher,” he added.</p>
              <p>“I hate injustice - but I just couldn’t get into the box. Mind
              you, knowing the referee, who was Italian, even if I’d had both my legs
              chopped off in the box he wouldn’t have given it!</p>
              <p>“However, with five officials, you can’t do it because you will
              be spotted - and if you aren’t, then it’s the fault of the officials.”</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Eduardo has got a freak injury and he wanted to avoid that kind of injury again, and I think he fully understand that as an ex-player himself. But as FIFA president he also have to act on it by backing the ban on him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I think Eduardo should at least tell the referee that it was not a penalty, most of the referee won't overturn their decision anyway. Arshaavin did that the other day...the referee also went ahead to reward the penalty...</p>

              <p>No.</p>
              <p>Diving belongs to the swimming pool, not the football pitch.</p>
              <p>It's about time that they introduce video playback for controversial refereeing decisions.</p>
              <p>I've seen the video playback of Eduardo's dive. It was pretty clear that there was no contact, and the Celtic goalkeeper had taken pains to pull back to prevent contact.</p>

              <h2>EDUARDO HIT WITH UEFA CHARGE</h2>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>UEFA have charged Arsenal striker Eduardo
              with diving to win a penalty against Celtic and he could now face
              missing the Gunners' first two Champions League group games.</p>
              <p>European football's governing body announced they had opened
              disciplinary proceedings against the Croatia international for
              "deceiving the referee" in Wednesday night's play-off round second leg
              at the Emirates Stadium.</p>
              <p>UEFA said in a statement: "Having studied video evidence of the
              incident in question, the UEFA disciplinary inspector decided to charge
              the player concerned. The UEFA control and disciplinary body will
              examine the case on September 1."</p>
              <p>The charge is based on Article 10, paragraph 1c of the UEFA
              disciplinary regulations (misconduct of players) which states: "Players
              may be suspended for two competition matches, or for a specified
              period, for acting with the obvious intent to cause any match official
              to make an incorrect decision or supporting his error of judgment and
              thereby causing him to make an incorrect decision."</p>

              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger has gone absolutely ballistic after UEFA charged Eduardo over his alleged dive against Celtic. </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to the Arsenal boss, Eduardo has been unfairly
              signalled out due to the power of the media and the number of
              influential Scots working at European football's governing body. He's
              also vowed to contest every single decision made by a referee in Europe
              from now on</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Croatia striker allegedly dived in Arsenal's Champions
              League qualifier against Celtic on Wednesday night. If he is found
              guilty, he could be banned for two Champions League games.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Several Celtic figures called for a ban, as well as SFA chief executive Gordon Smith.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wenger said: "I find it a complete disgrace and unacceptable. We
              won't accept the way we have been treated in this case for two reasons.</p>
              <p>"I believe that you can debate whether it was a penalty or not.
              For me it's a witch-hunt that we see and not an objective judgement of
              a case.</p>
              <p>"This charge implies there was intent and a desire to cheat the
              referee. Having watched the pictures again there was nothing
              conclusive.</p>
              <p>"It singles out a player in Europe to be a cheat and that is not acceptable. UEFA has taken action that is not defendable."</p>
              <p>"In the past, cheating has happened and no action has been
              taken. A dangerous door has been opened - every decision can now be
              challenged.</p>
              <p>"I tell you now - we will be challenging every decision made by a referee in the Champions League.</p>
              <p>Wenger also claimed that Eduardo had been signalled out due to "Scottish influence" at UEFA.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"This case has been ruled by the media, and by Scotland.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"There are many Scots who work there (at UEFA) and who are influential"</p>
