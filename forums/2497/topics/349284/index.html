              <p><strong>LONDON - Arsenal will take a slender 1-0
              advantage over Roma to the Olympic Stadium after Robin van
              Persie's penalty gave them victory in the first leg of their
              Champions League, last 16 tie on Tuesday.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The livewire Dutchman was bundled over by French defender
              Philippe Mexes after 37 minutes and got up to smash a low spot
              kick past keeper Doni.</p>
              <p>Roma, knocked out of the competition for the last two
              seasons by Manchester United and with a dismal record in
              England, had a few chances to pocket an away goal, but Arsenal
              should have built a bigger lead.</p>
              <p>Nicklas Bendtner wasted their best chance shortly after
              halftime, blazing wastefully over the crossbar. Arsenal will
              hope Togo international striker Emmanuel Adebayor will be fit to
              return for what promises to be a tricky second leg.</p>
              <p>"It's a regret," Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger told
              reporters when asked if his side should have killed off Roma.
              "I'm happy with the performance but there was room to score more
              goals tonight."</p>
              <p>"The one positive, or not the only positive, is that we
              didn't concede a goal and it puts us into a position where we
              cannot just defend. We will want to attack and score goals over
              there."</p>
              <p>After three consecutive 0-0 draws in the Premier League
              Arsenal began with real purpose at the Emirates and threatened
              to blow Roma away.</p>
              <p>Without injured Cesc Fabregas in midfield, Samir Nasri took
              on the responsibility of pulling Arsenal's strings and his speed
              conjured an early chance for Bendtner.</p>
              <p>Roma barely got out of their own half for 15 minutes but
              when they did Marco Motta forced a fingertip save from Arsenal
              keeper Manuel Almunia. Simone Loria then wasted a great chance
              for the Giallorossi as Roma began to settle.</p>
              <p>As halftime approached Arsenal's dominance was rewarded when
              Bendtner played in van Persie on the left edge of the penalty
              area and Mexes, who was having a torrid night, got the wrong
              side of the Dutchman and committed a clumsy foul.</p>
              <p>Van Persie confidently dispatched the penalty.</p>
              <p>Arsenal began the second half in bizarre fashion as the game
              kicked off with centre backs William Gallas and Kolo Toure still
              walking down the tunnel, resulting in a yellow card for Toure.</p>
              <p>On the restart the home side went for the kill, however, and
              had chances to extend their lead. Bendtner should have finished
              off a sweeping move and then Doni saved a low drive from Abou
              Diaby. Arsenal's profligacy in front of goal continued when
              Emmanuel Eboue shot wide after over-indulging.</p>
              <p>The home side were almost made to pay when former Liverpool
              left back John Arne Riise shaved the post with a fierce cross
              shot but apart from a late flurry of pressure Roma were content
              to hang on.</p>
              <p>"It was a fair result," Roma manager Luciano Spalletti said.
              "Their pace and intensity gave us a lot of difficulties but
              everything will be different in the second match."</p>
