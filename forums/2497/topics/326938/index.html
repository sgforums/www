              <h1>Sir Alex Ferguson: Chelsea's only way is down</h1>
              <h2>The start of the Premier League season may still be a week away but Sir Alex Ferguson has continued his early attempt to undermine Chelsea by drawing comparisons between Luiz Felipe Scolari's current team and the Liverpool side that fell into steep decline after the title triumph of 1990 – the last time the Anfield club were crowned Champions.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/00788/sir_alex-ferguson_788461c.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><span class="caption"><em>Going down: Fergie, starts his mind games. Chelsea are a force on the wane according to Sir Alex Ferguson.</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The Manchester United manager has already voiced his belief this summer that, with a line-up studded with players already on the wrong side of 30, Chelsea's potential for improvement is limited and that their best days may soon be behind them. Warming to his pre-season theme ahead of today's Community Shield match against Portsmouth, Ferguson has reinforced his view, damning Scolari's side with faint praise, while lacing his comments with an additional barb that will be felt as keenly on Merseyside as it will in West London.</strong></p>
              <p>"I don't see any change in Chelsea. That is, to me they don't look as if they are going to find acres of improvement, simply because they are a very experienced team," he said. "But that experienced team can easily win the league because it's not exactly disintegrating. They are at their very peak, I would think, as a team. So it's much like the Liverpool team of '89. Exactly that same format of experience of that Liverpool team."</p>
              <p>Reminded that Liverpool have never recovered from that point, Ferguson added: "I know. It was a very experienced team but that's the difficulty of football clubs. What's helped Chelsea is they have re-energised the club by putting new managers in. Now Phil Scolari's come, and it seems – again – is this a new dawning, a new era, new ideas? How will he energise them? But I don't think it will be much different to last season. They could win the league and there won't be much in it again. But I just hope we are the team that can improve more."</p>
              <p>Perhaps a more telling reflection of Ferguson's concerns about the challenge posed by Scolari's side came in the Scot's willingness to talk up the prospects of Arsenal as the most likely challengers for his own side's Premier League title.</p>
              <p>"If Arsenal get off to the start they did last season, I think they will sustain it better," he added.</p>

              <p>well, he just made a general comment...</p>
              <p>if two teams, one with age 30+ players and one with age 20+ players, who got more potentials for the future?</p>
              <p>the key is "future"..</p>
              <p>In this case, Chelsea is under pressure to win everything, so they have to get ready-made players such as Deco to win.</p>
              <p>I do believe every club now invest heavily in their youth development and given Chelsea rich suger daddy, their youth development won't lose out to any..</p>
              <p>So SAF may have to learn to eat his words lor.. but what better place to learn than Chelsea.. they are fond of making baseless predictions..</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">CHELSEA’S John Terry hit back at Alex Ferguson last night, insisting they will pip Manchester United to the title. The Blues skipper insists Fergie is way off target by saying the Londoners are too old. And he believes United cannot top last season and are on the way down after peaking in the last couple of years.</h2>
              <p class="article">Terry, 27, also said Cristiano Ronaldo will struggle to repeat his 42-goal season and even had a pop at 34-year-old Ryan Giggs’ age. He said: “Fergie realises we weren’t too far away from them at the very top of their game — I don’t think they’ve got another level to go to. </p>
              <p class="article">"They’ve had a lot of players who have hit the peak of their form in the last two years. “Rio’s been awesome. Ronaldo’s been unbelievable — I don’t think we’ll ever see that again.” “Rooney, Tevez, Giggs at his age — they’ve all been fantastic. “But after the injuries at our place, we as players can all raise the bar a little bit.”</p>
              <p class="article">Terry insists new Chelsea boss Big Phil Scolari has signed the right players to see the Blues recapture the title. He added: “I never realised how good Deco was — but he’s probably one of the best I’ve ever played against and trained with.”</p>
