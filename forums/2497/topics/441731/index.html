              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">STEVEN GERRARD is haunted by the prospect of ending his career without a title winner's medal at Anfield.</h2>
              <p>The Kop captain is currently on the way back from a crocked ankle and still some way off full fitness.</p>
              <p>Yet that has not stopped him dreaming daily of what it would be like to lift the Premier League with Liverpool.</p>
              <p>And the prospect of eventually hanging up his boots with a gaping hole in his trophy cabinet leaves him cold.</p>
              <p>Gerrard, 31, confessed: "It's something I think about almost every day. I always think about the dream of winning it — or the disappointment if I was never to win it.</p>
              <p>"To have played at Liverpool for 14 or 15 years by the time I finish and not win it would be hugely disappointing. It would be an awful shame."</p>
              <p>Gerrard will have to wait at least another 12 months with Liverpool currently sixth and leaders Manchester City all but out of sight already, 12 points ahead.</p>
              <p>The England midfielder has played just four league games all year after groin surgery delayed his kick-off until the end of September.</p>
              <p>But he has seen enough in Kenny Dalglish's new-look squad to convince him the Reds can have a massive say over the next few years.</p>
              <p>He added: "I've played in an era where there have been three, four or five top teams in the league. When Liverpool dominated in the 1970s and 80s, they were so good they often turned it into a one-horse race from the start of the season.</p>
              <p>"In my time, we've been fighting with Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and now City and Spurs.</p>
              <p>"They have all been, or are, fantastic teams — but that's the way football has gone. It's a really difficult competition to win but we'll always keep fighting for it.</p>
              <p>"And with the squad we have now, if we can keep improving and progressing and adding to it, we'll have a really good chance of becoming champions. It won't be for a lack of trying.</p>
              <p>"The squad is looking stronger, probably the strongest we've had for a long time. Now it's all about delivering because the tools are all there.</p>
              <p>"At Liverpool your standards have got to be so high every single week. You have to perform every time.</p>
              <p>"That's what I've had to do every year and that's what the new lads are coming to terms with.</p>
              <p>"Luis Suarez and Andy Carroll still feel like new signings because they came halfway through last season.</p>
              <p>"And since then we've added Charlie Adam, Jordan Henderson, Stewart Downing, Craig Bellamy, Jose Enrique, Doni and Sebastian Coates.</p>
              <p>"The majority of them are strong British lads who know the league well and also have quality."</p>
              <p>While Gerrard continues his recovery work, boss Dalglish is hopeful Jamie Carragher and striker Suarez will be fit for Sunday's crucial trip to high-flying Chelsea.</p>
