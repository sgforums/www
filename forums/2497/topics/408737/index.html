              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">MARIO BALOTELLI has promised Manchester City fans there is plenty more to come after his explosive debut in Romania.</h2>
              <p>And the controversial Italian striker has vowed to be fit to make his home bow against Liverpool on Monday.</p>
              <p>City's new £23million arrival from Inter Milan lived up to his billing during an unforgettable 33-minute cameo as a sub against FC Timisoara.</p>
              <p>He scored the only goal within 15 minutes of coming on, could have had a couple more, then got a yellow card for squaring up to an opponent and ended up limping off with a knee injury.</p>
              <p>Balotelli, 20, said: "I feel good, this is the kind of debut I dreamed of. "I showed up for Manchester City immediately and I will continue to show up for them.</p>
              <p>"These are only the first games we are playing together but we will get better and better.</p>
              <p>"My right leg aches a bit. I think it may be a cartilage thing, the problem is I do not have much muscle there.</p>
              <p>"It's a bit of a problem, but I'm sure I will be available against Liverpool."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>It is tempting to depict this a clash between the future and the past. <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester City" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester City</span></a> enjoy all the means and will expect, at the minimum, to qualify for the Champions League this season. <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Liverpool" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><span style="color: #005689;">Liverpool</span></a> crave a return to that lucrative tournament and Roy Hodgson's know-how has to bring new impetus to the club.</p>
              <p>City, despite the outlay, have not been exhilarating so far, but a goalless draw at Spurs and a 1-0 win away to Timisoara in the first leg of the Europa League play-offs suggested that solidity is the immediate priority.</p>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Christian Poulsen has taunted Manchester City ahead of Monday's meeting between the sides by claiming their history cannot compare with Liverpool's.</strong></p>
              <p>The Denmark international recently completed his Anfield move after two seasons with Italian giants Juventus.</p>
              <p>The 30-year-old is impressed with the club's history and knows it will take big-spending City time to match the Reds' impressive trophy cabinet.</p>
              <p>Although Liverpool have come up short in the title race in recent seasons, Poulsen is pleased with the quality in Roy Hodgson's squad and thinks they can challenge for honours.</p>
              <p>"You can't compare City with the history of Liverpool and (Manchester) United," he said. "In Denmark we really love English football.</p>
              <p>"It will take some time for City. Four or five years ago the Premier League was United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea.</p>
              <p>"Now you have teams like City and Spurs. But in Denmark, Liverpool are No 1. You see the history, it's really something special.</p>
              <p>"When you are at Melwood and Anfield, there's a really big history. We have a really strong squad and will be at the top of the league this season.</p>
              <p>"We showed against Arsenal we are ready to battle with all the big teams in England. It's the strongest league in the world and I'm looking forward to playing in it."</p>

              <p>The club's multi-billionaire owner proved a lucky omen on his Eastlands debut as City completely outplayed Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Mancini said: "It was a great performance to put on in front of Sheikh Mansour and it would be great if he could come every week.</p>
              <p>"I spoke to him after the game and he was very happy.</p>
              <p>"It is the first time he has been here and he has seen us beat Liverpool. He spoke with Carlos Tevez, too, and congratulated him."</p>
              <p>Mancini was quick to emphasise last night's victory was very much made in England.</p>
              <p>He added: "It always takes time for a team to gel but what pleased me tonight was that we had six English players in that side."</p>
              <p>New £26million buy James Milner was man of the match on his debut, setting up the opener for Gareth Barry.</p>
              <p>He said: "I wanted to go out there and get on with the job. It is a great start to the home season.</p>
              <p>"It was a great finish from Gareth and after that Liverpool did not cause us many problems up to half-time.</p>
              <p>"I think I can be part of something special here. This is a club moving forward with a great stadium."</p>
              <p>Tevez got the slightest of touches for the second from Micah Richards' header.</p>
              <p>But Richards insisted: "It's definitely my goal. Carlos had a fantastic game and got a penalty later so I am going to claim it."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <div id="content">
              <div><em>It was the perfect introduction for the richest man in the ground and probably England, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan.</em></div>
              <div></div>
              <p><strong>There were no interviews from Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan, so we can only guess about what he was thinking, but it would not be unreasonable to assume that, like so many people at their first game of football in England, the sense of occasion, all those different noises, the tribalism, blue versus red, Manchester versus </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Liverpool" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong> must have invigorated his senses.</strong></p>
              <p>He certainly chose a good night to make his first appearance at Eastlands since that seminal day, almost two years ago, when he parted with a few droplets of his oil riches to buy out Thaksin Shinawatra.</p>
              <p>There was a good vibe at Eastlands; a genuine sense that maybe the most powerful spenders in English football were not getting too far ahead of themselves to emblazon the words "This is gonna be our season" (in telltale blue) over Manchester's city centre buses.</p>
              <p>James Milner had an excellent debut, Adam Johnson put in maybe his best performance since joining the club and it could not be said Carlos Tevez's second-half goals flattered <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester City" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester City</span></a>. Roberto Mancini's team played with width and penetration and, once they had sensed Liverpool's vulnerabilities (of which there were many), they set about exposing them, not once afflicted by the kind of self-anxiety we have been accustomed to seeing on this ground.</p>
              <p>How much the sheikh knows about football remains unclear, and it would be a brave man to try to get past the entourage of bodyguards, with their dark glasses and walkie-talkies, to pose the question. What he will know for certain now, though, is that the stories about Manchester's weather are true and that his money has brought a feeling of positivity to the stadium Stuart Pearce, from an already distant past, once described as having the acoustics of a library.</p>
              <p>"Manchester Thanks You, Sheikh Mansour" is the banner, written in English and Arabic, on the opposite side to where the representative of Abu Dhabi's royal family was sat – handsome, in a sharp suit, looking every bit the young Al Pacino – in one of the thermostatically controlled leather seats high in the Colin Bell stand. There is not a decibel meter inside Eastlands, so it is difficult to measure the appreciation when he appeared on the giant screen to offer a polite wave, but it was certainly louder and more prolonged than the ovation reserved for Milner's introduction – and that was fairly voluble itself.</p>
              <p>Milner began in the role that might have been assigned for Mario Balotelli had the Italian not been forced out with a knee injury, playing on his "wrong" side: a right-footed player drifting in from the left, with the scope to roam. It is an unorthodox but increasingly fashionable tactic, one that Bayern Munich and Holland use successfully with Arjen Robben, a left-footed player on the right.</p>
              <p>This role was filled by Adam Johnson and the two wide men were integral to the periods when City were notably the better side and it was not long before Milner had demonstrated he is a prolific creator of chances.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div><span style="color: #005689;"><img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2010/8/23/1282597523999/James-Milner-006.jpg" alt="James Milner" width="460" height="276"></span></div>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>At Aston Villa last season, Milner not only scored seven times from midfield but played the telling pass for 12 goals. There is no question he is over-priced, coming in a £26m player-plus-cash exchange with Stephen Ireland, but these are exceptional statistics, and there were none of the first-day nerves that might have been anticipated of a player with a price tag that could weigh down a less confident player like a bag of cement. Milner was quick to the ball, hard running, always trying to make himself available, and when he had possession he generally made good use of it – never more so than the low, precise cutback for Gareth Barry to expose Liverpool's brittle defence.</strong></p>
              <p>The beauty of this goal was actually one pass before, when Adam Johnson slipped the ball through Milan Jovanovic's legs, but Milner's part justified his inclusion ahead of David Silva.</p>
              <p>High in the crowd, the sheikh was on his feet, celebrating in the way that royals do: clapping and smiling, rather than punching the air and bellowing.</p>
              <p>He may not fully comprehend that Liverpool were far more obliging opponents than usual, and it would be wrong of him to assume that just because Fernando Torres was so ineffectual it scarcely matters that the Spaniard could not be coaxed away from Liverpool.</p>
              <p>But, equally, he may not even care. This was a brutal night for Liverpool but, for the richest man in the ground (and probably England, on this one occasion), it was the perfect introduction.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, you are correct but you must also look at the situation and assess.. Liverpool shall make use of its limited resources and play accordingly. Lucas suks as DM. That is why, no choice Gerrard shall be deploy as DM. Now aqua man almost sold.</p>
              <p>I don't know what's wrong with Hodgson,sold aqua man and now even more limited option?? Maybe make Joe Cole as AM and again push Gerrard into DM.</p>

              <p>Gerrard won't be a good DM... The guy play his best football as an AM behind the main striker but strangely, whenever he excel in that position, he is changed and moved to the right, left or central midfield position behind 2 other strikers (4,4,2)...</p>
              <p>Last nigh was another good example. His covering isn't totally convincing at all... City's first goal could have been prevented had Gerrard (the closest to Milner) got into the covering position earlier rather than drift too far away from him and ball watching Johnson who already had another Pool defender on him...</p>

Pool got You never walk alone, Man United got the Grand musical introduction and the Glory Glory United song... City got their Blue Moon... which is not too bad but like no power like that so now they got 2 songs... Before Blue Moon is played, there is this one I think by the Fat Boys Slim or someone... It goes like Right Here, Right Now... lol... Very powerful intro this one, I like it... It makes you really pump up for the match... But Blue Moon kind of too sentimental and make me want to go back and sleep... lol.</p></div>
