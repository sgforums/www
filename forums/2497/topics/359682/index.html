              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Newcastle striker Michael Owen has questioned Alan Shearer's decision to leave him out against Liverpool last week. </strong></p>
              <p>Owen, who was restored to the starting line-up for
              Monday's win over Middlesbrough, was left out by his old team-mate for
              the trip to former club Liverpool last weekend as Newcastle slumped to
              a 3-0 defeat at Anfield.</p>
              <p>Shearer substituted Owen 20 minutes from
              time against Middlesbrough with his replacement Obafemi Martins going
              to score the crucial second goal within a minute of entering the pitch.</p>
              <p>Owen,
              speaking in the matchday programme notes, admits he was upset to be
              left out and feels Shearer was wrong to omit him from the starting
              line-up.</p>
              <p>Owen wrote: "On a personal basis, I am glad the last fortnight is over.</p>
              <p>"I
              was angry with myself for missing that chance against Portsmouth and
              then disappointed to be left out of the starting line-up against my
              former club.</p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p>"I have known our manager ever since I
              started in the game and consider him to be a friend but there was no
              old pals' act as far as his decision-making was concerned.</p>
              <p>"Though
              I was upset and felt that he was wrong - only last week the press
              pointed out that, even though I had only scored eight league goals this
              season, my conversion ratio was the best in the Premier League - what I
              can't fault is the way he handled the situation: strong, up front and
              honest. Just the way a top manager should be.</p>
              <p>"I also
              appreciate that rotation is part of today's game and any number of top
              players were left out of the Champions League semi-finals for tactical
              or other reasons."</p>
              <p>Owen, who is out of
              contract at St James' Park in the summer, insists the whole squad is
              focused on getting Newcastle out of trouble in the fight to avoid
              relegation.</p>
              <p>"I wish you were able to see how professional and
              focused we all are," added Owen. "The management team have made certain
              that we are in the right frame of mind and each of us knows the job we
              have to do as individuals and as part of the team."</p>
