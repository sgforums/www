              <h1>Martin Jol turns his back on Ajax to join Fulham after irresistible 
              offer from Mohamed Al Fayed<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Martin Jol is on his way back to London and the Premier League as the
               new manager of Fulham.</p>
              <p>The Dutchman has succumbed to Fulham 
              owner Mohamed Al Fayed’s considerable powers of persuasion and decided 
              to quit Ajax for Craven Cottage.</p>
              <p>Jol’s appointment as Roy 
              Hodgson’s successor is scheduled to be confirmed on Monday and is a 
              major coup for Fayed.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/16/article-0-01DB0C61000004B0-69_468x335.jpg" alt="New job? Martin Jol could replace Roy Hodgson at Fulham" width="468" height="335">
              <p class="imageCaption" style="text-align: left;"><em>New job? Martin Jol 
              could replace Roy Hodgson at Fulham</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>It had been felt Fulham 
              could not compete with Jol’s £2m wages at 
              Ajax, but Fayed has made an offer the 54-year-old former Tottenham boss 
              could not resist, including supplying the finance to compete for new 
              players, while Ajax are considering selling two of their World Cup 
              stars, Luis Suarez and Gregory van der Wiel.</p>
              <p>One of the first of these arrivals could be Sweden striker Zlatan 
              Ibrahimovic, who has the same agent as Jol and is on his way out of 
              Barcelona.</p>
              <p>Jol’s decision was greeted with surprise in Holland, where his team 
              finished just behind Steve McClaren’s FC Twente in the Dutch League 
              despite a goal difference of more than 100.</p>
              <p>‘No one here can understand how you leave Ajax for a club like 
              Fulham,’ said a source in Holland. ‘It is shocking to us. We recognise 
              the English club want to progress, we accept they were Europa League 
              finalists and we know they are right that Jol can maintain their run of 
              success.</p>
              <p>‘But Ajax are a club with a reputation as one of Europe’s greatest, 
              past and present and in the future. To walk away from such a club at 
              such a time is an extraordinary decision.’</p>

              international Dennis Rommedahl, who won't be at Ajax next year" width="468" height="346">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Exodus: Jol was upset at the rush of players, 
              including Denmark international Dennis Rommedahl, who won't be at Ajax 
              next year</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Jol was a late entry for the job after Hodgson’s move to Liverpool, 
              with former England manager Sven Goran Eriksson and Switzerland’s German
              coach Ottmar Hitzfeld the favourites while USA World Cup coach Bob 
              Bradley was also in the frame.</p>
              <p>But Fayed had his eyes firmly on the Dutchman, who was 
              controversially forced out of Spurs in 2007 after guiding them to 
              successive fifth places.</p>
              <p>Jol has become increasingly frustrated by a lack of spending money 
              and Ajax demands that they sell his best players.</p>
              <p>The Amsterdam club have suffered what for them was a massive loss in 
              excess of £20million last season and claimed the only way they can 
              recover financial stability is by weakening the squad through player 
              sales.</p>
              <p>In the past two weeks, Jol has looked on as Ajax entertained a 
              £20million approach from Bayern Munich for Van der Wiel while letting 
              Denmark winger Dennis Rommedahl move to Olympiakos. It had been made 
              clear that he could lose Uruguay hit-man Suarez in the next few days.</p>
              <p>Jol, who kept the home he bought during his time at White Hart Lane, 
              said: ‘The board told me that everything was going to be all right. But 
              it clearly is not. To me that is a big disappointment.’</p>
              <p>Striker Bobby Zamora tapped in the equaliser to earn Fulham a 1-1 
              draw in a friendly at Bournemouth on Saturday.</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Ajax coach Jol agrees terms with Fulham</h1>
              <p>Ajax coach Martin Jol has agreed terms with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fulham</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>The <em>Sunday Mirror</em> says Jol last night agreed a deal to take over 
              as <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fulham</span></abbr> manager.</p>
              <p>He will fly out to join the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fulham</span></abbr> squad on their 10-day tour of Sweden next 
              week.</p>
              <p>Sven Goran Eriksson had appeared to be favourite for the job until it 
              emerged Ajax chief Jol had been in talks with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fulham</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Negotiations stalled over pay. Club owner Mohamed Al Fayed had earmarked
               a salary of £1.5million a year – £1m less than Jol earned at Ajax.</p>
              <p>However, the pair reached a compromise, with Jol known to be keen to 
              return to the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr>.</p>
