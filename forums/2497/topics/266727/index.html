            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool forward Djibril Cisse had his heart set on a move to Marseille before the end of last season.<br><br>The France striker is set to sign a reported four-year contract at Marseille, who yesterday 'reached an agreement in principle' with the Reds.<br><br>West Ham also declared an interest in Cisse - but he is now on the verge of completing a switch to his home town club, with whom he spent last season on loan.<br><br>The 25-year-old revealed his delight at securing a deal with Marseille, and admitted there was never a doubt he would join any other club.<br><br>'I am very happy, really delighted,' he told Marseille's official website, www.om.net.<br><br>'It has been a long time coming. We fought tooth and nail for this - and we have got what we wanted.<br><br>'I decided on Marseille even before the end of the championship. I had already made my decision.<br><br>'It went very well last season. Marseille is like my home. I am happy here.'<br><br>Cisse struggled to impress in his two seasons at Anfield.<br><br>'I was really keen on being present at all the talks between the directors of Liverpool and Marseille,' he said.<br><br>'I wanted to show to the chiefs at Liverpool that this wasn't a joke, that it wasn't just talk, that my wish was to join OM [Marseille].<br><br>'I think that played a part in the final outcome.'<br><br>Marseille president Pape Diouf is relieved to have finally got his man.<br><br>'It was symbolic for us in our recruitment to keep Djibril in our ranks,' he said.<br><br>'It has not been without pain that we have reached this point, so we are very satisfied to bring an end to this affair.<br><br>'The negotiations have been long, sometimes hard and gruelling. But we have had to keep on going - and Liverpool have done the same.'<br><br>No fee has been announced for the transfer as yet, but if Cisse does go on to complete his switch he will be joined at Marseille by former Anfield colleague Boudewijn Zenden - who signed a two-year deal with the French giants yesterday.<br><br>'Happiness comes in twos,' Diouf added.<br><br>'With the arrival of Zenden, we can say that we have sealed a double coup.'<br><br>The Dutchman joined on a free transfer, having been released by Liverpool, becoming Marseille's seventh summer signing.<br><br>Marseille have Champions League football to look forward to next season after finishing second in Ligue 1 last term - and appear ready to challenge the dominance of Lyon, who have won the last six French titles.<br><br>'It is exciting,' said Cisse.<br><br>'We have the championship - as well as the Champions League, which OM have not played in for three years and are going to rediscover in September.<br><br>'With the team we have this year, I believe we can do great things.'</div>
