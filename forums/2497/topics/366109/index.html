              <h1>Who will get a starting role in Manchester City's Galacticos - the most expensive forward line in football?</h1>
              <div id="article-body">
              <div class="art-o art-align-left"><img src="http://images.mirror.co.uk/upl/m4/oct2008/8/1/B8961F58-F284-7BBB-7E892E3E2FD0726A.jpg" border="0" alt="Mark Hughes (Pic:Getty)" width="450" height="279"></div>

              <p><strong>Mark Hughes is soon to be the proud owner of the most expensive forward line in football - but Manchester City's boss has also been handed the biggest dilemma in the game. Just WHO starts in this array of Galacticos? And how do you keep so many big egos happy in the crammed dressing room at Eastlands?</strong></p>
              <p>This week alone Hughes could see Samuel Eto'o arrive on £200,000 a week and Carlos Tevez for another £150,000 a week. They will join Robinho, who suddenly seems decent value at just £130,000 per week. And the weekly wage bill for the likely bench for strikers is also staggering with Craig Bellamy and newly-signed Roque Santa Cruz both on £80,000, and Brazilian Elano at £30,000.</p>
              <p>The Beswick Billionaires are now on the global market like their Arab owners hoped they would be when they bailed out Thaksin Shinawatra ten months ago. But back in the real world Hughes is facing the largest selection dilemma ever known - with an embarassment of riches every time he tries to pick one to eleven.</p>
              <p>Eto'o HAS to play from the off, but his style suggests that City may play him on his own up front with two buzzing assistants on either side in a system Hughes tried to perfect last season.</p>
              <p>Robinho, their enigmatic Brazilian, should get his chance as the left-hand side-kick. However he will have to deliver on a regular basis because there is a queue forming behind him - and his status as biggest buy and best-paid star is history.</p>
              <p>Tevez is coming from Manchester United because he wants to play every week - his biggest moan at Sir Alex Ferguson - so he had better get a jersey or else.</p>
              <p>Between them that is a whole lot of skill and unpredictability not to mention a combined wage of close to £500,000-a-week. But it does leave new boy Santa Cruz and Hughes-signing Bellamy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="art-o art-align-left"><img src="http://images.mirror.co.uk/upl/m4/jun2009/0/5/roque-santa-cruz-458160431.jpg" border="0" alt="Roque Santa Cruz (Pic:PA)" width="450" height="322"></div>
              <p><em><strong>Roque Santa Cruz </strong></em></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p>Santa Cruz has just joined from Blackburn Rovers for over £15 million and is picking up £80,000-a-week but unless Hughes changes his tactics he could be giving his knees a rest on the bench.</p>
              <p>Bellamy was an over-the-top £12 million buy from West Ham just a window ago but could also be like last year's fashion with this array of talent ahead of him. And he is not one of the world's happiest squad men.</p>
              <p>Valeri Bjoinov and Felipe Caicedo should either be onto their agents and keeping an eye on the draw for the Carling Cup - because they are going to be well down the list.</p>
              <p>Hughes has already signed Gareth Barry to bring poise and presence to his midfield and he should get a game in a midfield three beside Nigel De Jong, whose £15 million arrival seems like small change.</p>
              <p>That leaves crowd favourites like Stephen Ireland - their Player of the Year - Shaun Wright-Phillips and Martin Petrov squabbling for one place in the all-star line-up.</p>
              <p>Elano was a bit up-and-down last season and was not a Hughes signing. Vincent Kompany was and may be wondering where he stands in the new big picture.</p>
              <p>Hughes has not even signed a defender yet this summer, taking the Real Madrid Galacticos theme to its ludicrous extreme. Everton will make them pay through the nose for Joleon Lescott while a right back could still be signed if one can be found.</p>
              <p>City stalwarts like Richard Dunne and Micah Richards could return to pre-season training and find someone else's gear is in their lockers.</p>
              <p>It is quite possible that City will start the new season against Blackburn Rovers with a side costing more than £160 million in the past calendar year - and with a further £20 million or so on the bench.</p>
              <p>In English football's history even the great movers and shakers like Jack Walker and Roman Abramovich didn't go anywhere near those levels of spending in such a short space of time.</p>
              <p>Walker inherited Donald Mackay at Blackburn Rovers and Abramovich had the pleasure of the tinkering Claudio Ranieri. Hughes will be hoping it's not third time lucky in that sequence.</p>
              <p>The Welshman did brilliantly to dodge the bullet at the end of the season and win the right to be the manager who spends the millions.</p>
              <p>Now it is time to produce.</p>
              <p>Hughes asked to be judged on this season when he aimed for the top six. Thanks to the current spending spree it's a title challenge and a trophy or someone else gets the combination to the safe.  </p>

              <p>with all their riches, they should also boast their defences lar. score many goals and then let in many goals?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>how to be in top 4 like that? if hughes doesnt finish top 4 or win any trophies, he may face the fate of ranieri, replaced by a top top manager.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I actually thought that the sheik could replace hughes with maybe Mourinho in the off season. surprised that he kept faith in hughes and let him spend so much dosh on Etoo, Tevez, Roque and Barry.</p>
