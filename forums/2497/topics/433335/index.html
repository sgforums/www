              <p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Arsenal have launched a club record £18m bid for Valencia midfielder Juan Mata as Arsene Wenger finally prepared to open the chequebook.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>With their Barclays Premier League title rivals having already strengthened since the transfer window re-opened, the Gunners are now planning their own summer spending spree - beginning with the capture of the Spanish Under 21 star.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Club officials spoke to the 23-year-old’s agent and father - also Juan - with Mata now happy to discuss his future with the European Under 21 Championships complete.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Skilful Mata can play in central midfield or on the left wing and was also part of Spain’s 2010 World Cup winning squad - making one 20-minute substitute appearance against Honduras in the group stages. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>His eye for goal and assists are why Wenger is willing to smash the club’s current transfer record - £13m for Russian star Andrey Arshavin - to bring the Spaniard to the Emirates.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Former Real Madrid youth player Mata was one of the stars of Spain’s victorious Under 21 side in Denmark, scoring two goals in the tournament, and has been identified by Wenger as the man to help ease the blow of Cesc Fabregas’ increasingly inevitable departure to Barcelona.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Reports in Spain on Sunday evening suggested that Fabregas, currently on holiday in Ibiza with Barca's Carles Pulyol and Gerard Piquet, will refuse to return to Arsenal for pre-season training on July 5.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But Wenger may have to act fast to head off Barcelona and Manchester City — who are also vying with Chelsea to sign Udinese and Chile winger Alexis Sanchez — and Liverpool.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The Gunners boss must also be alarmed that Inter Milan have moved to hijack Arsenal’s move for Argentinian playmaker Ricky Alvarez.</span></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>And new Inter Milan boss Gian Piero Gasperini has targeted Alvarez as his first signing after tabling an official bid for the £12million-rated man, who is also target for Palermo, Roma and Malaga.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">An Arsenal source today told Standard Sport that the club are confident of beating </span><a class="inform" title="More on Manchester City FC..." href="http://sgforums.com/standard/related-17663-manchester-city-fc.do"><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester City</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> and </span><a class="inform" title="More on Tottenham Hotspur FC..." href="http://sgforums.com/standard/related-10887-tottenham-hotspur-fc.do"><span style="color: #000000;">Tottenham</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> to land the </span><a class="inform" title="More on England..." href="http://sgforums.com/standard/related-144782-england.do"><span style="color: #000000;">England</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> centre-back.</span></p>
              <p>It had appeared City were set to win the race for his signature but Cahill is thought to be uncertain he would be guaranteed regular first-team football at City and is instead keen on a move to <span style="color: #000000;">Emirates Stadium</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></p>
              <p>The club are also close to an agreement for Gervinho after Lille demanded more money at the 11th hour. Arsenal thought they had agreed a £10.5m fee but the French club insisted on add-ons to bring the deal to £14m. The Gunners have now bid £12m.</p>

              <p>The multi-millionaire businesswoman claims they are past their sell-by date and need an injection of dynamism.</p>
              <p>Writing on Twitter, she said: "I agree the board should go. They're passe, have nothing to give."</p>
              <p>The current Gunners board has a combined age of 400 years, comprising Hill-Wood, 75, Stan Kroenke, 63, chief executive Ivan Gazidis, 46, and non-executive directors Ken Friar, 76, Sir Chips Kewsick, 71, and Lord Harris of Peckham, 69.</p>
              <p>Bracewell-Smith added: "In time we'll need a more dynamic, pro-active, younger board and a good directorial leadership."</p>
              <p>The Indian-born business woman inherited her 15.9 per cent stake in the club from her husband's father, former Arsenal director Sir Guy Bracewell-Smith.</p>
              <p>But she was forced off the board in December 2008 following a dispute with her fellow directors.</p>
              <p>She sold her 9,893 Arsenal shares to Kroenke for £123million in April, allowing the American to take control.</p>
              <p>But now she claims: "They couldn't handle a woman with power on the board. Male chauvinism."</p>
              <p>She was part of the boardroom lockdown agreement which forced David Dein out in 2007 over his support for Alisher Usmanov's failed takeover bid.</p>
              <p>Bracewell-Smith, who now backs Dein's contribution, also warned Arsenal are losing their fight to keep Cesc Fabregas.</p>
              <p>She said: "He wants out. You can't keep someone whose heart isn't in it."</p>

              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">Despite suggestions Everton left-back Leighton Baines could be Eastlands-bound, <em>Sportsmail</em> understands Clichy is Roberto Mancini's preferred choice for one of City's problem positions and that a deal is close.</span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">With key midfielders Cesc Fabregas and Sami Nasri also heading out of the Emirates, it leaves Arsene Wenger under greater pressure than at any tme in his Arsenal reign.</span></p>

              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">The saga of Fabregas' return to Barcelona may at last be drawing to a close, after an improved offer from the European champions, while Nasri looks increasingly likely to complete a controversial move to Old Trafford.</span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">As revealed in <em>Sportmail</em>, contract rebel Nasri has overtaken Tottenham's Luka Modric and Inter Milan playmaker Wesley Sneijder as Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson's prime target for the attacking midfield role vacated by the retired Paul Scholes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">Wenger faces a dilemma over the France midfielder, who refuses to renew a contract that has just 12 months to run and is believed to be keen on the idea of bolstering United's attacking options.</span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">The Arsenal boss would rather sell to the likes of Inter Milan, than one of his main Barclays Premier League rivals, but is mindful he is in danger of losing Nasri for nothing this time next year.</span></p>
              <p><em><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">Sportsmail </span></em><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">understands he will attempt to deter United with a £15m asking price but that Ferguson will meet it to add Nasri's flair to his other recent signings, Aston Villa winger Ashley Young, Blackburn centre-back Phil Jones and Atletico Madrid keeper David de Gea.</span></p>
              <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black">Clichy also looks bound for Manchester, as Mancini pepares to kick-start his summer recruitment drive.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Chelsea are about to add further misery to Arsenal's summer by launching a bid for Theo Walcott. With the unsettled Samir Nasri heading to Manchester City along with Gael Clichy, and Cesc Fabregas looking certain to join Barcelona, the loss of a fourth key player would be a body blow at the Emirates.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But the bad news has not stopped manager Arsene Wenger committing his future to the club, as he insisted he was trying hard to bring in new players.</span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Frenchman, who came in for criticism last week as the prospect of losing midfielders Fabregas and Nasri and defender Clichy grew more likely, urged Gunners fans to be patient over the club's transfer strategy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I'm very happy at Arsenal,' said Wenger. 'One sign of intelligence in life is to not always to want what you don't have. Appreciate what you have.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Everyone is on standby at the moment, keeping their cards close to their chests, and waiting for someone to make the first move. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Everyone wants to make that great signing and I'm focused on those objectives and am very busy on the telephone.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Some of those calls may need to be made to Walcott over the coming days. The winger, who has an uneasy relationship with Wenger mainly because he feels he has not been given the first-team opportunities the new year and paid the price in the final sprint. We also had players like Fabregas and Robin van Persie out injured for a long time.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I enjoy conditions every coach dreams of. I'll be eternally grateful to my club because I work with a philosophy and freedom that I like.'</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He added: 'I have contacts with the shareholders at Paris because I work with them outside of football.

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Wenger, who seems certain to take Bolton defender Gary Cahill to the club, again hit out at the big spenders who buy beyond their means.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'We work like everyone should, with a balance between revenue and expenditure,' he said. 'When this is not the case, it puts a club in danger. We try to combine three factors: a style of play, sensible management and human qualities.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">So it's hard to understand why we are criticised. Because we did not win? Yes, that's true, there were stronger teams than us. But we have not been out of the top four for 15 years and, for me, the true value of a team is consistency.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Wenger added that a desire to compete on all fronts last season is what cost Arsenal a trophy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He said: 'We came close to winning the title but we may have been too greedy because we tried to win everything and, in the end, we were a bit short physically. We played 27 games over three months around the new year and paid the price in the final sprint. We also had players like Fabregas and Robin van Persie out injured for a long time.</span></p>

              <p><strong>With left-back Gael Clichy expected to complete his £7m move to Manchester City in the next 24 hours, the Gunners could be considered close to implosion as a queue of high-profile players builds up at the Emirates' departure lounge.</strong></p>
              <p>Though Fabregas and Nasri are both due to return to north London this Monday, their appearances could be fleeting. The Spaniard is set to undergo fitness tests to determine whether he can start pre-season training on Tuesday as the Gunners continue to play hardball in talks with Barcelona, while the Frenchman is due to meet Arsene Wenger for last-ditch showdown talks on his future. However, the player is reputedly determined to quit the club and move to Manchester in order to join either United or City.</p>
              <p>The Daily Mirror claims 'there is a growing feeling that Arsenal will sell Nasri - with both Manchester clubs keen - rather than let him run down his contract', while Nasri's comments to a French magazine over the weekend, in which he stressed his desire for trophies rather than money, have only fuelled the expectation that he will leave Arsenal before the season starts.</p>
              <p>As for Fabregas, his long-anticipated return to Barcelona should finally be completed in the coming days.</p>
              <p>'Fábregas, who has been on holiday in Spain, will return with the bulk of the senior squad on Tuesday, with Barcelona still attempting to complete what they hope will be a £35m transfer back to the club,' reports The Guardian. 'A bid of around £27m was rejected earlier in the summer but having received an improved offer last week, there is an acceptance at Arsenal that the long-running saga of their captain's future is nearing a conclusion.</p>
              <p>'The player himself was quoted last week as being "calm and optimistic" about his future. While the 24-year-old privately anticipates that he will be granted his wish to join the Catalan club where he started his career, he is not expected to risk his reputation at Arsenal by refusing to report back for training and will instead hope resolution is reached in negotiations before the Gunners depart for a mini-tour of Malaysia and China a week on Sunday.'</p>
              <p>For Arsenal supporters, braced for a 6.5% increase in the cost of season tickets, one crumb of comfort is the thought that the club's coffers, already thought to hold £40m for transfers, will soon be swelled by an additional £70m. However, as The Independent points out, 'Arsenal are well aware that they are likely to be quoted inflated prices for players if they sell Clichy, Fabregas and Nasri in quick succession, meaning they would ideally like to reinforce their squad before losing players.'</p>
              <p>The anger that is bound to be sparked by the departures of Nasri and Fabregas will hardly be quelled if, as announced by The Daily Mirror, Wenger opts to respond by launching a bid for Kevin Doyle, a striker who has scored 14 goals in 59 appearances since Wolves' return to the top flight.</p>
              <p>There will also be widespread bafflement if Arsenal sanction the departures of three established first-teamers in Clichy, Fabregas and Nasri whilst retaining the raft of deadwood in their bloated squad. Hitherto, the Gunners have failed to offload any of the likes of Sebastien Squillaci, Denilson, Abou Diaby, Tomas Rosicky, Carlos Vela and Nicklas Bendtner.</p>
              <p>Arsene, it's over to you.</p>
