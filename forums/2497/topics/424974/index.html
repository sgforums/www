              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger was left counting the emotional and physical cost of Saturday’s defeat as defender Johan Djourou was ruled out for the season with a dislocated shoulder.</strong></p>
              <p>Arsenal crashed out of their third cup competition in 13 days at Old Trafford and Wenger’s mood was worsened by the sight of Djourou being given oxygen as he was carried off on a stretcher.</p>
              <p>He was caught accidentally by his own team-mate Bacary Sagna in a goalmouth scramble 10 minutes from the end of the game and fell awkwardly on to his shoulder.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wenger said: ‘We have lost Djourou now for the rest of the season and it will be difficult for us. It is a dislocated shoulder.’</p>
              <p>Arsenal’s season is unravelling fast after being talked about as contenders for a unique Quadruple.</p>
              <p>Since then, they have been beaten by Birmingham City in the Carling Cup final and were knocked out of the Champions League at Barcelona. They still have the Premier League title to chase, currently lying second to Manchester United, and Wenger said: ‘I believe that we can do it but it’s a good test for us now to show that we can regroup.</p>

              <p><strong>‘I am very disappointed that we lost three big challenges in a very strange way. One was in the last minute to a goal that came from nowhere [Carling Cup], one was under strange circumstances in Barcelona and now this. We weren’t outplayed but we were punished by a team that was more clinical than us.’</strong></p>
              <p>Wenger’s problems are exaggerated by the fact his most experienced central defender, Thomas Vermaelen, is also currently out injured.</p>
              <p>One better piece of news for Arsenal was the long-awaited return of midfielder Aaron Ramsey. He came on as a substitute at Old Trafford yesterday for his first Arsenal appearance since an horrific broken leg at Stoke City 13 months ago.</p>

              Arsenal boost as Swiss FA claim Johan Djourou could be fit within a fortnight
              
              
              
              
              
              Arsenal have been handed an unexpected boost by the announcement from the Swiss FA that defender Johan Djourou may yet be fit enough to play a part in the Gunners title charge. 
              
              The centre-back, who has been outstanding for the Gunners this term, was ruled out for the season on Saturday with a dislocated shoulder picked up during Arsenal's demoralising FA Cup defeat to Manchester United. 
              
              Immediately after the game manager Arsene Wenger said there was no chance the 24-year-old would play any part in the final 10 games of the campaign.
              
              However in a release on their website, the Swiss FA have revealed every effort is being made to get Djourou fit for his country's key Euro 2012 clash against Bulgaria on March 26. 
              
              The release said: 'The shoulder injury to Johan Djourou is less serious than feared on Saturday and announced by the coach of his club.
              
              'The Arsenal defender and member of the Switzerland national team was submitted to thorough medical examinations on Monday. At the end of a long exhausting day, Johan Djourou had new hope that.... his season is not over yet.'
              
              The Swiss FA report that Djourou suffered no fractures or injury to the bones.
              
              The Gunners star fell awkwardly in a collision with team-mate Bacary Sagna in the latter stages of the match as Arsenal crashed out of their third cup competition in the space of two weeks.
              
              On Sunday Djourou seemed to suggest that he was making good progress. Using the social networking site Twitter, he wrote: 'Many thanks for all your wishes. I am feeling today a little bit better,' followed by, 'I have to wait and see how my shoulder is progressing. I will keep you updated.'
              
              The player missed virtually the entire 2009/10 campaign following knee surgery but has returned to be Arsenal's most consistent performer in a back four beset by problems. 
              
              Thomas Vermaelen has missed the majority of the campaign with a long-standing achilles problem, while new signings Laurent Koscielny and Sebastien Squillaci have failed to justify their place in the team on more than one occasion.
