              <h1>Sagna open to Madrid move</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/arsenal/sagna_back.jpg" alt="" width="476" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>Arsenal right back Bacary Sagna has opened the door to a transfer to Real Madrid.</strong></p>
              <p>French sources have claimed that the Merengues are about to launch a
                  £20 million bid to capture The Gunners’ first-choice right back.</p>
              <p>While Real president Florentino Perez is building an impressive
                  squad of Galacticos, the player has positively reacted to the rumour
                  and has refused to reject the possibility that he will head to the
                  Santiago Bernabeu.</p>
              <p>After
                  Emmanuel Eboue, who has hinted that he would ask to join a foreign club
                  if he was not offered more game time in North London, Sagna is the second Arsenal full back that has refused to commit himself to the club.</p>
              <p>“I am surprised by this news, but I wouldn’t turn my back on it,” Sagna told Aujourd’hui Sport.</p>
              <p>“I fully intended to come back [in pre-season training] with Arsenal, but I’m going to see [what happens].”</p>
              <p>Former Auxerre star Sagna, 26, joined the Premier League giants in
                  summer 2007 after being voted right back of the season in the French
                  league, and he claimed the same award after his debut season in England.</p>

              <p><strong>Emmanuel Eboue has hinted that he could hand in a transfer request if he is not offered more game time at Arsenal.</strong></p>
              <p>The Ivory Coast international has grown frustrated by his lack of
              starts at Emirates Stadium last season, with the right back and
              midfielder considered as a utility player by Arsene Wenger.</p>
              <p>The 26-year-old joined The Gunners in January 2005 and slowly imposed himself as a first-team player in North London.</p>
              <p>Eboue, who still appeared 28 times in the league this term, has been
              linked to Serie A giants Inter this season, and he has issued an
              ultimatum to his employers.</p>
              <p>“[Leaving] would be hard, but I think experiencing another season
              like this one would be even harder, spending more time away from the
              pitch,” Eboue told France-Football.</p>
              <p>“At the end of the day, if I leave Arsenal, I will move to another
              league because playing somewhere else in England is out of question.”</p>

              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Arsenal full-back Bacary Sagna
              has distanced himself from reports linking him with Real Madrid and
              says he is "100% committed" to the Gunners.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The defender was quoted in
              the French press as "not against the idea" of a switch to the Bernabeu
              as part of new president Florentino Perez's revolution.</p>
              <p>However, the 26-year-old France international, who joined the
              Gunners in the summer of 2007, maintains he has no intentions of
              leaving the Emirates Stadium.</p>
              <p>"I have seen the quotes attributed to me in the French media
              today and I just want to put the record straight," Sagna said in a
              statement.</p>
              <p>"These comments are not accurate and I am not aware of any
              speculation linking me to another club. I am 100% committed to Arsenal.
              This is a great club and I am proud to wear the shirt.</p>
              <p>"I am looking forward to returning for pre-season training in July and preparing for the challenges that next season will bring.</p>
              <p>"We have a great squad of players at the club and I know that we
              can achieve something together at Arsenal, my focus is nowhere else."</p>

              <p>eboue can be sold.</p>
              <p>if i am sagna, i would stay arsenal at least another 2 years to establlish himself.</p>
              <p>i dont think real will field him as first team player. he will end up like helb, flamini as bench players in those big clubs with deep reserves.</p>
