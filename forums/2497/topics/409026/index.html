              <p><strong>Jose Mourinho has dismissed the chances of </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool </strong></span></a><strong>or </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Arsenal</strong></span></a><strong> being crowned Barclays Premier League champions this season.</strong></p>
              <p>The former <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea </span></a>boss is predicting a three-way battle between his old employers and Manchester rivals City and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">United</span></a>.</p>
              <p>The Blues sit top after two games with the Gunners, City and United just behind. </p>
              <p>'I believe Chelsea, Man United and Man City, that's it,' Mourinho said. </p>
              <p>Liverpool have just one point after crashing 3-0 at Eastlands on Monday night and Mourinho does not expect things to get much better for the Anfield outfit.</p>
              <p>He said: 'It's very difficult for (new Liverpool manager) Roy Hodgson as over the last three years they have been getting worse, worse and worse. He needs time.'</p>
              <p>'The Liverpool of 2004 was better than the Liverpool of 2005 and the 2005 [team] was better than 2006. </p>
              <p>'It is very difficult for Roy to make Liverpool champions.I think he needs time and it’s not easy because I don’t think that the club went in the right direction and I don’t think Arsenal too. </p>
              <p>'Year after year it looks like [success], but no, looks like, but no. Always the same type of comment, ‘it’s a young team’, ‘it will be next season’.</p>

              <p><strong>'I remember when we [Chelsea] played them [Arsenal] in a Carling Cup semi-final when they played the ‘team of young boys’.</strong> </p>
              <p>'The ‘team of young boys’ is not any more the team of young boys now, they are the team of 25, 26, 27-year-olds. </p>
              <p>'So [Cesc] Fabregas, [Theo] Walcott, [Gael] Clichy, [Alex] Song, [Bacary] Sagna, they are not any more a team of young kids, they are a team in the age to win things. </p>
              <p>'But I do not think they will do it.  I think it will again be Man United, Chelsea and of course Man City, because they have a great squad.'</p>
              <p>Real Madrid manager Mourinho admitted he was blown away by City's spending power this summer as Roberto Mancini beat the Spanish giants to the signing of Serbia full-back Aleksander Kolarov.</p>
              <p>Kolarov joined City last month for £16million as part of another remarkable summer of team strengthening which has seen their Middle East owners splash out more than £120m.</p>
              <p>And Mourinho, who joined Madrid after leading Inter Milan to a domestic and European treble last season, concedes even they can't compete. </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>'I understand that if someone wants to compete with them for a player it is very difficult, they are dominant in the market,' he said.</strong></p>
              <p>'The player they say they want is the player they get. 'I was interested in Kolarov when I came here but I couldn't compete with them as they went to values that I couldn't.</p>
              <p>'If they have the money they can do it, if they have the ambition to win the Premier League they can do it.'  </p>
              <p>Mourinho will keep a close eye on former Inter Milan striker Mario Balotelli's progress at Eastlands.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>The Italy striker left the San Siro in a £23m move and Mourinho said: 'I had some problem because he is a kid and because a coach always wants to educate a kid and always wants a kid to go in the right direction - it’s like at home with a son.</strong> </p>
              <p>'Mario has incredible potential, he has every football quality to adapt to the Premiership, he has all the conditions to succeed, he’s a boy with a lot of potential. </p>
              <p>'[Roberto] Mancini knows him very, very well, that’s why he bought him. Now it’s time for him to grow up as a person, more stability in his life, more stability in his private life and to understand, like I was teaching him every day, that a boy of 19, 20 years old has a lot to learn and that he is not the end product. </p>
              <p>'If he goes in the right direction he can be a great success in English football.  But it depends on him, the people that surround him and people that have to help him and not make his life more difficult.'</p>
