              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Real Madrid</span></abbr> signing <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Cristiano Ronaldo</span></abbr> says he would only return to England for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Of United's fans, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Ronaldo</span></abbr> told the <em>News of the World</em>:
              "I really could not have asked for any more from them. There were times
              when the whole of England was against me but they stood strong in their
              support and belief for me.</p>
              <p>"While opposition fans' hate made me stronger, the love of the United support also made me stronger.</p>
              <p>"I just want to say thank you for all their support. I will
              never forget them and I hope I have given them memories that will
              always be with them."</p>
              <p>And if that doesn't appease those who wished him only good
              riddance, then a belated declaration of loyalty might. A declaration
              that even hints at the possibility of a return.</p>
              <p>He said: "It would not feel right to play for anybody else in England apart from <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr>. They have been my home for so long and it would feel like I was cheating if I played for anybody else."</p>

              <p>United fans should reflex and realised that he has done very well for them and not act or feel bitter about him leaving now... He is already a legend in United's history... and no one can take that away... He could have left 3 yrs ago at a much cheaper price but he stayed back year after year even till last season when he could have left but because of Fergie and the club he stayed back... During this period, United has won many titles mostly with his form... He is also United's and English League's only Fifa Player of the year to date...</p>
              <p>Its time he moved on... I have already said earlier, the amount they are willing to pay for him is too good to refuse... From the club's point and from his personal side as well, the pay and security he would have for the next 6 years, any player would want given their short career in football... For all we know, he may never rediscover his 2008 form again or he may have another 2 or 3 yrs at the excellent level, before being in the good level at best...</p>
              <p>So, compare to Tevez whom some United fans seem to think much better of, is really a perception problem... Ask yourself who have done more for United? Ronaldo has stayed back year after year till next season when a world record fee and a world record salary which benefit both club and player that he leave for a boyhood dream club... He has never mentioned any other club since his time there... only one as it was his parents and his own dream to be playing there at one point of his career...</p>
              <p>Compare to Tevez... Who have been saying he love this, he love that, and wants to stay, he wants to stay, But now that there are other interested clubs offering not even a world record salary, but just a little more only, and he leave... Its not that United have not agree the same transfer fee, its on the table... and if all along he has been saying was any truth, it doesn't matter when it was made... The fact is they have given him a choice from the start of this month, simple as that... And I am glad they redrew their offer 10 days before the deadline as he wans't worth it.</p>
              <p>So I rather Ronaldo as he was more truthful all along than Tevez... I see a pattern in Tevez's ways... He seems to also have said the same thing with the West Ham fans... Then now with the United fans and I won't be surprise it he does it with the City or Blues fans as well... The guy is that type that wants to be like and would say things just to be like...</p>
              <p>Ronaldo's was a much more direct style... Some people probably can't take it, but it was more truthful than playing to the galleries like Tevez...</p>

              <p><span class="news_story_title"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span class="news_story_title"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Cristiano Ronaldo</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span> world soccer’s Player of the Year, was sold by Manchester United to Real Madrid for a world record 80 million pounds ($131 million) as the Spanish team mounts a challenge to archrival Barcelona.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span class="news_story_title">
              </span></p><p>United said it accepted the unconditional offer for the Portuguese star. The move should be completed by the end of June.</p>
              <p>The 24-year-old Ronaldo’s transfer would break the record fee that Real Madrid President <span style="color: #000000;">Florentino Perez</span><span style="color: #000000;"> paid in his previous term when he signed </span><span style="color: #000000;">Zinedine Zidane</span><span style="color: #000000;"> for 75.1 million euros ($105 million) in 2001. Two days ago, Perez completed the signing of </span><span style="color: #000000;">Kaka</span><span style="color: #000000;"> from</span> AC Milan for what media reports said was 68 million euros as he began his quest to rebuild a team overshadowed by archrival Barcelona last season.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Real Madrid confirmed it made an offer to buy Ronaldo and said it hoped to reach an agreement with the player “in the coming days.” It didn’t give any financial figures. He was named as the world’s best player in 2008 in a poll of national team coaches and captains by governing body FIFA.</p>
              <p>Madrid spokesman Luis Villarejo wasn’t available to comment on a public holiday.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ballon d’Or</strong></span></p>
              <p>Perez is set to break the record transfer fee for a Portuguese forward who scored 42 goals to lift Manchester United to the 2008 Champions League and Premier League titles. He added another 26 goals last season as United retained the English title and reached the Champions League final. He’s scored <span style="color: #000000;">118 times</span> in more than 290 appearances for United.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo, who also won the 2008 Ballon d’Or, moved to United from Sporting Lisbon for 12.2 million pounds in 2003. He has been quoted as saying he would like to join Real Madrid in reports over the past two seasons.</p>
              <p>Perez signed Kaka -- the 2007 World Player of the Year -- eight days after starting his second term as president. He had told Spanish media he would also like to sign other players <span style="color: #000000;">including </span><span style="color: #000000;">Ronaldo</span><span style="color: #000000;">. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The record nine-time European champion agreed to pay Milan the then second-highest fee for Brazil playmaker Kaka, according to media reports. Neither Madrid nor Milan disclosed financial terms of 27-year-old Kaka’s six-year contract. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Ronaldo will get almost 10 million euros a season for six years, according to Spain’s</span><span style="color: #000000;"> El Mundo</span> newspaper.</p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>$175 Million Boost</strong></p>
              <p>Between 2000 and 2006, Perez oversaw the signings of<span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #000000;">David Beckham</span><span style="color: #000000;">, Zidane and other big names known as “galacticos,” who drove marketing income and turned the team into the biggest in the world by sales, according to Deloitte LLP, even as it failed to win a trophy in three straight seasons. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The signings of Kaka and Ronaldo may bring in about $175 million a year from the sale of replica shirts and merchandise, sponsorship revenue and increased ticket sales, according to </span><span style="color: #000000;">Simon Chadwick</span><span style="color: #000000;">, a professor of sport business strategy and marketing at England’s Coventry University</span>. The research was done for Weber Shandwick Sport, a London-based sports marketing consultant.</p>

              <p><strong>Second Stint</strong></p>
              <p>Real Madrid suggested Beckham’s stay at the Santiago Bernabeu brought in $600 million in sales of shirts and other goods alone, increasing merchandising profits by 137 percent over four seasons between 2003-04 and 2006-07 before his departure to the Los Angeles Galaxy, according to Forbes magazine.</p>
              <p>Barcelona won last season’s Champions League, Spanish title and Spanish Cup. Real Madrid has failed to reach the quarterfinals of the Champions League in each of the past five seasons. Perez appointed Villarrea<span style="color: #000000;">l’s </span><span style="color: #000000;">Manuel Pellegrini</span><span style="color: #000000;"> as coach on June 2. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Perez, the 62-year-old president of Spain’s biggest builder Actividades de Construccion y </span><span style="color: #000000;">Servicios SA</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span> became Real Madrid president for a second time June 1 after no other candidates could raise the required 57 million-euro guarantee to run. In 2006, he quit after the team failed to win a trophy for a third straight season, its longest barren spell in more than half a century.</p>
              <p>During Perez’s first term, the team won the 2002 Champions League final with a volleyed goal by Zidane against Bayer Leverkusen. Perez hired Zidane, who quit playing in 2006, as an adviser last week.</p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>In Debt</strong></p>
              <p>Real Madrid bankrolled player trades by selling the club’s training ground for 500 million euros in 2001. Last month, Perez said Real Madrid would need to borrow money to finance its purchases this time. Madrid had debt of 563 million euros in June 2008, according to its latest published accounts. It had sales of 365.8 million euros for fiscal 2008.</p>

              <h1>Real Madrid Insert €200m Buy-Out Clause In Cristiano Ronaldo Contract - Report</h1>
              <h2>The €94 million man is set to break yet another record, without even touching a football…</h2>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/50413_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="257"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Cristiano Ronaldo</span><span style="color: #000000;"> will soon become the most expensive player in the history of the game when he officially completes his move from </span><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span><span style="color: #000000;"> to </span><span style="color: #000000;">Real Madrid</span>.</strong></p>
              <p>He could also very well become the best-paid player in the world and if he gets things his way when it comes to his image rights, he could one day surpass the commercial myth that is David Beckham to become the richest footballer.</p>
              <p>But for the immediate future, Ronaldo is bound to shatter another record as Los Blancos prepare to include an astronomical buy-out clause in his contract.</p>
              <p>According to <em>AS</em>, club president Florentino Perez will insert a €200 million breakaway clause to his agreement to deter his rivals from pinching the Portuguese away while he is still under contract.</p>
              <p>The paper believes that Perez is aware of the presence of the cash-rich Arab investors in the football world, as he still recalls how Manchester City almost dished out €115m for Kaka back in January and supposedly €150m to lure Iker Casillas away from the Santiago Bernabeu.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo himself, meanwhile, is said to be extremely pleased with the amount as it shows that his new employers regard him as the most valuable player in the transfer market. It will also allow him to beat the only player who can match him today out on the football pitch, Barcelona’s Lionel Messi, who has a €150m buy-out clause.</p>
