While Ramos tried to insist afterwards that there was nothing in it, Defoe - who has scored eight goals so far this season - admitted he had been told by the Tottenham manager that he WAS needed after all.<br><br>And it has emerged since then that Ramos was persuaded to make the U-turn by Comolli the day after the Spaniard decided to give Defoe the boot.<br><br>The news will disappoint Aston Villa boss Martin O'Neill who was keen to sign Defoe.<br><br>But it is an embarrassing situation for Ramos, who yesterday admitted decisions on transfer policy are not his alone to make, even though he does have the power to veto targets put forward by Comolli or chairman Daniel Levy.<br><br>Ramos said: "We evaluate the players as a group, decide whether we are interested in players and make a final decision."<br><br>He claimed recently that he had never heard of Rangers rightback Alan Hutton, even though Tottenham had agreed an Â£8m fee for the player with the Scot tish club. Ramos also revealed he had turned down other players put forward to him by the Spurs board.<br><br>He confirmed: "I already have done on various occasions.<br><br>Maybe six to eight players that I don't like and that aren't right for the team."</div>
