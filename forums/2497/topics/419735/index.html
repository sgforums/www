              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ROY HODGSON has said goodbye to Liverpool's flops.</h2>
              <p>The Anfield boss has not yet been sacked - but gave a farewell speech after Wednesday's 3-1 shock defeat at Blackburn.A Kop insider said: "Roy was very down and emotional.</p>
              <p>"He said things like 'It's been a pleasure working with you all but I'm sure the owners will want me out after this.</p>
              <p>"And he even added 'It's no fun hearing your own fans singing another manager's name every two minutes'."</p>
              <p>That was a clear reference to Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish, who supporters desperately hope will make an emotional comeback for the remainder of the season.</p>
              <p>New Liverpool director of football Damien Comolli will play a major role in choosing Hodgson's replacement.</p>
              <p>It is thought he favours a young coach he can work alongside - and is a huge fan of Porto's 33-year-old rookie Andre Villas-Boas.</p>
              <p>Hodgson is still due to host a Press conference today to preview Sunday's FA Cup clash with arch-rivals Manchester United.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But he is clearly expecting the axe to fall at any moment.</p>
              <p>He has managed only seven wins but racked up nine defeats in his 20 games in charge, with two of the reverses coming at Anfield against Premier League newcomers Blackpool and strugglers Wolves.</p>
              <p>In contrast, Boas is flying high in Portugal with Porto eight points clear at the top of the league and through to the last 32 of the Europa League.</p>

              <p>Roy hodgson left liverpool already....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Roy Hodgson has left Liverpool by mutual consent after a dismal seven months in charge, with Kenny Dalglish taking over as manager for the rest of the season.</p>
              <p>Hodgson had been under pressure for some time and speculation over his future intensified after Wednesday night's 3-1 defeat at Blackburn Rovers.</p>
              <p>The former Fulham boss was expected to face the media on Friday lunchtime ahead of Sunday's FA Cup showdown with Manchester United at Old Trafford, but the club pulled the plug on the scheduled press conference.</p>
              <p>Liverpool face a crucial week, with a trip to Blackpool on Wednesday followed by the Merseyside derby against Everton an Anfield next weekend on the back of the game at United.</p>
              <p>Hodgson had lost the supporters following a run of form which included defeats home defeats to Blackpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers, as well as losses at Newcastle United and Stoke City. Liverpool also suffered an embarrassing Carling Cup defeat to League Two strugglers Northampton Town at Anfield.</p>
              <p>There has long been a clamour for Dalglish, who successfully managed the club to the Double in the 80s and won the Premier League title with Blackburn Rovers in 1995, to replace Hodgson at the helm. While the move is currently on a temporary basis it will be difficult to replace him should he transform Liverpool's fortunes.</p>
              <p>In a statement on the club's website, principal owner John Henry said: "We are grateful for Roy's efforts over the past six months, but both parties thought it in the best interests of the club that he stand down from his position as team manager. We wish him all the best for the future.</p>
              <p>"We are delighted that Kenny Dalglish has agreed to step in and manage the team for Sunday's FA Cup tie at Old Trafford and for the remainder of the season.</p>
              <p>"Kenny was not just a legendary footballer, he was the third of our three most successful managers - three giants. We are extraordinarily fortunate and grateful that he has decided to step in during the middle of this season.''</p>
              <p>Chairman Tom Werner said: "No one who cares for this great club has been happy with the way this season has unfolded and we have examined options and considered at length what is best for us going forward.</p>
              <p>"Kenny will bring considerable experience to the position and provide management and leadership for the rest of the season.''</p>
              <p>Hodgson said of his departure: "Being asked to manage Liverpool Football Club was a great privilege. Any manager would be honoured to manage a club with such an incredible history, such embedded tradition and such an amazing set of fans.</p>
              <p>"Liverpool is one of the great clubs in world football. I have, however, found the last few months some of the most challenging of my career.</p>
              <p>"I am very sad not to have been able to put my stamp on the squad, to be given the time to bring new players into the club in this transfer window and to have been able to be part of the rebuilding process at Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"The club has some great, world-class players, with whom it has been a pleasure to work and I wish the entire squad well for the rest of the season.</p>
              <p>"I thank those with whom I have built up a close working relationship at the club for their loyalty and support during very testing times, and finally of course to the Liverpool fans, your passion and dedication to the club will see Liverpool at the top of the game once more.''</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span><span style="color: #000000;">'s owners New England Sports Ventures finally put an end to manager Roy Hodgson's miserable six months at Anfield in ruthless fashion and immediately installed club legend Kenny Dalglish to take over in the interim. </span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Although Hodgson knew he was on borrowed time after NESV suggested after last week's home defeat to </span><span style="color: #000000;">Wolves</span><span style="color: #000000;"> they were looking for alternatives he probably expected to remain in charge at least for tomorrow's FA Cup third round tie at </span><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span><span style="color: #000000;">. </span></p>
              <p>He even gave an interview to the club's television channel yesterday previewing the game but less than 24 hours after that was aired he had been relieved of his duties.</p>
              <p>Although the club statement said the 63-year-old's departure was by mutual consent there is no doubt the club's American owners pulled the trigger - especially as less than a fortnight ago Hodgson insisted he had no intention of resigning.</p>
              <p>By bringing in Dalglish, widely regarded as the club's best player and their last manager to win the championship in 1990, NESV have bought themselves some time while also immediately getting disgruntled supporters back on side.</p>
              <p>The 59-year-old put his name forward for the permanent job when Benitez left but was overlooked by the previous regime.</p>
              <p>He will now see this as his chance to get the job for good after the end of the season.</p>
              <p>Hodgson was never the fans' first choice as manager and he was certainly not the owners', who completed their £300million takeover three months after Hodgson's July appointment.</p>

              <p><strong>'We are grateful for Roy's efforts over the past six months, but both parties thought it in the best interests of the club that he stand down from his position as team manager,' said principal owner John Henry. </strong></p>
              <p>'We are delighted that Kenny Dalglish has agreed to step in and manage the team for Sunday's FA Cup tie at Old Trafford and for the remainder of the season.</p>
              <p>'Kenny was not just a legendary footballer, he was the third of our three most successful managers - three giants.</p>
              <p>'We are extraordinarily fortunate and grateful that he has decided to step in during the middle of this season.'</p>
              <p>Dalglish has been on holiday in the middle East but is returning today in order to take charge of the side at Old Trafford, where he will renew rivalry with old foe Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p>There are a number of coincidences involved in Dalglish's return.</p>
              <p>His last match in charge was the 4-4 FA Cup fifth round replay draw at Everton 19 years and 11 months ago.</p>
              <p>Dalglish's return to Liverpool management will be in the FA Cup and next weekend they host Everton at Anfield.</p>
              <p>The Scot, for whom the 1989 Hillsborough disaster took a huge personal toll, quit after complaining he felt like his 'head would explode'.</p>
              <p>However, within two weeks of leaving he was already thinking about coming back and now, after stints at <span style="color: #000000;">Blackburn</span><span style="color: #000000;">, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Newcastle</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and </span><span style="color: #000000;">Celtic</span>, he returns to complete unfinished business.</p>
              <p>Dalglish has been involved at the club since being brought back in an ambassadorial capacity by former manager Rafael Benitez a couple of years ago.</p>
              <p>The spectre of his presence at the club has loomed large over Hodgson, who oversaw Liverpool's worst start to a season since 1953/54 - when they were relegated.</p>

              <p><strong>Hodgson failed to win over fans with perceived negative tactics and criticism of supporters and once performances began to go downhill rapidly his days were numbered, as he had to endure the name of Dalglish being chanted at him in recent games.</strong></p>
              <p>In his departing statement the former Fulham boss even suggested he had found the Liverpool job difficult.</p>
              <p>'Being asked to manage Liverpool Football Club was a great privilege,' he said. 'Liverpool is one of the great clubs in world football. I have, however, found the last few months some of the most challenging of my career.</p>
              <p>'I am very sad not to have been able to put my stamp on the squad, to be given the time to bring new players into the club in this transfer window and to have been able to be part of the rebuilding process at Liverpool.</p>
              <p>'The club has some great, world-class players, with whom it has been a pleasure to work and I wish the entire squad well for the rest of the season.</p>
              <p>'I thank those with whom I have built up a close working relationship at the club for their loyalty and support during very testing times, and finally of course to the Liverpool fans, your passion and dedication to the club will see Liverpool at the top of the game once more.'</p>
              <p>Irrespective of his complaints about the depth and quality of the squad - and the fact he has been let down by some of those players - results ultimately cost Hodgson his job.</p>
              <p>'No one who cares for this great club has been happy with the way this season has unfolded and we have examined options and considered at length what is best for us going forward,' said chairman Tom Werner.</p>
              <p>'Kenny will bring considerable experience to the position and provide management and leadership for the rest of the season.'</p>

              <p>When hodgson was at fulham, it was all in  a day's work to win some and lose some. Draw on other days. And he was lauded for that. Liverpool perhaps was too big a shoe for him to fill and moreover, there are lots of unmotivated fat cats there.</p>
              <p>Hodgson imo is still a good manager and he will be back with bang again soon.</p>

              <p>Not a proven winner ? He is Liverpool's 3 best manager in their history &amp; won the league with Blackburn. He might have been out from the game a long time, but i beatca he's still got it in him to save Liverpool this season.. </p>

              <p>Lets see how Kenny Dalglish fare... I am thinking it could go the same way as Gerard Houllier...</p>
              <p>Anyway, a good 6 months for Roy whatever it is as it's being reported that he was paid $7.5 million for getting the sack... Which he would have took 7 yrs to earn at Fulham on a million a year salary... lol...</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/notw/nol_sport/1192075/Hodgsons-hell-ends-with-huge-pay-off-while-new-boss-Dalglish-wanted-four-year-deal.html"><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00224/splash-roy_224797a.jpg" alt="" width="619" height="390"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Hodgson, who signed a three-year contract when he took charge at Anfield last July, admitted that he had found the past few months "some of the most challenging of my career", and added: "I am very sad not to have been able to put my stamp on the squad, to be given the time to bring new players into the club in this transfer window and to have been able to be part of the rebuilding process."</strong></p>
              <p><span>
              </span></p><p>Gérard Houllier, the former Anfield manager now in charge at Aston Villa, said: "Roy was manager of the year last season and he's still a great manager and a fantastic person.</p>
              
              <p><span>Former Liverpool manager under pressure himself at Aston Villa, said Hodgson had been the victim of a 'brutal world', adding: 'If you lose two games you are in the firing line. I feel for him but Kenny has been a friend for a long time, too.'</span></p>
              <p></p>
              <p><span>Henry said of the appointment of Dalglish: 'Kenny was not just a legendary footballer, he was the third of our three most successful managers - three giants. We are extraordinarily fortunate and grateful that he has decided to step in during the middle of this season.' </span></p>
              <p><span>Dalglish is confident he can succeed. In his column for The Mail on Sunday today he says: 'It's true that Fernando has not been as effective for Liverpool this season as in previous years but the team have not had a great season as a whole. I've seen and read the criticism but I don't think he is finished as a top performer, as some would suggest.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I regard him as one of the best strikers in Europe and even in this supposedly disastrous season, he remains Liverpool's top Premier League scorer.'</span> </p>
              <p>The simple pragmatic consideration is that Liverpool cannot afford to see another manager undermined by their own supporters. Just as Hodgson had to go once the Kop turned on him and he began digging deeper holes for himself by questioning the nature of Liverpool's support, so Dalglish had to be tried rather than left looking on from the sidelines to form a focus, intentionally or otherwise, for terrace dissent. It could be argued Liverpool have caved in to fan power and given the objectors what they want: it could also be said the club's owners have called the supporters' bluff.</p>
              <p>Dalglish will either sink or swim, the supporters will be proved right or wrong, and by the end of the season Liverpool ought to be in a position to move on. Friends and supporters of the new manager insist he has not really been away from the game these past 10 years, he has been attending almost every Liverpool match and taking the keenest interest in developments, though these same supporters tend to gloss over Dalglish's past couple of appointments, the less-than-happy experiences at Newcastle and Celtic.</p>
              <p>Liverpool's owners have played a smart card. If nothing else, Liverpool will be playing to full crowds again for the foreseeable future. Dalglish applied for the job in the summer, or at least let it be known he was interested, only for the old owners to reject him in favour of Hodgson. The new owners have gone for the unashamedly populist option.</p>
              <p>Dalglish has Ferguson this afternoon, Ian Holloway on Wednesday and David Moyes next weekend. By the end of his first week he, and everybody else, will have a much clearer idea of how this most dramatic of comebacks will work out.</p>

              <p>Urgency? Pardon me.....but my eyes didn't see much of it. And I could see from last night's game why liverpool just cannot step up a gear. Last night's performance was perfunctory.</p>
              <p>At least three quarters of the team has to be revamped. And I have seen skrtel being turned so many times by opposing players. What's he still doing there??</p>
