              </span></p><p>I see it in a different way honestly. I thought United didn't need to get out of first gear and tried to slow down the game and Pool didn't have any idea of how to make it more pressurized for the team leading by only a goal like we see most teams does during the last 20 mins...</p>
              <p>I can understand the hope of wanting to see Kenny do well, even Steve McMahon was trying his very best to talk up Kenny in the studio, the commentary was still being kind to him. But If anything, I feel there are more darker days ahead... Cos the Pool team last night lack ambition and determination to succeed... Normally in the first game of a new manager, we see the players really trying their best like in the case of Newcastle... They couldn't win and got 2 points in their last 5 matches, then a new manager start, they outplayed themselves and beat Pool 3-1. This is the 'honeymoon' period they call and everyone try to be nice from press to players. But once it's over in 2, 3 weeks... These very same people will no longer be nice, the press especially...</p>
              <p>Though Steve McMahon will still be trying his very best to "find and talk" some positive from a negative outcome to help his old friend... McMahon looked kind of silly with his comments cos Pool as I remember only had one serious shot on target and thats from a free-kick and even then, i thought Kuszczak made a meal out of it...</p>
              <p>I believed had last night been Roy still in charge... You will see him blasting away like Pool players lack ambition, ideas and courage kind of stuff... And why take out Torres? Might as well kept him in and take out another defender since losing 1-0 or 3-0 makes no difference and a half fit Torres is better than any of the other players pool have to bring on kind of stuff... But of course, they are just biased against Roy... I thought Pool's performance against United earlier in the season under Roy was better than last night...</p>
              <p>But there was one similarity though... Joe Cole got a direct red in Roy's first match. Last night Gerrard also got a direct red in Kenny's first match... Rather ironic.</p>
              <p>Now on to "the bet"... lol.</p>
              <p>Seems rather fun... I don't know what position gets you in Europa but I am guessing winning the FA Cup or League Cup and a 5th place finish right? So if I am making another guess, the only way Pool are getting in to the Europa is, if they somehow win the 'Fair play' award or something cos they are out of both cups already right? And Pool will not finish in 5th place in my honest opinion even if they suddenly go out and spend $30m bring in players... Cos under Kenny, they won't go very far...</p>
              <p>The best they can do under Kenny is hope to equal last season's position of 7th for me... Any lower, Rafa would be laughing across the street since he is now staying in Liverpool after getting the sack at Inter... And Pool will have a new manager again next season...</p>

              <p>It's sad to think that liverpool has come to this stage. The players in the last ten minutes were just running into their positions, providing cover and making some tackles....that's all. The lack of drive was hugely apparent.</p>
              <p>Precisely...a new manager shd warrant a much more motivated performance. Seems like king kenny can't do much either; darker days ahead. Better overhaul the entire squad.</p>

              <p>Pardon me but I think the only drive coming out of Liverpool in recent weeks are from Steven Gerrard, which partly explains why United did not even shift up a gear to kill off the game, played crap football and still managed to qualify for the next round.</p>
              <p>And the worst part is Gerrard is hitting the 30s, who else in Liverpool is fit to wear the Captain's armband?</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">you look at sunderland/bolton/newcastle team sheet and how many do you consider to be good enough for the teams you mentioned?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">they are also in 6th, 7th &amp; 8th now</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">so it's quite obvious the underlying problem is roy and liverpool needed to change manager to progress</p>
