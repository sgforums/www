BluesÂ’ 1-0 win over Manchester United made it an FA and Carling Cup double. But the board are Â“disappointedÂ” and believe Mourinho had enough resources to win the Champions League. They also want to see their side play more attractive football.</strong><br><br>Mourinho is set to stay as boss, despite causing a stir by missing Saturday nightÂ’s FA Cup party. But he will not get a penny of Roman AbramovichÂ’s millions to bolster his squad. The Blues boss wanted Benni McCarthy from Blackburn but was told the board would not pay the Â£8million asking price.<br><br>Instead, Sport can reveal Mourinho is limited to bringing in three players this summer. Bayern Munich striker Claudio Pizarro and Reading midfielder Steve Sidwell are available on frees while PSVÂ’s Brazil defender Alex will cost a nominal fee.<br><br>Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon admitted: Â“I doubt weÂ’ll have big-name signings because I donÂ’t think we need it.Â” Â“WeÂ’re in the region of moving three out and bringing three or four in. WeÂ’re looking for cover.Â” Mourinho was hugged by chief executive Peter Kenyon and chairman Bruce Buck at Wembley. Yet only last month Kenyon was talking to Jurgen Klinsmann about taking over.<br><br>Asked if Mourinho will stay, Kenyon said: Â“He has said that and we have said that, so there shouldnÂ’t be any more to say.Â” Mourinho missed SaturdayÂ’s celebrations after flying home to his family in Portugal. Owner Red Rom also snubbed the bash Â— although he did go to ChelseaÂ’s dressing room to congratulate the players for the first time since Christmas.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>CHELSEA last night cut Jose Mourinho's Wembley celebrations short by warning him that the two cups he bagged this season - and the style in which he won them - is not good enough. Didier Drogba's last-gasp Wembley winner allowed Mourinho a stay of execution at Stamford Bridge - he has been given one more year to deliver what Roman Abramovich wants.</strong><br><br>Abramovich ended his six-month stand-off by visiting the Chelsea players in their dressing-room - for the first time in 2007 - following their Wembley triumph. But as the club broke years of tradition by having no victory parade at Stamford Bridge yesterday, it became clear that the Blues board are unimpressed with the consolation silverware Mourinho has won.<br><br>The Chelsea hierarchy believe the season has been "disappointing for two reasons: failure in the two major competitions and the uninspiring football the Blues play. Although Mourinho insists he and Abramovich are "not enemies", the manager has been told in no uncertain terms that he must do much better next term if he is to have any chance of hanging on to his job for a fifth season. The failure of chief executive Peter Kenyon - acting on Abramovich's instructions - to find a suitable replacement for Mourinho has given the most successful manager in the history of the club a final chance to show he can deliver the big prizes in style.<br><br>Mourinho, who shared hugs with both Kenyon and chairman Bruce Buck in the Royal Box after lifting the FA Cup into the air on Saturday, said: "I have three years of relations with Mr Buck and Mr Kenyon. I look on them as honourable people and not liars. "When they say publicly and to me that I am going to be Chelsea manager next season I have no reason to doubt them. "If the club are not happy with me, I think I will be the first one to know. As I keep saying, it's the best place to work in football. That's why I want to stay."<br><br>Kenyon did officially concede there had been problems between Abramovich and Mourinho when he said: "It's been a difficult year for all sorts of reasons. Now we just want to draw a line under everything and move on." That may not be easy, with the chief executive insisting neither Andriy Shevchenko or Michael Ballack would be sold and saying that while he expected three or four arrivals at Stamford Bridge this summer, none would be big-money signings.<br><br>Chelsea, though, are reluctant to put further improved offers on the table. The club's claim that Lampard has rejected a British record Â£7million-per-year offer has been bitterly refuted by the England midfielder's representatives, while Terry is not happy with a Â£115,000-per-week offer. Chelsea feel that Terry has nowhere to go and will stay, but have serious fears that Wembley will prove to be Lampard's final game in a Blues shirt.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>greed never ends. even if they win quadruple.. the board will still want them to repeat the quadruple the following year and maybe add some new cups like world club cup and uefa super cup...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The board have high expectations and you can't blame them when they have spent money like they had, they expect to be winning the top prize like the League Title and the Champions League... Winning 3rd and 4th prize isn't something they will be proud about or consider a succes at all.<br><br>If Pool go on and win the CL this wed, they will probably wonder how did Pool manage to do that when they spent lesser than one quarter of what they spent...<br><br>And i guess it does not help when Jorge Valdano described their football as "it's a s*** hanging from a stick" ... It probably made Roman unhappy, Roman wants to win and win playing pretty football.<br><br>Probably the only reason jose is still there could be because Klinsmann turned down the job offer... So is seems Jose is still there by default.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br><strong>JOSE GIVEN ONE MORE YEAR?<br><br>Jose Mourinho will get one more year to deliver more trophies and more entertaining football, according to reports. The Chelsea boss has been given a reluctant vote of confidence by the Stamford Bridge board, who will not back him with cash this summer. </strong><br><br>The Sun says that 'the board are "disappointed" and believe Mourinho had enough resources to win the Champions League. They also want to see their side play more attractive football'. Mourinho apparently wants to buy Blackburn striker Benni McCarthy but will be told that the Â£8m asking price is too steep.<br><br>He will instead by limited to free transfers Steve Sidwell and Bayern Munich striker Claudio Pizarro, while Alex will be recalled from his loan spell at PSV to be the cover they desperately need in central defence. if Mourinho fails to deliver the Champions League, or at least the Premiership, next season, his reign will come to an end after four tumultuous years.</div>
