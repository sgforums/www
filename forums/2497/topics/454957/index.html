              congrats to spain and well done, italy.
              
              from this tournament i noticed balotolli is way over-rated.  he cant create chance for himself.  he doesnt run into good positions often enough.  he cant pass properly.
              
              italy looked tired yesterday.

              Football: Torres wins Golden Boot award at Euro 2012
              
              KIEV: Spanish striker Fernando Torres won the Golden Boot award for top scorer at Euro 2012 edging out Germany's Mario Gomez, UEFA announced on Monday.
              
              The 28-year-old - whose goal in the 4-0 win over Italy in the final made him the only player to score in two Euro finals - like Gomez scored three goals and provided one assist during the tournament.
              
              However, UEFA gave it to him on the tiebreak of having had less game time during the finals, the Spaniard having had 189 minutes on the pitch compared to Gomez's 280.
              
              Four other players also ended up with three goals, Italian striker Mario Balotelli, Portuguese captain Cristiano Ronaldo, rising Russian star Alan Dzagoev and one of the revelations of the tournament, Croatia's Mario Mandzukic.
              
              For Torres it sees him complete an incredible latter part of the 2011/12 season where he also collected FA Cup and Champions League winners medals with Chelsea having been all but written off for the majority of the campaign as he failed to fire for the English club.
              
              However, there was to be a let down for the former Atletico Madrid and Liverpool star as he missed out on being named in the 23-man squad of the championship named by UEFA later on Monday.
              
              While he came on as a substitute during the final - he also set up Juan Mata for the fourth and final goal - rightback Alvaro Arbeloa was the only one of the starting XI against Italy who failed to make the UEFA squad.

              winning the FA cup and CL with chelsea.  and now this.
              
              what a joke!!

              someone on goal.com suggested the golden boots be awarded to the best player of the tournament.
              
              i feel there is some logic to it.
              
              why should the top scorer be given the golden boots?  surely players of other position can be the best as well.
              
              the top scorer in this euro is torres.  he does not deserve the golden boots at all.
              
              fifa didnt even include him in the players of the tournament.
