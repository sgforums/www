            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.teamtalk.com//Images/66058.jpg"><br><br><strong>France coach Raymond Domenech has hit back at Arsene Wenger following the Arsenal manager's claims that Les Bleus are to blame for Thierry Henry's injury-ravaged campaign. Gunners captain Henry was last week ruled out for the rest of the season with stomach and groin problems. </strong><br><br>That prompted Wenger to suggest the striker had been badly managed by France since the World Cup, insisting there was no need for the player to feature in so many friendly matches for his country. But Domenech has reacted by saying his football federation have looked after Henry in the correct way.<br><br>"Mr Wenger is starting to seriously tire me out, and he is starting to tire out a lot of people," said the France coach, following the announcement of his squad to play Lithuania and Austria in a double-header later this month. "He doesn't have innate knowledge. There comes a moment when enough is enough. "When he says that a player who played in August injures himself (as a result) in March, I do not understand how he can explain that.<br><br>"He is forgetting to say that each time Thierry Henry played a match for France, three days later he played for Arsenal. "He has never been injured in matches for France. We have never been allowed to take risks with the player. We have a clear conscience."<br><br>Henry, who has had back, neck and ankle injuries during the 2006/07 campaign, has made only 27 appearances for Arsenal since signing his new contract with the club last summer. The 29-year-old has played in all but one of France's seven matches since their World Cup final defeat by Italy last July.<br><br></div>

The charge relates to comments made with regards one of the assistant referees in the Carling Cup final defeat to Chelsea.</strong><br><br>Towards the close of Chelsea's 2-1 victory at The Millennium Stadium, a fracas erupted between both sets of players, as Arsenal's Emmanuel Adebayor and Kolo Toure were sent off, along with John Obi Mikel of the opposition. Post-match and Wenger pulled no punches, claiming 'the whole system is not honest', when referring to the disciplinary procedures of The FA, in a statement that has not sat well with English football's governing body.<br><br>Wenger also claimed the assistant whom referee Howard Webb consulted before sending off Adebayor was a 'liar', and it is for these comments that the Frenchman has been brought to book. "Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has been charged with improper conduct and/or bringing the game into disrepute," read an official FA statement.<br><br>"The charge relates to his media comments about one of the assistant referees in the Carling Cup final. "He has until March 30 to respond."<br><br></div>
