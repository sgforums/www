              " width="280" height="390"></p>
              <p><em>Scolari: Worst manager in Roman's time... Behind Mourinho, The Tinkerman Ranieri and even Avram Grant...</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">PHIL SCOLARI is under mounting pressure — as our stats prove he has easily made the worst start of any Red Rom boss. The Chelsea manager has a meagre win record of just 59.1 per cent after the home defeat to Arsenal.</h2>
              <p class="article">That is compared to the 78.2 per cent effort Jose Mourinho put together in his first season at Stamford Bridge. The statistics are based on performances after 15 Premier League games and take in results in the Champions League and Carling Cup.</p>
              <p class="article">Next best after Mourinho is Tinkerman Claudio Ranieri with 77.3 per cent of games won in Roman Abramovich’s first year. And he got the chop at the end of the season.</p>
              <p class="article">Even flop Avram Grant managed a combined win percentage of 63.6 last term. Scolari copped another blow yesterday when he was told not to expect a rouble of Red Rom’s billions in January.</p>
              <p class="article">Chief executive Peter Kenyon made it clear the club will not finance any signings. But Scolari is still reeling at losing out on Robinho to Manchester City in August and was looking to strengthen.</p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea may be nicely placed in the Premier League but they could still fail to qualify for the Champions League knockout stages and are already out of the Carling Cup.</p>
              <p class="article">Kenyon confirmed: “I don’t think we will be doing any business in the January window because the type of players we are looking for are not available. “We also have players with long-term injuries coming back so we’ll have more availability in January and February. We put our squad together in the summer and we’re concentrating on the one we have.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“We’re making sure our players get back from injury. On that basis, we think we have a good enough squad to help us improve on last season.” Chelsea handed former boss Grant £15million for striker Nicolas Anelka from Bolton and a further £9m for defender Branislav Ivanovic in January. Chelsea could even afford to keep Serb Ivanovic in mothballs for nearly nine months before he got his first outing.</p>
              <p class="article">Kenyon claims his new-found prudence means Abramovich will not have to subsidise Chelsea FC from his vast wealth for the first year since he took over. The Blues chief executive added: “The long-term plan was always to be profitable,non-loss making and self-funding. It’s the right thing for Chelsea.</p>
              <p class="article">“That has not been dictated by Roman. “He’s absolutely committed to the club and absolutely passionate about it. But he is also a very good businessman. “Which is why he had enough money to put £600m into the club in the first place.</p>
              <p class="article">“If you look at our record over the last few years, we’ve been spending less on transfers. “That’s not to say that we won’t do in the future. But, again, I think we want some long-term players. “I think we’ll be pretty busy in the summer but that’s the right time for Chelsea to be busy.”</p>
              <p class="article">Scolari will have to bank on the returning talents of Ricardo Carvalho, Michael Essien and Juliano Belletti. He will also need more input from Didier Drogba to strengthen the push to regain the Premier League title from Manchester United.</p>
              <p class="article">Kenyon added: “I don’t think anyone would deny we’ve had some disappointing results and Sunday’s is still a bit raw. “But it’s not yet Christmas and we were top of the league on Sunday night. “You get weeks like that and we’re not used to it too often, thank goodness, so it’s not something we want to get used to.</p>
              <p class="article">“The bar at Chelsea is like it is at United — it’s higher.”</p>

              <p>Perhaps it beginning to tell that Scolari didn't had much club management experience before taking over at Chelsea... A great manager he sure is but 6 years spent in Portugal and having a match once a month or in two months... probably took the edge of him a little... Cutting his squad down to 25 was one of his first request when he came in cause he didn't want unhappy players...</p>
              <p>Mourinho learned the season when he reduced the numbers in his squad and he lost the league title and went on to sign a few back-up players on the free and Grant benefitted last season when he had a worse injury problem than Scolari currently have... They could still bring on players like Sidwell, Ben Haim, SWP, Makelele...</p>
              <p>Its beginning to seem to me that Scolari is a great short term manager like World cup one month kind of thing... But a league of 9 months and 60 over matches where he has to be on the job daily rather than monthly, he seem to be struggling a bit of late. I feel even his timing and use of subs is a bit questionable at times... like maybe putting in the right person but taking out the wrong guy kind of stuff...</p>
              <p>And another thing is... why is he even using the first team to play in the Carling Cup for? Doesn't he know its the best time to give his players some much needed rest that will be useful for the long season?</p>

And also, I don't think Roman would want to incur more cost at this moment as he is the highest paid manager on a $6m a yr contract and what about the whole team of coaches he brought in along with him... those contracts will need to be paid off also... It will take millions and millions to get rid of him and his men and more millions to bring in another guy and his team...

              <p>Well... I guess some of their defensive qualtities have been compromised for their attack... I rmb a couple of weeks ago when i was watching sportscenter, they compared mourinho's and scolari's opening games in charge of chelsea in terms of GS and GA.</p>
              <p>Mourinho had lesser GS and GA while Scolari had more GS and GA...</p>

Second half of the season could be different, they will play apart from all the big 3, Pool, United &amp; Gunners... They have to go to Everton, Aston Villa, Portsmouth, Tottenham, Newcastle and West Ham... The only real easy ones are Sunderland and Fulham but Fulham is also quite good at home this season...</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>well IMHO, the nos. of win against the lost is not that important if at the end of the season Chelsea goes on and win the league, Chelsea and set a benchmark for the rest to catch up and this season it seems that most of the big 3 (less Arsenal) did kinda strengthen their squad some how or rather so it does make senses that all are almost about the same.. but its always better then when one team runs away with the league at mid season..</p></div>
