              <p><br>Fully agreed. This time all singaporeans really have to stand up and boycott this bloodsuckers (the last time in 2006 there were also talks about boycotting, but wasn't really successfully).</p>

              <p>Not Starhub or Singtel's fault this time round. So I think we've to understand also.</p>
              <p>But as for the BPL rights, it's confirm Singtel's fault! So I will not be getting MioTv.</p>

              <p>Now, they secured the matches and they just trying to pass the cost the consumers.</p>
              <p>It is a clear cover-up.</p>

              <p>Does SingtelÂ understand the TV business at all.....I don't understand its Â mentality...????</p>
              <p>Couple of aspect i would like to bring toÂ attention.....</p>
              <p>1) if we show to the outside world that we are "Willing to Pay"Â we ends up paying too much......</p>
              <p>Singtel bid 350 million for EPLÂ  when starhub only bid for 141 million for EPL ...what do you expect when weÂ have shown to the outside world that weÂ are willing to PAY such high price for EPL ......World Cup will definitely pursue higher priceÂ since it is a much bigger game globally as compared to a regional league....</p>
              <p>2) Singtel bid beyond advertising revenue is perplexed in business ....typically TV Games revenue are generated thru selling ofÂ AdvertisingÂ with maximum exposure toÂ viewership.....</p>
              <p>With such a high price its counter productive to viewership....this has become a laughing stock to the world.....</p>

              <p>It is amazing we a little red dot on the face of this earthÂ hasÂ the dubious honour of being one of the most if not the mostÂ expensive place on earth to watch the World cup...</p>
              <p>It's just ridiculous when you think about it... You can get to watch it free in Australia, free in England and free in Indonesia... Are these lesser football crazy nationsÂ than us? How about Japan, where they say the standard of living is the highest in Asia.Â And how much do they pay? Surprise, surprise... S$9.20 only. And even across the causeway, they are charging $28.70 while we over here pay an average of $82.50</p>
              <p>To add insult to injury, the 2 fools from the telcos actually pat themselves on the back during their press conference andÂ said they did it all for us the fans... wtf!Â </p>
              <p>And I say don't blame Fifa as we all don't know the real deal behind this episode... Our local press can report $100m demand from Fifa then can suddenly changed to $40m... And now they say it's $21m... The 2006 deal they have all along saidÂ Starhub paid $15m to justify charging us that muchÂ the last time, thenÂ this time aroundÂ it's said to be $21m, the difference can't be that much right? Wrong, cos now they are telling us Starhub might have only paid $8m for the 2006 rights...</p>
              <p>Where is their credibility? And even to date when the deal is signed, theyÂ still decline to reveal how much they paid for it... For all we know maybe they paid a very much lower fee but are not telling us that's all. Otherwise how are they going to justify charging us this king's ranson this time around?</p>

You eat because you are starving but you also 'bay song' so you live to rememberÂ how they treated you... Then went the opportunity come to return the favour...
