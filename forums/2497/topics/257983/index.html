But this makes it harder overall to maintain a balance between achieving success in europe and success domestically. The need to sacrifice one or the other might become greater as the demands are greater as well.</div>

"Owen will formally sign his contract when he returns from a holiday at the end of June," read a United statement.<br><br>Hargreaves, who is taking a family break in his native Canada, has been a long-time target for United. The Premiership champions failed with bids to sign him last summer and in January. He enjoyed an illustrious 10 seasons at Bayern, winning six league titles and the 2001 Champions League.<br><br>The announcement of Hargreaves' arrival at Old Trafford comes less than 24 hours after it was revealed that United had agreed "in principle" to sign Brazilian midfielder Anderson, 19, from FC Porto and Portuguese winger Nani, 20, from Sporting Lisbon.<br><br>The deal for the duo could amount to a total of Â£30m.<br></div>
