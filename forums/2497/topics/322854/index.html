              <p class="articleHeading"><em>Scolari has not talked to Lampard</em></p>
              <p class="articleHeading"> </p>
              <div style="margin: 0px 0px 15px;">
              <p class="introcopy"><strong>CHELSEA'S new boss Luiz Felipe Scolari has lined up exciting young Brazilian forward Robinho but his best chance of landing him from Real Madrid hinges on Cristiano Ronaldo leaving Manchester United.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="padding7north" style="font-size: 12px; margin: 4px 5px 4px 0px; line-height: 17px; text-align: justify;">
              <p class="storycopy"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Chelsea’s sporting director Frank Arnesen met with Robinho’s agent, Vagner Ribeiro, but a transfer is far from cut and dried. Scolari began his Chelsea regime  by signing Portugal international Deco and he wants more flair in the shape of the dazzling Robinho.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Ribeiro is determined to get the best move for the Real winger and claims he is better than Ronaldo. “It's true that Chelsea are interested in signing Robinho,” Ribeiro told Spanish sports daily AS. “They have been after him for a while and there has been much more contact since Scolari became the new Chelsea coach. “I met with Arnesen in London and he confirmed that Chelsea wanted my player for next season.”</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">The Spanish champions are only keen to offload the player to free up cash to help buy Ronaldo, but Ribeiro insists his client is as good as, if not better than, the Portugal international. “Neither Robinho nor I like the fact that Real Madrid can use him as part exchange in their bid to sign Cristiano Ronaldo,” he said. “We don’t like this attitude and we want Madrid to start valuing Robinho, because at the moment they’re not. “Robinho is as good a player as Ronaldo or better. The difference is Ronaldo reached the Champions League final and Robinho didn’t. “But if Robinho had won such a title he would be at the same level as Ronaldo.”</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Scolari may have to bide his time to find out if Real will make Robinho available but his next problem centres on a current Chelsea thoroughbred. Frank Lampard is apparently devastated and hurt by the total lack of contact from Scolari and is on the verge of saying goodbye to Chelsea. The fate of the England midfielder has been one of the highest items on the agenda at Stamford Bridge this summer with talks on a new contract deadlocked, and his old manager Jose Mourinho openly admitting he wants to take him to Inter Milan.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Lampard, currently on holiday in Italy, wanted face-to-face talks with Scolari before he made his final decision on his future. But he has been left stunned that there has been no telephone call from the Brazilian or suggestion of a meeting – yet on Monday the new Chelsea boss managed to complete his first signing with the £8.5million capture of Portugal midfielder Deco.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Friends at the club describe Lampard as “disillusioned”, after wavering in the past six weeks following the death of his mother Pat and the support he received then from the club and its fans.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">A club source said last night: “Frank is totally disillusioned by it all. If Scolari had the time to approve the Deco deal, and if he really wanted Frank to be the linchpin of his team, as has been said, then why has he not contacted him?</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">“Frank feels completely let down by the club.”</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">A club source added: “Frank now feels that he is not wanted at Chelsea.”</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">The daily Express can also reveal that at a meeting last Wednesday, Chelsea even suggested to Lampard’s representatives that he play out the last year of his contract at the club this season and then renegotiate his deal next summer.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">They are reluctant to give a 30-year-old the kind of money he is demanding.</p>

              <p>Tho I am a chelsea gal, I had a feeling that scolari cannot make it, lampard is a England player, if he let go lampard, the fans may not like it. Deco is also old liao, good in midfielder playmaker but lack stamina, i heard he is a playboy, weak legs.</p>

              <p>Then come Robinho, I hv seen many brazilians end their career in a sour note, most are ok in the initial young stage, but they like to enjoy and party and drink, same goes to the like of Adriano, Ronaldo or even Rodinhindo who are currently out of form.
