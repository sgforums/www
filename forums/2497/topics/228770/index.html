            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Blocking and diving is Bolton's way, says BenÃ­tez</strong></span><br><br>The simmering antipathy between Liverpool and Bolton Wanderers has resurfaced yet again before the teams' meeting at Anfield this afternoon, with Rafael BenÃ­tez warning today's referee, Graham Poll, to look out for what he perceives to be the visitors' overly aggressive tactics and gamesmanship.<br><br>BenÃ­tez claimed that Bolton's emphasis on blocking opponents at corners and free-kicks would not be tolerated in his native Spain and he urged Poll to be aware of El Hadji Diouf's apparent pride at winning set plays by diving - the former Liverpool striker said in November that "sometimes when I need to dive to get a penalty it's because, for me, the best footballer is a footballer who is very clever".<br><br>A victory for Liverpool would lift them above Bolton into third place in the Premiership but Sam Allardyce's side pose a threat. "When you play against Bolton, the key during the game is the referee," said BenÃ­tez, who suffered his first domestic defeat as Liverpool's manager against Bolton in August 2004 and has had a fractious relationship with Allardyce ever since.<br><br>"Each player or each team decides how they want to win, and you can't criticise them for that, but the rules are the same for everybody. When you play against Bolton you must say to the referee: 'Be aware of each throw-in, each foul or each free-kick you award because it makes a big difference if the decisions are right or wrong.'<br><br>"I don't think Bolton could play the way they do in Spain. At every free-kick, every corner, every throw-in they commit what in Spain would be a foul, but here it's not. They know this and they take advantage of all these things.<br><br>"When they block someone or go against the goalkeeper, it's up to the referee to see it's a foul. It happens from all their set pieces - you can see two or three players trying to take advantage of this. I've seen two or three players surrounding the keeper sometimes. That is a foul, simple as that.<br><br>"Diouf and Nicolas Anelka are good players but one of them is really proud of diving and I don't like that. If we are killing the players who dive and someone says he is proud to dive because it is good for him and his team, then I feel we cannot support this. The referee must be aware of this."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rafael Benitez has admitted there's no time for his players to dwell on Saturday's excellent win at Tottenham with Bolton set to visit Anfield in just 24 hours time.<br><br>Luis Garcia secured the victory for Liverpool at White Hart Lane but Benitez has already turned his attentions towards tomorrow's game when the Reds will take on third placed Bolton.<br><br>"You know my idea," said Benitez, "it's impossible for the players to be physically fit when you are playing Saturday and then Monday.<br><br>"We have no time to prepare the game but the players will be as ready as they can be for what we know is going to be a difficult match.<br><br>"Bolton are a good side with experienced players and they play with a style they have used for years. They are very good at what they do and we know what to expect. All teams have problems in playing against them.<br><br>"As always, it's up to the referee to be aware of what is going on during these games and I hope that will be the case this time.<br><br>"It was important to beat Tottenham because they were close to us in the league and it's the same this time as well. Bolton are having a good season but it's important that we beat them."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Newcastle 2-2 Man Utd </strong><br><br>A second-half strike from Newcastle's David Edgar denied leaders Manchester United victory in a thrilling match.<br><br>The Magpies took a surprise lead when James Milner fired in a stunning shot high into Edwin van der Sar's goal.<br><br>The visitors bounced back when Scholes rifled in a brilliant 20-yard shot before he scored a sublime second from a similar distance.<br><br>But 19-year-old defender Edgar grabbed a point for Newcastle with a 25-yard drive that deflected in off Scholes<br><br>The action started almost from the word go when Louis Saha came close to giving the visitors the lead, but fired just wide of Shay Given's goal.<br><br>Ronaldo, who tormented the inexperienced Newcastle defence all match, gave Saha the chance to make amends for his earlier miss, but this time the Frenchman was thwarted by an impressive save from Given.<br><br>The striker then had a header blocked on the line from Giggs' cross, before his miserable day was complete when he came off with an injury.<br><br>Nevertheless, Sir Alex Ferguson's men still looked formidable opposition and when Newcastle took the lead it not only stunned the leaders but also the crowd at St James'.<br><br>Milner, one of Newcastle's players of the campaign so far, was quick on to Dyer's pass and after cutting in from the left flank smashed in a superb 25-yard shot high into the roof of Van der Sar's goal.<br><br>If one thing let Newcastle down earlier in the season it was their defence, and with three first-choice defenders out injured the home side were always going to find it difficult to keep this fantastic Manchester United side at bay.<br><br>And true to form, the visitors bounced back courtesy of a bit of magic from Scholes.<br><br>The little maestro tricked past two Newcastle challenges on the edge of the area to fire in low.<br><br>It was what Ferguson's team deserved and straight after the break Scholes scored his second with another wondrous effort.<br><br>The midfielder was fed a square ball and took little time to fire a low drive through the legs of defender Steven Taylor and past a helpless Given.<br><br>It looked all over for Glenn Roeder's men until Edgar decided to make a rare foray into the opposition's half.<br><br>The Canadian, making his first start for the club as a replacement for the injured Nicky Butt, ventured down the left and hit an opportunist strike that took a slight deflection off Scholes and beat the hand of Van der Sar.<br><br>The visitors feverishly looked for a late winner, but their best opportunity, a Ronaldo header, was cleared off the line by an alert Nolberto Solano.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Newcastle manager Glenn Roeder:</strong><br>"It was terrific and we will enjoy the result. When you play Manchester United you have to keep trying to take the game to them.<br>"The lads came in and did a great job and it just shows how much courage and team spirit there is in the squad.<br><br>"David Edgar is not renowned for his 25 yarders and he must have been saving it for a special occasion."<br><br><strong>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson:</strong><br>"We missed a stack of chances but we have to admire Newcastle's character, they deserved their point.<br>"We should have won the match but we did not play as well as we have been because they did not allow us to play. I have nothing but praise for them.<br><br>"It is a real challenge now for the championship but we are a serious contender and points will be dropped by both teams."<br><br></div>
