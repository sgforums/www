              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> has explained to fans why they haven't spent the £80 million raised from <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Cristiano Ronaldo</span></abbr>'s sale to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Real Madrid</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>In his column for <em>United Review</em>, Ferguson wrote: "I know there will be some fans who are disappointed that we didn’t spend the princely £80million we got for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Cristiano Ronaldo</span></abbr> from <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Real Madrid</span></abbr> on another superstar. I would have done had I felt we were getting
              value for our money, but this close-season some crazy things went on
              and the price of the game’s major players went through the roof.</p>
              <p>"The asking price for players we were looking at just wasn’t
              realistic and we held off. I think we have shown over the years that we
              are not afraid to spend big and we have in fact frequently created
              transfer fee records, but only when we felt the business made financial
              sense. The level of the fees being demanded in recent months just
              didn’t add up.</p>
              <p>"So we stood off, but what you must remember is that we are
              working from a position of strength. We don’t suddenly have to splash
              out to try to compete at the top. We are already there, thanks to a
              long-term strategy of buying mostly young players, who we feel have the
              potential to become top performers. <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Cristiano Ronaldo</span></abbr> was a case in point. We spotted him and bought him for a modest £12m.
              You know the rest. In the six years we had him he became the world’s
              best player, and we certainly wish him well with the rest of his
              career."</p>

              <p>Its a wise move... Cos this year, with City and Real going about buying big and paying in excess of the true value... Its better to keep the money for Jan or next season...</p>
              <p>Anyway, United do have a decent squad so no need to get desperate... Chelsea are also keeping things under control... They have only got that Russian for like the same fee as Valencia, Sturradge will cost probably $3 to $6 million at most and a free signing from Boro Ross Turnbull... Arsenal, probably even lesser only one defender at $11m. Its Rafa's Liverpool that is doing all the spending... This season Rafa is the Big spender of the top 4... Already coming close to $40m and he is still not finish...</p>
              <p>Under this current economy situation, its pays to be prudent with this kind of big money deals...</p>

              <p>Let's be honest. It's been a crazy summer with everyone being worth 80m  from Ibrahimovic to Ribery. For a moment, even I thought I was a decent footballer worth a good dime.</p>
              <p>In fact, looking at some of the deals that have been done, it's hard to disagree with Roy Keane's assessment that Ronaldo at 80m was cheap.</p>

              <p>this one i agree with Ferguson , like Liverpool , we still have accessive amount of spending , but we dun sign for the sake of signing , we sign if there is value on top of it , more financial sense ie of the player .</p>
              <p>Now every team going to squeeze Real Madrid , Man City , and knowing MU have that £80 , they will squeeze United all the way .</p>
              <p>Now Real and Man City had settle down more or less their squad , we still have the Jan transfer window to fulfill our signings , for this season , it's just too crazy .</p>
