              <p><strong>Luiz Felipe Scolari has promised a massive overhaul of Chelsea's bloated first-team squad that is likely to see around ten players leave before the start of the new season.</strong></p>
              <p>While Scolari's assurances during his introductory press conference that Frank Lampard would remain at the club have seemingly rebounded to the extent of making the midfielder's departure inevitable, a host of other established names are expected to be told they can leave after Scolari indicated he wanted to radically trim the size of his squad.</p>
              <p>"I want to work with 23, 24, or a maximum of 25 players," the new Chelsea boss confirmed. "Now I have 32 players. But now is the time to change the team. If I have 30 players I can't bring them in from the youth side, which is what I have always done and always will do.</p>
              <p>"The players know this. When I spoke to them, I said this: 'There will be 23, 24 or 25 who will stay with me. That is the maximum I will need'."</p>
              <p>Scolari is not short of candidates for the cull. Among those set to depart in the next few weeks are Steve Sidwell and Shaun Wright-Phillips, as well as Lampard. However, his remarks could also signal the exit of Andriy Shevchenko, Juliano Belletti, Carlo Cudicini and Claudio Pizarro. Claude Makelele, meanwhile, is thought to be interested in a switch to Paris St Germain.</p>

              <h2>SCOLARI SPARKS LAMPARD ROW</h2>
              <h2>'Lampard v Kenyon Canteen Row Sparked By Scolari'</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"> <img id="mainpic" src="http://images.football365.com/08/06/Others/228633.jpg" alt="'Lampard v Kenyon Canteen Row Sparked By Scolari'" width="224" height="193"> <img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/08/07/240/JoseMourinho_994121.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><br></div>

              <p><strong>Luiz Felipe Scolari's claim during his introductory press conference that Frank Lampard would stay at Chelsea is reported to have sparked an extraordinary confrontation between the midfielder and chief executive Peter Kenyon that has seemingly made his departure to Inter Milan inevitable.</strong></p>
              <p>While Scolari's debut performance in front of the press was composed and confident, his announcement that Lampard would be staying at the club may prove a terrible error of judgement.</p>
              <p>Far from settling the issue, the repercussions of Scolari's claim saw Inter Milan table a £8m bid for the midfielder last night and his departure is now depicted as merely a matter of time.</p>
              <p>"He wants to stay and to play for Chelsea for many years. I was very happy because I think Chelsea needs Lampard and Lampard likes Chelsea. Now it's a minimum of questions to solve it and Lampard will be with us more time than one year," Scolari declared.</p>
              <p>The announcement was immediately countered by Lampard's agent, Steve Kutner, stressing that while his client 'wanted' to stay, that didn't mean he would be staying. "He made it categorically clear that although he would love to finish his career at Chelsea, with the deal he has been offered that is not possible," Kutner's statement read.</p>
              <p>Yet while Kutner was issuing his statement, Lampard's reaction is reported to have been even less restrained. According to the Times, 'Lampard, who watched the press conference at the training ground in Cobham, Surrey, between double sessions, confronted Peter Kenyon in the canteen when the chief executive returned from the nearby Hilton Hotel, where Scolari had been speaking.'</p>
              <p>An irretrievable breach has apparently opened between Lampard and the club's hierachy, with Chelsea unwilling to meet his demand for a five-year contract worth approximately £135,000 a week. No doubt delighted at the unexpected turn of events, Inter Milan, now under the management of Jose Mourinho, made their first formal bid for Lampard's services last night and saw the odds on the player moving to Italy tumble.</p>
