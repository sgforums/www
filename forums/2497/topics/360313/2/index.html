              <p>its ok we may have lost the title to a better team on certain crucial times of the season. its hurts for me to say this as a lifelong Liverpool fan, but congrats to ManU for winning their 18th title and equalling our record.</p>

              <p><br>You mean yourself? Don't keep assuming that all Liverpool fans are nasty. You Manure has won 18 titles and is the most successful club for the past 20 years, credit be given where its due.</p>
              <p>Be honest to yourself, for the past 20 years, Manure or Liverpool fans are more arrogant??? When we said we have 18 titles, we were defending ourselves from your taunts, your bull$hits, your arrogance!!</p>

              <p>i find that arrogance must be kept in the right situations. where the people i am upset with here are the ones who have been 18, 18, 18 for the (not for the past 20 years), but WHEN IT HAPPENED 20 years ago. whereas it is well reasonable for arsenal fans to be happy during the 2004 season, unbeatable and all that, THAT IS PERFECTLY REASONABLE, DURING THAT SEASON AND THE SEASON AFTER, whereas NOW IT IS IRRELEVANT BECAUSE ARSENAL IS NO WHERE THAT GOOD ANYMORE. (pls dont argue that arsenal is still that good cos they're 4th -.-, not unbeatable) similarly in the following 2 years that chelsea won it IT WAS PERFECTLY FINE.</p>
              <p>relevance is the key issue. imagine a leeds fan came up to you and told you WE ARE THE BEST TEAM IN THE WORLD AND LIVERPOOL SUCKS AND MAN UTD SUCKS AND ARSENAL SUCKS AND CHELSEA SUCKS, what would you think?</p>
              <p>@mod: seems alot of ppl have difficulty understanding reason. request to close this thread. thanks.</p>

              <p>History is something we can learn from, you don't just forget about it because you wish to win a quarrel.</p>
              <p>That is the problem, and since the founding of a certain sub-forum, the situation has become much much hostile as more people have safe zones to abuse other clubs. While the mods are not doing a good job, it has become a habit to take it out of their little playground and exert it on rival fans. When that occured, it was a battle of who has more supporters abusing the other camp.</p>
