              <p>Tevez slapped in a transfer request last week and will walk away from the game if he is not sold in January.</p>
              <p>But City are determined not to bow to the Argentine striker's demands and will even take legal action if he retires.</p>
              <p>Tevez, 26, rejected a £1.5million bonus in August as he was so determined to leave.</p>
              <p>His supporters insist his refusal to accept the sweetener shows his row is not motivated by cash.</p>
              <p>But City are determined not to sell Tevez despite the disruption his continued presence at Eastlands could cause.</p>
              <p>Tevez's camp might see legal action as constituting City cancelling his contract, allowing him to go to another club who would pay any compensation.</p>
              <p>He claimed he wanted to leave because of a breakdown in relations with senior figures.</p>
              <p>City find it bizarre he has cited chief executive Garry Cook as the main problem and believe his actions are about not getting a new contract.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Poster boy: QUIT THREAT ... Carlos Tevez </em></p>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span><strong>Roberto Mancini will launch an attempt to keep Carlos Tevez at </strong></span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Manchester City</strong></span><span><strong> at a training-ground meeting on Friday. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Tevez, who has asked for a transfer, is expected back at City on Tuesday after returning from a four-day break in Tenerife on Monday night. </span></p>
              <p><span>He will be asked to train with a group of reserve players as Mancini's first-team squad are not due in until Wednesday. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The 26-year-old is not in the provisional squad of fringe players selected for the trip to Juventus for Thursday's Europa League dead rubber. Instead Tevez is scheduled to meet City boss Mancini - who is already in Italy - at Carrington when they return at the end of the week. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">High on the agenda will be the issue of the club captaincy. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Mancini is considering taking it off him but will not make the decision until after he has spoken to the star striker about his exact reasons for wanting to leave. Mancini has been left bemused by Tevez's decision and wants the Argentina international to explain it. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Like many other City senior officials, the Italian believes Tevez's move has been driven in part by his adviser, Kia Joorabchian, something the player has already denied. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">At Eastlands, the row over Tevez's future deepened further on Monday with City sources indicating that the club will sue if he walks away or pursue him through the courts for breach of contract if he simply decides not to play. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">City also claim to have damning email evidence showing how Joorabchian asked for a contract extension for his client just a few weeks ago. This is denied by the Tevez camp. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">But if Tevez does manage to engineer a move from City then Chelsea's Florent Malouda believes it will spell the end of their title ambitions this season. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">He said: 'Tevez is like Didier Drogba for us. You definitely need players like that in order to win titles. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'Every time he plays against us he is fantastic so I think City will be happy if they keep him. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'You have to try and keep calm when you hear this news. You never know what could happen. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'It happened (a change of heart) with Wayne Rooney didn't it?' </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">With City officials scornful of the statement from Tevez that was released by his PR team on Sunday night there is no sign of this stand-off ending as Rooney's did at Manchester United. Rooney signed a new deal just two days after admitting he wanted to leave. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">City's team in Turin will be almost identical to that which beat Red Bull Salzburg recently, though Italian striker Mario Balotelli will not travel for fear of the unsavoury attention he may receive from Juventus fans.</span></p>

              <p>I think there's really no point if it resorts to threats like lawsuit is involve in a player's decision on staying or leaving.</p>
              <p>And i still do not believe Tevez insistence in his claims that he's homesick and not motivated by money blah-blah-blah. If that is the case, why join City after leaving United when other big clubs (in terms of structure and trophy winning pedigree, not 32 years joke) like Chelsea, Real Madrid all linked to him but he of all clubs, he chose City.</p>
              <p>I think this saga will probably end like how Rooney's did, with pay increment.</p>
              <p>Looks like Tevez is aiming to be the best paid footballer in the world, abeit zero trophies in his remaining playing career.</p>
