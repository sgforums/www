              <p>David Beckham is set to travel to the World Cup finals next month as a
               member of the England coaching staff.</p>
              <p>After a series of 
              discussions between Beckham, his representatives, Fabio Capello and his 
              club, Los Angeles Galaxy, it has been agreed that the former England 
              captain will be on the plane to South Africa on June 2.</p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/13/article-0-06D2F357000005DC-619_233x385.jpg" alt="Lending a hand: Beckham" width="233" height="385">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Lending a hand: Beckham</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Beckham will not join Capello’s training camp in Austria, instead 
              focusing on his recovery from the achilles tendon injury that ruled him 
              out of the finals. But the England manager sees real value in having the
               35-year-old midfielder around because he knows the Italian’s coaching 
              methods after playing under him at Real Madrid — and has played in three
               World Cups.</p>
              <p>While Beckham will be given time to continue his
               recovery with gym work, his role as ambassador for England’s 2018 World
               Cup bid will be limited by the demands Capello puts upon him.</p>
              <p>He
               sees Beckham, who has 115 caps, as a mediator between management and 
              the players and as an English member of the coaching staff, in addition 
              to Under 21 manager Stuart Pearce.</p>
              <p>Earlier this week, Capello
               spoke of the importance of having Beckham in the England set-up, 
              despite only relying on him as a bit-part player during World Cup 
              qualifying.</p>
              <p>He said: ‘When I selected David you (the press) 
              always asked me “Why?” David played only 10, 20 or 30 minutes in games. 
              He is really important for the dressing-room spirit that he always had 
              in training. It is important for him to set an example. Some players 
              like this are really important to me both as part of the group and when 
              they play.’</p>
              <p>Beckham’s world was in tatters when he injured 
              his left ankle in March, while on loan at AC Milan.</p>

              <p>After a successful operation he returned to America to continue his 
              expected eight-month rehabilitation in Los Angeles.</p>
              <p>But he 
              refuses to call time on his international career and his presence will 
              boost<br>England, whose opening World Cup game is against the USA on 
              June 12.</p>
