              <p><br><strong>Alberto Zaccheroni has warned his Juventus side to avoid complacency against Fulham as he looks to put one over on his old adversary Roy Hodgson in the Europa League last 16 first leg contest.</strong></p>
              <p>Zaccheroni only beat Hodgson once during the three spells the 62-year-old spent in Italy and he has told his team they will have to fight hard to beat the Cottagers.</p>
              <p>"He is a very honest person. He plays teams in a very structured system, 4-4-2,'' said Zaccheroni of Hodgson, who managed Inter Milan twice and Udinese in the 1990s.</p>
              <p>"His teams are always successful without trying to do too much, they just keep it simple.''</p>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Roy Hodgson is relishing the opportunity of carving a new chapter in Fulham's history by beating Juventus in the Europa League clash on Thursday.</strong></p>
              <p>The match represents a new high for the Cottagers, whom Hodgson took over in December 2007 when the club was facing the very real threat of relegation.</p>
              <p>Hodgson has already guided the west London side through their best ever European campaign, and now hopes a win over Juve tomorrow will herald a new era in the club's history.</p>
              <p>"Given our position when I came to the club in 2007 I don't think many people would have actually given any credence to the fact that we'd be this far forward now in our development," the former Inter Milan boss said.</p>
              <p>"Apart from appearing in the last vestiges of the Intertoto Cup, we haven't had any European history so we are making history as we go along.</p>
              <p>"These adventures in Europe can help us in terms of us becoming a stronger football club but we have a long way to go, mind, before we match the Inter Milans, the Juves and the Milans."</p>
              <p>Fulham's preparations for the match have been hit by bad weather in the northern Italian city. Snow storms have meant that the Cottagers had to call off their training session at the stadium.</p>
              <p>Hodgson admits preparations have not been ideal for the match, but believes that will not ruin his side's chances of victory on Thursday against an injury-hit Juve side who currently sit fifth in Serie A. "I went to look at the pitch at the stadium this afternoon," said Hodgson.</p>
              <p>"Juventus made it clear that if we insisted on training, as we have the right to do from UEFA, that they would take off the covers and allow us to train on it but it was obvious to me that that would be counter productive.</p>
              <p>"It won't be a good pitch with all that bad weather. It will be difficult and will cut up badly but it's not a drawback, not enormously. It can't be that bad. It will be 105 metres long by 68m wide so I'll take my chances."</p>
              <p>Hodgson's side have a chance of causing an upset with Gianluigi Buffon, Giorgio Chiellini, Felipe Melo and Amauri all missing for Alberto Zaccheroni's side.</p>
              <p>Fulham will be without injured trio Andrew Johnson, Clint Dempsey and John Pantsil (all knee) but Paul Konchesky is available after recovering from an ankle knock and will replace Nicky Shorey, who is cup tied.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>After narrowly avoiding relegation from the Barclays Premier League less than two years ago, Fulham fans would never have dreamt of playing Juventus in the last 16 of the Europa League.</strong></p>
              <p>But here they were yesterday, sipping their beer in the sun in one of the city's piazzas in anticipation of the biggest European match in their club's history.</p>
              <p>There was, therefore, a definite feeling of anti-climax when the Stadio Olimpico boasted more empty grey seats than Juventus fans. Fewer than 9,000 home supporters turned up in the 27,000- seater stadium, but Fulham sold out their allocation and brought 1,537 fans from west London.</p>
              <p>The sense of bathos continued as David Trezeguet forced a save inside eight minutes from Mark Schwarzer and Juventus scored from the resulting corner as Diego's delivery was headed in by central defender Nicola Legrottaglie.</p>
              <p>It was immediately apparent that this was not going to be a repeat of Fulham's 4-0 FA Cup victory over Notts County, the side who inspired Juventus' famous black and white striped shirts, and it was Fulham who looked in danger of being turned over in Turin.</p>
              <p>Juventus struck again after 25 minutes. A probing build-up ended with Jonathan Zebina sidestepping Simon Davies and Dickson Etuhu before dispatching a fierce right-foot shot into the left hand corner from just outside the box.</p>
              <p>Fulham conceded one Premier League goal in the whole of February but last night they were two down inside half an hour. Yet not only did the English side manage to keep the score respectable, they got an away goal with their first real attack of the match.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/11/article-1257318-08AEBEC5000005DC-662_468x363.jpg" alt="Dickson Etuhu" width="468" height="363">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Lucky strike: Etuhu gives Fulham a ray of hope with his deflected away goal</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>A Davies free-kick into a crowded penalty area was met by Etuhu and the ball was deflected twice before dribbling over the line to beat former Arsenal goalkeeper Alex Manninger. It was a fortunate goal to say the least, but it gave Fulham the belief they had lacked in a shellshocked first 30 minutes and sparked something of a revival. </strong></p>
              <p>Brede Hangeland forced a fine save from Manninger with a close-range header from a Davies corner and Zoltan Gera hit the target with a left-foot strike just before half-time.</p>
              <p>But Fulham's prominence was short-lived as Trezeguet showed his class with the 170th goal of his Juventus career. The former France centre forward, who is returning from injury, fired a shot at Schwarzer from a Diego corner and hit the rebound first time to outwit the Australia goalkeeper just before half-time.</p>
              <p>It gets worse for Schwarzer, the Barclays Premier League player of the month in February: he has to face Wayne Rooney at Old Trafford on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Fulham manager Roy Hodgson said: 'I thought when we went 1-0 down against the run of play and at 2-1 I thought we were looking reasonable. There's going to be an element of fatigue but what killed the game for us was the goal in the 46th minute.</p>
              <p>'Our major regret was that, at 2-1, when the possibility of a result was in our hands that we conceded a goal in added-on time in the first half.'</p>
              <p>But Fulham are still in this tie and boast an impressive home record at Craven Cottage, which is sold out for the return leg on March 18.</p>

              <p><strong>Hodgson added: 'It's not impossible. We're not out of it yet. 'I don't think we were favourites before the game started, we're even less favourites now but it'll be an exciting game. I've certainly seen stranger things than us turning it round.'</strong></p>
              <p>There was further good news for Fulham as Paul Konchesky and Clint Dempsey, who both suffered knee injuries against Blackburn in January, came through 90 minutes and half an hour respectively.</p>
              <p>With 46 games played already this season and Manchester United, Juventus, Manchester City and Tottenham in store over the next two weeks, Fulham certainly need all their resources available.</p>

              <p><strong>Hodgson said: 'It's a testing time but to come to a place like Juventus and have as much control as we did for long periods is very commendable.</strong></p>
              <p>'Perhaps we weren' t as sprightly as we've been in some games but I thought we looked organised, capable of keeping the ball and getting behind them, but it was the last pass or the last cross that didn't quite arrive.</p>
              <p>'But the Juventus back four will know they've been in a game and will be thankful for (Fabio) Cannavaro making several vital interceptions from crosses.'</p>
