            <div class='col-md body'>LIVERPOOLÂ’S hopes of landing Fernando Torres have hit a setback with Atletico Madrid refusing to budge from their Â£27million asking price.<br><br>The Spain striker, 23, has emerged as a prime target for Kop boss Rafa Benitez this summer.<br><br>However, TorresÂ’ club have insisted the star player will only leave if the buy-out clause in his contract is triggered.<br><br>The Reds are prepared to offer Luis Garcia Â— a former Atletico player Â— as a makeweight in the deal but the sides are still some distance apart in their valuation.<br><br>Benitez knows if he gives them the asking price it would blow a huge hole in his summer transfer budget.<br><br>And Liverpool sources have suggested they will not go the full way Â— even though they are desperate to sign a world-class goalscorer.<br><br>Yet Atletico are unlikely to climb down as they do not want to part with their prized asset despite the fact Torres has indicated he fancies a move to Anfield.<br><br>Speaking last month, president Enrique Cerezo said: Â“We always have the same problem.<br><br>Â“Every year, either at the start of the season, midway through or at the end.<br><br>*<br>Click here to find out more!<br>Â“It is the same. Torres is an Atletico Madrid player and I think he is going to remain with the team for many years. He is very well at Atletico Madrid, the fans want him and we want him.<br><br>Â“Neither is he for sale nor do I think he is going to leave.Â”<br><br>If the Reds fail to land Torres it would be another blow in what has been a frustrating summer for the Kop.<br><br>The millions of pounds promised by new owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks have yet to be turned into big-name signings.<br><br>LiverpoolÂ’s interest in CharltonÂ’s England striker Darren Bent has also faded as they do not believe he is worthy of the Â£17m price tag.<br><br>Benitez hopes to off-load French striker Djibril Cisse to Bolton for around Â£6m.<br><br>This will free up funds to spend on West HamÂ’s Israeli midfielder Yossi Benayoun, 27.</div>

The funds that are being promised have to be spent wisely, and not for the sake of spending. Identifying the target is one thing, whether the respective clubs are willing to let them go is another.

It's a proven fact. How easy is it for you to say that speed and money is important. But put yourself in their shoes and you'd realise every pound you spent must be carely calculated because you have pumped in so much money in the club. Leeds United have proved that.

What they provide may not be proven right all the time, so why would i not doubt them?<br><br>Yes, United wanted hargreaves for nearly a year and they got their man. Where did that cash come fromt] you may question? It came from the ever increasing tickets pricing, the sale of Ruud Van Nistelrooy, and the infamous Obi Mikel, whom United got paid 12m pounds without him even featuring once! Well, that probably sums it up.<br><br>The revenues United get superceded that of the scouscers, with them only second to Real in the Annual Richlist. Yes, they do have the debts to settle, but since we are dwelling only on the player transfer aspect, the sales they got out from the 2 players mentioned above probably answer the question itself, and moreover, United weren't spending big up till this summer, for quite awhile. Yes, Carrick was an exception. But  that was meant for last summer.<br><br>Since you mentioned the NHL team, they'd probably be split on where shall they direct the cash to since they own 2 teams, that would be financially taxing on them, so every moves in the transfer market must be calculated properly.<br><br>Pool fans are getting impatient partly because of the fact that United got their act together way too early, just after the season ended not long ago. Probably that's why the pool fans are getting frustrated for the lack of activity. It's not like the takeover was done before last season started, if it was done so, RB would have the matter discussed with the owners, things would have been quicker than currently.<br><br>Moreover, it's still June, just give the yankees some time, be patient. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
