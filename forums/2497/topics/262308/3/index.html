Unless, Arsenal move in, having already spoken with Atleti about Reyes!</strong><br><br>The talks between Liverpool and Atletico Madrid continue as both sides look to strike deals favourable for themselves.<br><br>Reports in Spain suggest Atletico Madrid have been demanding 36 million euros (Â£24million), while Liverpool, who started with a 25 million euro offer, are at the moment only willing to offer 30.<br><br>Neither club seem to be willing to budge as of now, so the weekend has come at a good time, allowing both to reconsider their positions.<br><br>There is talk of Rafa Benitez including one player in the deal, along with around 25-30million, but Atletico Madrid are not interested in Luis Garcia, or others Liverpool are willing to offer.<br><br>It is believed that if a player cannot be added to the deal, Liverpool will table a 32m 'take it or leave it' offer next week. Ateltico Madrid might just go for it, given that Torres' buy-out clause is anyway set at 40m.<br><br>However, Los Colchoneros are hoping that the sale of Thierry Henry to Barcelona will bring Arsenal into the picture, and help drive up the price. Jose Antonio Reyes is a player Atleti have discussed with Wenger, and that could also tilt the balance in Arsenal's favour.<br><br>Atleti are, however, still keen on Liverpool largely because they want a straight cash deal, and simply want to use Arsenal's interest. The Reds, meanwhile, are keen to seal the deal on Monday itself, to avoid being held at ransom.<br><br>Watch this space...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>United To Bid For Torres, Accept Boro's Â£6M Smith Bid<br><br>According to reports out of England, it is Middlesbrough, not Newcastle, who are set to land Manchester United striker Alan Smith. The money will be used to help land either Dimitar Berbatov or Fernando Torres.<br><br>Sam Allardyce was linked with a move for him, and Roy Keane and Harry Redknapp had both expressed interest.<br><br>However, today's report suggests that neither the Toons, nor Pompey or the Black Cats, submitted a concrete bid.<br><br>This put Boro - who are hunting for a replacement for Mark Viduka - in pole position. However, Southgate must now sell the plan to Smith, who is currently on vacation in Florida.<br><br>The Boro manager is expected to fly to the States to speak to the former Leeds man, in order to convince him to move to the Riverside.<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson is hunting for a number 9 who can play in front of Rooney, and Smith does not fit the bill. Under the circumstances, he is happy to open the door in return for a sum that will boost his transfer kitty.<br><br>Dimitar Berbatov and Fernando Torres are both still on Fergie's radar! The former could be sold if Spurs land Darren Bent, while the latter has already been put on the market with a 36 million euro (Â£24 million) price tag.<br><br>A separate report in the Mirror suggests that Giuseppe Rossi could also be sold if someone is willing to offer around Â£8-10m, in order to put together enough money for a bid for Torres, who is close to a move to Liverpool at the moment.<br><br>The Red Devils have, for now, gone cold on Fabio Quagliarella, with Udinese refusing to sell the player at the moment.<br></div>
