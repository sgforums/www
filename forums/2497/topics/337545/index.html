              <h1>I'm the first, second and third best player in the world, says smug Man United star Ronaldo<br></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/08/11/240/Cristiano-Ronaldo-edited1_1486369.jpg" border="0" alt="Ronaldo - better to come."><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1086705" rel="1086705_3" href="/sport/football/article-1086705/Im-second-best-player-world-says-smug-Man-United-star-Ronaldo.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo believes he fully deserves to be named FIFA Player of the Year. Ronaldo is a firm favourite to emulate last year's winner Kaka and lift both the European and World player of the year titles.</strong></p>
              <p>The 23-year-old helped fire United to the Premier League and Champions League double last season with 43 goals, and believes there is still more to come.</p>
              <p>"I am the first, second and third best player in the world," joked Ronaldo in an interview with Brazilian daily O Estado de Sao Paulo. "But there are other good candidates, like Kaka, (Lionel) Messi and (Fernando) Torres.</p>
              <p>"I think that I did everything that is necessary to win and I am going to continue doing more. "My goal is to win everything that is in front of me."</p>
              <p>Brazil legend Pele expects to be giving the prize to the Portugal winger this year, and Ronaldo draws particular pleasure from his comments.</p>
              <p>"That represents a lot for me, he was a great player in world football," added Ronaldo. "It was a special sensation for me to hear that from Pele."</p>
              <p>With each season that passes, Ronaldo is hitting the back of the net more and more frequently.</p>
              <p>Despite missing the start of the season after ankle surgery he already has nine goals for United, but revealed it was never his aim to be a prolific goalscorer.</p>
              <p>"My objective, sincerely, was never to score goals," he added. "I like to play for the team, or what I want most is to win games. "But, if the goals appear, all the better. I am having the luck of scoring many goals and I hope things continue like this."</p>
              <p>In a typically confident interview, the former Sporting Lisbon ace said he was ready for plenty of attention from Brazilian women ahead of Wednesday night's friendly in Brasilia. </p>
              <p>'Oh, I'm ready for harassment (from women), I'm used to that in Europe, and here it is the same,' he said. 'It is a friendly game here and a good opportunity to relax. 'I have been [to Brazil] a few times, but never to play. I love holidays here, there are beautiful beaches and the people are nice.'</p>
              <p>A home draw against Albania last time out was particularly badly received but Ronaldo has asked for patience. 'Big Phil (Scolari) is a great friend. I'm sorry he has left the Portugal job, but it was an excellent move (to Chelsea). I loved working with him.</p>
              <p>'Queiroz has not had much time to develop his work. Two years ago, England also had problems and then they recovered. All the big national teams go through this. Let us recover.'</p>
              <p>Recovery is also something that Ronaldo hopes for in the global economy, even if you would think his multi-million pound contract leaves him immune from the credit crunch.</p>
              <p>'The situation has to worry everyone, yes,' he said. 'We are worried and feel a certain uncertainty (about the future). We talk about it - it is part of our reality - but we believe that things will improve.'</p>

              <p><strong>Ballon d'Or nominee Lionel Messi has tipped his rival Cristiano Ronaldo to claim European football's most prestigious individual award. The run up to December's announcement of the Golden Ball winner of 2008 has been dominated by Messi and Ronaldo.</strong> <br><br>The Argentinean and the Portuguese are out on their own as clear favourites for the award, and Barcelona star Messi concedes that his Manchester United counterpart has the edge on him. <br><br>Ronaldo has claimed a slew of individual awards already this year. He has accrued the FIFPro World Player of the Year honour, along with the English Football Writers Award and the Premier League Players' Player of the Year. <br><br>The 23-year-old has also been named the Uefa Club Footballer of the Year and has won the Golden Boot for his return of 42 goals last season. Combined with those accolades, the former Sporting Lisbon man helped the Red Devils to the Premier League title and the Champions League to cap a truly remarkable year. <br><br>Speaking in the wake of Barcelona's 5-2 win over Ronaldo's former club in Portugal, Leo Messi was questioned by the local media for his prediction on the outcome of the Ballon d'Or vote. <br><br>Playing up the significance of such an honour, Messi plumped for his foe. He said: "I think the Ballon d'Or is an important competition. He won the Champions League, the Premier League as well, he won them, so I think he will be awarded the prize."<br><br>Ronaldo came in for some criticism earlier this month with his declaration that he was the 'best, second best and third best' footballer at work in the world, and it is not a manner in which the modest Messi views himself. <br><br>On Ronaldo's outlandish statement, the 21-year-old was coy. He said: "Each one is how he is. I am a footballer and that is all I care about. As they say in Barcelona, the important thing is to have the respect and support of my teammates. I am happy with that."</p>
