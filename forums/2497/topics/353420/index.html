              <p class="small bold"><em>KOP OF THE POPS ... Torres, Gerrard, Alonso and Carragher as Ringo, John, Paul and George</em> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">ALVARO ARBELOA is convinced this season will be so historic for Liverpool they will end up more famous than The Beatles. </h2>
              <p class="article">No one can convince the Spanish star that Manchester United are favourites to win the Champions League. Or that the Reds cannot overtake their greatest rivals and pip them to the Premier League title. </p>
              <p class="article">It’s all ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah’ at Anfield as far as the Spanish defender is concerned. Looking to Europe, Arbeloa is undaunted at the prospect of facing Chelsea in the last eight. He has also warned United that Liverpool could easily win all of their remaining eight league games to take a first Championship since 1990 and 19th in all. </p>
              <p class="article">The team are in buoyant mood after hitting 13 goals in three successive victories over Real Madrid, United and Aston Villa. And Arbeloa, 25, said: “This team is on the way to becoming more famous than The Beatles. </p>
              <p class="article">“There are many weeks of emotion awaiting us in the Champions League and Premier League and this season could end up being historic for us. “We are developing a sensational game and now all the pressure is on United. I believe they could fail and we are ready for that moment.” </p>
              <p class="article">Sunday’s 5-0 home drubbing of Villa took Liverpool to just a point behind leaders United. Alex Ferguson’s men have a game in hand but have lost back-to-back league games to the Kop and Fulham — and Liverpool also have a superior goal difference. </p>
              <p class="article">The latest batch of results has set up the possibility of a fairytale finish for the Anfielders to an already thrilling campaign. For so long it was assumed United would not only automatically retain their league crown but also draw level with the Merseysiders’ current record total of 18 wins. </p>
              <p class="article">For much of the season, Liverpool have suffered from self-doubt in the wake of poor results against the likes of Stoke and Hull. On February 28, defeat at Middlesbrough allowed United to open up a 10-point lead and the cause looked all but lost. But from the ashes of what seemed a burned-out title charge, they have turned things around. </p>
              <p class="article">The 4-0 Anfield rout of Real also heightened the tension in the Champions League, another crown United are thirsting to keep. Liverpool will now go top of the table if they win at Fulham on April 4, as they are playing 24 hours before the Red Devils face Villa at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p class="article">Manager Rafa Benitez has stressed there is ‘real belief’ among his squad that they ‘can beat anyone’ — and Arbeloa sees no hint of the recent trend changing. He added: “Our objective is to win all our league games between now and the end of the season. It is a difficult task but not impossible now our morale’s improved so much. </p>
              <p class="article">“That triumph at Old Trafford really increased our desire to be the champions.” As for the Champions League, he admitted: “We didn’t desire Chelsea and would have preferred not to have drawn an English rival. My dream was to play Bayern Munich or Barcelona. But I still insist we are the favourites. </p>
              <p class="article">“Since the arrival of Guus Hiddink, the Blues have improved. But Champions League games are different and we manage these kind of situations better. “From our point of view, Rafa’s new deal was very important. He may appear to be too serious for many people but that’s not what the players think. </p>
              <p class="article">“He is a coach whose only desire is to obtain the maximum from everybody and, under him, I feel like I am the best player in Spain. “We are happy he is staying because the news means continuity and generates calm and confidence as we go about our work.”</p>

              <p>Lol. This is the reason why I cannot stand Liverpool Football Club. Like their fans, they hide in their turtle shells and shut up when they are losing. When they start to win a few matches, they boast like as though they have the best football team around.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Worst of all, they go accusing Man Utd, Chelsea and etc of being arrogant. I have greater respect for Man Utd FC, Arsenal FC and all their fans because even though they are cocky and arrogant, they are consistent. Even when they are losing, they still come out bravely and talk and act like they are the king of the world. Surely it is much better than a team who only barks when the tide is going their way</p>
