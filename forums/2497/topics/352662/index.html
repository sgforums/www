              <p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has been left 'surprised and worried' after Theo Walcott suffered an injury setback. </strong></p>
              <p>The speedy winger only recently returned to action
              after a long-term shoulder injury he sustained while on international
              duty with England.</p>
              <p>Walcott made his first start for the Gunners
              since the problem last weekend and impressed during the 4-0 triumph
              over Blackburn Rovers.</p>
              <p>However, the 20-year-old has damaged his
              knee during a training session prior to Saturday's trip to Newcastle
              United and now faces a nervous wait over a scan.</p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p>"Walcott got injured today in training," Wenger told the club's <em>official website</em>. "We have to test it, he has a scan on his knee today.</p>
              <p>"We are surprised and worried. He was in very good form coming back and that is very bad news for us and for England.</p>
              <p>"For the rest of the season might be too long, but he's out of tomorrow's squad and he could be out of the England squad.</p>
              <p>"He
              locked his knee so it could be a cartilage problem. He did it walking
              back from training. He was fully normal during training but maybe it
              only came out when he stopped.</p>
              <p>"We have to see how he responds today and I hope it's not really serious."</p>

              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger has told <strong>Setanta Sports</strong> that Theo Walcott’s knee injury is far less severe than initially feared. </strong></p>
              <p>Walcott picked up a freak injury at the end of training on Friday and there were fears that he had suffered cartilage damage.</p>
              <p>Such a problem would have ruled him out for five weeks and Wenger said the England star was distraught.</p>
              <p>However, a scan has painted a far rosier picture and he should be back in contention in a fortnight.</p>
              <p>”The scan was reassuring and it does not look as if there is any damage there,” Wenger told Setanta Sports<strong></strong> ahead of Arsenal’s clash with Newcastle.</p>
              <p>“It is a swollen knee with some blood in it, but I believe that in 10 or 12 days he should be back.</p>
              <p>”You want all your players and it is unfortunate as he was
              coming back, but the most reassuring thing is there is no serious
              damage.</p>
              <p>”We were scared at one stage that it was a cartilage or ligament, but there is none of that.”</p>
