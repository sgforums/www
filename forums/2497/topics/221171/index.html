Olympiacos can still progress to the knockout rounds if they win their remaining games and Roma lose twice against the same opponents but three points on Matchday 6 against Shakhtar would at least seal a UEFA Cup place.<br><br>Meanwhile, defender Michalis Kapsis, who has been left out of the UEFA Champions League squad, suffered a cut leg against FC Aris Thessaloniki, requiring eight stitches.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Kromkamp says he did not criticise Liverpool</strong><br><br>PSV Eindhoven defender Jan Kromkamp has attempted to placate Liverpool fans ahead of Wednesdays Champions League clash at Anfield.<br><br>The 26-year-old Holland international, who moved to PSV from Liverpool in the summer, will be facing his former club in the Champions League Group C decider.<br><br>And his return to Merseyside has been marred by reports that he had been critical of his former clubs style, apparently branding them a "long-ball team".<br><br>Kromkamp had been quoted in a radio interview suggesting that Liverpool resort too quickly to the long ball up to striker Peter Crouch.<br><br>Kromkamp has not only annoyed Liverpool fans, but also former boss Rafael Benitez and he has even received text messages from former team-mates on the subject.<br><br>Now Kromkamp says: "I do not want the crowd after me, I want them to know that what I said was misunderstood. I had just a short radio interview and I have never said anything bad about Liverpool or the manager. I do not understand how anyone could say anything bad about this club, I enjoyed my time at Liverpool and have never said bad things like this. I even had text messages from friends here about it and I want the crowd to understand."<br><br>Benitez, however, had clearly been annoyed by Kromkamps alleged remarks, saying: "He is a player who was with us for a year so he will know about us, he will know about our style but he will also know from the training ground the quality we have here. It is not nice to see him talking about us the way he has. But he will know the weaknesses and the strengths."<br><br>PSV boss Ronald Koeman, who as Benfica coach won both legs of a Champions League last-16 clash with Liverpool last season, also tried to defuse the situation, saying: "Yes, with Peter Crouch or Sami Hyypia, Liverpool can use a long ball. But that is not their only method of attack. They have Dirk Kuyt, Craig Bellamy and Robbie Fowler and with them they obviously play a different way."<br><br>On last seasons Benfica triumph, Koeman said: "I know Liverpool well, from playing them twice last season and this season at PSV. Maybe it is true they have problems scoring away from home, but at Anfield they are still very strong. I have fantastic memories of winning here with Benfica, it was a great result in Europe that night. I do not feel that Liverpool are very much stronger overall than last season, but they are certainly better up front. Signing Dirk Kuyt has been good for them. He is already a very good player, and this is his first experience outside of Holland with a really big club. He is already good, but he will get better, stronger and more confident in the future."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>League form is irrelevant in Europe says Benitez<br><br>Rafael Benitez is certain LiverpoolÂ’s inconsistency in domestic competition will have no effect on their Champions League fate.<br><br>Already qualified for the last 16, Liverpool will finish top of Group C if they beat PSV Eindhoven at Anfield on Wednesday night.<br><br>Benitez, who will have Spain midfielder Luis Garcia back in contention after a hamstring injury, will stick with an attacking system using two wingers, believing the approach will be good enough to overcome the Dutch champions.<br><br>The Reds manager said: Â“What happens in our league form is not an issue, we have to show we are good enough in Europe and we will do that. We do have to improve, I do not recall ever seeing a perfect match Â– maybe a perfect second half in Istanbul (in the 2005 Champions League final) Â– but there is always something to improve on. At home, we are scoring goals and winning. Away, we are making chances and not winning. We have to start scoring the goals, it is as simple as that. We make so many chances, and when you watch the videos of away games it is even more disappointing. We are attacking and attacking, but I have confidence that we will start to score and to improve. The players know they can improve and they know they have quality. They also know I have confidence in them.Â”<br><br>He added: Â“It is good to have qualified for the last 16 in Europe. It will be good to beat PSV and make sure we do not have to go to Galatasaray needing anything to be top. I want to finish first, but you never know with the draw. Teams could be poor now but buy in January and be much better when the last 16 comes around in a few months. Their form, money and players can change so it is hard to predict but we need to finish top for our own confidence. It is clear we want to finish first. Maybe you could play against a team who are not as good as a team that wins a group but that is hard to judge. Teams will be different in a few months. So it is hard to say what the benefits of finishing top of the group are, but I would like to go in to the next game in Istanbul without any pressure. In front of our supporters we win, we score plenty of goals and we are happier. We need to show confidence and show people we are good enough.Â”</div>

A repeat of their 4-0 victory against FC Spartak Moskva in the reverse fixture on Matchday 1 would guarantee that aim but they can expect a tough test against opponents who still have their eyes on third place and qualification to the UEFA Cup. Spartak are currently four points adrift of Sporting Clube de Portugal and know that victory tonight is vital for them to retain an interest in Europe this season.<br></div>
