              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">IAN RUSH led the chorus of approval at Liverpool following Joe Cole's arrival.</h2>
              <p>Rush, who scored 346 goals in two spells with the club, said: "It's fantastic news.</p>
              <p>Speaking to the club's official website, the Anfield scoring hero couldn't hide his excitement with Cole's arrival and backed Liverpool to race back to the top four after last season's seventh placed finish.<br><br>"I think it's fantastic news for the club," Rush said.<br><br>"Joe Cole is a wonderful player and I think he left Chelsea because he wasn't getting a regular game. I was a bit surprised he didn't appear much for England in the World Cup because he's a player that can unlock any defence.<br><br>"Liverpool Football Club for me is the biggest club in the world. We might not have been successful as we would have liked to have been recently, but this shows we can still attract top name players, whether that's an England international or a foreign international.<br><br>"We've got a great new manager in Roy Hodgson and he knows what he wants, and he can talk these players into signing for our club.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><em>Cole can be the catalyst for a "new era" at the club.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Former Reds captain <strong>PHIL THOMPSON</strong> added: "This is what we expected when Roy Hodgson took over, the arrival of more English players. It will be saying to other players 'Look, if we have a chance of getting Joe Cole, we have a chance of getting other players.'</p>
              <p>"Signing Joe will tell Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres all is not lost, we're still a top-four club. Joe can create something out of nothing."<span id="intelliTXT"> </span></p>
              <p>"I'm absolutely delighted," Thompson told Sky Sports News. "We need that player, the catalyst between midfield and attack. It all adds up for me.</p>
              <p>"Joe Cole has that bit of character, the can do something out of nothing, he that creative ability that Torres comes alive to, Gerrard too.</p>
              <p>"It's the kind of news all fans wanted. We've got thousands of people waiting for season tickets but everyone is going to be renewing them now. Everyone will have Joe Cole's name on their shirt.</p>
              <p>"It's the start of a new era, we'll be looking for more new players and it could be a glorious summer for the fans. They will be delighted. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>CRAIG JOHNSTON</strong>, who was part of the 1986 Double-winning side, said: "Cole's one of the only born-and-bred players that can do it like Kevin Keegan or Kenny Dalglish could.</p>
              <p>"He is one of the jewels in the country, so it just sends the right message to everyone. I was very excited when I heard. It brightened up my day."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Former Kop midfielder <strong>JASON McATEER</strong> insisted: "Liverpool have been missing a player with craft and guile and Joe Cole will give them that.</p>
              <p>"Steven Gerrard will look at Joe and think 'This signing is a positive one'."</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>David Fairclough</strong> was equally enthused by the news.</p>
              <p>He believes Liverpool fans already have a good appreciation of Cole's qualities, having been on the receiving end of them in the past.</p>
              <p>"It's excellent news and very positive. It shows they mean business," he told Sky Sports News.</p>
              <p>"He's a player Liverpool fans have always taken to.</p>
              <p>"He's scored goals against us, offered support (to the strikers) and always been a genuine threat. The Liverpool fans have always feared Joe Cole's threat, I think.</p>
              <p>"It's exciting the club have gone after a really top player."</p>

              <p>To me, I feel the signing of Cole is a positive direction for Pool... Cos the guy is a quality player afterall... The only drawback I find is the length of the contract they offered him... I have no doubt Cole will be a useful player for them for the first 2 seasons if he stays injury free. Beyond that, I still have lots of doubt if he can still bring it like he used to when he is 30 going on to 31 by the start of his 3rd season of his 4 yrs contract...</p>
              <p>I personally think giving him a $110k per week on a 2 yrs deal might actually be a better deal from Pool's point of view...  At least they can cut their losses should he disappoint or show signs of decline like in Chelsea's case with Ballack... Cos the position now is, should Cole start to show signs of ageing by his 3rd season or worse 2nd, as most wingers seems to be finish by 30, Pool will have to carry his huge salary burden for another few seasons... This is the only disadvantage i feel otherwise it is a positive for the club...</p>

              </div>
              <p class="art-txt-first">Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp 
              has wished Joe Cole all the very best despite missing out to Liverpool 
              for the player's signatue.</p>
              <p>Redknapp was keen on luring free agent Cole to White 
              Hart Lane after he left Chelsea earlier this summer.</p>
              <p>However Liverpool won the race for the England star's signature 
              with Cole set to sign a four-year deal at Anfield once he has completed a
               medical.</p>
              <p>Redknapp admits Spurs tried their hardest to sign Cole, but that 
              the 28-year-old snubbed their overtures for football reasons rather than
               money.</p>
              <p>"We tried our very hardest to get him. The chairman made Joe a 
              fantastic offer," Redknapp wrote in his column in The Sun.</p>
              <p>"But, in the end, we were competing with a club that has years 
              and years of tradition and a reputation as one of the biggest clubs in 
              the world.</p>
              <p>"I got a lovely message from Joe to inform me of his 
              decision.</p>
              <p>"He explained it. I think he wants to move for football
               reasons. He wants to be part of a transformation at Liverpool. I think 
              maybe getting away from London and a clean break was part of it too.</p>
              <p>"Whatever his reasons he has been genuine the whole way through. 
              Joe is a bit of a throw-back, if you like.</p>
              <p>"He has class and his 
              manners are impeccable. I will always see him as the 11-year-old boy I 
              first clapped eyes on at West Ham and I can only wish him all the best 
              and hope his move is successful.</p>
              <p>"Everywhere I went this summer Spurs fans were asking me 'Are we 
              going to get him?' Daniel Levy pushed the boat out for him, he really 
              did.</p>
              <p>"No one can fault the effort we made to try to get him but 
              it wasn't to be and I fully respect Joe's decision."</p>

              <p>Joe: 'I could have stayed at Chelsea I joint the <strong>'biggest club in England' </strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Joe Cole has revealed he signed for </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> because they are the 'biggest club in England'. The England midfielder officially signed his four-year deal - worth £80,000 a week - after leaving </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> this summer. And he has spoken for the first time about his reasons for joining Liverpool - and snubbing a move to </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Arsenal</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> and </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Spurs</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></strong> </p>
              <p>The new Liverpool No 10 said: 'I could have stayed at Chelsea because the fans loved me and I won things, but I wanted to challenge myself and when I knew Liverpool were interested it was a no-brainer because they are the biggest club in the country.</p>
              <p>'I set myself a deadline to make a decision and when I made it I sent a text to Christian Purslow and Steven Gerrard and then turned my phone off.</p>
              <p>I know I have made the right decision and I am looking forward to the challenge. This is a challenge for me. I have played in London all my life.'</p>
              <p>'This is a massive club. I tried to take everything out of the equation, take the financial and location side out and just thought in football terms. </p>

              <p><br> </p>
              <p><strong>Cole revealed that he is exciting about working under new Liverpool boss Roy Hodgson, who replaced Rafa Benitez at the end of the season.</strong></p>
              <p>He added: 'I had a chat with the gaffer about football and was impressed with him. The club has had Spanish and French managers over the years and I think it's a breath of fresh air to get an Englishman in.</p>
              <p>'The club finished seventh last year, which wasn't good enough, and he explained where the club wants to go. I jumped on board because with the players we have here and the players we are looking to bring in, it's definitely going in the right direction. </p>
              <p>'I want to go out there and to run and fight for the lads and the fans. That's what I'll always do and Roy is the man who can make sure we are a nice unit as a team.</p>
              <p>'It's all about us and being together as a team and having the spirit which can take you a long way. If you add that to the quality players we've got here we can go a long way.'</p>
              <p>Cole has also welcomed the news that he will be playing alongside Steven Gerrard next season after the Liverpool skipper committed his future to the club.</p>
              <p>He said: 'That was the best bit of news I could have had. I know Stevie, he is Liverpool through and through and I know from playing with and against him for the last 10 years what a quality player he is.</p>
              <p>'I know how much this club means to him. I think players can play for other clubs but with Liverpool you have to live and breathe it. It's that kind of a place. I am excited by the challenge.</p>

              <p>'I just want to get involved. When you move to a new club it's important to immerse yourself into everything about it and that's what I'll be looking to do. I know the fans are great with the players and I will fight to try and win trophies for this club.'</p>
              <p>Cole, who has spent his entire a career in London with <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/west-ham-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">West Ham</span></a> and Chelsea, says he has no problems moving to Merseyside - particularly after the seal approval from Kop legend Jamie Carragher.<br><br>He said: 'That's as good as it gets, isn't it? I've always got on well with Scousers. I actually roomed with a Scouser for a year at Lilleshall - Ian Armstrong who went on to move to Liverpool.</p>

              <p>My take on this on how it has unfolded... lol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Though I think Cole is a decent player but he should have just kept quiet... Saying all these now is just plain stupid on his part... Cos almost everyone knew for a fact he left Chelsea cos they didn't want to give him more money... For months he and his agent played a game of dare with Roman and waited for him to give in but it didn't paid off...  And now he is leaving them and behaving like a scorn woman making all these noise about her "new man" to her old lover... lol.</p>
              <p>As for young and promising gentlemen Arsenal and Spurs, though they were also very keen on 'her' but they were also seen as not being able to provide enough $$$ for 'her' liking...</p>
              <p>And lucky for smart gentleman United, whom 'she' was really waiting for a call but didn't came... He went as far as making it crystal clear to the Press that he is not interested on a bidding war on 'her' from the very beginning when 'she' was being linked to him...</p>
              <p>In the end, it would have been wiser for 'her' to have just kept quiet and do her talking on the pitch or on the bed...lol. But unfortunately, 'her' mouth and actions in trying to make 'her' new man happy... Came across like a scorn woman showing off to 'her' previous man what 'she' got now...</p>
              <p>I feel this whole episode was really badly handled... It just came across to me like 'she' prostituted herself to the highest bidder in the end... and the worse thing was, 'she' could have got the same from 'her' previous man but in the end, settled for an old hero who was willing to used up all his CPF money to provide for her fancies... lol.</p>
              <p>And now, having gone with the lau hero, 'she' now claims it was not because of his money... 'She' now tell us "When I knew lau hero was interested in me, it was a no-brainer because he has the biggest dick in the country... and 'she' look forward to an exciting time with him"... lol...</p>
              <p>If all these was said before 'her' contract was over or right after it was, at least it would have been convincing... But after searching for weeks and months for a new carrot head to chop? Who would seriously belief any word of it? Had 'she' said, "When I knew lau hero was interested in me, it was a no-brainer because he was the only carrot head to chop" would sound more realistic... lol.</p>
              <p>Oh well, just for laugh only don't take offence...</p>
              <p>On a personal view, Cole's behaviour has made me think a lot lesser of the guy... Cos at least with others like Ronaldo, Alonso, Kaka or even Fabregas... They genuinely wanted to join the other club... and not looking around for a carrot head. And didn't bad mouth on their previous one either after leaving... </p>
