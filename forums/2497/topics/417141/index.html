              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Not enough experience? Chris Hughton has been dismissed by Newcastle</em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Newcastle United </span>have sacked manager Chris Hughton fewer than eight months after guiding the club back to the Barclays Premier League.</strong></p>
              <p>After a run of two points from their last five games, and poor away performances at Bolton and West Bromwich, club owner Mike Ashley says he is now looking for a more experienced manager to 'take the club forward'.</p>
              <p>Martin O'Neill was quickly installed as the bookies' favourite and Alan Pardew, Gianfranco Zola, Alan Curbishley, Rafa Benitez and Steve McClaren were names immediately linked with the vacancy, along with Alan Shearer.</p>
              <p>Former manager Joe Kinnear is another man Ashley and his managing director Derek Llambias could turn to.</p>
              <p>But, whoever is appointed, Ashley's decision to sack the popular Hughton will anger supporters who have been chanting the 51-year-old's name throughout matches since their 5-1 derby demolition of Sunderland and who have been begging the board to hand the former Republic of Ireland international a new contract.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/12/06/article-1336138-0C5F2E33000005DC-141_233x281.jpg" alt="Newcastle owner Mike Ashley" width="233" height="281">

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Hughton's deal was due to run out at the end of the season but Newcastle put off negotiations for a new deal until the New Year, presumably to leave their options over his long-term future open.</strong></p>
              <p>Hughton has also been working without an assistant of his choice since Colin Calderwood left the club to manage Hibernian on October 18 and attempts to bring in a new man of his choice such as former Chelsea and West Ham Number Two Steve Clarke or former Ireland boss Brian Kerr have failed.</p>
              <p>The man the board wanted to appoint, former player Peter Beardsley who has been coaching with the academy, is favourite to take over as caretaker for the visit of his former club Liverpool on Saturday.</p>
              <p>But Beardsley cannot be an option for the role if the wording of the club statement is to be believed.</p>
              <p>The statement read: 'Football Club have today parted company with manager Chris Hughton. Goalkeeping coach Paul Barron also leaves the club today.</p>
              <p>'The board would like to place on record their thanks to Chris for his considerable efforts during the club’s transition from Championship to Premier League football.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/12/06/article-1336130-0C5BFBB9000005DC-252_468x286.jpg" alt="Blow: Somen Tchoyi scores West Brom's first goal in their win over Newcastle" width="468" height="286">

              </div>
              <p><strong>'Chris has shown exceptional character and commitment since being appointed manager in October 2009. The club wishes him well for the future.</strong></p>
              <p>'Regrettably the board now feels that an individual with more managerial experience is needed to take the club forward.</p>
              <p>'The task of appointing a new manager now begins. An announcement will be made shortly regarding transitional arrangements pending the appointment of a successor.'</p>
              <p>Hughton, who turns 52 on Saturday, was appointed as full-time manager in October last year, after taking over as caretaker in the aftermath of relegation and Alan Shearer's unhappy departure.</p>
              <p>Despite the loss of high profile stars like Damien Duff and Michael Owen, Hughton quickly galvanised his squad and they romped through the Championship last season, winning the title with more than 100 points.</p>
              <p>His side have made a better than expected start to this season, helped by the addition of players like Cheik Tiote and, briefly at least, Hatem Ben Arfa. The emergence of Andy Carroll who has scored nine Premier League goals has also helped.</p>
              <p>But for every exceptional result, like the Sunderland thrashing and win at Arsenal, Newcastle have picked up poor ones too. They have lost to Blackpool, Blackburn and Stoke at home and drawn with Wigan and Fulham.</p>
              <p>The last two away games brought 5-1 and 3-1 defeats and a furious Hughton kept his players in the dressing rooms at The Hawthorns for more than an hour. Newcastle are currently 11th, four points clear of Wigan in the bottom three.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>After Liverpool, Newcastle face Birmingham City, Manchester City, Tottenham, Wigan and then West Ham.</strong></p>
              <p>Former captain Robert Lee said: 'I am amazed but nothing should surprise me about Newcastle United. Chris did a tremendous job and was doing very well until this point.</p>
              <p>'I don't think he could have done anymore. They won at Arsenal, got the best derby result for years and put in a great performance against Chelsea.</p>
              <p>'The contract talks stalled so they had probably been thinking about it for a while. Chris could not have done any more.'</p>

              <p><br>Considering Hughton managed to get NUFC up in just one season, that is quite a feat in its own right given his relative inexperience in running a big club. Mike Ashley is acting like a typical ungrateful business owner.</p>

              <p><span><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>Alan Pardew has vowed to win over the Newcastle fans after signing a generous five-and-a-half year contract.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The former West Ham and Charlton manager paid tribute to the work done by Chris Hughton in getting the Magpies promoted to the Barclays Premier League and admits he can't wait to face Liverpool at the weekend.</span></p>
              <p><span>Pardew is far from the fans' choice to replace the popular Hughton - whose sacking on Monday caused disbelief across football - and the length of the new bosses deal will certainly raise eyebrows.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">But he immediately tried to build bridges with the 'second to none' Toon Army and promised to produce the kind of flair football they crave.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'I am honoured and privileged to have been given this opportunity at Newcastle United, one of the truly great clubs in English football,' he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'I understand what this club means to its supporters. Throughout the football world people recognise that this is a unique club in many ways, with supporters who are second to none in their loyalty, passion and devotion to the team.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'Chris Hughton did a great job last season, guiding the club back to the Premier League. He continued that good work this season. It is my aim to build on that now and take this club forward.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'I’m not a Geordie of course, but I’m a football person with a love of the game and I can assure you I bring great drive, desire and commitment to the job,” he said. “I have always managed teams that have played attacking positive football, something I know the supporters here appreciate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'At the same time I intend to focus on developing exciting young players through the club’s excellent academy and development squad, and I know the board here at St James’ Park are very committed to that too.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'I can’t wait to get started and what better way to kick-off than welcoming Liverpool to St James’ Park on Saturday?'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Pardew held his first press conference at St James' Park on Thursday afternoon.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">He said: 'I'm privileged to be sitting here and looking forward to a tough job. But it's difficult because it's fairly obvious the players and fans had tremendous respect for Chris and the fact he's gone has caused something of a stir.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>'The problem I'm going to have initially is the players - I need to get my message across quickly and with clarity so as not to get any resentment at a time when they are doing reasonably well.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'The battles I need to win are on the pitch. I understood what was going to happen if I took the job and that's a daunting prospect but to be manager is something I couldn't turn down.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">On the length of the deal, he added: "I wanted to be tough on the length of contract and give myself as much stability at a club that hasn't had much stability with managers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'Managers have come and gone here. It doesn't bode well so I'm trying to say I will work as hard as I possibly can here to get a situation where I can bring some longevity to the job.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'I represent the fans. I'm an employee of the club but I'll be knocking on the door trying to get the maximum funds I can to make the club the best it can be. I've never had a problem with that in the past.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'In the past I have convinced owners to have faith and trust in me to invest. Obviously I've got to gain that. I think I've got a good record in the Premier League but I'm not going to compare myself to what Chris has done - because he's done a super job.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'But I'm a competent manager, I give fans information and don't withhold anything. I like to think the players will grow to respect me and what I do. I've never really had a problem with playing staff and I hope that continues here.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'The brief for me would be to consolidate and stay in the division - but there's an opportunity this year...the Premier League is so close. We're in a great position for a team that's just been promoted but we've got to kick on.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'I've had a lot of texts from managers saying 'you must be mad going in there' but it's a massive club, one of the top five in the country I'd suggest. I'd never be able to live with myself if I didn't take that on.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'I can't put my finger on where there's a problem in the team or a weak link in the squad. I'll be talking about that with Simon Stone and Peter Beardsley.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'But my most immediate concern for any manager is the next game. My immediate focus is that game on Saturday night (at home to Liverpool) and I'm going to maximise my time to prepare the team.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>'Our home form needs to improve, we don't need another down day on Saturday. That's an area we have to look to and make sure we put teams under continuous pressure.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'My own theory about football is that some of the most successful sides create players from within. So I'll be making sure underneath the first team there is a good solid base of young players coming through.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">In my career I've been creative with transfers. I got Yossi Benayoun for small money and took players out of the Championship who did brilliantly for me at West Ham.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'My message is there is a team to be proud of. I can understand the frustration of losing Chris. I'm very much aware the only faith I'm going to gain is by keeping this club in the Premier League, where it belongs.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The 49-year-old is well-known to much-maligned St James' Park owner Mike Ashley and was quickly established as the bookmakers' favourite on Monday, despite the likes of Martin O'Neill and Martin Jol firmly in the jobs market. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Pardew </span>m<span style="font-size: small;">et members of the Toon hierachy at the Slaley Hall country house on Wednesday night to rubberstamp his move and is now set to be paraded at a press conference at 2.30pm on Thursday afternoon.</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Out of work since his sacking by Southampton in August, he is looking to bring in a number of his own backroom and office staff but has faced opposition from his potential new employers. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">At his previous clubs, Pardew has worked with his own assistants, notably Peter Grant, who became Alex McLeish's No 2 at Birmingham in the summer, and Wally Downes, who has just joined West Ham as Avram Grant's assistant. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">He has also had extensive support teams, including sports scientists, nutritionists, masseurs, dieticians and video analysts. Newcastle have cut back on such staff in recent years. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">When Ashley sacked Sam Allardyce, a manager he inherited, he was shocked by the number of backroom staff he was also forced to pay off. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Toon legend Peter Beardsley, who is in charge of the first-team squad as they prepare for Liverpool's visit to St James' Park on Saturday, is one of the key figures the board would like to keep.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Although Hughton fought hard to keep Beardsley away from the first team, the one-time fans' favourite has worked his way into a senior role over the last year and is perceived by the board as an important ally in the PR battle with fans. </span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Pardew, for his part, recognises the importance of having some local influence in his back-up team and will also keep on former England international Steve Stone. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The impasse between Pardew and the St James' board was not a deal breaker and it is thought he will be paid close to the £450,000-a-year Hughton received. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">But it is an early indication of the type of arena he is entering and the difficulties Hughton and his predecessors faced. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Pardew has a number of other difficult issues to deal with, notably the dressing-room unrest and the battle to keep hold of England striker Andy Carroll. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Many fans fear the club will be prepared to cash in on Carroll if the likes of Manchester United, Chelsea or Tottenham follow up early interest with concrete bids. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Pardew is also aware he faces a near-impossible task to win over sceptical supporters. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">On Wednesday, a poll in the city's <span style="font-style: italic;">Evening Chronicle </span>newspaper saw him attract just 14 votes out of 1,000 on who fans wanted as manager. </span></p>
              <div class="artSplitter"><a class="lightboxPopupLink" href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/12/08/article-1336951-0C68221F000005DC-933_634x333_popup.jpg"> <span class="clickToEnlargeButton"> </span> <img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/12/08/article-1336951-0C68221F000005DC-933_634x333.jpg" alt="To do list: Six priorities for Alan Pardew's in tray at Newcastle" width="634" height="333"> </a></div>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Hughton received more backing in the online survey, with Martin O'Neill, who was not even considered for the post, the runaway leader with 42.3 per cent. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Former Spurs boss Martin Jol attracted 32.8 per cent but has also ruled himself out. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Earlier, although they refused to be quoted, the board used another local newspaper to give an explanation for Hughton's dismissal. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">According to 'sources' - believed to be Llambias - the former Ireland assistant manager was perceived to be a coach more than a manager and lacked the experience to maintain Newcastle's top-flight status. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Pardew has managed for 74 games in the Premier League and was relegated with Charlton.</span></p>

              I think it's because Martin O'Neill would cost a lot more than Pardew... Pardew is only getting $450,000 per year while Martin would command anything from $2.5m to $4m per season... That is like even more than what Pardew will earn in his 5 yrs contract... lol. 
              
              So no surprise he is also the one most Newcastle fans wanted according to their fans voting choice... Cos look at where Villa are without him? 3 yrs of top 6 finishing with the same players Houllier presently have...  plus Pires of course...

Pardew is only getting $450,000 per year while Martin would command anything from $2.5m to $4m per season... That is like even more than what Pardew will earn in his 5 yrs contract... lol. So no surprise he is also the one most Newcastle fans wanted according to their fans voting choice... Cos look at where Villa are without him? 3 yrs of top 6 finishing with the same players Houllier presently have... plus Pires of course...</p>

              <p>Sad day for newcastle fans.</p>
              <p>mike ashley like the duo hicks and gillett aren't really there for the club. mike ashley has publicly said he wanted to sell the club. Looking to profit from the club isn't going to make newcastle a better club.</p>
              <p>He wanted to kick hughton a long time ago but at that time newcastle was on a roll, 6-0 aston villa, 5-1 sunderland, 1-0 arsenal, and it was too weird to sack him then so they waited till a bad period and sacked him, but still it was too weird.</p>
              <p>pardew isn't an experienced manager when he has only been in the premier league for less than 2 years, somemore not in top flight club. his ambition for the club is to stay out of relegation when newcastle is challenging(possible) for european football.</p>
              <p>what a joke.</p>
