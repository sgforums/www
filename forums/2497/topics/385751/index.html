              <p> </p>
              <p>
              </p><p><strong>Benitez's position has come under scrutiny as </strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/liverpool/"><strong>Liverpool</strong></a><strong> have exited the 
              Champions League at the group stage and won just three times in 12 matches, 
              slipping to eighth in the Premier League. </strong></p>
              <p>It is thought his job is safe until the end of the season - owners George 
              Gillett and Tom Hicks would struggle to afford to sack him now and appoint a new 
              manager - but Torres nevertheless has spoken out in defence of his fellow 
              Spaniard.</p>
              <p>"I think sacking the manager is not a solution," Torres said. "The manager is 
              not playing so we have to be positive with him, try to work with him.</p>
              <p>"We are the main reason, the players are the people that have to find a 
              solution to the situation. The manager is not playing, so we have to play much 
              better."</p>
              <p>Torres - the subject of speculation that Manchester City may bid for him in 
              the January window - also underlined the bleak future facing Liverpool by 
              admitting that the club cannot afford to buy top-class players in the January 
              transfer window.</p>
              <p>The Spain striker, on whom Liverpool have relied heavily since he moved from 
              Atletico Madrid in 2007, conceded Liverpool need new players.</p>
              <p>Liverpool's American owners are under pressure to cut their £240 million debt 
              and are also facing a £20million cut in income if they fail to qualify for the 
              Champions League next season.</p>
              <p>Torres, speaking in Zurich after being named part of FIFA's world XI, said: 
              "Obviously we need players. If we can bring quality players it should be really 
              positive for us, but I think the situation is really difficult because I think 
              we don't have money to bring in the best players.</p>
              <p>"It's a difficult situation but every top team in the world goes sometimes 
              through a bad situation like Liverpool now.</p>
              <p>"Like every top team in the world, Liverpool will get over the situation.</p>
              <p>"I have confidence in myself and my team. I know we are good enough.</p>
              <p>"We were playing really well last season with the same team. We have to just 
              recover the mentality and the confidence in ourselves and everything will be 
              different."</p>
              <p>Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, also named in the world XI, also called on 
              the team to pull together.</p>
              <p>Gerrard said: "I don't think it's right to pick out individual players.</p>
              <p>"We're a team, we're a group and we are responsible for where we're lying in 
              the league at the moment.</p>
              <p>"All of us have got to stick together and try and pull through and turn it 
              around."</p>
              <p>Liverpool insist any move from Premier League rivals to buy Torres will be 
              resisted. Instead Benítez is thought to be keen on providing him with a foil.</p>
              <p>Bayern Munich are reported to be keen to offload Luca Toni, and Liverpool may 
              try to to persuade the Italian to join them rather than Benfica or Dynamo 
              Moscow.</p>
              <p>Real Madrid’s Ruud van Nistelrooy is another option, possibly in a loan deal, 
              in a move sure to antagonise Manchester United fans.</p>
              <p>Liverpool could then look to sell Ryan Babel, Andrea Dossena, Andriy Voronin 
              and Philipp Degen to balance the books.</p>
              <p>Among the spectators at Anfield on Saturday for the visit of Wolves will be 
              Prince Faisal Al Saud. His last visit, in September, sparked speculation he was 
              about to launch a takeover of the club.</p>
              <p>Liverpool defender Glen Johnson could be questioned by police after a student 
              alleged he was attacked outside a London nightclub, it was reported on Tuesday.</p>
