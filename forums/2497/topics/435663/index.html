              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>'Noisy neighbours' Manchester City have struck a huge blow to their bitter rivals United after snatching Wesley Sneijder from under their noses.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">According to reports in Italy, a £31million feel has been agreed with Inter Milan and the player will sign a £5m-a-year deal. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Sneijder was named in the starting line-up against AC Milan in Beijing for what could be his final appearance for the Serie A club in the Super Cup.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Until now the Dutchman had been heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford with United desperately seeking a replacement for Paul Scholes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But the club seemed unwilling to match the Champions League winner's salary demands and City have swooped instead.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The news will add extra spice to the derby clash in the Community Shield at Wembley on Sunday.</span></p>

              <p>let's not forget where Mancini came from. He may have good ties with Inter's bosses.</p>
              <p>And with fatter paycheck, and not a young WS, may want to consider this his last hurray.  Also, with his pay structure, not sure whether it will cause disruption to MUFC's dressing room. Footballing wise, he is a technical gem, but SAF may not want to rock the boat.</p>
              <p>As for MCFC, I think they are just spending just to get a major trophy. A ticking time bomb.. </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Wesley Sneijder will thrash out his future over the next 48 hours, after his move to Manchester United took a major step closer on Tuesday.</strong></p>
              <p>The Dutch midfielder was hoping to hold formal talks with the Premier League club in London on Thursday, following his country’s friendly international with England at Wembley.</p>
              <p>But the riot-induced postponement of the fixture has moved that process forward, and now the 27-year-old will speak with his club, Inter Milan, on Wednesday to seek permission to begin negotiations in earnest.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>Sneijder hinted this week that informal talks have already begun over the transfer, with the two clubs close to arriving at a fee somewhere in the region of £32million.</p>
              <p>His representatives will be in Milan on Wednesday, hoping to speed up the process, which would allow the player to fly into England to thrash out the terms of a near £200,000 a week contract.</p>
              <p>Inter now accept Sneijder wants to leave, and they are also close to finding an accommodation with United - the two clubs have explored a possible price over the past few weeks through a third party.</p>
              <p>The Dutch star has a tax-free deal in Italy equating to around £250,000 a week, so with United’s wage structure topping out at around £180,000 a week there is still some way to go.</p>
              <p>The Old Trafford club, though, have sweeteners to add to any deal.</p>
              <p>Their worldwide popularity greatly enhances the image rights-related package they can offer to prospective signings.</p>
              <p>Sneijder also has a personal sponsorship deal with Nike - who are United’s main clothing sponsor - and there are suggestions the US sportswear giants could also enhance the deal to ensure the arrival of one of their big-name players at their biggest club.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Manchester United have given up on their bid to sign Wesley Sneijder from Inter Milan.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">United manager Sir Alex Ferguson had been hoping to make the Dutch international his final signing of the summer.</span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But senior Old Trafford sources told Sportsmail that United have now grown tired of a saga that has dragged on since the end of last season and have decided to pull the plug on the deal.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">With 27-year-old Sneijder sitting right at the wrong end of United's age limit for new signings, Ferguson and chief executive David Gill have decided to walk away from a player who was demanding in excess of £200,000-a-week in wages.</span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">United's decision to back off explains the fact that Sneijder's representatives have this week been hawking him around United's Barclays Premier League rivals Chelsea and Manchester City. Neither club have an expressed an interest, with City sources describing the overall cost of the deal as 'mind blowing'.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/08/12/article-2025067-0D52DF8D00000578-194_468x321.jpg" alt="Pretty please: Sneijder is keen on the move to Manchester United, but his wages have proved a bridge too far" width="468" height="321"></span>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>With Sneijder desperate to leave Inter, it now seems very possible that the World Cup finalist will find himself stuck at the San Siro when the transfer window closes at the end of the month.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The only way that United's interest will be rekindled is if Sneijder dramatically drops his financial demands later in the window.</span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">However, United do not expect this to happen and Old Trafford sources last night stressed that the club will do 'absolutely nothing' to resurrect what would have been the big Premier League transfer of the summer. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">It is clear that Inter and Sneijder would have to make the first move.</span></p>

              <p>I'm pretty sure he'll earn more at United even between 170-190k per week, with all the bonuses, shirt sales, adverts and sponsorships. May not be evident in the first few months but it would pick up real quick.</p>

              <p><br>I don't think City wants him... Cos the moment his name was linked to them by some joker trying to pressure United to pay the high sum, They quickly made it very clear they were not interested in him... It seems they are more keen on Nasri... Unless they have Tevez who still want to leave and no one else are offering what they want... May they might swap them just to keep them happy.</p>
