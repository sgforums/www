              The problems with Liverpool for a few seasons have been, they are not able to kill off lesser opponents.  For Stoke, its clearly the case of under-estimation of the opponents:  Arsenal lost, Man U has to labor to win by a goal.  Chelsea also managed to beat them by one goal only.  What does Rafa thinks he can simply go to Britannia and have a stroll in the park?
              
              last season, Liverpool's problem with the rotation, this season, they more or less have a stable squad - thus should be quite formidable.  Watching the match against Newcastle, they simply blow away the opponents.  But against Stoke, they struggled.  Haiz.
              
              It will be interesting to see how Liverpool will cope thereafter.  Gerrard is due to appear in courts &amp; if he genna unfavorable ruling (which I don't think so) - the team performance will be severly affected.

I think thats the way its going to be for the rest of the season at all the away matches after his night club brawl... And it doesn't helps with the court case coming up soon too as more news will keep the case fresh on peoples minds...</p></div>

              <p>Sir
              Alex Ferguson was red-faced with rage earlier this season when
              relatively innocuous remarks by him were, he says, misinterpreted as a
              snide suggestion that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chelsea">Chelsea</a>'s squad was too old to win the title this season The irony is that today Chelsea did play like a team that is past it.</p>
              <p>Finesse
              was not present for much of this afternoon and in its absence the
              fastest, most lively team triumphed. It is not an age thing –
              35-year-old Ryan Giggs was as energetic and alert as anyone – it's a
              question of mentality and in that regard Chelsea looked jaded and
              stale. Michael Ballack and Deco were as lethargic as they have been for
              most of the season, and Joe Cole was doddery. This season they have
              revelled on the road by absorbing blunt pressure and springing sharply
              forward, but United's speed and dynamism – and certainly not their
              passing, which was often as erratic as Chelsea's – meant the visitors
              could not rely on that approach.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's grumpiness was
              compounded by some strange refereeing by Howard Webb - who gave only a
              short Sunday sermon to Wayne Rooney after the striker crassly kicked
              Ashley Cole up the backside in the 25th minute but then booked Jose
              Bosingwa for a far less mean-spirited tackle on Rooney less than 60
              seconds later. And the more cantankerous the Pensioners got, the less
              they focused on their own ailing game. Ballack took to falling over,
              Didier Drogba to bleating and gesticulating and Luiz Felipe Scolari to
              waving imaginary yellow cards.</p>
              <p>No Chelsea player showed the sort
              of nimble thinking that United demonstrated just before the break. The
              canny corner routine worked by Rooney and Giggs proved that United
              remain as mentally agile in training as they can be in matches. They
              have a similar trick they sometimes use at free-kicks, whereby two
              United players deliberately bump into each other as if neither knew the
              other was going to take it and then, as the defence drop their guard to
              mock the apparent mix-up, United quickly deliver. This time, alas, they
              were thwarted because the officials were as sluggish as their
              opponents, but Chelsea did not have the alacrity to use the reprieve to
              reorganise and John Terry found himself attempting to mark two
              opponents when the more conventional re-take was delivered and Nemanja
              Vidic headed into the net.</p>
              <p>Whatever Scolari said at half-time had
              no discernible effect. Bosingwa looked befuddled and almost
              disinterested as he allowed Patrice Evra and Cristiano Ronaldo to
              effortlessly forge space for the former to cross for United's second
              and both Berbatov – who missed his header - and Rooney beat dozing
              defenders to the ball. Thereafter, rather than rally, Chelsea got ever
              more ragged. The ease with which Berbatov poked into the net when
              unmarked four yards from goal was symptomatic of a deep malaise.</p>
              <p>Chelsea
              urgently need new blood, not merely to provide Scolari with more
              options but also to stimulate a listless team. Their problem is,
              however, that Roman Abramovich's appetite also appears to have waned.</p>
