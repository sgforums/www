              <p>One month after becoming Chelsea's sixth manager in as many years, Carlo Ancelotti has a simple message for Roman Abramovich: Stay calm, be patient - and the Champions League will be yours.</p>
              <p>Calmness and patience are not the characteristics we normally associate with a club owner who craves European football's Holy Grail.</p>
              <p>But Ancelotti, 50, draws on his childhood experience to explain the philosophy he believes will - eventually - bring Abramovich the biggest prize in club football.</p>
              <p>The Italian, who was born and raised in a small farming town nestled between Milan and Parma, says: "My father was a farmer.</p>
              <p>"I milked the cows and cut the trees and bushes.</p>
              <p>"The most important produce was milk, which produced parmesan cheese. And the big lesson I learnt was to wait, to be patient.</p>
              <p>"Because he who wants to produce parmesan today has to wait for at least one year before everything is ready for him to make cheese.</p>
              <p>"You plant today and harvest one year or two years later. This is my philosophy with football.</p>
              <p>"It's my style, my way of life.</p>
              <p>"You can't be anxious for the result. If you've done the proper things it will come."</p>
              <p>In the four weeks since accepting the poisoned chalice from the Russian billionaire, the former AC Milan boss has already earned the moniker The Calm One.</p>
              <p>While everyone else was panicking over the John Terry saga, he remained calm. While club officials were talking of the need for a marquee signing, he remained calm.</p>
              <p>When the media told him only instant success would guarantee his job, he made jokes and refused to be ruffled.</p>
              <p>"The most important things are the Premier League and Champions League," says the coach who survived eight years at the San Siro under the extrovert reign of Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister.</p>
              <p>"I think to win both would be a success, but we have to build an identity for the team.</p>
              <p>"Would I make Roman very happy with the Champions League? I think so. But is there pressure on me? No. I want to win a trophy this season and we have the possibility. I have a good feeling about it."</p>
              <p>His two Champions League wins clearly convinced Abramovich Chelsea finally had a manager who could take them into the Promised Land.</p>
              <p>To do that, Ancelotti is determined to abolish the fear factor at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>"I won't shout at the players, I will explain. If I see they're not doing good work I'll have a discussion with them. I'll treat them like men."</p>
              <p>Ancelotti's first big test comes in the Community Shield clash with Manchester United next Sunday.</p>
              <p>He says: "I have respect for United. They are a team with a great tradition.</p>
              <p>"Chelsea, United, Liverpool and Arsenal are all on the same level, though Arsenal have a very young team so maybe they are different.</p>
              <p>"I'm friends with Alex Ferguson. But for 90 minutes our sides play there will be no friendship. Only a big battle."</p>
              <p>His relationship with another rival is less cordial. "Jose Mourinho is not a friend, he''s a colleague."</p>
              <p>Then the country boy reveals he''s off for a night on the town. "I am going to see Mamma Mia. I like Abba. I also like Queen. Ray [Wilkins] said, 'Go see We Will Rock You'."</p>
              <p>At the end of the season, perhaps he will join Roman for a lusty rendition of We Are The Champions.</p>
