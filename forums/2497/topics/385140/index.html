              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> striker <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Nicolas Anelka</span></abbr> has set himself a target of staying at Stamford Bridge until 2014, before a final lucrative move abroad.</p>
              <p>The 30-year-old still has around 18 months left on his current contract with the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> club - but talks over a new deal have been mooted.</p>
              <p>"I would love to sign for another three further years," he told French newspaper <em>20 minutes</em>. "I still have one year left. I see myself playing here until I'm 34. And that would not be the end of my career.</p>
              <p>"Afterwards I don't know. I could go to the Middle East, to Qatar, Abu Dhabi or the United States. I don't know.</p>
              <p>"I have often been criticised for changing clubs. At the same time,
              it's good to experience different things, whether it's in Turkey or
              Spain.</p>
              <p>"Everywhere has enriched me. It's a mentality different to that in France."</p>
              <p>Anelka, who has played in France, England, Spain and Turkey,
              admits a move to the Middle East or America would be little more than a
              money-spinning end to his career.</p>
              <p>"I wouldn't be going to Qatar to play the Champions League," he
              added. "In any case that doesn't exist. It (the money) is the truth."</p>
              <p>"In a way I have never felt as strong on the pitch," continued
              Anelka. "When I was asked to play as an out-and-out striker, you never
              saw me doing what I'm doing now.</p>
              <p>"That's why I always wanted to play behind the striker. Showing
              what I can do other than score goals. I've rarely had the chance to do
              that.</p>
              <p>"When I signed for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> I absolutely wanted to play with Didier up front. From the first year they put us in competition.</p>
              <p>"But to play both of us together is the best solution and
              Ancelotti has understood that well, and me, playing freely, well it's
              extraordinary.</p>
              <p>"The fact that my football has been understood allows me to be happy in life. I know that I am understood."</p>
