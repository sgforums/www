              <p>The <em>Observer</em> says City are convinced that the player
              has had his head turned by the project at Eastlands, bankrolled by Abu
              Dhabi billions, and a revised offer of £40m could seriously test
              Chelsea's resolve.</p>
              <p>They first inquired about him in January, when they were
              prepared to sweeten any move for him with the Brazil striker Robinho.
              It is unclear whether Robinho could yet be used as a makeweight.</p>

              <p>Terry's future at Stamford Bridge has been the subject of intense speculation in recent weeks with <a class="lingo_link" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12.1667px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;" title="Mouse over ^ icon to search." rel="nofollow" href="http://topics.skysports.com/Manchester+City/?section=football">Manchester City</a><img id="lingo_icon" class="lingo_icon lingo_icon_black" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 0pt ! important; padding: 0pt; float: none; position: static; left: auto; top: auto; line-height: normal; background-color: transparent; visibility: visible; width: 12px; height: 12px; background-repeat: no-repeat; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: top; display: inline; cursor: pointer;" src="http://static.lingospot.com/spot/image/spacer.gif" alt=""> lining up a mega-money move for the England international.</p>
              <p>Chelsea
              have snubbed two offers for Terry already, with reports suggesting
              cash-rich City are weighing up a new improved bid for the central
              defender.</p>
              <p>However, Ancelotti, who was unveiled as Chelsea's new
              manager on Monday, expects Terry to stay put and wants the player to
              stay on as captain of the Blues.</p>
              <p>"John Terry is a symbol of this team," said Ancelotti.</p>
              <p>"He will be captain next season. He said he wants to stay forever and we want to keep him forever.</p>
              <p>"Now there is a question of Man City, but for Terry (there is) no price.</p>
              <p>"Terry will be at Chelsea forever.</p>
              <p>"He said he wants to stay, there is no problem for him with us, the story continues - Chelsea and Terry.</p>
              <p>"I
              like to have a captain like Terry, he is very close to (Paulo) Maldini
              for professionalism, for quality and he will be the best captain for
              Chelsea.</p>
              <p>"I spoke with Terry a month ago when I came to the club and he said welcome. And after he went on holiday.</p>
              <p>"I will speak with him because he is the captain and I want a good relationship with the captain."</p>
              <p>When asked if the club would offer Terry a new, improved contract, he added: "It's not my problem."</p>

              <h1>It is impossible for John Terry to leave Chelsea, insists Ancelotti<br></h1>

              <p class="imageCaption">Going nowhere: Carlo Ancelotti insists that captain John Terry will be staying at Stamford Bridge</p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1197928" rel="1197928|3| nofollow" href="/sport/football/article-1197928/It-impossible-John-Terry-leave-Chelsea-insists-Ancelotti.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Carlo Ancelotti claims it is 'impossible' for Manchester City to sign John Terry and insists his iconic skipper is more motivated by success at Stamford Bridge than the millions on offer at Eastlands.</strong></p>
              <p>Ancelotti was grilled on the subject of Terry's future at his unveiling as Chelsea manager. And displaying an already impressive command of English, the Italian was adamant Terry will see out his career at the club despite not having spoken to him for a month.</p>
              <p>He said: 'It's impossible that he'd want to leave. There's no need to convince him because he wants to stay. He stays here for sure. I don't worry. Terry is a great player, but also a great man. When a great man says one thing, it's that. He's not a normal player, he's a symbol for this team.</p>
              <p>'There is no problem. For him, for us, the story continues: Chelsea and Terry. I like to have a captain like Terry. He is very close to (Paolo) Maldini for professionalism and for quality.'</p>
              <p>Urged on by Ancelotti, Chelsea yesterday stepped up their pursuit of Carlos Tevez to put pressure on City who are also bidding to sign the striker.</p>
              <p>ity are expected to raise their £30million offer - which Chelsea rejected out of hand - by a further £5m and are ready to pay the England captain an astronomical £200,000-a-week wage packet.</p>
              <p>Chelsea, however, are understood to be unwilling to improve on the £130,000-a-week Terry receives under the terms of his current deal which has three years left to run.</p>
              <p>The power brokers at Stamford Bridge are believed to be eager for Terry, who returns to training on Thursday, to publicly pledge his loyalty to Chelsea, while Ancelotti's unreserved praise of the 28-year-old has certainly placed the ball firmly in the defender's court.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's unwillingness to do business with City for Terry was spelled out further by their chief executive, Peter Kenyon, who added: 'He's not available at any price.</p>
              <p>'He's got a three-year contract. He's told us he doesn't want to go and we don't want him to go. End of story.'</p>
              <p>Such resistance means Terry has little option other than to hand in a written transfer request to the club where he has spent his entire career should he be determined to push through an extremely lucrative move to Mark Hughes' side.</p>
              <p>But Ancelotti, who also confirmed his intention to keep Didier Drogba, is satisfied Terry will be eager to play for a manager who guided Milan to two Champions League titles and - using the example of their failed £91m bid for Kaka - questioned City's ability to attract the cream of Europe's talent.</p>
