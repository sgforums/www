              <p class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;"> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">JOHN TERRY has been offered a record-busting £300,000-A-WEEK to join Manchester City. The future of the Chelsea and England skipper is now on a knife-edge. </h2>
              <p class="article">Terry, 28, has been blown away by City's offer, which is worth a mind-blowing £15.6million-a-year. But it is a measure of how boss Mark Hughes views the centre-back as crucial to City's development. </p>
              <p class="article">Terry would become easily the world's highest-paid player. His salary would dwarf even that of the footballer closest to him - Cristiano Ronaldo, on £255,000-a- week at Real Madrid. </p>
              <p class="article">Hughes reckons Terry is the key to City bursting into the Premier League's top four and becoming one of Europe's leading clubs. The Welshman is convinced he can get a good five years out of the centre-back, despite some of the injury problems he has suffered in the last couple of seasons, and has long had him on his radar. </p>
              <p class="article">City failed with a move for Terry last season and, though the latest £30m offer has been firmly rejected by Chelsea, SunSport understands the pursuit is far from over. </p>
              <p class="article">In fact, the Londoners are bracing themselves for another bid in the region of £40m. Sources close to Terry say the player is beginning to wonder whether Chelsea really want him as much as they claim and admit he has been impressed by the faith Hughes has in him.</p>
              <p class="article">SunSport can reveal Terry has had no contact with incoming manager Carlo Ancelotti since the Italian got the job and is worried that his influence at Stamford Bridge could be on the wane. </p>
              <p class="article">Terry has become more than just the skipper at Chelsea. He was almost on the board and was the link-man between the players and the hierarchy. Ancelotti may have different ideas about how the club should operate. Yet with Hughes, Terry knows he will be the main man whichever stars arrive. </p>
              <p class="article">Terry currently earns around £150,000-a-week with the Blues, so would be doubling his wages. City are also prepared to pay Samuel Eto'o £250,000-a-week to secure his services from Barcelona. Clearly money is no object to City's Arab owners. </p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea suspect Terry has been tapped up and City sources admit the club would not have made a bid without doing its homework. In other words, they have already found out whether he would be interested in the move before making their official approach. </p>
              <p class="article">SunSport was told: "This one could run for a while. John is really interested in what City have to say. It is not impossible he could leave."</p>

              <p><strong>John Terry is on a collision course with Chelsea's incoming boss Carlo Ancelotti.</strong></p>
              <p>The Italian will be unveiled at Stamford Bridge tomorrow but expects his press conference to be overshadowed by talk of a renewed bid by Manchester City to sign Terry.</p>
              <p>Although Chelsea issued a statement last week dismissing talk of Terry's exit, the Blues hierarchy are amazed at the timing of the bid and Terry's silence.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti is ready to square up to Terry and demand a public declaration of the skipper's loyalty to the club.</p>
              <p>If that is not forthcoming, Ancelotti will fear the England star's head has been turned by talk of a salary exceeding £250,000 a week at Eastlands.</p>
              <p>Terry will be challenged to ask for a transfer. City refuse to throw in the towel in their attempts to prise Terry away from Stamford Bridge and his future at the club appears to be hanging by a thread.</p>
              <p>Some senior Chelsea executives fear City's interest may even lead to new contract demands from Terry, a situation they are not prepared to tolerate.</p>

              <p>I don't think Ancelotti can do anything about it... He is only trying to get Terry to clear the air as I believed Chelsea suspect something is going on behind their back and Terry seems to have his head turned already... Cos it has been a while since this news has been going around and Terry have still not come out to clear the air... It's all very simple if Terry would just say he is not interested and is not leaving and all these would be over in a flash... But its obvious he is giving serious consideration to it given the reported sum...</p>
              <p>For Terry, its definitely worth considering when their offer is said to be $200 to $300k per week for 5 yrs... This could be his last big contract and would go a long way to ensure he goes into retirement with extra loads of cash for his remainding days... Being 'Mr Chelsea' is not going to put extra $$$ in his bank account.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Its gonna be interesting indeed....if Terry goes to Man City for $$$. If he does, it'll just convince me (among many others Utd fans) further that he's a pretender; pretending to be the 'brave' one, pretending to be Chelsea thru and thru etc. He is overrated. A good defender rarely needs to go to ground to make a tackle eg. Maldinin, Ferdinand but the reason he looks good is becoz he is at times forced to make last ditch tackles caused by his own errors. Carvalho has been carrying him all these years.</p></div>

              <h1>Chelsea Boss Ancelotti Seeking John Terry Meeting - Report</h1>
              <h2>As the Italian prepares for his first day at work at Stamford Bridge, his main priority is to sort out the skipper's future...</h2>

They are ready to offer £40 million for his services, with the option of including Robinho, who came very close to signing for Chelsea before moving to Eastlands, still a possibility. <br><br>While the Pensioners initially refused to consider any offers for Terry, his general silence on the matter has forced a re-think. They are adamant that they will not be held to ransom over a new contract offer because of these rumours, while some at the club are reportedly concerned by the amount of power Terry holds at the Bridge. <br><br>Terry, along with the rest of his international colleagues, does not return to <a id="KonaLink0" class="kLink" style="position: static; text-decoration: underline !important;" href="http://www.goal.com/en/news/9/england/2009/07/06/1365970/chelsea-boss-ancelotti-seeking-john-terry-meeting-report#"><span style="color: #0464d1;"><span class="kLink" style="position: relative; font-family: Verdana,Arial; color: #0464d1 !important; font-size: 13px; font-weight: 400;">training</span></span></a> until Thursday, but he has arrived back in London after his holidays, and Ancelotti is keen to meet him as soon as possible, to resolve the matter.</p>

              <p><strong>Manchester City will make an</strong><strong> increased bid of £40 million for John Terry, although any transfer is likely to be dependent on the England captain’s willingness to force the issue.</strong></p>
              <p>Chelsea suspect that Terry may be using City’s interest as leverage in an effort to secure an improved contract, but if he is serious about leaving Stamford Bridge, the club will insist that the defender submits a transfer request as they are determined not to be painted as the villains in any prospective sale.</p>
              <p>City would not have pursued Terry so rigorously had they not been given grounds for encouragement and are refusing to concede defeat despite having a £30 million bid rejected last week.</p>
              <p>Terry would stand to earn about £200,000 a week at City — compared with his existing wages of £135,000 a week at Chelsea — and is said to be impressed by the scale of City’s ambitions, although the club must be aware that they could be being used as a bargaining tool.</p>
              <p>Chelsea would consider opening talks with Terry, whose present contract has three years left to run, about a new deal.</p>
              <p>The tone of the statement Chelsea released last week, confirming that they had “completely rejected” City’s offer, reflected their frustration, but despite encouraging Terry to reiterate his commitment to the club, the defender has yet to do so.</p>
