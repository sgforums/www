              <p>Barcelona have risked enraging Arsenal by using their own TV channel to push for the signing of Cesc Fabregas.</p>
              <p>The
               Catalans are so frustrated at their attempts to prise the midfielder 
              from Arsenal that they are considering Everton's Mikel Arteta as an 
              alternative.</p>
              <p>However, Barca star Andres Iniesta has kept up the 
              public fight for Fabregas by telling Barca TV that the 23-year-old would
               be a perfect addition to their ranks.</p>

              <p>'We all want him to come because he will help us to go up a level - 
              he's very complete,' said Iniesta. 'However, he belongs to Arsenal and 
              the two clubs must understand each other (in order for a deal to be 
              done).</p>

              <p>'He will be very happy here - Barcelona's style of play is very well 
              suited to him.'</p>
              <p>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has tried to brush off Barca's interest as
              'noise', while Gunners chiefs behind the scenes have voiced their 
              displeasure at constant propaganda unsettling their captain.</p>
              <p>Nou Camp president Sandro Rossell complained that the very public 
              pursuit had hurt his chances of signing Fabregas, but he has done little
              to silence his players or colleagues.</p>
              <p>Arsenal rejected an opening £29m bid in June and have made it clear 
              they will not enter negotiations.</p>
              <p>Barca insiders are now hoping Fabregas will try to force a move when 
              he returns to club duites on Thursday, but the Catalans are being forced
              to look at alternative signings.</p>
              <p>Everton star Arteta has been suggested as an alternative by coaches 
              who know him well within the club.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/03/article-1299936-0A6BA614000005DC-190_468x354.jpg" alt="Cesc Fabregas " width="468" height="354">

              </div>
              <p>Like Fabregas, the 28-year-old was a trainee at Barcelona but left 
              for Rangers in 2002 after failing to make the grade.</p>
              <p>His agent says there has not yet been contact from the champions of 
              Spain, but reportedly told newspaper <span style="font-style: italic;">El Mundo Deportivo </span>that Arteta 
              would love to make the move.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Plan B: Barcelona are keen on Everton star Arteta</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The £12million-rated star has told David Moyes that he wants to 
              return home, but the Everton boss won't let him go cheap.</p>
              <p>Arteta and his wife, Lorena, have been told their one-year-old son 
              Gabriel is partially sighted.</p>
              <p>And now the couple plan to return to their homeland in order to be 
              closer to their families for the sake of their son.</p>
              <p>The former Real Sociedad player is gaining admirers in Catalonia 
              because he is seen as a player whose defensive skills are more developed
              than Fabregas.</p>
              <p>His signing would not only be cheaper, but it may also negate the 
              need to replace Yaya Toure.</p>
              <p>Barca technical staff see Arteta as someone who could stand in for 
              defensive midfielder Sergio Busquets - who is lacking cover since 
              Toure's departure to Manchester City - as well as playing in the roles 
              occupied by Iniesta and Xavi.</p>
