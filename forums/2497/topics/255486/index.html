            <div class='col-md body'>Terry scotches 'ludicrous' transfer request speculation<br><br>Captain John Terry has dismissed suggestions that he was ready to hand in a transfer request as 'ludicrous' and insists he is ready to sort out a new long-term contract with Chelsea.<br><br>Terry's future at the club came under increasing speculation in the build-up to the first FA Cup final at the new Wembley, which Chelsea won 1-0 thanks to Didier Drogba's 33rd goal of the season five minutes from the end of extra-time.<br><br>Terry was understood to have rejected Chelsea's latest offer and, according to reports, was on the verge of handing in a transfer request.<br><br>But the victorious Chelsea skipper declared: 'That's ludicrous. I would never do that.<br><br>'Now the season is over for Chelsea, I'd like to think things are going to get sorted out and I'm hopeful we will be in talks.<br><br>'I didn't want to be in talks in the build-up to the FA Cup final and the build-up to what could have been us possibly retaining the Premiership.<br><br>'I told Chelsea to wait and we would go again in the summer. It was not right to go into important games with things on your mind and being unhappy.<br><br>'Hopefully it will be resolved as soon as possible really.'<br><br>Terry's remarks over talks were echoed by chief executive Peter Kenyon who said the club's message to both Terry and vice-captain Frank Lampard had always been positive.<br><br>Lampard, also the subject of difficult negotiations over a new long-term deal, insisted he wanted to remain at the club for life after helping the club lift the FA Cup yesterday, and his comments had also been noted by Kenyon.<br><br>Kenyon said: 'We are talking about major contracts with many issues surrounding them.<br><br>'Both parties want this to happen, and therefore you have got to believe this will happen.<br><br>'The key message from Chelsea to Frank has always been `we want you to stay', and to be fair to Frank his has always been 'I want to stay', so that is a great position to be in.<br><br>'I think it would be settled in the near future. Frank has said he wants it sorting before next season, and we want it sorting before next season.<br><br>'For all parties, it would be the sooner the better.'<br><br>Meanwhile, Terry revealed how match-winner Drogba had inspired Chelsea with a pre-match speech seconds before kick-off when he called all the players into a huddle in the middle of their own half.<br><br>Terry declared: 'Didier called everyone together and gave a great speech.<br><br>'He said `I'm nervous, I know everyone is nervous, but one thing is for sure, I am going to fight, give everything', and he looked every player in the eye.<br><br>'It touched quite a lot of people. I didn't know he was going to do it, he just called everyone together and when he said he was going to fight no matter what and work so hard for the other players, it was special.<br><br>'He has been unbelievable, not only on the pitch but off it as well.'<br><br>Drogba's winner sealed Chelsea's second cup success of the season and earned coach Jose Mourinho a clean sweep of domestic trophies following his arrival at Stamford Bridge in 2004.<br><br>Not surprisingly, Terry could not hide his pride at becoming the first captain to lift the FA Cup at the new Wembley, as well as gaining revenge on United for their title victory.<br><br>Terry added: 'I felt really proud walking up the steps, and getting out on the last line of the walkway was really special.<br><br>'To lift the cup was an amazing feeling. I am just so proud and quite emotional.<br><br>'With what has happened this season with the Champions League and the Barclays Premiership as well, winning the cup on the last day of the season means we are going away really happy. I am really pleased with that.<br><br>'I did feel quite tired when we were celebrating on the pitch but you manage to get your energy from somewhere.<br><br>'On an occasional like that, in a stadium like that, it comes from deep inside and that's what we have shown all year, not just me but everyone.<br><br>'Chelsea were last team to win it at the old Wembley and now we've been the first at the new stadium to win it - that is special in its own right.<br><br>'Maybe a lot of people and the fans wouldn't have accepted us just winning the Carling Cup this season. That's why it was very important to win the trophy.<br><br>'Even though United won the Barclays Premiership three weeks ago, we go away the happiest.'<br></div>
