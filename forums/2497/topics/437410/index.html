              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">THE FA were last night urged to quiz Manchester City's chief executive after a vile e-mail was sent from his account to the cancer-ridden mother of a club player.</h2>
              <p>Defender Nedum Onuoha's mum was devastated when she received the message, which was intended for City's football administrator Brian Marwood — and appeared to be sent by the club's chief executive Garry Cook. </p>
              <p>Cook has denied to Dr Onuoha that he had ever sent the message — which cruelly ridicules her illness — and has insisted to her that someone broke into his own e-mail system as a practical joke.</p>
              <p>But Dr Onuoha, battling an aggressive form of cancer, is not happy with that explanation.</p>
              <p>And last night she asked the FA and Premier League to investigate, handing over all her e-mail evidence to both bodies.</p>
              <p>Dr Onuoha said: "When I opened up my e-mails and saw the message, it was the worst day of my life, even worse than being diagnosed with cancer.</p>
              <p>"I couldn't understand how anybody could behave like that. I'm critically ill.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">THE cancer-stricken mother of Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha has been left 'humiliated and devastated' following a callous e-mail she believes was sent by the club's chief executive, Garry Cook.</h2>
              <p>Dr Anthonia Onuoha, who acts as Nedum's agent, last night sent official letters of complaint to the FA and Premier League about the e-mail she received during her year-long fight against cancer.</p>
              <p>Cook has denied sending the message, explaining his e-mail system was broken into and a full internal inquiry has been launched at City to find the culprit.</p>
              <p>The offensive e-mail emerged after Dr Anthonia wrote to City's football administrator, Brian Marwood, about a contract dispute her son was having with the club.</p>
              <p>In October last year she e-mailed Marwood explaining that, while her body might be "ravaged with cancer and ongoing chemotherapy" she still had her wits about her to argue Nedum's case.</p>
              <p>Two weeks later Dr Anthonia received an e-mail — which appeared to be from Cook and was meant for Marwood — but was instead sent to her.</p>
              <p>The e-mail was addressed 'Brian' then said: "Ravaged with it!!......I don't now how you sleep at night. You used to be such a nice man when I worked with you at nike (sic)."</p>
              <p>A devastated Dr Anthonia replied to Cook the following day saying: "Thanks very much for your insightful e-mail."</p>
              <p>Cook responded, saying he hadn't sent the offending e-mail and that his e-mail account had been hacked while he was on holiday in South Africa for 10 days.</p>
              <p>He insisted that, following an internal investigation, he had learned a member of his staff had sent the e-mail to Marwood as a joke.</p>
              <p>He told Dr Anthonia: "I cannot and will not condone this unacceptable behaviour. I can confirm Brian did not receive this e-mail and disciplinary action is currently underway regarding one of our employees."</p>
              <p>Cook also apologised for "any hurt or embarrassment this may have caused".</p>
              <p>Dr Anthonia said: "When I opened up my e-mails and saw the message, it was the worst day of my life, even worse than being diagnosed with cancer.</p>
              <p>"I couldn't understand how anybody could behave like that. I just cried and cried for hours.</p>
              <p>"I'm critically ill and at that point I was undergoing chemotherapy. I was just so shocked but I couldn't tell Nedum or any of my family because I didn't know how they would react.</p>
              <p>"It's incredible that any human being would write this. It's unforgivable and I still cannot believe it.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">MANCHESTER CITY chief executive Garry Cook was fighting for his job last night.</h2>
              <p>SunSport revealed yesterday how a vile e-mail was sent from Cook's account to the mother of City defender Nedum Onuoha which mocked her battle against cancer.</p>
              <p>City last night confirmed a "board-led review" would begin this morning into the scandal as calls for Cook to resign began to grow.</p>
              <p>The e-mail, which carried the message "sent from my iPad", had been intended for City's football administrator Brian Marwood.</p>
              <p>But instead it was sent to Nedum's mother Dr Anthonia Onuoha, leaving her deeply distressed and anguished.</p>
              <p>Cook later told her he did not send the message, insisting his e-mail account had been hacked into while he was on holiday and that — after an investigation — the culprit was being dealt with.</p>
              <p>However, we can reveal that Dr Onuoha has contacted City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak saying she refuses to believe Cook's version of events.</p>
              <p>We understand she is demanding that Cook admits he sent the offending e-mail and that he apologises for his actions.</p>
              <p>Dr Onuoha has also asked the FA to investigate Cook under rule E3 which covers improper conduct.</p>
              <p>The FA were still considering their position last night but it is understood they may leave it to City to resolve the matter.</p>
              <p>City have issued a statement confirming they will now investigate the scandal.</p>
              <p>The statement read: "Following allegations made to the football club by Doctor Anthonia Onuoha, the club can confirm that a board-led review has been launched into the matter."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, John Hartson last night demanded City sack the person behind the vile e-mail.</p>
              <p>The former Arsenal and Wales striker, 36, bravely beat testicular cancer two years ago.</p>
              <p>He said: "To take the p*** out of a poor woman fighting cancer just sickens me.</p>
              <p>"It's the actions of the lowest of the low. Whoever sent it should be sacked.</p>
              <p>"It's shocking and downright despicable.</p>
              <p>"They should be punished and punished hard. This is someone at one of the biggest clubs in Europe now.</p>
              <p>"I had cancer and came through it. I know what it's like and how it affects people.</p>
              <p>"This lady will be going through hell without having to receive an horrendous message like this.</p>
              <p>"Anyone who pokes fun at people fighting cancer should take a long hard look at themselves.</p>
              <p>"The person is a disgrace."</p>
