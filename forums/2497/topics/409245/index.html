              <p><strong>Inter Milan coach Rafa Benitez has responded to </strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool's</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> </span>claims that he had agreed not to poach players from Anfield by insisting he is not responsible for signing players for the Italian club.</strong></p>
              <p>Reds manager Roy Hodgson has said Benitez would be reneging on an agreement not to raid Anfield for players if he pursued Dutch forward Dirk Kuyt.</p>
              <p>But Benitez, speaking in Monaco ahead of Friday's UEFA Super Cup final between Inter and Atletico Madrid, ducked questions about any agreement.</p>
              <p>The Spaniard said: 'I am the coach and I cannot sign players - that is for the technical director and the chairman.</p>
              <p>'I am fine like this - I can focus on my work on the pitch and that is all. I am the coach, not the manager.'</p>
              <p>Hodgson had denied any knowledge of Kuyt wanting to leave despite suggestions by his agent that talks between Liverpool and Inter are continuing.</p>
              <p>'Dirk has not expressed that sentiment to me,' said Hodgson, who insisted the assurances he had received from Inter president Massimo Moratti last week that the Italians were not intending to buy any Liverpool players still held firm.</p>

              <p>Benitez, who evaded further questions on the subject, will see his side taking on the team supported by his father on Friday.</p>
              <p>'It will be a tough game for us, they are a very talented team with quality players and they have great offensive potential,' he said.</p>

              <p><strong>Rafael Benitez has dismissed the latest jibe from predecessor Jose Mourinho as he attempts to maintain Inter Milan's domestic dominance when Serie A resumes this weekend.</strong></p>
              <p>Mourinho led Inter to the Serie A title last season - the fifth year in a row they have clinched the Scudetto - and followed that up by also clinching the Champions League and Coppa Italia crowns.</p>
              <p>Mourinho has since moved on to Real Madrid but this week claimed Benitez's job would be easy because of the team he had inherited.</p>
              <p>The Spaniard responded by laughing off the Portuguese's comments and questioning why Mourinho chose to leave the San Siro.</p>
              <p>"First of all I'm surprised that Mourinho has spoken because normally he doesn't speak, he talks about nothing," Benitez said sarcastically.</p>
              <p>"He's not here any more but if everything was so perfect then why did he leave? Why did he choose to join another team? That was his decision.</p>
              <p>"It's clear to everyone that this is a good team and it was too when he arrived at Inter.</p>
              <p>"I'm very happy and don't like talking about these things. I think he speaks from outside, but it's better for us to concentrate on the work we must do for Inter."</p>
              <p>Benitez has already contributed to putting one trophy in the Inter cabinet after his side beat Roma 3-1 in the Supercoppa last Saturday.</p>
              <p>Their participation in the UEFA Super Cup against Atletico Madrid means they don't open their Serie A programme against <strong>Bologna</strong> until Monday.</p>

              <p>inter wont turn out the same way as liverpool, i have a feeling he wasnt given the rights to buy and sell, like what he said, he's just a coach, not a manager.</p>
              <p>rafael's tactics okay one, he sidelines instructions also helpful at most times. his major issue is he dont know how to buy, and buy something that only he think is good.</p>

              <p>The Spaniards fully deserved to walk away with the trophy as, after a first-half which held few talking points, they came out stronger after the break and took the lead as Reyes showed determination to break into the area in the 62nd minute and fire in a low effort. </p>
              <p>Inter could not break down a solid Atletico defence and the result was made safe when Aguero tapped in from close range with just seven minutes remaining after good work from Simao. </p>
              <p>Rafael Benitez's side still had the opportunity to pull one back from the penalty spot in the final minutes, but young goalkeeper David De Gea got the better of Diego Milito and palmed his spot-kick away to put the icing on the cake.</p>

              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez insisted he needs more time to make his mark on Inter Milan after the reigning European champions slumped to a 2-0 defeat against Atletico Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup.</strong></p>
              <p>The former Liverpool manager admitted Inter were below par against the Europa League winners, who triumphed through goals by former Arsenal forward Jose Antonio Reyes and Argentina striker Sergio Aguero.</p>
              <p>Benitez said he wants to change some of the things put in place by his predecessor Jose Mourinho but needs time to do so.</p>
              <p>"Some things we will need to do in the same way as we did before and change the way we do some other things,'' said Benitez. "It's clear we will need some time but how long you never know. We have not had much time since the World Cup with the players. We were not at the level we needed to be against a team that was physically stronger and very good tactically.''</p>
              <p>Benitez added that Inter's Champions League group with Tottenham, Werder Bremen and FC Twente was potentially dangerous.</p>
              <p>"It's a really difficult group,'' he said after the match in Monaco's Stade Louis II. "There is not a big difference between the teams and that can be dangerous. This will be very tough.''</p>
              <p>Reyes was named man of the match and expressed his delight at being the matchwinner.</p>
              <p>"It was a tremendous joy,'' he said. "To score a goal in the final is every player's dream.''</p>
