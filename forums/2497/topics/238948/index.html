"I got a mail from Beckham's lawyers which I have passed on to the advertising agency involved but the whole thing is finished anyway.<br><br>"It was never part of my official campaign and I think it's amazing that it has got so much attention. I don't think anybody in Switzerland would really have thought that David Beckham was supporting my campaign or even knew anything about it."<br><br></div>

Pallister says his former Old Trafford team-mate should never have been axed from the national squad in the first place. And he feels Beckham has proved a point with his outstanding displays since being recalled by Real Madrid.</strong><br><br>Pally, who played more than 300 games for United, said: Â“The fact is we still need David in the team. Â“He is a quality player who has shown he definitely still has what it takes to play at the top level, so Steve McClaren should bring him back in from the cold.<br><br>Â“I couldnÂ’t understand why McClaren left him out anyway. Â“People talked about David having a poor World Cup but he scored and created goals. Tell me who has been doing that among the people who have tried to replace him?<br><br>Â“DavidÂ’s experience would be invaluable in the Euro 2008 qualifiers because we suddenly find ourselves under a lot of pressure. Â“But experience isnÂ’t enough if you canÂ’t cut it Â— and I have absolutely no doubts about David on that score.Â”<br><br>Boss McClaren will travel to check on Becks for the first time since dropping him when he goes to watch Bayern Munich host Real in the Champions League on March 7. McClaren will also be able to check on Bayern midfielder Owen Hargreaves.<br><br></div>
