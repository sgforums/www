            <div class='col-md body'>The American goalkeeper joined Everton on a season-long loan deal from United last summer which became a permanent deal in February.<br><br>Premier League rules on loan deals prevent players from playing against their host club but, once the Howard deal became permanent, he was eligible to play against United on April 28.<br><br>The Premier League would not have sanctioned the permanent transfer if United had requested a clause preventing Howard from playing against them.<br><br>But before the match Everton boss David Moyes appeared to suggest that there had been a verbal agreement between the clubs over Howard's omission.<br><br>Moyes said: "While Tim Howard was on loan he would not have been able to play against his parent club, United. But although we have now signed him ourselves, United wanted the loan clause to remain in operation.<br><br>"It was partly the reason we were able to tie up the deal for next season as early as we did, we have abided by their wishes."<br><br>Moyes recalled reserve keeper Iain Turner from his loan to Sheffield Wednesday and, with Everton leading 2-0, the youngster's blunder gifted United the goal which got them back into a match which they went on to win 4-2.<br><br>Premier League spokesman Dan Johnson told the News of the World: "As Howard's is a permanent transfer there is no reason why he could not have played against Manchester United.<br><br>"Had such a clause been included in the transfer we would not have allowed it - it would have been a clear case of third-party interference.<br><br>"We certainly have no record of an agreement between Everton and United that Howard could not play on April 8."<br><br>Reports on Sunday claimed that the clubs could be punished - even docked points - if the Premier League proved there was an agreement between the clubs for Howard to not play.<br><br>The more likely outcome is that the Premier League will seek to tighten up the rules surrounding loan deals between Premier League clubs.<br><br>The Premier League are now waiting for a response from Everton and United.<br><br>http://www.teamtalk.com/football/story/0,16368,2483_2110432,00.html<br><br><span style="color: red;">i was suprised noone post up tis news...haha...</span></div>

It is a fact.<br><br>However, thankfully for you, it will change next season.
