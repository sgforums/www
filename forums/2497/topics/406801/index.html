              United</em></span></div>
              <div class="photowrap"><br></div>
              <div class="photowrap">Manchester United signing <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/146419">Javier Hernandez</a> scored against his new team while playing the first half for old club 
              Chivas Guadalajara as the Mexican side won 3-2 in Friday night's 
              friendly.</div>
              <div class="photowrap"><br></div>
              <div class="photowrap">
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=30">Sir Alex
               Ferguson</a> might not have been too bothered to see Hernandez, who 
              played for United in the second half, on the scoresheet, but the result 
              would not have been so pleasing in his side's final match on their North
               American tour.</p>
              <p>Hernandez made an immediate impact as he netted 
              after just eight minutes, to the delight of the crowd at the new Estadio
               Omnilife. <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/123605">Chris
               Smalling</a>, another United new boy, levelled two minutes later but <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/147355">Adolfo Bautista</a> re-established the lead for the hosts after 38 minutes and Hector 
              Reynoso made it 3-1 just before the hour mark, before Nani pulled one 
              back in the 79th minute.</p>
              <p>Hernandez, who has been given a hero's 
              reception on his return to Mexico, was the centre of attention from the 
              start and was given a standing ovation when his name was read out. And 
              he rewarded the fans who had come to cheer him by becoming the first 
              player to score at Chivas' new stadium, striking left-footed first time 
              from Adolfo Bautista's chest-down to send it into the bottom right 
              corner.</p>
              <p>But just two minutes later, Smalling rose at a corner to 
              head the ball home and draw United level with his first goal for the 
              club. United's players had surely been told to go easy on their new 
              team-mate but they were not entirely reverent, as <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/7624">John O'Shea</a> showed when he fouled Hernandez in midfield.</p>
              <p>Fabio had an effort 
              well saved by <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/146415">Luis
               Michel</a> after 23 minutes, but on the whole it was the Mexicans who 
              were playing the better football. And they went ahead when <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/147354">Alberto Medina</a>'s
               centre was played Reynoso to Bautista who finished right-footed. <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8860">Paul Scholes</a> ensured his own little bit of history five minutes before the break as, 
              fittingly, he picked up the first booking in the life of the new 
              stadium.</p>
              <p>Hernandez swapped teams at half-time, replacing <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/12724">Dimitar Berbatov</a> in the United line-up. But he could do nothing to improve their 
              fortunes as Reynoso headed home from Michel Vazquez's corner. Nani did 
              pull one back late on after good work from <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/108327">Tom Cleverley</a>,
               but there was still time for Juan Antonio Ocampo to hit the post.</p>
