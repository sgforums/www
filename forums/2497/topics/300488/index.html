            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Blackburn boss Mark Hughes will not be taking any risks in the January transfer window.</strong><br><br>The Ewood Park boss has the opportunity to make changes to his squad from Tuesday, but admits he is no rush to spend.<br><br>Hughes believes that any player he brings in must already be attuned to the pace of the Premier League, making business at this time of year more difficult.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mistakes</span></strong><br><br>He told the website: "January is a difficult period to negotiate. You have to be really certain that the players that you're going to bring in can hit the ground running and can improve you.<br><br>"From our point of view, if we spend money then we can't afford to make mistakes. More mistakes are made in January than possibly in the summer window.<br><br>"We'll have a look at the situation and what presents itself. We get lots of phone calls from agents at this time of year, some of them aren't really worth pursuing or even taking the call on occasions.<br><br>"That's the time of the year that we're in and there's a lot of nonsense flying around and speculation about players, so you have to wade through that.<br><br>"If something presents itself and we can do it or we have the ability to do something that will enable us to bring good quality into the club we will always look at that."<br><br><strong>Savage</strong><br><br>Robbie Savage has been linked with a move away from Ewood Park, but Hughes has again insisted the midfielder remains an important member of his squad.<br><br>He added: "There's a lot of speculation. A number of clubs have enquired about the situation. The situation is that Robbie is contracted to Blackburn Rovers.<br><br>"At the moment he's not particularly happy because he's not an automatic choice in the team, but that's the same for the vast majority of players in my squad.<br><br>"At the moment he's not in the team, but he's very much a valued member of the squad and if I feel he's the right player for certain games, he will play."</div>
