              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has challenged his Manchester United players to give him the perfect 70th birthday present - top spot in the Premier League.</strong></p>
              <p>After United wiped out Manchester City's lead by demolishing Wigan at Old Trafford, Fergie urged his squad to claim top spot outright when they host bottom side Blackburn on New Year's Eve.</p>
              <p>City do not play Sunderland until the following day and the United manager seized on the chance to strike a major psychological blow over Roberto Mancini's side in the title race.</p>
              <p>Mancini looks to be feeling the heat already with the City boss reacting to his side's 0-0 draw at West Brom by complaining at the fixture pile-up facing his side in January.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: "As I always say it's a long season. If we're top of the Premier League or joint top with City on New Year's Day, then I'll be happy."</p>
              <p>City play Liverpool on January 3, just 48 hours after facing Sunderland, and Mancini hit out at what he sees as an unfair fixture list which could ultimately handicap his side's title chances.</p>
              <p>"I'm disappointed because we play on January 1 and January 3," said Mancini. "Liverpool play December 30 and then January 3 against us.</p>
              <p>"I think that at this moment this is not correct. I expect United to win their next game.</p>
              <p>"We play away at Sunderland and then against Liverpool 48 hours later.</p>
              <p>"I'm not happy, I don't know why this situation. Two extra days in this moment is not correct.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes the fixture list can do better because for Liverpool to play the game after four days and for us after 48 hours can make a difference."</p>
              <p>United's victory made it eight wins and a draw from their last nine Premier League games since their 6-1 derby mauling by City at Old Trafford two months ago.</p>
              <p>Ferguson paid tribute to the character of his side for continuing their winning run against a backdrop of mounting injuries, with 11 players now missing through injury or illness.</p>
              <p>"We've had a nightmare the last few days," said Ferguson. "Jones came down ill, Smalling is ill, Rio called off with a back injury, while Evans came off injured at half time.</p>
              <p>"It does put some pressure on but fortunately we had a good first-half and we got an early goal which helped us.</p>
              <p>"The consistency of the team is very good now. Injuries are mounting up; we are getting our fair share. I'm certainly hoping Jones and Smalling will recover from illness, which will make a difference.</p>
              <p>"But I think I said some weeks ago that someone was going to suffer and we're really hitting good form now.</p>
              <p>"There's a real goal threat from us from all departments."</p>
              <p>Dimitar Berbatov grabbed the fourth hat-trick of his United career and Ferguson said: "It was the right game for Dimitar.</p>
              <p>"We needed his height to defence against set-pieces and this will help his confidence.</p>
              <p>"He's not had the best of starts to the season in terms of selection, with the options I have in Wayne Rooney, Javier Hernandez and Danny Welbeck."</p>

              <p><span>Fresh from seeing United move level with Manchester City at the top of the Premier League, Ferguson was at Doncaster on Thursday afternoon to see his horse Harry The Viking claim victory.</span></p>

              <p><span>Ferguson will feel it's already been a happy festive season, with impressive victories for his United team at QPR and Fulham followed by a 5-0 win over Wigan on Boxing Day.</span></p>
              <p><span>The Scot will now be preparing for United's final game of 2011 on Saturday, a home clash with Blackburn, which falls on his birthday. </span><span>It's only been a couple of months since Ferguson celebrated 25 years as United boss, with the North Stand at Old Trafford renamed in his honour.</span></p>
              <p><span>And as he reaches a new landmark, his sporting appetite seemingly remains as strong as ever.</span></p>
