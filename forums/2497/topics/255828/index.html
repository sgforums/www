            <div class='col-md body'>Rafa set for Anfield revolution<br><br>Rafa Benitez has already started planning for next season and the early indications are that an overhaul of his playing staff could be made in the aftermath of Wednesday's UEFA Champions League final against Milan.<br><br>Despite having reached the European Cup final for the second time in only three years, Liverpool have failed to mount a serious bid for the Premiership during Benitez's tenure and it is a lack of domestic success the Spanish tactician is keen to remedy.<br><br>Following their Champions League victory over Milan in 2005, Benitez was ruthless in deeming a number of his squad surplus to requirements and again, he has intimated changes could be forthcoming in the summer.<br><br>Armed with a handsome transfer chest courtesy of backing from American owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks, Benitez has already earmarked several new faces as he bids to create a side capable of pushing for the Premiership.<br><br>"We know we can improve and we will do by bringing in new players with character, quality and experience. We must keep going forward," said Benitez.<br><br>"I feel we are going in the right direction but this final is just a stopping point on the way to where we want to be.<br><br>"A second Champions League final in three seasons shows what can be done but we want to achieve even more. This is going to be an important summer because we want to maintain our progress and keep going forward next season.<br><br>"Another European Cup would be very welcome but the aim is not just to win this trophy, it is to be stronger all round, so we can make a better challenge for the Premiership next season."<br><br>Liverpool finished the domestic season 21 points behind Manchester United but confident everything is geared for success at Anfield, Benitez is predicting a bright future for all those involved on Merseyside.<br><br>The former Valencia chief is well aware he will have absolute financial backing in the pre-season and it will likely be a busy summer of arrivals and departures at Anfield.<br><br>"I am happy with my players but we need to improve to challenge in the Premiership," he added.<br><br>"We want to achieve even more. It is important not to think that by getting to the final we have done everything, because we have the potential to be one of the biggest clubs in Europe in every way.<br><br>"We are already one of the most famous names in football, but we have the chance to take advantage of our position - it will be an important summer.<br><br>"The new owners have already seen what is possible here. Every time we have spoken, it has been positive, and we will talk again after the final."<br></div>
