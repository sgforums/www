              <h2>GALLAS WANTS TO GET UGLY</h2>
              <div><span id="intelliTXT"><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/08/09/240/William-Gallas-Arsenal-2008-West-Brom_1239229.jpg" border="0" alt="Gallas - disappointed after derby."></span></div>

              <div><span><strong>William Gallas believes Arsenal must stop putting so much emphasis on playing "beautiful football".</strong> </span></div>
              <div><span>
              <p> </p>
              </span></div>
              <div><span>The Gunners have again received plaudits this season for their attractive style of play but have also slipped to a number of shock defeats. Stoke beat Arsene Wenger's men 2-1 on Saturday, just three days after Tottenham had fought back to salvage an incredible 4-4 draw at the Emirates. </span><span>And Gallas feels Arsenal need to learn to be more flexible and not be afraid of adopting an 'uglier' approach at times.</span><span> </span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"Maybe we give too great importance on playing beautiful football," the Frenchman said in the <em>News of the World</em>. "I agree with Gael Clichy, who said you need to boot the ball into touch on occasions to preserve your lead. "But I think our main failing is that we are not always clear in our minds."</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div id="articlebody">
              <p>Gallas admits it was devastating to drop two points against Tottenham, as Jermaine Jenas and Aaron Lennon both struck in the closing stages. He said: "It is really infuriating. We lacked clear-sightedness and we made mistakes that we paid for in full.</p>
              <p>"I scored in the game but the pleasure has been spoiled by the result. It felt like a defeat. "There is great disappointment, especially as we let ourselves get pegged back in the final few minutes."</p>

              <p><em>Wenger: 'Did they hurt us deliberately? Of course they did'</em></p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1083029" rel="1083029_3" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1083029/Cowards-Angry-Wenger-accuses-hard-men-Stoke-setting-hurt-Arsenal-players.html"> </a></p>
              <p><strong>A furious Arsene Wenger has accused Stoke players of deliberately trying to injure Emmanuel Adebayor, Theo Walcott and Bacary Sagna, branding those responsible cowards.</strong></p>
              <p>The trio were forced out of the defeat at the Britannia Stadium on Saturday as Arsenal failed to cope with Stoke’s physical approach. But although Wenger insisted he had no qualms about the result, he was incensed at Ryan Shawcross’s tackle on Adebayor, Rory Delap’s on Theo Walcott and Andy Griffin’s on Sagna.</p>
              <p>I read that my team were not brave,’ raged the Arsenal manager. ‘I can say that they are brave and for me, you need to have more courage to play football when you know that someone is tackling you from behind without any intention to play the ball.</p>
              <p>‘The only intention is to hurt you and I can show some tackles where I can prove what I say. The one who is tackling is not the brave one. For me the brave one is the player who is trying to play football.’</p>
              <p>Asked whether the intention had been to deliberately hurt his players, Wenger said: ‘Yes, of course. It happened at the weekend. 'Do you think Delap tried to play the ball when he tackled Walcott? Or that Shawcross tried to play the ball when he tackled Adebayor off the pitch. All the players have been injured deliberately.</p>
              <p>‘We cannot stop it. We can be guided by the way we want to play the game by showing courage, being resolute and being determined to dictate the way we see the game.</p>
              <p>'I think that’s the right one. I am not ready to listen to things that are completely untrue and make people look brave who are cowards, for me.’</p>
              <p>Wenger will be without Walcott and Adebayor for tonight’s Champions League encounter at home to Fenerbache but Sagna is in contention. Looking to bounce back from the capitulation against Spurs and the defeat to Stoke, Wenger said: ‘The problem this season is that we have not been efficient in some games but as well we have just had a run of seven games unbeaten and I still think on Saturday we had a little hangover from a huge disappointment we had against Tottenham.</p>
              <p>‘We lost a game but we are six points behind the leaders, it is the start of November and we have plenty of quality to get it back. The same people who say we are not good, let them say in three weeks when we are the best.</p>
              <p>‘For example, we drew 4-4 against Tottenham but we had an outstanding performance. That's what I believe. Let's re-establish what we have not done well recently, defend together as a team and continue to play in a positive way.’</p>
