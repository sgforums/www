              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The Thierry Henry cheat storm could see Michel Platini's radical plan for five referees introduced in time for the World Cup.</strong></p>
              <p>FIFA president Sepp Blatter has called an emergency meeting of the world governing body's executive committee in Cape Town next week and the controversy surrounding the Republic of Ireland's play-off elimination by France in Paris will be at the top of the agenda.</p>
              <p>The meeting, which will come 24 hours before the ExCo were due to convene on December 3, has also been called in response to the hundreds of arrests across Europe by officers investigating corruption in football.</p>
              <p>But Blatter wants to have his say on the double handball by Henry that enabled France to score the goal that denied Ireland a place in next week's draw for South Africa and, according to FIFA insiders, he might recommend to IFAB - the game's law makers - that they look at Platini's plan for two further assistant referees.</p>
              <p>While both Blatter and UEFA president Platini remain strongly opposed to the introduction of video technology, Platini has used this season's Europa League as a platform for his proposal.</p>
              <p>An additional assistant referee would have almost certainly spotted Henry juggling the ball before guiding it into the path of William Gallas and it is understood Blatter now recognises the value of such a change.</p>
              <p>Scottish FA chief executive Gordon Smith, who sits on IFAB, said: 'I've no doubt Michel Platini will use this incident to push the system and they may now decide to put it to IFAB that they want to have it at the World Cup.</p>
              <p>'I feel that it has its advantages at the highest levels of the games. When there's massive TV coverage the problems are highlighted all over the world.'</p>
              <p>IFAB meet in March and normally any change to the laws of the game - assuming it receives the required support of 75 per cent of the votes - would not be implemented until the following season.</p>
              <p>But there is nothing in the statutes that says such a change could not be introduced for the start of a major tournament, with the World Cup kicking off on June 11.</p>
              <p>FIFA's ExCo also plan to examine the violence that married Egypt's play-off encounter with Algeria in Cairo, in which the Algeria team bus was stoned.</p>
              <p>The governing body said: 'Due to recent events in the world of football, namely incidents at the play-offs for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, match control (refereeing) and irregularities in the football betting market, the FIFA president has called an extraordinary meeting of the executive committee. It will take place in Cape Town on December 2.</p>
