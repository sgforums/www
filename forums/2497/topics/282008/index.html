            <div class='col-md body'><strong>CalderÃ³n: 'I Was Concerned I Would Miss The Opera'</strong><br><br>RamÃ³n CalderÃ³n was in good spirits after being held by police at JFK Airport in New York and admitted that he was only worried about missing the opera.<br><br>"They acted appropriately, " he explained. "The only bad thing that happened was they refused to listen to me.<br><br>"Of course, I told them a thousand times I wasn't the person they were looking for. I told them I was president of Real Madrid, but they wouldn't listen.<br><br>"I must say I am disappointed by some of the reporting of this. I've already seen on the internet some claims I was stopped over 'strange circumstances'. What rubbish! What happened to me, has happened to many people travelling from Spain. You just have to laugh about it."<br><br>CalderÃ³n was in New York to see Gaetano Donizetti's opera Lucia di Lammermoor but arrived moments before the performance started, although he was in time for dinner afterwards.<br><br>"The only concern I had was my wife and I would miss the opera," he continued. "But we managed to get to the theatre five minutes before it began. We had dinner with Placido Domingo, a great Madridista, afterwards and joked about the incident."</div>
