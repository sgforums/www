              <p><strong>Cesc Fabregas has hinted that he would consider his position at Arsenal if they don't win any trophies this season.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Spaniard has repeatedly stated he is happy in North London, but has often suggested he may wish to return to his homeland at some point in the future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Daily Telegraph quotes the midfielder as saying he would like to go back to Barcelona, the club at which he started his career, and from whom he was signed by Arsene Wenger as a 15-year-old.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I would like to try to win more titles here, although next season we'll see" Fabregas said. "It would be a dream to return to Barcelona one day."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, Fabregas went on to praise the structure of his present club, and said he wasn't ready to leave Arsenal just yet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It is wonderful to see so many players from the youth system in the team, so well adapted to the philosophy of the club.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I decided to give my all for Arsenal and I'm not the kind of person to just give up on things just like that."</p>

              <h1>Cesc: Barcelona Return Would Be A Dream</h1>
              <h2>The young midfielder has stated that although a move is not in his immediate plans, he would like to return to Barcelona at some point in the future.</h2>
              <p> </p>

              <p><em>Fabregas speaking in an interview with radio station Rac-1</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Fabregas strained to express that his current goal is to give 100% to Arsenal, the team who have nurtured his potential and moulded him into one of Europe’s most influential midfield players.</strong><br><br>However, three seasons without a trophy have left Fabregas looking enviously at the club he left at 15. The 21 year-old was speaking in an interview with radio station Rac-1, in which he discussed how he loves watching Barcelona on television, and enjoys the ‘player’s connection to each other in an attacking philosophy’.<br><br>Cesc revealed that he was in constant contact with ex-Arsenal team-mate Aliaksandr Hleb, and refused to rule out the possibility of moving on next summer. Fabregas said: "Right now I'm fine at Arsenal but I cannot deny that to return and play for Barca would be a dream come true for me.</p>
              <p class="article">"I chose to stay at the club last summer and right now I'm totally focused on the reason for that decision which was to try and win trophies. "We'll see how things have gone by the end of the season. The fact is that Barca are playing 'cinematic' football right now and it's fantastic to see that the other day when they beat Atletico 6-1 they had seven or eight guys who, like me, came through the club's youth system.</p>
              <p class="article">"Every week I chat to Alex Hleb on the phone because he's the guy I miss at Arsenal. He's a friend and I also loved playing with him. "He always looks for you with a pass and if you give him the ball you can always count on getting it back at the right time."</p>
              <p>The Spanish European champion also held out particular praise the irrepressible Lionel Messi. Fabregas said of the Argentine: “He has a great future if he can stay clear of injuries. For me, he is the best there is.” <br><br>Also given an honourable mention were the midfielder's international colleagues, Xavi and Iniesta, whom he says ‘always manage to play at a consistent level, even if Ronaldinho and Deco were the stars of the team.’<br><br>The midfielder struck in injury time to grab Arsenal a vital point at the Stadium of Light, after Grant Leadbitter had appeared to give the Wearsiders an unlikely victory. Arsenal will need their playmaker adding more goals to his game if the London side are to have any chance of mounting a title charge.</p>

              <p><em>The way things were: Cesc Fabregas and former Gunners team-mate Alex Hleb</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1076556" rel="1076556_3" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1076556/Hleb-Signing-Cesc-absolutely-Fab-Barcelona.html"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Barcelona midfielder Alexander Hleb admits he has been trying to persuade former Arsenal team-mate Cesc Fabregas to join him at the Nou Camp.</strong></p>
              <p>Spain international Fabregas vowed earlier this week that he would one day like to return to Barca, the club he left to join Arsenal in 2003, and for Hleb that day can not come soon enough.</p>
              <p>Hleb moved to Barca this summer after three seasons at the Gunners, and the Belarus ace would be delighted if the highly-coveted Fabregas followed suit.</p>
              <p>Hleb said in El Mundo Deportivo: "We get on very well on and off the pitch. For me he is like a brother. We call each other a lot to talk about things. "He tells me he misses me at Arsenal and, without wanting to detract from anyone, I would love it if he came to Barca to be a part of all this."I don't stop insisting that he should return to Barca and he doesn't stop insisting that he is very happy at Arsenal and with Arsene Wenger.</p>
              <p>"I will keep boring him until he changes his mind. If in the end he listens to me, I think it would be great for Barcelona."</p>
