              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Ronaldo finally looks set for the move.</em></p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1167180" rel="1167180|3| nofollow" href="/sport/football/article-1167180/EXCLUSIVE-This-time-Real--Madrid-confident-capture-Ronaldo-75m-world-record-deal.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Real Madrid believe they will finally complete the record-breaking £75m transfer of Cristiano Ronaldo from </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> this summer.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span> understands that the Spanish giants are sure they have the foundations of a deal in place with the player and with the English and European champions. United continue to deny that there is an agreement and are sticking to their very public stance that Ronaldo is not for sale.</p>
              <p>However, it is also the case that a select group of European super agents are now convinced that United's resistance to the deal will finally be broken in the coming weeks and that the biggest transfer in English football history will finally take place at the end of the season.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo has coveted a switch to the Bernabeu for more than 18 months and was only convinced to give life at Old Trafford another go after the personal intervention of manager Sir Alex Ferguson last summer. But it was always likely that Madrid would come back for the World and European Player of the Year and at Real, at least, there is now cast iron confidence that Ronaldo will be the latest superstar to wear the all white of Spain's most famous cub.</p>
              <p>Madrid's proposed deal includes a £75m transfer fee - to include a down-payment of more than £50m - and wages in excess of £200,000-a-week for Ronaldo. They believe this is now acceptable to United and to the player.</p>
              <p>The news will disturb United fans but not surprise them. Ronaldo has enjoyed a productive season at United since returning from an ankle problem which delayed his start to the campaign but he has not quite been the inspirational, all-conquering force he was when he led the team to the Premier League and Champions League double last season. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/03/article-0-0141D64400000578-579_306x387.jpg" alt="Ferguson and Ronaldo" width="306" height="387">

              </div>
              <p><strong>Just two weeks ago, <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span> revealed that there are increasing fears within Old Trafford that Ronaldo, who cost United £12m when signed from Sporting Lisbon in 2003, will bring his time in England to an end, due in part to the physical treatment dished out by Premier League defenders on a weekly basis.</strong></p>
              <p>But it has now emerged that Madrid were sure they had got their man weeks ago. Back in December, for example, Real director Pedro Trapote gave a recorded but off-the-record interview to Spain's El Mundo newspaper, which subsequently became public. He said: 'If you are asking me what we are going to do now, then I would tell you that we have already signed the best player for the summer.</p>
              <p>'It is Cristiano, there is no other. It is better that we do not say anything at the moment though.' Ronaldo is expected to be in the United team that faces Aston Villa at Old Trafford tomorrow and may even play up front with Carlos Tevez as an emergency striker as Dimitar Berbatov is injured and Wayne Rooney is suspended.</p>

              <h3>ALEX FERGUSON is set to snatch French ace Franck Ribery from Barcelona's fingertips this summer. </h3>
              <p>The Spanish giants believe Manchester United have already done the deal with Bayern Munich. And that is a clear sign that Cristiano Ronaldo will finally be on his way to Real Madrid. Barca want to build on what looks like a certain La Liga crown by capturing the Bayern Munich star. But sources at the Nou Camp are convinced Ribery is heading for Old Trafford, suggesting that United are well advanced with preparations for life without Ronaldo.</p>
              <h4>Gap</h4>
              <p>Ribery, who will be 26 on Tuesday, is understood to have just signed a £1.2m a year sponsorship deal with Nike, keeping him with them until 2014. Both United and Barcelona are Nike-backed and the Spanish team look favourites to take the French winger from Adidas-backed Bayern in the summer. </p>
              <p>But it is United who are in pole position, with the need to fill the gap left by a departing Ronaldo seen as the driving force. </p>
              <p>Despite strenuous claims to the contrary from Old Trafford, Real Madrid officials are convinced that Ronaldo agreed last summer to join at the end of this season, a deal that will not be affected by a change of president at the Bernabeu.</p>
              <h4>Boasted</h4>
              <p>Former president Ramon Calderon boasted: "Thanks to me, one of the best players in the world will arrive at the end of this season. </p>
              <p>"Last summer was not the right moment for him to come but Real Madrid has the money to get the best." </p>
              <p>Madrid newspaper Marca quoted Ronaldo's godfather Fernao as saying in Portugal: "Real need to sign Ronaldo. The error of last year was to talk to much about it. </p>
              <p>"This year, hardly anything is being said, so I'm sure negotiations will run much more smoothly."</p>

              <p>Benezma can play on either left or right wing, that way he can either be a direct replacement for Ronaldo, or we can 4 solid strikers again like we used to have in 1999</p>

              <p><br> To be frank, i've never seen Benzema play one single good game. He
              flopped at Euro08. Maybe i dont watch enough Lyon and France
              games.</p>
              <p>Ribery looks good but can't match the pace of Ronny.</p>

              <p>Hmm, Benzema just recovered from a goal drought.</p>
              <p>Might be the reason why the gap between top 2 at the French League is only 3 points, Lyon normally runs away with it.</p>

              <p>I would tink that its a good deal for Manchester.. The Devils play has been too predictable for the last three matches.. Sent 2 person to mark Ronnie when he gets the ball or tackle him at all cost when he had the ball..</p>
              <p>I tink the trickery of Ribery can spark Devils offence to a new level.. Sadly, i tink the purchase of Berbacock is a total flop.. Did not manage blend into the Devils quick offense well.. I tink the speed of Bezema would be definately more exciting to watch.. I hope Tottenham would buy back Berba at a discount price.. Haahaa..</p>

              <p>haha, same thing will happen to Ribery if he comes too.. He will get hacked all the time.Furthermore, he needs time to adjust to EPL.</p>

              <p><strong>Franck Ribery will not be leaving Bayern Munich at the end of the season according to Jurgen Klinsmann.</strong></p>
              <p>The France international, who scored both winners in the double
              clash with Lithuania, has been linked to Real Madrid, Barcelona and
              Chelsea in recent months, following outstanding displays in the German
              league.</p>
              <p>But Klinsmann has ensured Allianz Arena fans that the attacker is
              not for sale and will not leave Bavaria after two seasons with the club.</p>
              <p>“Franck is staying at the club whatever happens,” Klinsmann told Munchner Merkur.</p>
              <p>“We have decided so, and from now on you are aware of it.</p>
              <p>“I have always told Franck to take speculation as a compliment, but as a club we also have huge targets.”</p>
