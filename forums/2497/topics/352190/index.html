              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">CESC FABREGAS was sensationally accused of spitting at Hull assistant manager Brian Horton. The Arsenal skipper allegedly stormed over to Horton after the Gunners’ controversial 2-1 FA Cup win and gobbed at him on The Emirates pitch. </h2>
              <p>Injured Fabregas watched from the bench as the Gunners came back from behind to win the quarter-final 2-1 before clashing with Horton in the tunnel. That came after a William Gallas winner which Hull boss Phil Brown called 'a disgrace' because of an offside claim.</p>
              <p class="article">Hull boss Phil Brown raged: “I was there, I witnessed it. Fabregas spat at our assistant manager. That’s their club captain. Hopefully he’s proud of himself. He spat at his feet.”</p>
              <p class="article">But last night a stunned Fabregas phoned The Sun to vehemently deny the claim. He insisted: “I absolutely and categorically deny I spat at anyone and I cannot understand why Hull are making these accusations against me. </p>
              <p class="article">“I have never spat at anyone in my life. It is a disgusting habit. Why would I do something like that after a match I was not even playing in? “I was on the pitch at the end of the game celebrating with my team-mates but I promise I did not do anything wrong.”</p>

              <p class="article"><strong>Arsenal clinched a semi-final clash against Chelsea at Wembley on April 18 with a controversial late William Gallas winner after Robin van Persie had cancelled out Nicky Barmby’s opener.</strong> </p>
              <p class="article">Tigers chief Brown added: “I’m not bothered if Fabregas apologises. I don’t even accept apologies from my own players. “For Arsenal’s club captain Cesc Fabregas to spit at my assistant Brian Horton shows you what this club’s about.” </p>
              <p class="article">There were further claims that Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, Hull No 2 Horton, Barmby and Gunners stewards were involved in a tunnel bust-up at half-time. </p>
              <p class="article">Arsenal gaffer Wenger also refused to shake Brown’s hand at the final whistle. Brown felt he was cheated out of a replay by Gallas’ late winner, which was clearly offside. </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/03/17/article-0-03F43B18000005DC-493_306x246.jpg" alt="Phil Brown" width="306" height="246"></p>

              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"><strong>The manager added: “I can’t use that word I’m afraid — but that’s the case. I’m glad you said that word . . . thank you. “We lost the game unfairly. But I didn’t use the word cheat, you did.</strong> </p>
              <p>Riley allowed Arsenal's 84th-minute winner to stand, even though goalscorer William Gallas was in an offside position when he headed it in. Brown said: 'You are not going to get the rub of the green when you come to places like the Emirates.</p>
              <p>Wenger dashed straight down the tunnel at the end without shaking Brown's hand, and claimed he knew nothing about the spitting incident. Brown said: 'He never shakes my hand. Maybe he's still sore we beat them here last time.'</p>
              <p>Fabregas added: “It was not until half an hour after the game that I heard what Hull were saying about me and it is not something that is easy to accept. “I understand Hull are angry and frustrated about going out of the FA Cup. “But I don’t know why they are saying these things about me because it did not happen. That is the truth. </p>
              <p class="article">“I don’t even know who the assistant manager of Hull is or what he looks like. “I am told Hull will be making an official complaint to the FA about me. </p>
              <p class="article">“Well, I am perfectly relaxed about that. I have nothing to hide. Not one drop of spit left my mouth. I am certain of that.” </p>

              <p>Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas has denied
              Hull City accusations that he spat at assistant manager Brian Horton
              during last night's bitter FA Cup victory.</p>
              <p>Fabregas, who once clashed verbally with Mark Hughes after a match
              against Blackburn, said: "I can categorically deny that I spat at
              anyone after the match. I have never done this in my career on the
              pitch, so why would I do it when I'm not even playing?</p>
              <p>"I can understand the frustration of losing the game to a
              dubious goal, but it's not the fault of me or any of the Arsenal
              players."</p>
              <p>Horton had been locked in a touchline dispute with Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger for much of the game.</p>

              <p>I watched the match and it was really hard to tell if that Gallas goal is an offside or not. If the ball from the corner was headed by Djourou into the path of Gallas it was indeed an offside. But if the ball was punched into Gallas's path by the keeper, then its not offside. It was very difficult to say if it was offside or not. From the replays I still can spot which is which.</p>
              <p>But Arsenal won and its good news. Hull City score via a deflected shot and that is all.</p>
              <p>Hull City just isnt good for the premier league, they make the premier league looks dull. Even if they survive this season, I think they will go down next season. Their players are old, average I think is 30-31 yrs. Oh my god... the Ah Pek team.</p>
              <p>And one last thing about them, I just dont understand why are their team all wearing the stupid Tigerish tie. It is ther fucking most ugly tie that i have seen in the world. It is much much much more unglier than my secondary school tie.</p>

              <h2>FA AWAIT INFO ON `SPITTING` ROW</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"><img id="mainpic" src="http://images.football365.com/09/03/Others/299440.jpg" alt="FA Wait On Referee Report" width="224" height="193"></div>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>The Football Association are aware of the allegations of spitting by Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas which overshadowed Tuesday night's FA Cup tie with Hull, but await the referee's report and any possible formal complaint from the Tigers' coaching staff.</strong></p>
              <p>Hull boss Phil Brown said he witnessed Fabregas - who denies the allegations - spitting at assistant manager Brian Horton in the tunnel after his side were controversially beaten 2-1 in their quarter-final tie with a late offside goal from William Gallas.</p>
              <p>Horton was thought to be considering making an official complaint to the FA, who are also waiting to see whether referee Mike Riley has mentioned anything in his report.</p>
              <p>Even though Fabregas, who is on the verge of a comeback from three months out with a knee injury, was not in the Arsenal playing squad, the FA still maintain disciplinary jurisdiction.</p>
              <p>However, because the alleged incident was not an on-field matter, it would not fall under the 'fast-track' system and so any investigation would seek submissions from all parties involved, as well as any potential television evidence.</p>
              <p>Fabregas released a statement denying the allegations. "I categorically deny that I spat at anybody after the match," he said. "I have never done this in my whole career on the pitch, so why would I do it when I am not even playing?</p>
              <p>"I can understand the frustration of losing a game to a dubious goal, that has happened to me many times in my career as well. "But this is not the fault of me or any of the Arsenal players."</p>
              <p>Aside from the post-match row, Brown was upset about Gunners boss Arsene Wenger attempting to get Hull players booked for time-wasting. The visitors - who took the lead through Nick Barmby in the 13th minute before Robin van Persie levelled in the second half - were cruelly denied a replay when Gallas headed in an equaliser, despite looking offside.</p>
              <p>Brown felt Riley "succumbed to local pressure" in the second half after his players were jeered by the crowd. "Mr Wenger decides to join in and the result is my goalkeeper getting booked in the second half," he said.</p>
              <p>Wenger, though, was upset with Brown for talking about incidents in the tunnel. "It is very disappointing for him to do that. I will just stick to what I said now - I won't talk about this in public," he said.</p>

              <p>The Spaniard strongly denies the claims, Fabregas released a statement denying the allegations.

              <p class="article-icon-links-container"><em>Fabregas what was he doing on the pitch dressed like a hoodie.</em></p>
              <p class="article-icon-links-container"> </p>
              <p><strong>Cesc Fabregas is set to escape punishment over the allegations of spitting which marred Arsenal's progress to the FA Cup semi-finals because the match officials failed to monitor the tunnel area.</strong></p>
              <p>But the midfielder came under renewed attack from Hull City manager Phil Brown yesterday and his snarling post-match antics are bound to attract further scrutiny.</p>
              <p>Referee Mike Riley and his assistants abandoned normal after-match protocol on Tuesday night as they felt under siege from angry Hull City players disputing the late winner by William Gallas.</p>
              <p>Usually it is the job of the fourth official and the linesman on the touchline nearest the tunnel to move inside and keep an eye on players as they enter the dressing rooms, while the referee and the other linesman stay outside to make sure everyone leaves the pitch safely.</p>
              <p>But after an incident-packed tie at the Emirates Stadium, Riley and his team headed quickly to their room to avoid the protests. They did not witness any flashpoint involving Fabregas and Hull's assistant manager Brian Horton and there are no CCTV cameras in the tunnel area.</p>
              <p>Fabregas, who missed the game through injury and watched from seats behind the Arsenal bench, has been accused by Brown of spitting at Horton's feet after a verbal exchange which started on the pitch after Arsenal's 2-1 win.</p>
              <p>Fabregas denies the allegations but Brown reiterated his claims yesterday and the FA have written to Brown and Horton asking for an explanation. Asked in a BBC 5 Live interview whether others had seen the spitting incident, Brown snapped: 'Are you questioning my integrity? I witnessed it.'</p>
              <p>Asked whether he stood by his post-match remarks, Brown added: 'Absolutely, 100 per cent. For one, being on the pitch after the game; two, dressing in the manner he was dressed and three, the pictures emphasise the aggression he was showing to my players and staff.</p>
              <p>'Then I witnessed him going down the tunnel and turning round and spitting at my assistant manager's feet. Whatever way you look at it, it doesn't matter, he addressed that spitting incident at my assistant manager.</p>
              <p>'The referee and linesmen had gone down the tunnel and were probably well inside their room, the same as Mr Wenger and the majority of the Arsenal staff and players.'</p>
              <p>Riley's match report contains no mention of the incident and the lack of independent witnesses will make any investigation very difficult.</p>
              <p>Perversely, the one person who may end up facing an FA charge is Brown. The FA were last night studying his wide ranging post-match rant which included an attack on referee Riley, who he claimed had been influenced by the home crowd and Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger.</p>
              <p>Brown is due to appear before an FA disciplinary committee today to answer a charge of improper conduct arising from an FA Cup third-round replay at St James' Park in January, when he and Newcastle manager Joe Kinnear were both sent to the stands after a bust-up.</p>
              <p>The Hull City boss has developed a reputation as an abrasive character and his No 2 Horton is also renowned for standing his ground on the touchline.</p>
              <p>City will be fined £25,000 for accumulating six yellow cards during the Arsenal game but yesterday Brown was still fuming about what he considers to be the disrespect shown to his club by Fabregas.</p>
              <p>The Spaniard is thought to have repeatedly told Hull City's players and their coaching staff to 'f*** off back up north you w*****s'. Sportsmail can reveal that Hull City's players then had to be restrained from attacking the Arsenal midfielder and his teammate Emmanuel Adebayor in the tunnel.</p>
              <p>Despite missing the flashpoint, Riley is unlikely to be in trouble for making a quick dash for his dressing room. It is only a recommendation that the four officials try to police the tunnel area, brought into play when the PFA blocked a proposal for compulsory tunnel cameras. The placement of cameras is left to the discretion of individual clubs.</p>
              <p>The quarter-final at Arsenal had been a stormy affair, not helped by the pressure heaped on Riley from Wenger and his team to stop what they thought was time-wasting by Hull after they went 1-0 up in the 13th minute. That issue triggered the initial row between Horton and Wenger, which simmered for the rest of the game.</p>
              <p>Robin van Persie, captain for the night in the absence of Fabregas and Kolo Toure and scorer of Arsenal's first goal, said: 'It was very frustrating. I felt like they stole almost 10 minutes.</p>
              <p>'Sixty thousand people come to see a football match, not to just sit there waiting. I was quite gutted about it and I told the referee a few times because when you play football, especially on an occasion like this, you should at least try.'</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p>Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas is ready to fight any charge over his clash with Hull City No2 Brian Horton this week.</p>
              <p>Cesc will be hauled before an FA inquiry after Hull officially accused him of spitting.</p>
              <p>But he told <em>The Sun</em>: “I’ve absolutely nothing to hide and nothing to be ashamed of.”</p>
              <p>Midfielder Fabregas stands accused of spitting at Hull assistant
              manager Horton at the end of the Gunners’ explosive 2-1 FA Cup
              quarter-final victory on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The Spaniard also faces trial by video after a YouTube clip appeared to show him gobbing on Michael Ballack four years ago.</p>
              <p>But Fabregas said: “The simple fact is I did not spit at the assistant manager of Hull City.”</p>
              <p>Tigers boss Phil Brown, Horton and Hull chairman Paul Duffen
              held an emergency summit yesterday morning. Duffen said: “Brian gets
              our full support in any action he wants to pursue.”</p>
              <p>FA chiefs have written to both clubs, asking for observations and given them seven days to reply.</p>
              <p>Fab’s dad, Francesc, leapt to his son’s defence, saying: He wouldn’t think of spitting at someone.</p>
              <p>“I can’t believe anyone is saying such a thing.”</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p>Arsenal skipper Cesc Fabregas has been forced to defend himself TWICE over spitting incidents.</p>
              <p>The Spaniard, 21, was sensationally accused by Hull manager Phil Brown
              of gobbing at his No 2 Brian Horton after Tuesday’s explosive FA Cup
              quarter-final at The Emirates.</p>
              <p>The FA will now launch a full investigation after Horton
              yesterday made an official complaint to the League Managers’
              Association.</p>
              <p>Worse was to follow. No sooner had a shocked Fabregas been
              forced to swallow global condemnation of his alleged behaviour than
              incriminating footage involving another confrontation, this time with
              Michael Ballack, emerged on YouTube.</p>
              <p>The incident, filmed at Highbury in March 2005, shows the two
              midfielders clashing in a Champions League tie when German ace Ballack
              was at Bayern Munich.</p>
              <p>Fabregas, then 17, fells his opponent with a sliding tackle and
              then, as Ballack licks his wounds on the floor, the Arsenal star
              appears to make a spitting motion towards his face.</p>
              <p>He told <em>The Sun</em>: “I have seen this video on the
              internet many times before and I remember the incident clearly. It was
              four years ago and I leant over to Michael Ballack, who was playing for
              Bayern at the time, and I shouted at him because I felt like I did not
              make a bad tackle and I felt that the contact was minimal.</p>
              <p>“I did not spit at him. It happens during matches that
              sometimes you have heated exchanges with your opponents. I am not proud
              of it but I was 17. The referee saw it and gave me a yellow card.</p>
              <p>“People can try and find as many video clips as they like from
              when I was 17, or when I was 12 playing for my school team, but this
              does not change anything.”</p>
              <p>Then, facing up to his latest spitting furore, Fabregas added:
              “The simple fact is that I did not spit at the assistant manager of
              Hull City.”</p>

              <p><em>Unwelcome: Cesc Fabregas gets up close to the Hull camp on the Emirates pitch.</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><strong><em></em></strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/hull-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Hull </strong></span></a><strong>chairman Paul Duffen says there were staff, stewards and players present in the tunnel at the time that Cesc Fabregas is alleged to have spat at the Yorkshire club's assistant manager Brian Horton.</strong></p>
              <p>Their evidence is likely to be crucial as the FA carries out its inquiry into the events that followed Hull's 2-1 defeat at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal </span></a>on Tuesday night. Duffen said: ‘Certainly there will be plenty of people to talk to. There were stewards in it (the tunnel), it did have couple of our backroom staff and players in it.</p>
              <p>'There were people who saw it and I’m sure there will be plenty of people to give evidence to the inquiry. I’ll leave it to the FA. ‘Whatever happened, and something definitely did happen, it was because we really rattled Arsenal.’</p>
              <p>He added that the punishment should be significant if Fabregas, who denies the allegation, is found guilty. ‘If the allegation is found to be true then they (the FA) need to take some serious action,' he said.</p>
              <p>'I think spitting in our culture in this country is one of the worst things you can do. It’s worse than hitting somebody. It’s an absolute mark of disrespect. ‘Certainly in terms of the events after that, I know an FA inquiry has been launched and it would be inappropriate for me to say too much but quite what Fabregas was even doing on the pitch, I have no idea.</p>
              <p>‘I don’t want to prejudice it (the inquiry) but certainly (Hull manager) Phil (Brown) said what he said. There was no inquiry at the time so he was entitled to say what he said.'</p>
              <p>Duffen feels Hull have been on the wrong side of a number of decisions by officials, pointing out that Arsenal defender William Gallas appeared to be offside when scoring the winner in Tuesday's match.</p>
              <p>He added: ‘It was similar to the decision we didn’t get at Anfield when (Albert) Riera ploughed through Michael Turner for the first goal. We were 2-0 up at the time.</p>
              <p>'Everyone else saw it in the stadium but, standing in front of the Kop, (the referee) didn’t do anything so I think there is a case that sometimes of maybe the managers getting into the referee and they do feel intimidated.'</p>

              <p>Well, I guess we have to go with the one with more witnesses right? Afterall, just mins or hours after Fabregas released a statement saying he have never spat at anyone in his whole career, Youtube brought out his spat with Ballack...</p>
              <p>Anyone who watch the video could tell there was something heading in Ballack's face from his reaction... Now he is saying he is not proud of it but he was 17?</p>
              <p>To me, Fabregas is just trying to deny it at all costs... Wasn't he the one Cole claim in his book that threw the pizza at Fergie... lol</p>
              <p>Fabregas seem to have an anger management problem too... But, what was he even doing on the pitch in the first place?</p>
