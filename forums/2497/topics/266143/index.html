            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Incoming Madrid coach Bernd Schuster has apparently declared an interest in midfielder Francesc Fabregas and winger Jose Antonio Reyes, both of Arsenal.</strong><br><br>Spanish sports daily Marca claims that Bernd Schuster, in his capacity as nearly-coach at Real Madrid, is after Arsenal pair Francesc Fabregas and Jose Antonio Reyes.<br><br>Reyes is well-known at the Bernabeu already, having spent a mixed season on loan at los Blancos in the last campaign, making fourteen starts and scoring six goals. Unsettled at Arsenal, this loan move was a chance for him to gain some much-needed first team action at the highest level.<br><br>It came after a difficult time at Arsenal, for whom he signed from Sevilla in 2004. After a great start to his career, he tailed off in 2005 before recovering somewhat for the 2005-06 European campaign. Yet still he found adjustment to London life difficult. Real Madrid were sniffing around the unsettled player - much to the continued chagrin of Arsene Wenger - and made a loan move for him after he sat out Arsenal's European tie against Dynamo Zagreb to allow him to compete in Europe for the Blancos.<br><br>Wenger is reportedly angry at Real Madrid's consistent meddling through the media, and would point to Jose's signing a six-year deal back in 2005 as evidence that he has plans for Reyes in his Arsenal team. Further, Wenger declared last summer's Â£8.1m bid from city rivals Atletico as an "insult", signalling that it would take a massive offer to seal any deal from any side, let alone Real Madrid.<br><br>Nonetheless, there has allegedly been contact between the two clubs regarding a possible increased transfer fee for the player, meaning that Reyes could try once more for a permanent move to the Madrid giants. Jose would most likely leap at the chance, at least if his 2005 declaration - made during a prank phone call from a Spanish radio station - that he'd like to leave London for Madrid is anything to go by.<br><br>However, the odds of landing Fabregas seem much lower. Arsenal have already parted with prize asset Thierry Henry this summer, and losing a rising star of a midfielder would perhaps be too much for boss Wenger - and the fans - to bear. Cesc has settled in well at Arsenal and seems unlikely to want to leave right away.<br><br>What's more, Francesc has established himself as a first-teamer and a Spanish internationalist in his four years in the Gunners' first team, and is clearly seen as a future world-class player by Wenger and his assistants. Reyes' star may be dimming over the Emirates, but Cesc's is set to burn brighter.</div>

He's only problem is that he cannot adapt to the EPL but never forget he brought Arsenal to the Champions League final only to lose to Barca. Wish him good luck if he goes to Real Madrid</div>
