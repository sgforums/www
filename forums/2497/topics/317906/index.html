              <p><strong>I helped weeping Cheryl Cole cope with pain of her love-split from Ashley Cole</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>LOVELORN Cheryl Cole has been captured on video KISSING a handsome stranger on a hotel bed. In the shock tape that will stun her cheating soccer star husband Ashley, the weeping Girls Aloud beauty puts her ARMS AROUND budding US TV star Will Luke as she cries on his shoulder over her shattered marriage.</strong></p>
              <p>Will, 28, told us: "That was as far as it went—but Cheryl was drop dead gorgeous. Her husband must be mad to cheat on a girl like that."</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The Girls Aloud beauty is captured giving him affectionate <strong>CUDDLES</strong> and <strong>KISSES</strong> only weeks after discovering the Chelsea star had cheated on her.</p>
              <p>Vulnerable Cheryl, 24, snuggled up to Will after inviting him up to her hotel bedroom—where he and his pal filmed her and bandmates Kimberley Walsh and Nicola Roberts partying in the early hours for a pilot reality TV show.</p>
              <p><strong>Kissed </strong></p>
              <p>"She was crying on her bed and clearly going through a difficult time," says Will, 28, who touched the Geordie singer's damaged heartstrings with a quote from the <strong>BIBLE</strong>. "But when I went to sit next to her she moved closer and closer to me until she had her arms round me.</p>

              <p><em></em></p>
              <p>"She kept saying to me, ‘You make me feel so good. You made me feel much better'. She said she loved my bald head and kissed it twice. I felt like the luckiest man alive. "Then her hairdresser came over and explained Cheryl was having a rough time with her marriage. I thought what man could ever cheat on a wife who looked like Cheryl?"</p>

              <p><em>COLE COMFORT: Her arm is around Will as she poses with Kimberley and Kenny</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Will's revelations will shake Ashley, whose drunken night with blonde hairdresser Aimee Walton, 22, drove Cheryl to flee in tears to Thailand with Kimberley and Nicola.</strong></p>
              <p>On their way back to Britain the girls stopped off in Los Angeles at the plush Mondrian Hotel on February 16. Will was there with pal Kenny Rufus, 32, making a reality show called Parking Lot Pimps where they both try to charm phone numbers out of stunning girls. "It was about 2am and we'd been filming ourselves chatting up girls all night," says Will.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We were about to head home when I saw this beautiful girl who turned out to be Cheryl stood by the reception desk sobbing. She was inconsolable and looked so sad I had to see if she was OK. We found out she and her friends were some band called Girls Aloud but none of us had ever heard of them.</p>
              <p>"We just thought they were very cute girls who were very drunk. We all got chatting and when Nicola asked if we wanted to go up to Cheryl's room I just looked at Kenny and said, ‘Let's roll with it'."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cheryl went up first with the band's hairdresser. Will, Kenny and their cameraman followed in the lift with Nicola, 22, and 26-year-old Kimberley. "When we got to the room the girls went inside but the hairdresser stopped us at the door and asked me, ‘Are you a believer?'</p>
              <p>"I could see behind her Cheryl was sitting alone on the bed crying. So I quoted from the Bible, Psalm 30 Verse 5: ‘Weeping may endure for the night but joy comes in the morning'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The hairdresser looked at Cheryl as if to say, ‘Is it OK?' and she gave her the nod. We asked if it was OK to film and they agreed. "Cheryl was sat with tissues in her hand. I asked her, ‘You OK?' and she was like, ‘Yeah, you know'. The hairdresser came over and told me what was up. I had no idea who Ashley Cole was."</p>
              <p>Distraught Cheryl has been in turmoil since her two-year marriage to Ashley, 27, was left in tatters when it was revealed he had bedded single mum Aimee after downing vodka cocktails.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since the revelation neither Cheryl nor Ashley has worn a wedding ring. And photos of her in Thailand—and others taken since—showed her looking gaunt and sad. But Will tried his best to cheer her up. "I told her, ‘I don't know what's going on but it will be all right. I can feel you have good energy, so let's have a good time tonight'.</p>
              <p>"I even invited her to come to church with us the next morning. I was trying to get her to smile and it seemed to work. "Soon enough we were talking about all sorts of things like music, books, movies and sport. I sang a gospel song for her and then Cheryl and Nicola sang for me."</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><em></em></p>
              <p>The video also shows Kimberley—whose boyfriend is Triple 8 singer Justin Scott—getting friendly with Kenny. She throws her arms around him and tells the cameraman: "When you come (to England) you better tell us you're there because we can show you a good night out."</p>
              <p>Kenny says: "Kimberley was warm and friendly. There seemed to be a little flirting going on but I have a girlfriend."</p>
              <p><strong>Church </strong></p>
              <p>At one point Nicola joins the girls on the bed just as Cheryl kisses Will and the girls shout, ‘Girls Aloud! PLP! (Parking Lot Pimps)' before getting up and dancing wildly to the background music.</p>
              <p>Will says: "They were just having a great time and partying like mad." The party ended at 4am after Cheryl's hairdresser insisted that the star got some sleep. "Nicola and Kimberley invited us back to their room but we told them we had to go to church in the morning," says Will.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now Will has a message for Ashley, who looked embarrassed and uncomfortable as he watched Cheryl perform with Girls Aloud at London's 02 Arena on Friday night ahead of his appearance in the Champions League Final against Man United on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>"If I could say one thing to him it would be, ‘Tighten up your game because you've got one hell of a great girl who will not be hanging round for you for long'. "If I was her husband I wouldn't be looking at any other women. He must be mad."</p>

              <p>Really, Ashley Cole is the perfect embodiment of a piece of shit, literally. He betrayed the club that gave him the chance at the big league, and obviously all the money he has today. The worst part is that he totally shows no remorse in doing so. Is a freaking cheat during matches, fyi, Ronaldo is not the only diver in the EPL. Shows no respect to referees. Cheats on his wife.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Basically, Ashley Cole, someone you won't show any sympathy to even if he has lost a leg or something.</p>

              <p>Really, Ashley Cole is the perfect embodiment of a piece of
              shit, literally. He betrayed the club that gave him the chance at
              the big league, and obviously all the money he has today. The
              worst part is that he totally shows no remorse in doing so. Is
              a freaking cheat during matches, fyi, Ronaldo is not the only diver
              in the EPL. Shows no respect to referees. Cheats on his wife.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Basically, Ashley Cole, someone you won't show any sympathy to
              even if he has lost a leg or something.</p>

              <p>True. He could be arsenal's legend but he opted for ka-chings instead.</p>
