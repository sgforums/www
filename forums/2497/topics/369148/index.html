              <p class="first"><strong>Former England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson is in talks with Notts County about becoming director of football, BBC Radio Nottingham understands.</strong></p>
              <p>The Magpies, who were recently taken over by a Middle-Eastern consortium, and Eriksson's agent Athole Still are refusing to confirm his involvement.</p>
              <p>Earlier newspaper reports had linked Eriksson to the club's managerial role.</p>
              <p>The 61-year-old, who spent five years in charge of England, was sacked as coach of Mexico in April.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>BBC Radio Nottingham's Colin Slater said: "Claims that Notts are to appoint Eriksson as manager are wide of the mark.</p>
              <p>"It is far more likely Eriksson will be brought in as director of football."</p>
              <p>Ian McParland has been kept on as manager of the Magpies under the new regime.</p>
              <p>However, former Manchester City manager Eriksson is not the only big name to be linked with the job.</p>
              <p>Slater added: "My understanding is that Eriksson is not the first high-profile personality to be linked with the newly created post as director of football.</p>
              <p>"Former England manager Glenn Hoddle has also been in the frame."</p>
              <p>Following Eriksson's dismissal in Mexico, he had been linked with a return to the Premier League with Portsmouth.</p>

              <h1>Eriksson links up with Notts County</h1>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT"></span></p><blockquote>
              <p>Eriksson will take up the role with immediate effect following talks about taking a senior role at Meadow Lane.</p>
              <p>The 61-year-old Swede will be joined at Notts County by
              long-term assistant Tord Grip, who will fill the role of general
              advisor.</p>
              <p>And the club's new executive chairman, Peter Trembling, hopes
              Eriksson's appointment will help them achieve their aim of long-term
              success.</p>
              <p>"One key element to our future success will be our ability to
              attract outstanding talent to work with us in all areas of the club,"
              Trembling told the club's official website.</p>
              <p>"Today we have taken the first major step in building our team of experienced and committed people by appointing Sven and Tord.</p>
              <p>"Sven and his team join us with an unrivalled football pedigree.
              Their knowledge of the game and contacts throughout the football world
              will significantly enhance Notts County's prospects.</p>
              <p>"Sven shares our vision, and to attract someone of his calibre is testament to the ambition that we all share for Notts County.</p>
              <p>"This is a great day for everyone associated with the club."</p>

              <p>So Sven-Goran Eriksson was thinking of Meadow Lane when his agent revealed a couple of months ago that the Swede "would love to work in England again". Anyone predicting such a return before these remarkable developments would have risked being carted off to the nearest psychiatric ward but put a consortium from the Middle East and Eriksson's name in the same sentence and you start to believe that anything is possible.</p>
              <p>This time, however, the investors offering to line Eriksson's pocket are not fake sheikhs seeking to bring down the England manager but <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/nottscounty"><span style="color: #005689;">Notts County</span></a> board members who have pulled off one of the more staggering football appointments in recent times.</p>
              <p>Eriksson is expected to be unveiled as the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/leaguetwofootball"><span style="color: #005689;">League Two</span></a> club's director of football on Wednesday after agreeing to take the director of football role at Meadow Lane following talks which presumably did not dwell too much on the 61-year-old's knowledge of County's promotion rivals next season.</p>
              <p>Quite what was going through Ian McParland's mind when he learned of the bid to lure Eriksson is anyone's guess, though the current Notts County manager has been assured that his job is safe despite the arrival of someone who spent five years in charge of England. That period should have prepared Eriksson for most things but there could still be a few shocks in store if he makes his way around the League Two circuit next season.</p>
              <p>Whether he will be required to negotiate those kind of trips remains to be seen. Either way those close to Munto Finance, the ambitious Middle-East backed consortium that took control at Meadow Lane last week with plans to establish the club in the Championship within five years, say Eriksson will not be here today and gone tomorrow.</p>
              <p>Eriksson does have experience of working at a lower level before when he started out on his managerial career with Degerfors in Sweden but 30 years have since passed and the majority of those have been spent at some of the most glamorous clubs in Europe such as Benfica, Roma and Lazio. Portsmouth seemed likely to be the next port of call after he was sacked by Mexico in April but instead Eriksson has checked in at a club that finished 87th on the football ladder in May.</p>
              <p>His financial package will be the subject of much conjecture but it is thought to be strongly linked to the club's progress, although it would be naive to believe that there is not a hefty basic wage. Eriksson, after all, does not work for pennies, even if he has received three seven-figure pay-offs in as many years, and there were suggestions last night, albeit unconfirmed, that he might pick up as much as £40,000 a week at Meadow Lane.</p>
              <p>What a turnaround from 5½ years ago when County, mired in financial trouble, narrowly escaped the threat of expulsion from the Football League. There have been more tough times since, including the last five seasons finishing in the bottom half of League Two, but the loyal supporters that have remained faithful to the club that will celebrate its 150th anniversary in 2012 can be forgiven for waking up with a smile this morning.</p>
              <p>"We have a vision of success now," said Glenn Rolley, the chairman of the supporters' trust. "We stand in the shadow of our neighbours. Appointing Sven will reverberate around the football world. I can only compare it to when Notts County signed Tommy Lawton from Chelsea in the late '40s.</p>
              <p>"He was England's No 1 centre-forward. This is comparable. I've been a supporter for 45 years and this is proud day. It's quite romantic really."</p>
