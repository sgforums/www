Portsmouth today rejected Newcastle United's official approach for Harry Redknapp, Sportsmail can reveal. Redknapp, however, is still expected to take over at St James' Park and the key dispute would seem to be the south coast club's determination to extract maximum compensation for the loss of their 60-year-old manager. </strong><br><br>Redknapp, who didn't hold his usual Friday press conference at Portsmouth today, is expected to meet with Newcastle officials in the next 24 hours. They are prepared to offer him a four-year deal worth Â£5m a year, which would also include an agreement to let him commute by plane from the south coast. It is understood that Redknapp may also buy a property in the north east, to deflect any possible suggestions from fans that his heart wasn't in the job. The Portsmouth manager is now 1-8 favourite with some bookies to take over at St James's Park.<br><br>Redknapp had been agonising over the decision for the past 48 hours but has now decided that he has taken Portsmouth as far as he can. He has told friends that he will accept the "biggest challenge" of his life as he tries to breathe life into the ailing north east giants.<br><br>Compensation would now appear to be the main issue left to resolve before Redknapp takes over from Sam Allardyce, who was sacked on Wednesday night after just eight months in charge with their chairman Alex Gaydamark wanting at least Â£1.5million before the former West Ham manager is unveiled next week.<br><br>It's believed he can expect a Â£5m-a-year deal - five times his current salary at Fratton Park - and will be allowed to commute from his Sandbanks home in Poole, Dorset, with Ashley prepared to lend his new manager his private jet. Former Arsenal captain Tony Adams has already been sounded out about replacing Redknapp, who has led Portsmouth to eighth in the Premier League.<br><br></div>

The 60-year-old had been the favourite to take over from Sam Allardyce and Sky Sports News claim he held talks with the Tyneside club last night. </strong><br><br>However, after considering the move overnight, Redknapp arrived at Pompey's Eastleigh training ground this morning - the team are due to depart for the north-east to play Sunderland on Sunday - and told reporters he was staying with the club.<br><br>Speculation had suggested Newcastle were ready to offer Redknapp a four-year deal worth Â£20 million to take over and it was widely believed the former West Ham boss would accept.<br><br>Even Portsmouth chief executive Peter Storrie, who drove the manager away from the media circus which had gathered outside the club's training ground yesterday, admitted they would not stand in the way should Redknapp want to go.<br><br>"Harry is our manager and Harry is the way we see things going forward here.

"Specifically for those loyal supporters, they love Harry and rightly so.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Crossroads</span></strong><br><br>"I'm not surprised at his decision. It was a little bit of a crossroads for Harry for going to another club and a big club.<br><br>"But I was banking on his emotions and his loyalty and that everything he has done there would tie him there for a long time."<br><br>Mandaric, who is now Leicester chairman, saw Redknapp walk away from Portsmouth to take over at Southampton in 2004, but insists he did not expect a repeat performance.<br><br>"That walking away really bonded Harry and me at that time," Mandaric added. "Harry is a loyal manager to Portsmouth.<br><br><strong>Challenge</strong><br><br>"I was only thinking that would happen if Harry really wanted a big challenge.<br><br>"But at the same time I was banking on how much he is loved in the city. I'm so delighted for them.<br><br>"Harry is tailor-made for that job and the city. He has character and is a winner and the supporters adore him."</div>

The Pompey manager's loy-alty to the Fratton Park club will see him earn Â£10.5m over the remainder of his contract. </strong><br><br>His decision to stay won him the immediate gratitude of the Pompey board who will up his deal to fend of Newcastle owner Mike Ashley's billions. Redknapp's new package still leaves him a long way short of the Â£4m a year Newcastle were willing to pay. But the Pompey boss (left) is delighted with the pay rise after 24 hours of soul searching.<br><br>A source close to Redknapp said: "It didn't come down purely to cash with Harry. If it did, he would have gone to Newcastle. "Portsmouth made him feel wanted, they've given him a pay rise and he knows there will be money to spend during the rest of the transfer window. It was a case of Portsmouth putting their arm round him and making him feel wanted."<br><br>Redknapp said: "This is a club I feel comfortable at. I came back here and everyone treated me fantastically, I've got a good relationship with the fans, with the owner and the players I brought here. "I persuaded them to come to Portsmouth and sold the club to them. And to walk away after that and after the team is doing so well wouldn't be right.<br><br>"I have had a great offer and to be offered it by such a fantastic club like Newcastle was a terrific opportunity for me. "But in the end I thought I really have no intention of wanting to leave here. I looked at it but my heart is in Portsmouth, it always will be. This is where I'm happy.<br><br>"Alex Ferguson is always associated with Manchester United, Arsene Wenger with Arsenal and for many people I'm that way with Portsmouth... and that's the way it's going to stay."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Pearson wants swift Magpies appointment</strong><br><br>Caretaker boss Nigel Pearson wants Newcastle's managerial uncertainty settled 'as soon as possible' after the crisis-ridden Tyneside outfit capsized in catastrophic fashion at Old Trafford.<br><br>After a goalless first half, Manchester United struck six times in the second period, with Cristiano Ronaldo netting his first Red Devils hat-trick to send Sir Alex Ferguson's men soaring to the Premier League summit.<br><br>While United's army of supporters can look forward to the next few months with relish, an air of gloom is enveloping the Toon Army, who saw Sam Allardyce sacked on Wednesday and number one candidate to replace him, Harry Redknapp, snub the offer to take charge at St James' Park just hours before kick-off.<br><br>Pearson, who has pledged to continue until Allardyce's successor is found, admitted it was a day when everything that could go wrong for the Magpies did. And, while he refused to enter into any debate over the politics behind Newcastle's sorry predicament, Pearson does feel it would be better for everyone if a solution was found.<br><br>'It has been a very difficult day,' he said.<br><br>'When you are going through a transition period you need things to be as smooth as possible. Results like this make it very difficult.<br><br>'I am not going to make excuses. It is plain for all to see the situation would be better served by being resolved quickly.<br><br>'It is not my business to comment on those matters. Whatever is going on at that level will be dealt with by the people who have that authority.<br><br>'But the scoreline has altered people's perspective on how this day is viewed. The pride of everyone at the club has been pretty severely dented.<br><br>'The mood before the game was good. But the harsh reality is we have come up against a better side.<br><br>'What happened in the second half was down to a number of things including basic decision-making and bad defending.<br><br>'Some of the things we did were exceptionally good, others were appalling. When you are playing against a team as talented and ruthless as that, you make it very difficult for yourself.<br><br>'There was a big gap between the two teams.'<br><br>Redknapp's refusal to uproot from his beloved south coast to take on what many, including Sir Alex Ferguson, feels is an impossible job, appears a wise decision based on the evidence of this sorry affair.<br><br>United would not have been flattered if they had reached double figures such was their superiority, especially when Ronaldo cut loose after the break.<br><br>The injury-time dismissal of skipper Alan Smith for his robust complaints about the legality of Carlos Tevez's sixth was almost too ridiculous to be believed given the state of the game, even if Newcastle had legitimiate grounds for complaint.<br><br>Ferguson certainly feels the Newcastle hierarchy need to start taking a long-term view of the situation and give whoever eventually replaces Allardyce - Mark Hughes is now the favourite but Alan Shearer is the fans' choice - a chance to turn the situation around.<br><br>'I would say Newcastle are the most difficult club to manage in the game, gobbling up managers and spitting them out again with hardly a pause,' he said.<br><br>'Their list of sacked bosses reads like a who's who of football, with some of the greatest players taking on the challenge, though not for very long.<br><br>'Sadly, it seems that at St James' Park, if things don't go right straight away, the manager quickly finds himself operating against a background of criticism and questioning that inevitably leaves him operating on a match-by-match basis with ceaseless speculation about his future.<br><br>'It is hardly the platform for being able to introduce a long-term strategy and build the right foundations.<br><br>'If they regarded their managers as something more than ships that pass in the night they might achieve the stability and consistency that is the basis of success at any club.'<br><br>Not that Newcastle's problems are any concern of Ferguson's.<br><br>Offered the chance to clamber back to the top of the pile by Arsenal's surprise failure to overcome Birmingham, his team responded to some harsh words at the break to produce what the Scot described as one of the best second-half performances in his entire time at the club.<br><br>Ronaldo's three-timer, taking him to 22 goals for the season, was accompanied by a double from Tevez and a brilliant Rio Ferdinand volley, securing United's biggest win over the Tyneside outfit for 40 years, just slightly longer than Newcastle's long-suffering fans have waited for a trophy.<br><br>'The second-half performance was as good as you could ask for,' said Ferguson.<br><br>'I am really pleased for Cristiano. He was always going to get a hat-trick at some point and hopefully he will get a few more.<br><br>'The way he is going this season, who is to say where he will finish up. He is improving all the time.'<br></div>
