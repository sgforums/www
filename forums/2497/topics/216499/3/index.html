            <div class='col-md body'>just my opinion.<br>(I may get some names wrong but hopefully message gets thru).<br><br>I believe Liverpool is trying to play a 442 but more freedom given to StevieG on the right to come in.<br><br>now, IMHO, liverpool can win a game only if a few factors click into place,<br>1) StevieG is running into space and releasing those pinpoint passes or crosses.<br>2) Riise coming in from the left.<br>3) Hypia has a good day.<br><br>Now, against Arsenal and MUFC, factor 1 &amp; 2 were taken out of the equation even before the game start.<br><br>cause<br>a) against MUFC, StevieG needs to be on guard against Giggs, so he can't really attack. And for some strange reason, Fletcher has a game of his life, pressuing Riise into no attacking. Thus making Liverpool toothless.<br><br>b) against Gunners, Riise can't get near to Helb who seems to posses excellent ball control. This create pressure for Riise not to attack.<br>and StevieG instead of going his best to move into the space behind the attackers are back-pedaling as seriously Zenden and Xavi can't deal with Gunners MF.<br><br>Impt factor, Gonzalez is not a big time player. Against MUFC we saw how his nerves were ruining his game, and at Emirates Stadium, he fared no better.<br><br>For me, What Liverpool should do was to play a 4411.<br>Put StevieG, Xaxi, Zenden,Craig Bellamy, and then Crouch up front with Kuryt.<br><br>Unsure whether Craig is injured but he used to be profilic with Blackburn, and he seems underutilised.<br><br>or if Craig is unavailable, put Pennat who is more familiar with Gunners play.<br>He can put into the crosses for Crouch.<br><br></div>

The Wales striker did not speak about Liverpool or his club manager after Wales 4-0 demolition of Liechtenstein on Tuesday night, but his actions spoke louder than any words.<br><br>Bellamy has come through a crisis of confidence and fitness and he took out his frustrations by terrorising the limited visitors to Wrexhams Racecourse ground. Afterwards he looked relieved, but insisted: "I only want to talk about Wales, nothing else."<br><br>He made two and scored one to add to the goal from his previous international against Cyprus. After just two goals for Liverpool this season, and only one in the Premiership, Bellamy displayed all the selfless running and desire which can benefit Liverpool in their current state. Now the 27-year-old has given Benitez a selection dilemma for Saturdays trip to Middlesbrough, on the back of Sundays3-0 defeat at Arsenal.<br><br>Bellamy said: "People will be quick to say this was not against great opposition, but you can only beat what is in front of you. I was pleased with my all-round game, Ive always had a good assist rating and I enjoy that, if someone is in a better position you have to put them in for the chance. Thats a big part for me, I always want to do the best for the team and my colleagues, not just for me."<br><br>Bellamy has been frustrated by a calf injury which ruled him out for five games. His return at Birmingham in the Carling Cup saw him miss chances, including a penalty. On Sunday at the Emirates Stadium he was on for just a few minutes before having a goal disallowed wrongly for offside.<br>Bellamy aims to use the inspiration of Arsenals Thierry Henry to drive his own return to top form. He said: "All the best players, [some] a lot better than me, always work for others. Someone like Thierry Henry,who I shouldnt even be mentioning because he is a much higher level, but his assists and scoring is an example; the way forward for me."<br><br>Bellamy believes the 90-minute run-out against Liechtenstein will have helped his mental and physical recovery. "For my own sharpness I needed that 90 minutes under my belt because I had been out injured at Liverpool," he said.<br><br>"It was a nice feeling, a really good work-out on a heavy pitch. That can sap your energy and you have to put a lot more into it. It was good for me. I am just trying to get over the injury and the lay-off. My calves are aching but it was good to feel like that because I know I have put a lot into the game and got something out of it. It is important for me to score, but I would have been happy with 4-0 and my contribution. I felt I was a threat, and always on the edge of creating something. The goal capped it off but I would have been happy with just the result. When they wont go for you all you must do is keep believing there will be other chances. You keep plugging away and I always believe there will be more chances for me."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Alonso puzzled by Liverpool's lack of form</strong><br><br>Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso has admitted that the Reds poor Premiership form this season has been a mystery to both him and his team-mates.<br><br>The Anfield outfit have already secured a place in the knockout stages of the Champions League, but have failed to hit the heights in the league and are way off the pace set by Manchester United.<br><br>Alonso admitted: "At present we realise we stand a far better chance of winning the Champions League than the Premiership. Liverpool winning the title is a remote possibility and if Manchester United and Chelsea go any further ahead, it will be too much for us. The difference in our results is strange. If we played in England at the same level as we do in the Champions League, we would win the title."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Liverpool's away woes continue</strong><br><br>Liverpool's wait for an away win in the Premiership this season goes on despite mounting a siege in a goalless draw at Middlesbrough.<br><br>The Reds at least left Teesside with a first away point since the opening day of the season, but they will feel they should have ended their miserable run of results on their travels.<br><br>Dirk Kuyt blasted wide before the break and Craig Bellamy saw a goal-bound header blocked by substitute Robert Huth, before Daniel Agger forced a superb save from Mark Schwarzer with a 59th-minute piledriver.<br><br>And it took a magnificent goal-line clearance by Jonathan Woodgate to deny substitute Peter Crouch a late winner with an 83rd-minute header.<br><br>However, while Rafael Benitez's men were left to rue missed opportunities, they could have headed back across the Pennines empty-handed but for a remarkable escape.<br><br>Jose Reina did well to block Jason Euell's close-range header but when the ball fell to Aiyegbeni Yakubu in front of goal, he completely missed his kick.<br><br>The omens were not particularly promising for the visitors as they arrived on Teesside without a league win away from Anfield all season to meet a team who had already disposed of Chelsea and Everton.<br><br>Indeed, the Reds had won only twice in the Premiership at the Riverside Stadium in 10 attempts.<br><br>However, after an ordinary start it was they who took the game to their hosts and created the vast majority of the meaningful openings in front of a much-improved crowd of 31,424.<br><br>Spanish midfielder Mark Gonzalez set the tone, cutting in from the left to fire a right-footed shot straight at Schwarzer with just three minutes gone and then curling a 20th-minute cross on to the roof of the net.<br><br>However, Dutch striker Dirk Kuyt should have put them in front a minute later when partner Craig Bellamy chested down Steven Gerrard's long ball, but he fired wide of the the target.<br><br>Gerrard, lining up in his preferred central role, had taken time to get to grips with opposite number George Boateng but, as his influence increased, so did the threat posed by his team.<br><br>Xabi Alonso fired wildly over on 32 minutes after Jermaine Pennant had laid off Bellamy's cross, but the former Arsenal midfielder forced a good save from Schwarzer six minutes later with a well-struck shot on the turn.<br><br>John Arne Riise then warmed the Australian goalkeeper's hands with a long-range piledriver, but still the Reds could not break the deadlock.<br><br>For their part, Boro enjoyed some success down the right, where James Morrison and Andrew Davies gave Riise a tough time, but with Yakubu again playing as a lone striker, Reina had to deal with a handful of dangerous crosses, but little else.<br><br>Boro boss Gareth Southgate was forced to make a change at the break when he replaced the injured Davies with Robert Huth. The #6million central defender slotted in at right-back and was to play his part within minutes.<br><br>Kuyt's appeals for a penalty after he went down under Boateng's challenge were waved away, but it was his side which enjoyed a remarkable escape on 53 minutes.<br><br>Yakubu found Morrison wide on the right and then made his way into the penalty area as Euell headed the winger's cross towards goal.<br><br>Reina got down superbly to block Euell's effort, but could only serve the ball up to Yakubu, who inexplicably failed to make contact with the goal at his mercy.<br><br>However, the visitors would have been in front on 55 minutes had Huth not thrown himself into the path of Bellamy's goal-bound header, and it took a fine save from Schwarzer to prevent Agger's long-range missile from screaming into the top corner four minutes later.<br><br>The Australian was the hero again after 68 minutes when he got down smartly to keep out Gonzalez's volley and he was relieved to see Emanuel Pogatetz deflect Kuyt's cross wide of the post rather than inside it three minutes later.<br><br>Southgate rang the changes as he introduced Lee Cattermole for the injured Boateng and last weekend's match-winner Massimo Maccarone for Morrison, but they could do little to stem the tide.<br><br>However, Woodgate had to head off his own line after Crouch, on for Kuyt, got his head to a deep Gonzalez cross and looped the ball over Schwarzer.<br><br>The visitors hammered away as the clock ran down and Crouch saw another header saved in injury-time, but they could not find a way past the Boro defence.<br><br># Benitez: 'We deserved to win'<br><br>Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez dismissed suggestions his side lack confidence away from home after the goalless draw at Middlesbrough made it seven matches on the road without a win.<br><br>'We created a lot of chances. We deserved to win, we had a clean sheet and we were going forward all the time,' said the Spaniard.<br><br>'We have created enough for scoring goals and we must do the same, keep going.<br><br>'Today the team was controlling the game and creating a lot of chances. If they had scored the first goal it could have been totally different.<br><br>'If we play as today for 100 games we would win 99.'<br><br>Man of the match Jonathan Woodgate produced a saving headed clearance from under the crossbar late on from substitute Peter Crouch.<br><br>He accepted the visitors had done more in the game but was not satisfied with a point.<br><br>'They dominated throughout in the second half and we were lucky to hang on at the end,' he said.<br><br>'I think we need to improve on our second-half performance.<br><br>'We need three points when we are playing at home.'<br><br>Middlesbrough boss Gareth Southgate admitted his side were out-played and was happy to take a point.<br><br>Southgate said: 'We didn't do enough to win. We know we need to play better and we want to.<br><br>'The resilience and character to stay in it was admirable. I am pleased with the character and attitude and we must not underestimate the value of a point.<br><br>'They are games you can lose and but for some magnificent defending and goalkeeping we would have lost it.<br><br>'We were under the cosh there and answered questions that were posed.'<br><br>Southgate faces a difficult week as the Premier League meet to discuss whether he should be permitted to continue in his current role.<br><br>The former England defender does not have the requisite UEFA Pro Licence to manage in the Premiership and the period of grace allowed to run a side without one is due to expire.<br><br>Southgate added: 'I have said all along I have got the support of the chairman. There is a big job to do and I do not think about anything I can't affect.<br><br>'It is for other people to decide whether I can or can't do it, but I want to do it.'</div>

This is because I am the only Coach sitting at home at the moment, so itÂ’s easy to connect me to various jobs,Â” he told Â‘Quelli Che il CalcioÂ’ on RAI Due.<br><br>Â“With all honesty, I can tell you that there isnÂ’t a word of truth in any of these stories. The only real link I had was a very simple phone conversation with a director from the Mexican Federation.Â”<br><br>The most recent development suggests heÂ’ll replace Carlo Ancelotti on the Rossoneri bench, perhaps even before the end of the season. What would he say if Milan called?<br><br>Â“Any answer I give to that would be misinterpreted. I canÂ’t talk about something that doesnÂ’t exist. Besides, nobody knows what scenarios could pan out in May.Â”<br><br>Lippi had already won every available club trophy at Juventus and resigned from the Italy bench after lifting the World Cup.<br><br>Â“We won because we were strong, something we proved even before the tournament by beating Holland 3-1 and Germany 4-1 in friendlies. We started with very few people around us, so we were relaxed and didnÂ’t feel the pressure. On our return to Italy, two million met us at the airport.Â”<br><br>Lippi pointed to the controversial victory over Australia in the second round as the key moment in their campaign.<br><br>Â“That was the most difficult moment for us. The game was dragging on and the idea of going to extra time in 10 men didnÂ’t please us, so Fabio GrossoÂ’s run Â– another sign that this wasnÂ’t a team that focused only on defending Â– gave us a victory that provided a wonderful morale boost.Â”<br><br>The team-work is what most impressed about the Azzurri in Germany 2006 and Lippi assures it wasnÂ’t all his doing.<br><br>Â“The players talked among themselves and told each other this was an opportunity they could not afford to lose. There was no need for me to remind them! They were so united and all facing the same direction, which is why it didnÂ’t matter so much that Francesco Totti wasnÂ’t 100 per cent fit. We all knew he could invent something at any moment to turn the game.Â”<br><br>Now it looks as if Fabio Cannavaro will be given the Ballon dÂ’Or, narrowly pipping Gianluigi Buffon to the post.<br><br>Â“There were seven Italians nominated in the 50-man shortlist and the top two, we donÂ’t know in what order yet, will be Azzurri players. ThatÂ’s a fantastic achievement and the right way to crown an extraordinary year,Â” continued the Coach.<br><br>Â“If Cannavaro wins, then there could be disappointment after three weeks in which Buffon was tipped to take it, but these are two such intelligent people that IÂ’m sure there will be no problems between them.Â”<br><br><strong>he not coming anfield?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rafa backs Bellamy to get it right<br><br>Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez believes Craig Bellamy is suffering in front of goal because he wants to be perfect.<br><br>Bellamy has scored only two goals - one in the Barclays Premiership and the other in the Champions League - since his Â£6million move from Blackburn.<br><br>Liverpool return to Europes elite club competition on Wednesday when they face PSV Eindhoven at Anfield and Benitez is convinced the Wales striker will soon go on a scoring spree.<br><br>"Sometimes he has this anxiety and wants to do everything in a perfect way, " the Spanish coach told the clubs website, www.liverpoolfc.tv.<br><br>"I have said to him if he continues to work hard for me then it is okay. He will score goals and play well. Sometimes when you are not playing well and you have that mentality of his then you get frustrated. You start making mistakes. He said to me he wanted to make an impact. Now maybe hes worried about these things and thinks I dont have confidence in him. But I have confidence in Craig and had a good talk with him. We analysed things and are trying to give him confidence."<br><br>Both Liverpool and PSV have already qualified for the second stage so the only competitive issue remaining is for top spot and the Dutch side travel to Merseyside in a rich vein of form.<br><br>They moved three points clear of Ajax at the top of their domestic league by stretching their unbeaten run to 17 matches with a comfortable victory against Excelsior.<br><br>Defender Jamie Carragher knows they will have their work cut out to get a positive result.<br><br>He said: "Getting through to the next stage was our first objective but the aim now is to finish top of the group. We have a decent defensive record in the Champions League and hopefully we can keep that going. It is important to take advantage of playing PSV at home. But it will be very difficult as they have great experience in the Champions League and they are doing very well in the Dutch league."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Finnan looking to improve away form<br><br>Liverpools dependable Irish defender Steve Finnan accepts there is a glaring contrast between the Anfield clubs form in Europe and the Premier League.<br><br>But Finnan just hopes the Kop sees the best of Liverpool tomorrow when they bid to clinch top spot in Champions League group C at home to PSV Eindhoven.<br><br>The Dutch side are on equal points with Liverpool in the group, and like their hosts have also qualified for the last 16.<br><br>Finnan says: "We are aware that our form in Europe is fine but we cant seem to manage that level in the Premier League, and in particular away from home. If we knew why that was we would have solved it by now. It has not quite clicked at the moment while we know we have been in good form at home. The situation causes plenty of talk, understandably, but if you assess our games we have plenty of possession and chances but the results have not really happened. We have played well in games, should have won, but it hasnt been happening."<br><br>Now he adds: "Now we are looking forward to another great European night at Anfield, with the fans behind us, and if we do that it will certainly boost our confidence generally. PSV are a good team, they are doing well in their own league and we know it will be tight because it certainly was when we got a draw in Eindhoven. We did a good job in Holland and it was deserved. So we know if we do the right things in this match it will see us through. We have to start picking up more points away from home, there is a sharp contrast between the European table and the Premiership. But we are only five points off third place so it is not as bad as people make out. Our home form is always good but away from home for the past few years in Europe it has been fine, but it seems harder in domestic matches. Maybe there is a confidence problem, you lose a couple and there is pressure to get a result."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kromkamp criticises Rafa's rotation policy<br><br>Former Liverpool defender Jan Kromkamp has re-ignited the controversy surrounding the rotation policy favoured by Reds boss Rafael Benitez.<br><br>Kromkamp returns to Anfield with PSV Eindhoven for the Champions League game inisisting regular first-team football has improved his game.<br><br>He told BBC Sport: "I wasnt that fit and mentally sharp because I didnt play every week. If you dont play that often, its difficult to remain at a high level."<br><br>Benitez has been criticised for tinkering with his team, with the Spanish coach recently ending a run of 99 games without naming the same XI for consecutive matches.<br><br>Liverpool director Noel White recently resigned after criticising Benitezs selection policy.<br><br>Kromkamp added: "If you rotate the thought is that you keep the players more fit for the entire season. Thats the idea. I dont know how the players at Liverpool find it but for me it is better to play every week, although I can understand the thoughts that Benitez has about rotation."<br><br>The 26-year-old joined Liverpool in January 2006 but only started eight games while coming on as a substitute 10 times during his time at Anfield.<br><br>"I did play my games and was happy," he added.<br><br>"But when I was playing I could notice that I wasnt that fit and mentally sharp because I didnt play every week. From that point of view it was very difficult. I enjoyed it very much in England but, overall, it is better for me to be playing more games - thats why Im at PSV and, lets face it, we are doing great. Everything is going very well in Eindhoven. I am happy to be at PSV because Im playing more now and that is very important for my rhythm. I can still improve a lot more but basically I am happy that I am playing every week. That is the main thing."<br><br>Kromkamp signed from Villarreal in a swap taking Josemi the other way<br>PSV are top of the Dutch league and, along with Liverpool, are already through to the next stage of the Champions League with two games to play.<br><br>Kromkamp says victory against the Reds on Wednesday and the chance to finish top of their group is now the incentive as it could set up a potentially easier match in the knockout stages of the competition.<br><br>Liverpool will welcome the distraction of a Champions League tie after the Premiership draw against Middlesbrough still left them without an away win in the league this season.<br><br>They are 10th in the top-flight but Kromkamp has backed the Merseyside team to rise up the table.<br><br>"I know that they have got a very good team, technical staff and a very good coach in Rafael Benitez," he added.<br><br>"What I can remember of last season is that they also did not start very well but at the end they did very well. The only thing they can do is improve as they have a very good squad. I think they will get their points but they need a little bit of luck."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool victory marred by injuries<br><br>Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez admitted Wednesday night was tainted by injuries to Xabi Alonso, Mark Gonzalez and Jermaine Pennant.<br><br>The Reds beat PSV Eindhoven 2-0 at Anfield to ensure they finish top of Champions League Group C, but Benitez saw three of his midfielders limp out of the action.<br><br>"The first injury to Xabi was a big problem for us, (being already) without Momo Sissoko especially. Then Mark Gonzalez and Pennant went too," he told Sky Sports Xtra.<br><br>"The players worked really hard after that. Xabi had a leg injury which could be serious, Gonzalez felt something, hamstring maybe, which could be more serious and Pennant had a spasm which is not serious."<br><br>Benitez took heart from Steven Gerrards strike, which paved the way for victory.<br><br>"I was really pleased to see Steve scoring again, it could be a boost for his confidence," said Benitez.<br><br>"He likes to play there, today it was a difficult game without Xabi and we needed to see how it went with Bolo (Zenden) who didnt have a warm-up."</div>
