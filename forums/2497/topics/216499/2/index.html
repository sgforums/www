Just a few months ago he was a candidate for the manager post at Real Madrid and today as it is right now, quite a number of loyal pool fans are losing faith in him, asking for his "head"... And this is a guy that won them the treble cup and was just Real Madrid's target as manager. His loyally to pool meant that he didn't want to be considered as a candidate at Real therefore, i think the least he deserve is till some time.<br><br>He has already ask for some patience... so give him the benefit of the doubt.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>RAFA BENITEZ'S position at Liverpool is under pressure after a senior Anfield board member admitted the club is concerned about the direction the Spaniard is taking them.<br><br>With Liverpool already 11 points off the Premiership pace set by Manchester United and Chelsea, directors are already giving up hope of ending the championship drought that has already lasted 16 seasons.<br><br>And one influential figure on the six-man board revealed that Benitez's leadership of the team was being questioned.<br><br>"We have paid too many inflated prices and inflated wages for players who are not doing the job," said the director, who is concerned for the future of the club but wants to remain anonymous to avoid a boardroom split.<br><br>"When it comes to any manager, the view of the board has always been to let them get on with it. We do not believe in interfering.<br><br>"But the day will come when we may not be that way inclined any more. We have always been very respectful of any manager we appoint.

But if we are to make investment in the team we are talking about Â£20m of income we need to have every season."<br><br>Criticism of Benitez - who still has the backing of chairman David Moores - was aimed at his constant team changing and the lack of any pattern or passion in last weekend's Old Trafford defeat.<br><br>"We were looking to do something in the league. We thought it would be this year and it's not going to happen now.<br><br>"Normally, by the time you get to October, you'd expect the manager to know his best team and stick with it but there are no signs of that happening now.
