The club would be entitled to compensation, but only equaling the amount of the final year's wages as per the contract, which would be far less than an agreed transfer fee in most cases. </span><br><br>Take Michael Owen for example... Liverpool could have got much more for him, if they had re-newed his contract earlier and offer him more $ but instead they waited too long and he was still being paid his signed 3 or 4 yrs ago salary. And when his contract left one year, he wanted to leave, they had to let him go cheaply at $8m or risk losing him for nothing. Real got him on the cheap really... cos a player of his caliber would have cost double which they did get a year later from Newcastle. ($16m)<br><br>Then there is Steve McManaman... He left Liverpool for free and has personally benefited financially from the move. (Instead of the club)<br><br><span style="color: brown;">According to Forbes Magazine in 2000, McManaman was listed as 6th on the list of highest earning footballers in the world. McManaman is believed to have pocketed an estimated 15 million Euros in his four years in Madrid.</span> Although he didn't played much but he signed for them with a huge salary increment from his previous. These players probably wouldn't have got such a huge salary increment if they had stayed back at their clubs.<br><br>Then there is Chelsea's Michael Ballack...<br><br>He signed a 3 yrs contract at $130,000 a week which Bayern Munich couldn't afford to give him. His salary adds up to $7.2m a year. In his 3 yrs there, he would probably make around 22m But if he had came with a huge trans fee like $25m then his total would be almost 50m right? Instead chelsea's total layout on him would probably be less than 25m exclude bonus of course...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dun think rotation is the key, compare to Arsenal, Wenger do rotation his players. Rafa made a mistake being too nice to his players, look at SAF always give his players free hair drying treatmet.<br><br>On formation, there is not much to talk as u look at Arsenal, at any point of time in the game midfield and striker swap position either left or right.<br><br>As for ball control, pool have alot to do.<br><br>Man U win cos they control the ball and passes well, they din play very well in this game either.<br><br>Liverpool have not change much for past 15 years, but manage to win the UCL. The teamwork need alot of improvement. I remember one player left said in the team itself  players were divided into 3-4 group, if u have player dun work together this is the end result. They need to build a strong bond amoung themself, just like the national team and spurs too.<br><br>Football is a team game not Gerrard game.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's probably a combination of many factors. Rotation, tough fixture start, Pepe Reina and the post world cup effect.<br><br><strong>Rotation</strong><br>Chopping changes week in week out is not going to help the team gel. It's after all a team sport. A contributing factor to the poor defence...one week its Aurelio, the next its Risse. One week its Agger, the next its Hyppia..There's just no sync in the defence...<br><br>And think abt the msg being sent across the players...If you know that you're going to be rotated and dropped anyway, will you be trying as hard as you should to play better and keep your spot in the First XI?<br><br><strong>Tough fixture start</strong><br>You've got to admit that the fixture list hasn't been too kind to LFC. Think abt it...Sheff Utd, Everton, Chelsea, Bolton, Man United away in succession...those are really tough games...Maybe we should be more optimistic, hopefully, we'll be able to find our form back and start to move back into gear...and we'll deal with the same tough sequence of games again later on in the campaign. This time, with all of them being be played at Anfield.<br><br><strong>Pepe Reina</strong><br>He hasn't really impressed me...too erractic for my liking...He should have been dropped after the howler against Everton...<br><br><strong>Post World Cup</strong><br>Nah...who am I kidding..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by zocoss:</div><div class="quote_body">No no... don't get me wrong, what i meant is the transfer fee is something that is necessary when a player is still under contract but since the Bosman rule where players can leave for nothing once their contract expire... players have used this to their advantage.<br><br>Off course the club or clubs that want them would also be happy as they can save on a huge transfer fee which they can use to offer the player a little more than he was getting at his previous club or a "personal sign-on bonus".<br><br><span style="color: brown;">Bosman rule<br>An addendum to this rule means that a player may move in the final year of a four or five year contract. The club would be entitled to compensation, but only equaling the amount of the final year's wages as per the contract, which would be far less than an agreed transfer fee in most cases. </span><br><br>Take Michael Owen for example... Liverpool could have got much more for him, if they had re-newed his contract earlier and offer him more $ but instead they waited too long and he was still being paid his signed 3 or 4 yrs ago salary. And when his contract left one year, he wanted to leave, they had to let him go cheaply at $8m or risk losing him for nothing. Real got him on the cheap really... cos a player of his caliber would have cost double which they did get a year later from Newcastle. ($16m)<br><br>Then there is Steve McManaman... He left Liverpool for free and has personally benefited financially from the move. (Instead of the club)<br><br><span style="color: brown;">According to Forbes Magazine in 2000, McManaman was listed as 6th on the list of highest earning footballers in the world. McManaman is believed to have pocketed an estimated 15 million Euros in his four years in Madrid.</span> Although he didn't played much but he signed for them with a huge salary increment from his previous. These players probably wouldn't have got such a huge salary increment if they had stayed back at their clubs.<br><br>Then there is Chelsea's Michael Ballack...<br><br>He signed a 3 yrs contract at $130,000 a week which Bayern Munich couldn't afford to give him. His salary adds up to $7.2m a year. In his 3 yrs there, he would probably make around 22m But if he had came with a huge trans fee like $25m then his total would be almost 50m right? Instead chelsea's total layout on him would probably be less than 25m exclude bonus of course...</div></blockquote>ya u're rite n i knew tat too..<br>but my bottomline is transer fee is transfer free,<br>wages is wages,<br>n tats all..<br>dont mix tat 2 together,<br>n its a give n take situation..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>tough to say, but right now liverpools season is on the brink, i think....<br><br>hvg said tt, they played the 2 toughest team, chel$ki and red devil, lost to bogey team bolton and a tough derby with toffeeman. one cld argue the worst is over to liverpool. they need to start piling on the points from now onwards and beat the top 3 teams including everton and bolton @ anfield.<br><br>then i think liverpool will stand a chance, but we nvr learn abt starting off well. to go on a 4 straight loss is unbearable....<br><br>rafa needs to get his act together.</div>

But BenÃ­tez said: "He's as happy as he is in the national team. He's playing for Steve McClaren on the right side.<br><br>"Steve McClaren is clever, he knows the best season of Steven Gerrard was playing as a right-winger going inside, not as a right-winger close to the touchline, and scoring 23 goals. Steven is the captain, he knows the most important thing is the club, the supporters and, if he plays on the right side, going inside with freedom, and Momo Sissoko and Xabi Alonso can give the balance to the team. He knows that is better for the team."</div>
