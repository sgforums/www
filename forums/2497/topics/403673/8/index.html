              <h3><strong>Capello blames disallowed goal</strong></h3>
              <div class="freestyle-text">
              <p class="excerpt"><em>Fabio Capello refused to blame his players for England's woeful exit from the FIFA World Cup™ at the hands of Germany.</em></p>
              <p>Instead he focussed on the decision to disallow Frank Lampard's equalising 'goal'.</p>
              <p>England had been outplayed and were 2-1 down when Lampard's effort hit the underside of Manuel Neuer's bar and bounced down a clear yard over the line.</p>
              <p>Assistant referee Mauricio Espinosa failed to spot it, though, and instead of drawing level at 2-2, England capitulated in the second half to lose 4-1, their worst ever World Cup defeat.</p>
              <p>"It was one of the most important things in the game," Capello told BBC1.</p>
              <p>"The goal was very important. We could have played a different style.</p>
              <p>"We played I think well at 2-1, but after the third goal it was a little bit disappointing.</p>
              <p>"We played well. Germany is a big team. They played a good game. We made some mistakes when they played the counter-attack. The referee made bigger mistakes.</p>
              <p>"Little things decide the result always."</p>

              <p>i think capello is in a world of his own, deluded. So many times in the game english players failed to track back when german players were ghosting into their box. My dad predicted 5 german goals by the end of the game at 20 mins and he wasn't far off LOL.</p>
              <p>I hope by the next world cup, mourinho is the manager. He assigns two players on every attacking player in the zone. Last night? Holy crap, the English were slow to pounce on encroaching germans. All freaking over rated players, dun even know who to begin with. All players should be chopped from the next WC with the exception of rooney. Overrated, overpaid, overwhelmed.</p>
              <p>I hope the next WC, we bring genuine players, not crap like heskey, SWP, upson etc.</p>

              Sunday’s Round of 16 loss to Germany did effect the team but has not 
              used it as an excuse for their eventual 4-1 defeat.</p>
              <p>Gerrard feels that his side were right in the game when the score was
               2-1 and to have Frank Lampard’s goal disallowed was a key moment in the
               contest.</p>
              <p>“There were big key decisions in the game, at 2-1 we had a goal 
              disallowed,” he told <em>BBC5 Live</em>.</p>
              <p>“At 2-1 we were hurting them and we were still in the game. I think it 
              had an effect but we cannot use that as an excuse with being beaten 4-1.</p>
              <p>“That would have been a big goal for us. It’s all ifs and buts. Germany 
              are a fantastic team and they deserved their win.</p>
              <p>“They were more clinical in front of goal and they made less mistakes 
              than us and we got punished for that today.”</p>

              <div class="articlead"></div>
              <p>Franz Beckenbauer was happy to twist the knife into England 
              after Germany's 4-1 victory yesterday.</p>
              <p>The <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Bayern Munich</span></abbr> chief could not help himself further 
              taunting England's players after the triumph.</p>
              <p>"England were overwhelmed - they just could not come to terms with our 
              style of play," he said.</p>
              <p>"We have taken England apart. We were simply better in every aspect."</p>
              <p>Matthew Upson had given England some hope with a goal which made it 2-1 
              before the break, after Miroslav Klose and Lukas Podolski had put 
              Germany 2-1 up.</p>
              <p>It should have been 2-2 just seconds later when <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Frank Lampard</span></abbr>'s lob cannoned down off the underside
               of the crossbar and over the line.</p>
              <p>However, unlike in 1966, the goal was not given and a Thomas Muller 
              double put the seal on a comfortable win for Germany.</p>
              <p>And Beckenbauer was relieved that Germany had added two more goals to 
              render that Lampard strike insignificant.</p>
              <p>"The linesman really has to see the that goal which was not given," he 
              said. "It was a clear goal.</p>
              <p>"Fortunately, we added two more, otherwise there would be a lot more 
              discussion about it."</p>

              <p>i would scoff whenever i see terry, ferdinand or carragher sending long balls past midfield. Naive football in today's technical game. Don't even do it unless you are beckham.</p>
              <p>These 3 players are already past their best. Don't ever call up SWP or Heskey anymore. One's a brainless runner while the other cannot score except knocking balls onto his strike partner all his career.</p>
              <p>James milner, barry etc....all over-rated. Above average players at best. If we had ozil or muller in the EPL, milner wouldn't even have won the young player's award by distant miles.</p>
              <p>And capello says england has played well. Something isterribly wrong with the english mindset. The cracks were already apparent in the pre WC friendlies. They struggled against Japan and Mexico, both 2nd round teams in the recent WC. Even if they did well in the qualifiers, which was their toughest opponent? Croatia...and that really is a big joke and over inflated ego. I hope they fail to qualify for both the next Euro and WC. And they get thrashed a few more times. That should teach these egoistic bastards a good lesson.</p>
