            <div class='col-md body'>Mijatovic In Rome To Seal Chivu Deal<br><br>Real Madrid sporting director Pedja Mijatovic has travelled to Rome with the clear objective of signing Christian Chivu, come what may.<br><br>The Merengue bosses have already tabled a 16 million euro offer, and are ready to go up to 17m if need be. Roma have maintained that an 18 million bid will seal the deal.<br><br>Barcelona and Inter both have offers totalling 18m, but the deal would include players as well. Madrid are ready to offer cash.<br><br>AS are reporting that Madrid have already agreed a 4.5 million a year salary with Chivu's agent Gigi Becali, who, rather interestingly, had travelled to Barcelona on Monday.<br><br>Marca insist that Mijatovic could even throw one of the three Cs - Cassano, Cicinho and Cannavaro - into the deal in order to land Chivu.<br><br>Barcelona based Sport add that Fifa agent Ernesto Bronzetti - who often negotiates on behalf of Madrid in Italy, and who had earlier insisted that Chivu wants to move to Barcelona - also travelled with Mijatovic.<br><br>The situation, as it stands, is that Chivu has now agreed terms with all the three clubs (all said to be around 4 million euros per season), and it is Roma who must choose the club they want to sell to.<br><br>Barcelona's final offer is 14 million euros plus Ludovic Giuly, Inter are offering 15 million and half of Obinna's registration, while Madrid are at 17 million, but also prepared to throw players into the deal if the cash sum is lower.<br><br>Stay tuned as this complicated saga concludes. A final decision is expected today!<br></div>

However, the successful completion of the operation is now dependant on the player's personal desire."<br><br>However, his agent Victor Becali revealed that no agreement had been reached.<br><br>"Real Madrid's wage offer was way below Inter's proposal," Becali said. "Chivu will remain with Roma unless Real make a new offer."<br><br>Roma could find themselves in a difficult situation if Chivu fails to a agree terms with Real, losing out on a substantial amount of money.<br><br>Becali said: "The ball is in Real Madrid's court now.
