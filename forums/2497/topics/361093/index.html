              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/05/22/article-1186288-04D5D082000005DC-52_306x353.jpg" alt="Michael Ballack berates Tom Henning Ovrebo" width="306" height="353"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Taking the Mickey: Ballack berates Ovrebo after turning down a penalty claim</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>UEFA have charged </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea </strong></span></a><strong>, Didier Drogba and Jose Bosingwa in relation to incidents following the UEFA Champions League semi-final second leg against Barcelona at Stamford Bridge.</strong></p>
              <p>There were angry scenes at the end of the game on May 6, with Blues players confronting Norwegian referee Tom Henning Ovrebo at the final whistle. Barcelona went through to the final after drawing the match 1-1 but Chelsea claimed they should have had up to four penalties.</p>
              <p>A UEFA statement read: 'The club are charged with the improper conduct of their players and the throwing of missiles by their supporters, while Drogba and Bosingwa are accused of being in breach of the principles of sportsmanship by insulting the referee by making offensive comments.</p>
              <p>'The club and the individuals concerned have been requested to file a statement by Friday, May 29. The UEFA control &amp; disciplinary body will deal with the case on 17 June.'</p>
              <p>The announcement means that German midfielder Michael Ballack has escaped individual punishment despite his aggressive protest towards Ovrebo after the Norwegian official had turned down the last of four penalty claims.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's temporary boss Guus Hiddink said that he did not regret the behavious of his players that night against Barcelona.</p>
              <p>The Dutchman today said: 'I don't regret anything about what has been done so far.'</p>
              <p>European football’s governing body have taken three weeks to analyse and assess all the evidence surrounding the events that centred on Ovrebo, and are expected to hand out stiff punishments.</p>
              <p>Drogba faces a lengthy ban for his part in the affair after he remonstrated with Ovrebo on the pitch and then shouted obscenities into a television camera.</p>
              <p>The following day, wing-back Jose Bosingwa laid the blame for the Blues' failure to reach their second successive final squarely at Ovrebo's feet.</p>
              <p>'I don't know if he's a referee or a thief,' he told Portuguese television station RTP. 'I don't have any words to describe that man that was on the pitch.</p>
              <p>'We have nothing against Barcelona's goal but the penalties that he didn't give us and his way of managing the game weren't right at all.</p>
              <p>'This referee should never referee a game again. What happened was a disgrace. 'It was a well contested game but the referee came to spoil our game.'</p>
              <p>He later retracted the comments in a statement issued on behalf of the player to the Portuguese media, saying: 'We were all very disappointed and frustrated after the game, but I regret describing the referee as a thief. Having had some time to reflect I would like to withdraw those comments.'</p>

              <p><strong>Frank Lampard last night admitted their semi-final exit, when they were denied four penalty claims in the second leg while being dumped out by a 93rd-minute goal, still hurt.</strong></p>
              <p>'What matters for me is the team get what they deserve. This year we had a complete injustice in the biggest competition,' the Chelsea midfielder told the <span style="font-style: italic;">London Evening Standard</span>.</p>
              <p>'The frustrating thing about that was that everyone spent the next two weeks talking about us being upset after the game and not about how well we played. I just hope we can come out winning the FA Cup Final.'</p>
              <p>Ashley Cole added: 'It would have been a good season if it wasn’t for certain referees but we have to get on with it.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>UEFA's investigation is believed to have considered how:</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Drogba, who had been substituted, confronted referee Tom Henning Ovrebo at the final whistle and swore in front of a TV camera; </li>
              <li>Ballack chased the referee after Ovrebo had rejected a fourth disputed penalty claim; </li>
              <li>captain Terry questioned the suitability of the referee; </li>
              <li>and Bosingwa questioned whether Ovrebo was a 'thief' in a post-match interview, but later apologised.<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Drogba also apologised but is likely to face the heftiest penalty, which could include a fine and suspension from several European matches at the start of next season.</p>
