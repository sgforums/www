            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Premiership: Man United close in on title<br></strong><br><img src="http://soccernet-akamai.espn.go.com/design05/images/domr/unitedceleb_bc_e.jpg"><br><br>Manchester United came out on top 1-0 in a derby-day battle of the spot-kicks to move to within a single point of the Premiership title.<br><br>BarryCoombs/Empics<br>Michael Ball fouls Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo for a penalty.<br><br>Given Jose Mourinho's well-aired opinions on the 'new rules' regarding penalties currently in operation in the top flight, there was irony in the knowledge Cristiano Ronaldo's success from the spot, and Darius Vassell's subsequent failure means Chelsea must now win at Arsenal on Sunday if United's visit to Stamford Bridge next Wednesday is not to become a Red Devils party.<br><br>Mourinho could have no complaints about United's award, which produced Ronaldo's 23rd goal of the season.<br><br>The winger was clearly caught by Michael Ball, with the only criticism surrounding the whole incident being that the City man was still on the pitch after an outrageous stamp on Ronaldo much earlier in the contest.<br><br>But for Mourinho the real knife-twister was that after referee Rob Styles ruled Wes Brown had bundled Ball over 11 minutes from time, Vassell could only drive his penalty straight into Edwin van der Sar's legs.<br><br>It only maintained an unhappy scoring sequence for City, which condemns them to start next season knowing their last league goal on home soil came on New Year's Day.<br><br>Not that United will care a jot about that. The title may not quite be won yet, but once the formalities are confirmed, it will forever be remembered in Old Trafford folklore as the season they won the league at City.<br><br>It is difficult to assess the precise impact the absence of suspended midfielder Joey Barton had on the Blues, although given the erratic state of mind which prompted the ugly training-ground assault on Ousmane Dabo, which now leaves the England man facing possible police action, it is probably just as well he was not let loose in such a high-octane atmosphere.<br><br>The game was only two minutes old when Ronaldo went down amid a pile of City players, clutching his stomach.<br><br>Had Styles seen Ball deliberately drive his studs into the man voted both PFA and Football Writers' Player of the Year, he would have been instantly dismissed.<br><br>Instead, Styles missed it, although it did not take long for Ferguson to view the incident again on a TV monitor.<br><br>The irate Scot came roaring out of his dug out to voice his protests at a truly disgraceful act, which, given the bad publicity City have already endured this week, the Blues could have well done without.<br><br>Ball and Ronaldo exchanged brief and unpleasant words when they tangled again shortly afterwards close to the City area and it was hardly a surprise little was seen of the United winger for half an hour or so afterwards.<br><br>Revenge, when it arrived, was very sweet indeed for Ronaldo as he goaded Ball into an ill-advised tackle. A veteran of derby-day clashes in both Liverpool and Glasgow, the full-back was not having a very good day all in all and as he made no contact with the ball and chopped at Ronaldo's legs, the penalty award was automatic.<br><br>The home fans did their best to put the United man off, twirling some of the 40,000 blue and white scarves handed out before kick-off. But Ronaldo's resolve remained strong and he calmly sent Andreas Isaksson the wrong way.<br><br>Not that it was vintage United by any means. The visitors enjoyed plenty of possession, but the draining effects of their Champions League defeat in Milan on Wednesday were obvious and it was City who actually carved out the clearer chances.<br><br>Emile Mpenza and DaMarcus Beasley both drove shots straight at van der Sar as City pushed forward on the counter.<br><br>In the absence of Barton, teenage Academy graduate Michael Johnson showed great maturity to hold his own in the midfield exchanges and Nedum Onuoha was equally effective in quelling the threat of Wayne Rooney.<br><br>Given the appalling scoring record of Stuart Pearce's side, the hosts - and Chelsea - must have feared one goal would be enough to earn maximum points.<br><br>Paul Scholes blasted a shot straight at Isaksson at the start of the second half as United looked to give themselves a bit of extra breathing space.<br><br>Largely, though, Ferguson's team contented themselves with extended keep-ball sessions, which were only interrupted briefly by City who, in fairness, were not that far off levelling when Mpenza nodded Sun Jihai's corner wide.<br><br>The big chance came near the end when Ball went down trying to force his way past Brown.<br><br>Vassell struck his shot powerfully enough, only for Van der Sar's long legs to get in the way.<br><br>Post Match Analysis on ESPN<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VKGrJ9-hA4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VKGrJ9-hA4</a><br><br>Post Match Scenes<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUUOLSfl_Y8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUUOLSfl_Y8</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> Pearce to ponder Ball action</strong><br><br>Manchester City manager Stuart Pearce will review video replays of Michael Ball's controversial challenge on Cristiano Ronaldo before deciding if any punishment is necessary.<br><br>The incident took place in the second minute of United's 1-0 victory and left Sir Alex Ferguson incensed.<br><br>The Old Trafford manager raced to the touchline to remonstrate with the officials after referee Rob Styles waved play on.<br><br>Pearce responded: 'People have mentioned the tackle to me and are not particularly happy with what happened.<br><br>'But I have not seen that. Certain things happen in games and people pick up on them.<br><br>'I will review the incident on video and will make any decision from there.<br><br>'I am sure the authorities will do whatever they do.<br><br>'We often leave decision to referees and officials above them. It will be down to them.'<br><br>Ronaldo got his own back by scoring the winner from the penalty spot in the 33rd minute after being tripped by Ball.<br><br>It was his 23rd goal of the season and while Pearce had no complaints about the spot-kick being awarded, he was unhappy at the Portugal winger's behaviour.<br><br>He said: 'Ronaldo is an excellent player with very quick feet. He is very talented.<br><br>'But he went down very cheaply in our box and was looking for a penalty after the one that had been awarded.'<br><br>City chalked up an unwanted record as well by failing to score against their closest rivals.<br><br>Their home league tally of 10 goals in 19 games is the worst ever in the four divisions.<br><br>They squandered a great chance of drawing level and finding the target with only 10 minutes to go when a penalty was awarded after Ball was barged over by Wes Brown.<br><br>Darius Vassell drilled his effort straight down the channel and goalkeeper Edwin Van der Sar cleared with his legs.<br><br>The last time City scored at home in the league was in the 2-1 victory against Everton on New Year's Day.<br><br>Pearce added: ' It has been our achilles heel all season. We need more cutting edge, no doubt about that.<br><br>'Defensively, however, we have been pretty reasonably this season.'<br><br>Meanwhile, having abandoned plans to fly off to Zaragoza to watch United youngster Gerard Pique in La Liga, manager Sir Alex Ferguson will head outside rather than watch Arsenal attempt to deprive Chelsea of the win that will extend the championship race into the final week following his side's Manchester derby win at Eastlands.<br><br>'I won't be watching the game on TV,' confirmed Ferguson.<br><br>'I was going to see Gerard Pique play but there has been a problem with the flights, so I will go for a game of golf instead.<br><br>'Hopefully Arsenal will get the result we want tomorrow but if we have to go to Chelsea to get something on Wednesday, we will look forward to it.'<br><br>A combination of the first-half penalty Cristiano Ronaldo scored and the one after half-time Darius Vassell missed means even if Jose Mourinho's men win at the Emirates Stadium, then beat United at Stamford Bridge next week, a draw for the Old Trafford outfit on home soil against West Ham on the final day will be enough to clinch the hard-fought title.<br><br>'It has been a great title race but I think this result finishes it,' admitted City boss Stuart Pearce.<br><br>'You do not win the league over 38 games through luck. Manchester United are an extremely talented side with some fantastic players.'<br><br>As Ferguson pointed out, his squad also have plenty of durability.<br><br>Although they were never at their best against a City side who have beaten them on three of the last four meetings on home soil, in the end they proved worthy winners, casting off the lethargy brought on by an arrival back in England in the early hours of Thursday morning following their Champions League defeat to Milan.<br><br>'It was a great example of human courage,' said Ferguson.<br><br>'The Premier League did not do us any favours with the kick-off time but we dug deep and saw it through, which is all you can ask for at this stage of the season.<br><br>'I don't think there will be many more twists and turns now.<br><br>'If we had lost today, it would have given Chelsea a lot of confidence but we have both had hard seasons and maybe that is why we were both knocked out of the European Cup this week.'<br><br>Ferguson revealed he was ready to introduce Ole Gunnar Solskjaer if Vassell had levelled the game. But in the end, it was not required as the former England striker blasted his shot against Edwin van der Sar's legs.<br><br>'Ole is one player in the world who you can bring on to score a goal,' said Ferguson.<br><br>'Thankfully, Edwin showed his experience and made the save.'<br><br>Ferguson claimed he was not in a good position to see whether Wes Brown had fouled Michael Ball for the Blues' spot-kick.<br><br>However, he did see Ball trip Ronaldo for United's penalty, and he also saw the City man stamp on his star man in the second minute, an outrageous incident that was not spotted by referee Rob Styles.<br><br>'The lad stamped on Ronaldo,' said Ferguson.<br><br>'It was also a clear penalty for us. Cristiano took it well, as he has done all his penalties this season.'</div>
