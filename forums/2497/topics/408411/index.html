              <h1>Top 10 Things To Expect If Diego Maradona Joins The Premier League</h1>
              <h2>Football legend and former Argentina coach Diego Maradona has 
              been linked with the manager's job at Aston Villa.</h2>

              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> <strong><em>Please note the below is satirical and just a bit of fun...</em></strong><br><br>10) Following his move to Villa, Maradona forces his players to join the Church of Maradona.
               In order to be baptised by John ‘The Baptist’ Carew, each player must 
              emulate the 'Hand of God' at Villa Park. The first to be converted is 
              Stilian Petrov, and Maradona announces that his team is ‘Petrov plus ten
               others' in a 4-1-5 formation. Diego labels his twelfth disciple, James 
              Milner, ‘Judas’ after he joins Manchester City for 30 million pieces of 
              silver.<br><br>9) In his opening  press conference, Maradona admits he 
              made a mistake taking the job: "I thought they wanted me to join Ricky 
              Villa, and  that we were going to manage a club in Birmingham, Alabama” -
               home of  the Coke bottling company.<br><br>8) After being informed that
               Gabriel Agbonlahor once cheated on three  different girls and got them 
              all pregnant at the same time, Maradona  applauds his striker and says: 
              “As long as the girls do all the work.  Gabby can’t deliver crosses, so 
              I’m sure he won’t even attempt to deliver  babies.”<br><br>7) Ashley 
              Young is dropped from the starting XI, with Emile Heskey taking his 
              place. When asked why, Maradona claims he had a dream that Heskey led 
              Villa to the title by breaking the Premier League scoring record and 
              hitting the winner on the final day of the season with a 30-yard bicycle
               kick against Chelsea. <br><br>
              </span></p><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://u.goal.com/43400/43459_hp.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="230"></div>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>This wasn't part of the dream</strong></div>
              <br>6) On the 25th anniversary of the famous 1986 World Cup quarter 
              final, Maradona storms the SKY Sports studios with his trusted air rifle
               and wounds three pundits after they claimed that not a single 
              Argentine, including himself, would get into the current England team. 
              Diego then repeats his infamous Athletic Bilbao karate kick on Charlie 
              Nicholas after the analyst replicated his line that "Wayne Rooney would 
              be remembered as the greatest player of all time".<br><br>5) Maradona 
              then falls out with the entire press and refuses to speak in English. 
              Journalists are only allowed to ask questions in Spanish and when the 
              first reporter dares to do it, Maradona grins: "Bravo, now tell your 
              mates: '<em>que la chupen y que la siguen chupando!!!'</em>" <br><br>4) 
              Following a heated encounter between Aston Villa and Newcastle United, 
              Joey Barton stands in front of Dieguito’s car as he attempts to drive 
              out of the St James’ Park car park. Maradona reacts by flicking his 
              Cuban cigar into Barton’s eye, running over the ex-convict’s leg, before
               making a blowjob gesture to the cameras.<br><br>

              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>Diego then makes a lurid fist gesture to Barton<br></strong></div>
              <br>3) Maradona tells Sir Alex Ferguson to “go back to the museum”, and 
               Arsene Wenger that he “debuted with lads” after an Arsenal Under-18 
              team  thrashes Man Utd 5-0 in the first round of the League Cup.<br><br>2)
               Socialist Maradona misses Aston Villa’s top of the table clash against 
              Manchester United after travelling down to London for a 'Stop The War' 
              protest in Hyde Park. Dieguito addresses the ten million strong crowd: 
              “Comrades, we must end this evil imperialism. The UK and US are in Iraq 
              and soon Iran for their oil, and in Afghanistan for their drugs.” When 
              chairman Randy Lerner invites President Obama to Villa Park as a guest 
              of honour, Maradona threatens to resign. “Anyone who thinks Obama is 
              going to change the world is stupider than Pele. The puppet wants war 
              and his entire cabinet is Wall Street. We need a revolution. Viva Fidel.
               Viva Chavez!”<br><br>1) After selling Milner for 30 million pieces of 
              silver, Maradona is offered the chance to replace him with Javier 
              Zanetti, Esteban Cambiasso, Diego Milito and Juan Roman Riquelme. El 
              Pibe d'Oro rejects the opportunity and instead spends the money on Ariel
               Garce, Diego Pozo and his beloved Martin Palermo. Palermo earns a 
              "contract for life" after bundling home an injury time winner on his 
              debut against Chelsea, with Maradona celebrating the strike by 
              belly-diving across the waterlogged touchline and taking out Carlo 
              Ancelotti. "That's payback for when you hacked me during Napoli-Milan in
               1988," laughs Maradona after the game.<br><br><img style="border: 1px solid black; vertical-align: middle; margin: 5px;" src="http://u.goal.com/58000/58060hp2.jpg" alt="" width="570" height="330"><br>
