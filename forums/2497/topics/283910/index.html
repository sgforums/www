Because you can see a massive reduction in the quality. If you have the choice between 200 million players or 50 million players, it is less good.<br><br>"It is as simple as that.<br><br>"It will protect the bad players, or those who are not good enough.<br><br>"Also, if the best English players play with the best world-class players, then they will be even better and develop quicker."</div>

He seem to have strengthen his voice if both Fifa &amp; Uefa agree on it.</div>
