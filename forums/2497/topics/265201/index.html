            <div class='col-md body'>Eduardo Can Replace Henry - Croatia Coach Bilic<br><br>Slaven Bilic had backed Eduardo da Silva to make his mark at Arsenal.<br><br>Despite Dinamo claiming otherwise, the transfee is supposed to be in the region of Â£8-10m. The 24-year-old signed a four year contract at the Emirates.<br><br>Croatian coach Slaven Bilic, who has made him a regular international, tips him for some great things while asking the Gunners to be patient.<br><br>"He is not yet a big name in the Premier League but, donÂ’t forget, he has already scored a goal against England," began Bilic.<br><br>"In fact, last season, he scored 54 goals combined for Croatia and for Zagreb. He is certainly a goalscorer.<br><br>"No one can replace Thierry Henry at Arsenal right now. He is the one of the best strikers in the world. And the things he did for Arsenal over the last six or seven years were amazing.<br><br>"But, as I remember it, while he clicked with the club from the start, he didnÂ’t play beautifully for them in his first season. He did well but it took him time to adjust.<br><br>"Eduardo can replace Thierry Henry but the Arsenal fans need to give him time."<br><br>"Zagreb did not want to sell their captain," he continued. "The president of the club told me he had received much bigger offers from teams in Russia and the Ukraine for Da Silva.<br><br>"He resisted them all but when Arsenal called, I told him Â‘how can you deny the boy this dream?Â’<br><br>"This is Arsenal Football Club, one of the most respected and famous clubs in the world. He couldnÂ’t do it to Da Silva and reluctantly agreed to sell."<br><br>Coming back to the Gunners, Bilic added: "ItÂ’s a big blow to Arsenal to lose Thierry Henry to Barcelona. But with Emmanuel Adebayor, Robin Van Persie and Theo Walcott, Da Silva will sort out most of their problems in attack.<br><br>"Eduardo scores great goals but that is not all he can do. He can open space for other players in the team. Last season he had the most assists in the Croatian League. Arsenal fans will be delighted with him, I am sure of it."<br></div>
