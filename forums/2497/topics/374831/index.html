              <p><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester City</strong></span><strong> forward Carlos Tevez will miss Saturday's Barclays Premier League game against Arsenal.</strong>  </p>
              <p>The 25-year-old picked a knee injury while on international duty with Argentina, but City hope he will ready to face Manchester United the following weekend.</p>
              <p>'Our doctor has spoken to the Argentine medical people and the feeling is that he is out for the weekend so he will not play against Arsenal,'  said Hughes.  </p>
              <p>'The hope is that he will be okay for the derby, but we will have to determine that when he comes back. </p>
              <p>'He is staying with the national squad because he needs acute treatment at the early stage of the injury, which is what he can get now.</p>
              <p>'Flying him back quickly might compromise the injury, so he will be back towards the end of the week so we can assess him and hopefully get him ready for the United game.'</p>
              <p>Robinho, who faced Tevez in Brazil's 3-1 win over Argentina on Saturday, also has a slight knock.  'It's a different situation with Robi,' said Hughes. 'It's an old injury that he aggravated last year, just above his ankle.</p>
              <p>'We are going to get him back as soon as possible, the hope is that he will be an option for the weekend.'</p>

              <p>The Gunners midfielder has been troubled by the problem for a while, and was forced to sit out Russia's World Cup qualifier against Liechtenstein on Saturday as a result.</p>
              <p>He did, however, play the full 90 minutes for his country against Wales on Wednesday, helping Guus Hiddink's side to a 3-1 victory in Cardiff.</p>
              <p>That outing has come at a price, though, with <span class=" lingo_link" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12.1667px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;">Arshavin</span><img id="lingo_icon" class="lingo_icon  lingo_icon_black" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 0pt ! important; padding: 0pt; float: none; position: static; left: auto; top: auto; line-height: normal; background-color: transparent; visibility: visible; width: 12px; height: 12px; background-repeat: no-repeat; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: top; display: inline; cursor: pointer;" src="http://static.lingospot.com/spot/image/spacer.gif" alt=""> inflaming his previous injury.</p>
              <p>He will now be forced to miss Arsenal's next two fixtures, and his presence will be greatly missed by the Gunners.</p>
              <p>They face a mammoth clash against unbeaten City at Eastlands on Saturday, before starting their UEFA Champions League group campaign in Liege on Wednesday.</p>

              <p><strong>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger fumes at Guus Hiddink after Andrey Arshavin is ruled out of Manchester City clash - and Champions League trip</strong><br><br></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger has blamed Russia manager Guus Hiddink for leaving him without key player  Andrey Arshavin for </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Arsenal's</strong></span></a><strong> next three matches.</strong></p>
              <p>Arshavin aggravated a groin injury playing for Russia against Wales on Wednesday, having been left out of Russia’s previous game against Lichtenstein.</p>
              <p>And Wenger, who will lose Arshavin for Saturday’s trip to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester City</span></a>, the opening Champions League group game against Standard Liege and the league game against Wigan, is adamant that Hiddink should have rested his star striker.</p>
              <p>Wenger said: ‘Arshavin will be out for Saturday. He should not have played. He will be out for Saturday, Wednesday and against Wigan. He had a groin problem so I took him off against Manchester United. He should not have played. You can say a lot, but it doesn't do a lot.’</p>
              <p>Arshavin’s absence is likely to see a start for Eduardo at Eastlands, and Wenger admitted he can expect more rough treatment form Manchester City’s fans after England supporters jeered the Croat striker in Wednesday’s 5-1 win at Wembley.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Andrey Arshavin has been ruled out of Arsenal's games against Manchester City and Standard Liege with a groin injury.</p>
              <p>The Gunners midfielder has been troubled by the problem for a while, and was forced to sit out Russia's World Cup qualifier against Liechtenstein on Saturday as a result.</p>
              <p>He did, however, play the full 90 minutes for his country against Wales on Wednesday, helping Guus Hiddink's side to a 3-1 victory in Cardiff.</p>
              <p>That outing has come at a price, though, with <span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;">Arshavin</span><img style="line-height: normal; background-color: transparent; width: 12px; display: inline; float: none; height: 12px; vertical-align: top; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none; border: 0pt; padding: 0pt;" src="http://static.lingospot.com/spot/image/spacer.gif" alt=""> inflaming his previous injury.</p>
              <p>He will now be forced to miss Arsenal's next two fixtures, and his presence will be greatly missed by the Gunners.</p>
              <p>They face a mammoth clash against unbeaten City at Eastlands on Saturday, before starting their UEFA Champions League group campaign in Liege on Wednesday.</p>

              <h1>Manchester City's Emmanuel Adebayor lifts the lid on his feud with Nicklas Bendtner</h1>
              <h2>It all kicked off over Nicklas Bendtner's sneakers, apparently. The friction worsened with a dressing-room debate about respect at Arsenal, turned nasty with a very public scrap between Bendtner and Emmanuel Adebayor and culminated in the Togo striker being sold to Manchester City. From little sparks, a pair of trainers in this case, do infernos grow.</h2>
              <div class="slideshow">
              <div class="ssImg" style="display: block;"><img src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01480/ade2_1480210c.jpg" alt="Manchester City's Emmanuel Adebayor lifts the lid on his feud with Arsenal's Nicklas Bendtner " width="460" height="288">

              <div class="imageExtras"></div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Adebayor has been one of the stars of this nascent Premier League season, a joy to watch as he glides around, linking and scoring for City. Bendtner has also impressed for a revitalised, united Arsenal. As they collide at Eastlands on Saturday, this strange, sad and rather toxic story needs telling.</strong></p>
              <p>Adebayor has moved on physically but clearly not mentally, judging by the time he spent explaining his spectacular falling-out with Arsenal, starting with the shoes. "I have never been a bad influence in the dressing room,’’ Adebayor began. "I had a little difficult moment with Nicklas Bendtner.</p>
              <p>"There was a rule at Arsenal where no one is allowed to come into the dressing room with trainers or house shoes on. I cannot understand why Nicklas came every day with his shoes on.’’</p>
              <p>So he cornered the cocky young Dane. "Nicklas, you are a footballer, I am a footballer,’’ Adebayor told him. "Maybe I am better than you, maybe you are better than me but you have to respect everyone. There are rules saying you cannot come into the dressing-room with your house shoes. Take them off.’’</p>
              <p>According to Adebayor, Bendtner "never took them off and things started from there. I cannot accept that. Even if that happened tomorrow at City, I would fight with somebody.’’</p>
              <p>Arsenal’s manager, Arsene Wenger, told Adebayor to calm down. "The Boss jumped on me. 'Why me?’ I said. 'Nicklas is 20, he has to do the things that [William] Gallas, Robin Van Persie and Cesc Fabregas are doing.’</p>
              <p>"Nicklas had a very easy route [into football]. He had the chance to be in the Arsenal Academy, the chance to be an international for Denmark. Football doesn’t stop there. You are young, you have to learn. No matter what quality you have, you have to listen to people, let people help you to be good.</p>
              <p>"I was not born with a golden spoon in my mouth. I left Africa at 15, came to Europe [with Metz] and it was very difficult but I knew if I listened I would be better. That’s what pushed me to where I am today.</p>
              <p>"People in my country love me. I represent my country very well. My family are very proud of me. But I can do more. That’s why I am always fighting to improve and be one of the best strikers in the world. I am fighting in games to see how many goals I can score, how many passes I can make, how many tackles, how many times I am coming back to help my team-mates.</p>
              <p>"If [Cristiano] Ronaldo had gone to Manchester United and thought 'I’m good’ he would not have become the best player in the world. He worked with the United players, who helped make him big. Nicklas just thinks he can make himself big.’’</p>
              <p>On Jan 22, 2008, the pair’s feud turned physical during a League Cup tie against Spurs, Bendtner ending with a cut forehead.</p>
              <p>"Nicklas showed me the finger,’’ explained Adebayor. "I am very sorry. You cannot show a partner the finger.’’ Inevitably, question marks were raised about Adebayor’s future. He could have left that summer. "I had a chance to go to Barcelona and Milan and the money [salary] was two times bigger than Arsenal. I decided to stay.’’</p>
              <p>But the fans turned against him, their ire building after a series of uncommitted displays. "Arsenal forced me out. Arsene told me: 'You have to leave because financially we are very bad.’ That makes it more painful. Arsene knows I didn’t leave for money. Enjoying my football is more important to me than money.</p>
              <p>"When I realised Arsenal don’t want me anymore, I told the people City sent to watch me that I want a good conversation with Mark Hughes. He has a great mentality. He told me his ambition, how he wants to build up his team. I thought: 'OK, why not be part of this club? I’ll take a risk.’ It’s worked out. The club is happy having me here. I am happy being here. We are one.</p>
              <p>"What is good at City is that the fans are truly fans. They love you. Arsenal have a lot of fans who are not fans. Arsenal have fans from America and Jamaica. Today they are Arsenal fans, tomorrow they will be Liverpool fans and after tomorrow they will be Manchester United fans.</p>
              <p>'If you boo your player every weekend, I am very sorry, you are not true fans. I can understand the frustration if you think the player wants to leave but I said on TV, newspaper and radio I wanted to stay.’’</p>
              <p>Nothing could staunch the derision. "That hurt me a lot. That was the most difficult moment in my career. I did everything for that club. When I first signed at Arsenal they didn’t put even one pound on my salary at Monaco. I told them: 'I will show you how good I am and afterwards we can discuss a contract.’</p>
              <p>"So to have a fight at the end is not right. That gives me motivation every single day. I now have a chance to face the Arsenal fans. I have to fight for City to take victory. My determination is very high. I have the mentality of a winner. Here I have the confidence I lost last season.’’</p>
              <p>He has dovetailed well with a range of strikers. "With Craig [Bellamy], I know 100 per cent he will go behind the defence. One v one, Robinho will dribble. I know most of the time Carlos [Tevez] will come for the ball. But we don’t care how we win - technically, tactically or physically. What we are fighting for is the three points. I will be very pleased to win the title but it takes a lot of time.</p>
              <p>"There is a toughness here. They are my friends and my brothers. Kolo [Toure] says: 'We have to fight. Saturday’s game will not be easy.’ Shay Given does the same. We have a lot of personality in the dressing room – Carlos, myself.’’</p>
              <p>Before returning to training, Adebayor wants to stress his overall "respect’’ for Arsenal, particularly people like Wenger - "he knows I always love him as a manager’’ - and certain players.</p>
              <p>"Alex Song and Emmanuel Eboue are not friends - they are brothers. We did everything together. But I am a City player and they are not friends of this club. I want to be in the Champions League next season. So do they.</p>
              <p>"So between 3pm and 5, we are not brothers. If I have to score two goals, I will. If I have to make a pass that wins us the game, I will. After the game we will be brothers.’’</p>
              <p>Bendtner? Unlikely. The sneakers controversy lives on.</p>
