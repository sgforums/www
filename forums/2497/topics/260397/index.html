            <div class='col-md body'><strong>England made a faltering start to their European Under 21 Championship campaign as they were held to a goalless draw by Czech Republic.</strong><br><br><img src="http://home.skysports.com/images/playerpics06_07/Live/england-czech.jpg"><br>On a warm evening in Arnhem, England enjoyed plenty of possession but were frustrated by a hard-working Czech side.<br><br>England appeared to have finally broken through when they were awarded a penalty three minutes from time, but Leroy Lita sent his spot-kick wide.<br><br>England were given no time to settle in the early stages and Ashley Young lost his cool as his mistimed challenge on Daniel Kolar forced the Czech striker off the field.<br><br>With Anton Ferdinand injured and Steven Taylor suspended, England's new-look centre-back pairing of Gary Cahill and Nedum Onuoha was soon creaking as Fratisek Rajtoral played in Jan Kysela, and it was left to Scott Carson to rush out and save with his legs.<br><br>Czech Republic goalkeeper Zdenek Zlamal was not called into action until the 31st minute and even then it was a routine stop from David Nugent's long-range effort.<br><br>Nigel Reo-Coker dashed into the box and fired over, but it was not until the second half that chances began to come more freely.<br><br>Nugent flicked James Milner's cross towards Kieran Richardson immediately after the restart but the Manchester United player, completely unmarked, failed to make contact from point-blank range.<br><br>At the other end Martin Fillo slammed a shot over following a strong run from Lubos Husek, before Carson tipped Daniel Pudil's curling free-kick onto the post.<br><br>Stuart Pearce brought on Wayne Routledge for Richardson, and then changed the shape of the team by substituting Milner for Lita and playing with two strikers.<br><br>It was Nugent who grabbed the game by the scuff of the neck, first dragging a shot inches wide and then surging into the box with intent on a number of occasions.<br><br>One such run resulted in a penalty as Roman Hubnik handballed, but Lita found that it was much harder to score from 12 yards in a pressure situation than it had been in last week's specially arranged shoot-out against Slovakia.<br><br>The Reading forward sent Zlamal the wrong way but also put his shot past the post to leave England's hopes of qualification for the semi-finals in the balance.<br><br>England now face pre-tournament favourites Italy in their second match on Thursday.</div>

We're still alive and kicking but we're bitterly disappointed.<br><br>"But that's the nature of top-level football, you can't take anything for granted.<br><br>"We need to work that bit harder on certain things physically and technically."<br><br>Asked whether Lita's miss had cost England victory, Pearce said: "Lita is brimming with confidence and rightly so.<br><br>"He stood up, he wanted to take the penalty and we collectively missed.<br><br>"We had opportunities before that to seal the game.<br><br>"We expected exactly what we got from them, we didn't play well enough to win the game, those are the facts."<br><br>Captain Nigel Reo-Coker paid tribute to an organised Czech Republic side before looking ahead to Thursday's clash with Italy.<br><br>"As soon as the Czechs lost possession they got into their shape and we found it difficult to break them down," he explained.<br><br>"It's a well-earned point against very good opposition."<br><br>"It's a clean sheet and we can motivate ourselves to beat Italy."<br><br>Reo-Coker added: "I think Leroy will be fine, he's a great player and it happens.<br><br>"Everyone in the team believed he would score and had no objections to him taking it."</div>
