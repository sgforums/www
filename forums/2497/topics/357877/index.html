              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Manchester United´s Italian forward Federico Macheda</span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>ROME (AFP) - Teenage striker Federico Macheda's staggering impact at Manchester United has sparked a raging debate in Italy on how to stem the exodus of the country's brightest talents.</strong></p>
              <p>Macheda's startling goal-scoring start to life as a United senior player has fans here wondering what's so wrong with their own football that their best young players move away.</p>
              <p>Once the predator, Italy is now feeling what it's like to be the prey and the economic muscle of the English Premier League is largely responsible for that.</p>
              <p>It was for financial reasons that Macheda left Lazio to sign for United while just 16, but now Italy want UEFA to intervene to stop other young players being prised away.</p>
              <p>According to Ciro Ferrara, a former rugged defender with Juventus but now head of the club's junior section, it's not Italy's fault that top players are being poached.</p>
              <p>"You can't talk about a failure of Italian football, international rules have changed," he said.</p>
              <p>"(UEFA president Michel) Platini has to intervene, UEFA have to stop the exodus of our young footballers to foreign shores.</p>
              <p>"Players are often taken away by paying off their families but the rules shouldn't allow it."</p>
              <p>Macheda is not the only young player to have been tempted by United as they also pinched midfielder Davide Petrucci off Lazio's city rivals AS Roma.</p>
              <p>But according to another player seduced by United, it is Italian clubs who are at fault for not giving young players enough of a chance.</p>
              <p>Giuseppe Rossi left Parma for United at 17 before being sold to Spaniards Villarreal. But for spending half a season on loan back at Parma in 2006/07, the 22-year-old has spent his entire senior career playing outside the country he represents at international level.</p>
              <p>"Why don't I play in Italy? It's not my fault. Clubs make their decisions and I make my own," he said.</p>
              <p>"The important thing is to show off your skills in front of a big crowd. And when you play you have a chance to be seen.</p>
              <p>"Italian football is changing, giving more chances to young players. That's the right decision because the talent is there.</p>
              <p>"In England and Spain everything is different, they have more patience. Barcelona have three or four 20 year olds in their first team."</p>
              <p>An example of the apparent unwillingness to give youth a chance can be found at AC Milan, who last season saw the emergence of two teenage forwards - Brazilian Pato and Italian Alberto Paloschi.</p>
              <p>But while Pato has gone on to become an established first team regular, Paloschi was allowed to leave for Serie B Parma during the close season.</p>
              <p>With marquee signings Ronaldinho and Andrei Shevchenko failing to make an impact, and Marco Borriello injured, Milan have instead turned to veteran 35-year-old forward Filippo Inzaghi to lead the line.</p>
              <p>In fairness, Inzaghi has been enjoying an Indian summer to his career with 10 goals in his last seven matches, but Milan have been criticised for not taking a chance on youth and kept hold of Paloschi rather than Inzaghi.</p>
              <p>It may not be a bad thing for his career, though, as he has seen plenty of first team action in Serie B, scoring nine goals in 32 appearances.</p>
              <p>He may well be plying his trade regularly in Serie A next season and getting more playing time than he would have done with Milan.</p>
              <p>But even so, Ferrara thinks teams in Italy need to take more risks on young players.</p>
              <p>"It's a mistake not to spend much money on the youth system and give players a chance to emerge, even to go on the pitch and make mistakes," he said.</p>
              <p class="last">"It takes time for them to develop. But teams have an obligation to win and they choose a less risky path, but even that doesn't guarantee victories."</p>

              <p>Paloschi cannot even touch the hair of Inzaghi.  Inzaghi was  playing in Serie B before scoring plenty of goals and moved to Serie A team. So what's wrong? If u are good, no matter where u play people will still notice u if u start to bag many goals.</p>
              <p>Btw, Inzaghi despite going 36yrs old soon still turn faster than a 18yrs old player, run faster and react faster than any young player. This skinny player can even sometimes hold off a big defender. Most importantly, he got a killer goal instinct. Kowtow to him!</p>
