            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Christoph Metzelder has said that he feels honoured to have joined Real Madrid during his presentation at the Santiago BernabÃ©u on Wednesday.</strong><br><br>The German international defender agreed to the move earlier this year as his contract expired at Borussia Dortmund at the end of last season.<br><br>Madrid completed the deal before the arrival of Bernd Schuster, but Metzelder is just excited to have the chance to play for the club.<br><br>"I would like to say I'm proud of being part of a club that does everything in its power to sign the best players they can," he said.<br><br>"They didn't have to pay that much for me because my contract with Borussia Dortmund had already ended. Nevertheless, I don't think these matters have much to do with my job.<br><br>"I have to find my own spot on the team. I arrived on Sunday and I am already getting ready to play.<br><br>"I've obviously been signed for some special characteristics that I have, such as playing well in aerial plays. I hope to help the team in this aspect of the game.<br><br>"Nevertheless, there are many good players on defence and I am sure that, with time, we will build a good defensive back line.<br><br>"I've signed a three year contract. I think every player and every coach knows that this Club is very demanding. The great challenge of playing for this Club will motivate me to do my best every day, so I'm not too worried."<br><br>With Schuster's announcement that Madrid will play a more attacking style of football next term, Metzelder knows that the pressure on him to perform will be strong.<br><br>"I don't generally talk about teams I still don't know well, but I do know Real Madrid have traditionally been an offensive side and this style of playing sometimes makes trouble in defence," he continued.<br><br>"Real Madrid's idea is to showcase great football, and that adds extra responsibility to the job of the team's defenders. This is a great challenge for me. I am 26 years old and proud of being on this team.<br><br>"Those who know my CV will know that I have always taken on a challenge. At 19, I went from playing in the Third Division to playing in the First Division and I joined the German squad soon after that.<br><br>"I was the youngest player in the 2002 World Cup. I have always been ambitious and willing to take on a challenge. Mr. Klinsman has probably helped me take this step. I am also working with an American personal trainer to improve on my work. I have always been this motivated."<br><br>Metzelder has played in the BernabÃ©u before when he was part of a Borussia Dortmund side that were beaten by Real Madrid in the Champions League.<br><br>"We lost 2-1, so I don't have fond memories of that game," he joked.<br><br>"The crowd was amazing, though, and I remembered it a few moments ago when I stepped onto the pitch during my presentation and saw the fans. I very much want to play at the BernabÃ©u again, this time as a Real Madrid player."<br><br>Despite having a compatriot as head coach, Metzelder does not believe that he will receive any preferential treatment as Madrid wanted him before Schuster took over.<br><br>"Schuster hasn't been the talk of the town in Germany for a few years, but his work is well known amongst people in the football world," Metzelder stated.<br><br>"I have been following the Spanish League and I know he has been quite successful on smaller clubs. Real Madrid fans know him very well and I'm sure he will do his best to please them. I think the Club has done well to sign him.<br><br>"The Club contacted me when Bernd Schuster wasn't the coach yet, so I don't think his being the coach has been key for my signing. I'm sure it will help me to have him as coach, but I don't precisely think it would be a great advantage.<br><br>"My job is to find my own place on the team and to do what's expected of me. It is an honour for me to be here at Real Madrid."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Calderon: "Metzelder is a strong and intelligent defender"<br><br>Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon congratulated himself on another step towards rebuilding Real Madrid by waxing lyrical about the abilities of new signing Christoph Metzelder.  </strong><br><br>While, of course, Christoph Metzelder's positive words upon his arrival at the Bernabeu dominated the headlines, Madrid supremo Ramon Calderon weighed in with his thoughts on the new signing.<br><br>The tone was predictably triumphant. He started by saying that the new signings were integral to Real Madrid's progression, then continued: "Real Madrid has never been satisfied with merely winning titles, but looks for excellence in everything, including playing style.<br><br>"Metzelder is going to help much in this way. He is known as one of the most intelligent centre-backs, and solid even at international level. He is going to be one of the cornerstones of the team we are building," boomed Calderon.<br><br>The controversial president recently appointed Bernd Schuster as head coach, and has fanned the flames of transfer speculation as Madrid are linked with the likes of Arsenal's Cesc Fabregas.<br><br>Metzelder is the second summer signing for Los Merengues, joining ex-Porto defender Pepe. Thus, the Real Madrid central pairing, usually occupied by two of Cannavaro, Sergio Ramos and Helguera, may see drastic change for the new campaign.</div>
