              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">JOHN TERRY has let rip at Liverpool, accusing them of deliberately getting him booked. The Chelsea skipper will miss next week's Champions League quarter-final second leg after he was shown a yellow card in last night's 3-1 win at Anfield. </h2>
              <p>Terry was left fuming when Reds players protested to the referee about his second-half challenge on Kop keeper Pepe Reina. Terry was booked in the 61st minute for barging goalkeeper Jose Reina and was upset at the reaction of home players to his challenge.</p>
              <p>The Chelsea skipper said: ‘It’s not nice to see them crowding around the referee trying to get him to show a yellow card. Reina said to me afterwards it was not a booking and they knew I was one away from a suspension.</p>
              <p>'Xabi Alonso cried after he was suspended because of a booking when he clashed with Eidur Gudjohnsen when we met a couple of years ago, but he was involved this time. It is very disappointing.' "He was crying after that game.</p>
              <p>I'm obviously very disappointed." Chelsea boss Guus Hiddink should have Ricardo Carvalho back to replace Terry.</p>
              <p>The Dutchman praised Blues midfielder Michael Essien for his performance last night. He said: "Essien was the key for us in midfield. "He did not only follow Gerrard everywhere, but was able to be the starting point to many of our attacks. "We also felt we could have some success attacking at corners with the way they use their zonal marking. We managed some real benefits from that. </p>
              <p class="article">"Once we had got the equaliser we did not sit back and be content with the draw. We felt we could score more and that is what we did. "We pinpointed areas in our opponents' side where we could hurt them. "The team could smell that and they took advantage. </p>
              <p class="article">"We talked about that situation again at the break and made sure we continued in the same way. "I admit it was an unexpected result, but we are very happy with the win and it was well deserved. </p>

              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Danish referee Claus Bo Larsen insists he was right to show Chelsea's John Terry a yellow card on Wednesday night. </strong></p>
              <p>The booking, picked up during the Blues' 3-1 victory
              over Liverpool in the UEFA Champions League, will rule the centre-half
              out of the second leg of the quarter-final tie.</p>
              <p>The England
              skipper has questioned the decision, believing he had every right to
              challenge for the ball in a tangle with Reds keeper Jose Reina.</p>
              <p>However, having lunged in slightly on the Spanish shot-stopper, Larsen believes he was left with no option but to caution Terry.</p>
              <p>"Of
              course he is a little bit bitter, since he will miss the return game,
              but he could have avoided running into the keeper on purpose," the
              match official told <em>Bold.dk</em>.</p>
              <p>"This was purely calculated and I have no doubts this was the right decision."</p>

              <p>glad that JT is suspended... since they are gonna to win and move onto the semi anyway... Carvalho and Alex would be enough to contain torres and Gerard for 90 minutes.

              <p><strong>The referee who officiated </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chelsea"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span></a><strong>'s </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championsleague"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Champions League</strong></span></a><strong> quarter-final first leg at </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong> last Wednesday has said that he was "shocked" to be told by a Stamford Bridge official that the club would not welcome bookings of their players who risked suspension for the return leg.</strong></p>
              <p>The Danish referee, Claus Bo Larsen, said that during a security meeting on the morning of the match "a representative from Chelsea said, 'Claus Bo, you should just remember that we have some players who have a yellow card already and we are not so excited if they get one again.'"</p>
              <p>Larsen booked the Chelsea captain, John Terry – who now misses the return leg on Tuesday– in the 61st minute at Anfield. Ashley Cole and Nicolas Anelka were also one booking away from suspension. Chelsea admitted raising the issue but said they had not mentioned it solely in relation to their own players and denied any wrongdoing. Liverpool's Alvaro Arbeloa and Andrea Dossena werealso one card away from missing a game.</p>
              <p>"I've never experienced anything like this," Larsen was quoted in the Daily Express. "We were quite shocked. I have been to more than 100 safety meetings and this is the first time I have experienced such a thing. Liverpool and Uefa and other people were there. I responded by saying that, if a player does something for a yellow card, then he gets a yellow card." The safety meeting is also believed to have been attended by the police and Liverpool and Uefa officials.</p>
              <p>There was a minor mêlée after Terry's caution, for a foul on the goalkeeper Pepe Reina, and the captain later accused the Liverpool players of deliberately trying to get him booked. "It's very disappointing when fellow professionals ask for the yellow card," he said.</p>
              <p>However, Larsen said: "When a player tried to jump after a goalkeeper who has the ball, to prevent the enemy from turning, then he must also pay at a bank. So he received the card anyway."</p>
              <p>In a statement Chelsea said: "Uefa organisational meetings are opportunities for all parties to raise valid issues in relation to that day's game. Therefore, it was an appropriate meeting in which to raise the issue of both teams fielding players on yellow cards. Chelsea did not raise the issue solely in relation to Chelsea players."</p>
              <p>The Chelsea manager, Guus Hiddink, has warned Manchester United that they could still "stumble" as they pursue a third successive Premier League title. Hiddink's ability to plot a way to victory was displayed in memorable fashion during the defeat of Liverpool. That victory, which turned on the Dutchman's successful deployment of Michael Essien as Steven Gerrard's shadow, has given Chelsea vital momentum as they embark upon their season's run home which starts today when Bolton visit Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>"When you are on top, as Man United are, and you have a game in hand, it is a luxury. But you must be aware that you can stumble," Hiddink said, before recalling his experience leading PSV Eindhoven to six Eredivisie titles in two tenures at the Dutch club.</p>
