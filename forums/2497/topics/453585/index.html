              <p><span><strong>Alan Hansen has been mocked by fans after picking three teams from the same group among his tips for the Euro 2012 semi-finals.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The Match of the Day regular joined other BBC pundits in revealing their tips for the tournament in Poland and Ukraine.</span></p>
              <p><span>The pundits and presenters were all asked for their tips to reach the semi-finals and then eventual winners.</span></p>
              <p><span>But Hansen found himself on the end of a string of jibes after selecting Germany, Holland and Portugal as semi-finalists along with champions Spain.</span></p>
              <p><span>That is impossible as only the top two teams from each group can qualify for the knockout stages.</span></p>
              <p><span>The article on the BBC Sport website was later amended to show just three tips for the semi-finals along with a line saying 'not all predictions may work out precisely because of the nature of the draw', while the others - such as Alan Shearer - all had four picks.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Alan Hansen has officially forgotten more about football than most of us have ever known - apparently including the basics about how the upcoming European Championship is organised.</strong></p>
              <p>The BBC's relaxed pundit - who reportedly trousers a lumpy £40,000 an episode for his rarely less than utterly pedestrian analysis on Match of the Day - failed to do his homework when asked to provide his predictions for the first four home in the Euros.</p>
              <p>Hansen wrote: "It is the usual suspects in the final for me. Spain won it last time and they won the World Cup in 2010. They have got the best players so they are the favourites and rightly so, but that doesn't necessarily mean they will win it, and it will be close.</p>
              <p>"As well as the Germans and the Dutch, I think Portugal are in the mix too. Cristiano Ronaldo has been unfortunate before now to play in Portuguese sides at major finals that have been really negative, so he has not shown in tournaments how good he is.</p>
              <p>1) Spain 2) Germany 3) Netherlands 4) Portugal"</p>
              <p>All typically controversial stuff, marred only by the fact that Germany, Netherlands and Portugal are ALL IN GROUP B - and can therefore not all reach the knockout stage.</p>
              <p>You can't get away with that sort of fundamental sloppiness at this level.</p>
              <p>The BBC swiftly moved to erase Portugal from Hansen's list this morning, leaving him as the only pundit now naming just a top three, presumably because he is out of contact, and couldn't offer a substitute nation.</p>
              <p>MirrorFootball's prediction of the top four most likely places where the affluent Scot could be incommunicado:</p>
              <p>1) The golf course</p>
              <p>2) On his way to the golf course</p>
              <p>3) On his way home from the golf course</p>
              <p>4) The golf course (different one)</p>

              <p>Guess he was still upset with Fergie for dropping him from the Scotland squad at the 86 WC and left his better judgement at home when he made that punch-line statement.</p>
              <p>3 card Poll has almost left the game so no need to get taunt about it anymore. Hansen has his own. Over the years, he has always been remembered for that i guess... Now there is a new one... lol.</p>
