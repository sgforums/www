              <p><span><strong>Rafa Benitez was booed as he took his place in the Chelsea dugout for the first time.<br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Benitez has stepped in as interim manager after ruthless Russian owner Roman Abramovich sacked Roberto Di Matteo following the midweek defeat to Juventus.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Fans do not want the former Liverpool boss at Stamford Bridge and made no secret of their feelings before kick-off as the Blues faced Manchester City.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Home supporters in the Matthew Harding Stand sang 'we don't want you here' and paid tribute to their Champions League-winning former boss by chanting 'there's only one Di Matteo.'</span></p>
              <p><span>And in the 16th-minute, huge sections of the support united in applause to celebrate Di Matteo, who wore the No 16 in his playing days.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Benitez got the better of the Blues during his time in charge of the Merseysiders, knocking them out of the Champions League twice.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>And at his official unveiling at Stamford Bridge, Benitez was grilled on the explosive comments he made against the London club during his time as Liverpool boss. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>He said: 'I want to be honest. If I said this or that, I have to analyse the context. We were playing against Chelsea in the semi-finals of the Champions League. If I am a fan I want to see the manager fighting for my club. I don't see this as a lack of respect for Chelsea's fans, just a manager defending his team.'</span></p>

              <p><strong>PM Lee :"lf the govt follows what people want, then we are failed leaders"</strong></p>
              <p>I dun think Rafa really care about the fans at the moment.</p>
              <p>The boss pay him his salary and not the fans.</p>
              <p>He is more interested in adding more cup medals in his resume.</p>
              <p>From the club form of view, they changed managers and won cup medals.</p>
              <p>Liverpool changed managers and become worse.</p>
              <p>So, as long as he do his job well, he may even end up winning the BPL with Chelsea.</p>
              <p>If you are him, the worse case is he win nothing and retire at the end of the season.</p>
              <p>He is a smart guy as he did not take over when AVB was sacked.</p>

              <p>Rafa must win this match to even get some goodwill to at least last him for the next few weeks... The booed he got was quite strange as i can't remember the last time a club show off their new manager got so much boo by their own fans.</p>
              <p>I bet with the unhappiness of the fans, Rafa would be wise to stay at home and not wander around Chelsea side of London... <img src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>If the fans are not happy with the arrangement, they can sit out of the home match for the rest of the season.</p>
              <p>Roman is the pay master and he can appoint any one as his manager.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben already expected this treatment and he is more eager to do his job after the long absence.</p>
              <p>If he win some medals, he will be chased by other european club at the end of the season.</p>
              <p>Unless the whole chelsea team also against him, he will win some medals for sure.</p>
              <p>I dun think the chelsea team are stupid not to win medals and bonus just to go against Ah Ben and Roman.</p>

              Rafa axe fear
               
              West Ham 3 Chelsea 1
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              RAFA BENITEZ last night admitted he could soon be AXED as Chelsea boss. 
              
              Interim chief Benitez revealed he was â€œnot 100 per centâ€� certain of his future after the defeat at West Ham. 
              
              Benitez admitted: â€œI would say that it depends on the things that we can do on the pitch. So, if we improve on the pitch, it will be easier for everyone.â€�
               
              Pressed on the fact he did not sound 100 per cent sure of his position, he replied: â€œNo, I am not 100 per cent. We didnâ€™t win today â€” that is the main thing.â€�
               
              Benitez knows owner Roman Abramovich may pull the trigger after a shaky start to his Stamford Bridge career, which has seen two draws, one defeat and just one goal scored. 
              
              He was again booed by the Chelsea fans and taunted with chants: â€œYouâ€™re getting sacked in the morning.â€�
               
              West Ham boss Sam Allardyce warned Benitez he will NEVER succeed at the club unless he wins over the fans. 
              
              Allardyce said: â€œYou canâ€™t manage a club if the fans are not behind you. It just wonâ€™t happen. And the only way you can get them on your side is by winning games.â€�
               
              â€œIf youâ€™re winning, the fans will always back you.â€�
               
              And Big Sam believes the nature of the job makes it impossible to feel sorry for Benitez. 
              
              He added: â€œWe donâ€™t have sympathy for each other. 
              
              â€œWe compete against each other, we toil against each other and we play mind games against each other. 
              
              â€œI said to my players in our pre-match team-talk that a lot of people have been saying Chelsea would be relieved to be playing away from home after the problems theyâ€™d had in their last two home games. 
              
              â€œI told my players to make sure that wasnâ€™t the case and we came out on top.â€�

              <p>West Ham played well last night.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben just took over for 3 matches and I dun think Roman expect him to perform miracle.</p>
              <p>If he fire him now, Chelsea will be in worse shape.</p>
              <p>This will make Pep wary of Roman's Hire and Fire practise.</p>
              <p>It is not forgetting that Pep may not be guaranteed to win the BPL titile even though he won everything with Barca in Spain.</p>
              <p>What I guess Roman to do is to give Ah Ben and his pet Torres one month to shape up or ship out.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben already know this will happen when AVB was sacked and therefore he did not took the job at that time.</p>
              <p>But, he did not expect himself to be worst than AVB as he have a better squad now,</p>
