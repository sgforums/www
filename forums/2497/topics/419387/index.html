              <p>Anelka and Drogba was utterly lazy again. Not running, not going to fight for aerial balls and the passing is simply atrocious.</p>

And just like Arsenal have Bolton and more recently Wigan or United have West Ham, Chelsea have Villa... Somehow the Villa players raise their game when it comes to Chelsea...

              <p><strong>Carlo Ancelotti insisted Chelsea are not out of the Barclays Premier League title race despite watching them throw away a crucial two points in a breathless 3-3 draw against Aston Villa. </strong></p>
              <p>But the Blues boss admitted the result, which left his side outside the top four, meant they must beat Manchester United in March to stand any hope of retaining the championship.</p>
              <p>Failure to see off Villa left Chelsea marooned in fifth place, six points behind United having played a game more.</p>
              <p>While a slip-up from their unbeaten arch-rivals in not impossible, it is highly unlikely Manchester City, Arsenal and Tottenham will all press the self-destruct button.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti said after Wednesday's ugly win over Bolton that Chelsea's title defence would have been over had they failed to end their worst run of league results for 11 years - but he was defiant after the draw with Villa..</p>
              <p>"It's not over because we are improving and I think that we can say something again this season," he said, pointing out United had to win their game in hand to go nine points clear.</p>
              <p>"First, they have to win. Second, I think that the gap is not a light gap at this moment. But everything is open again.</p>
              <p>"Obviously, we have to beat them here, and we can say something again about the title."</p>
              <p>The result put Ancelotti's position under fresh scrutiny after Wednesday night's ugly 1-0 win over Bolton had eased the pressure on the Italian.</p>
              <p>At least Chelsea avoided defeat, a prospect that looked highly likely six minutes from time against a Villa side that had largely outplayed them.</p>
              <p>Trailing 2-1 after Ashley Young's penalty and Emile Heskey's header had cancelled out Frank Lampard's spot-kick, the home side thought they had won it when Didier Drogba and John Terry found the net.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Terry's goal sparked wild celebrations as Chelsea's players mobbed Ancelotti, but the joy was short-lived as Ciaran Clark levelled in stoppage-time. </strong></p>
              <p>Ancelotti said: "I think that we had a fantastic reaction second half, we played very well, with a lot of energy, with a good spirit.</p>
              <p>"And when we thought that the game was won, we lost two points at the last situation.</p>
              <p>"For this reason, I'm disappointed because at this moment, when we needed to win, it was our fault because I think we were not able to maintain concentration until the end."</p>
              <p>Ancelotti denied his players had paid for over-celebrating, saying: "I think that it was not over-celebration. It was a good reaction after the goal.</p>
              <p>"The last goal, yes, it was a mistake, because we conceded an easy cross and we didn't mark in the box."</p>
              <p>He also played down an argument between Terry and Drogba at the final whistle, saying: "Everything is okay."</p>

              <p>Honestly I rather Chelsea refocus on getting into Top 3 or 4 and stop the "title race". Anyone with the right minds know that Chelsea is already out from the title race.</p>
              <p>If there are no further signings, I believe Chelsea will end up like Liverpool.</p>

              <p>It now seems that match against United has become even more important... </p>
              <p>Personally, I still don't think it's totally finished for them cos when we take a good look at it, Spurs are only 1 point above them, City, could actually be only 3 point given their game in hand... And Arsenal, only 4 points...  Chelsea still possess something they all don't and that's the experienced of a title run-in...  The Chelsea squad has this which I think is very important cos year after year we see Arsenal doing very well at the start and when it comes to the title run in pressure moment from Feb to May, they just don't know how to play like their usual self and they fall off...</p>
              <p>So, I still won't write off Chelsea even though they are currently 6 point behind cos United still need to play away to Spurs, Arsenal, Liverpool and of course Chelsea too... They can lose 12 points from these it's not impossible given their away form this season, even bottom teams also they have difficulity winning... So if Chelsea was leading like 5, 6 point in Nov and looked like they were running away with the title till even a young player of theirs could consider they could  win the title by Christmas, everything can change in a short few weeks...</p>
              <p>So I wouldn't bet against them yet as last night, they did look like an improved side from their last 6 weeks...</p>

              <p>Well, City does possess a very strong squad from front to back to even the bench... And in my opinion, they together with Spurs have the strongest squad in the EPL...</p>
              <p>And City look like they will soon complete the signing of what Mancini describe as the decisive factor or <span style="color: #333332;">the missing piece of the jigsaw i</span>n Manchester City Winning The Premier League title. <span style="color: #000000;">Wolfsburg</span> <span style="color: #000000;">striker</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Edin Dzeko...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">And they are looking a more stable side now than at the start too...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">On Arsenal... Well, we just don't know what we are going to get from them... Will they crack or won't, it's still anybodies guess. But they are almost injury free so they will be much better than the last few years i think...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Spurs... Interesting... I enjoy watching them play, they are a handful for any side... They are the dark horse in this mix...</span></p>

              <p>the clark goal in stoppage time.....the chelsea players tried to play the offside trap when petrov crossed. What a mistake.</p>
              <p>Normally in the EPL, if a club is 5 or 6 points behind the leader after xmas, they won't make it. Yes no? Mathematically it's still possible but in reality, somehow it doesn't happen.</p>
