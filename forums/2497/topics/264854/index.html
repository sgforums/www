New Juventus boss Claudio Ranieri, who took Lampard to Stamford Bridge for a record Â£11m when he was Blues boss in 2001, is desperate to sign him.<br><br>Ranieri spent time chatting to Lamps when England played Brazil at the new Wembley last month.<br><br>Spanish giants Barcelona will also go on red alert now that Lampard has turned down the Blues.<br><br>Lampard insists he wants to stay at Chelsea for life but senior executives at the Bridge now fear their star midfielder is pricing himself out of that dream with his huge wage demands.<br><br>He returns for pre-season training this week after a holiday in Spain.<br><br>But there are growing doubts now whether Lampard will still be in the blue of Chelsea come the big kick-off next month.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Continental giants snub Lampard<br><br>Frank Lampard 'knows he has no chance of moving' to any of the big European clubs and so will almost definitely stay at Chelsea, according to an executive at Barcelona. 'There is no other option. He has been offered to us, Milan, Inter and Real Madrid. Basically all of the big clubs. But none are interested. We are the same as those clubs are, we're looking for a player who is more creative and has a greater technique than Lampard. So it looks like he will go nowhere.'<br><br>The England midfielder has been trying to negotiate a new contract for the past year, with the stumbling block believed to be his contract demands. He wants parity with Andriy Shevchenko and Michael Ballack, the top earners at Chelsea, who are thought to earn Â£130,000 a week. The 29-year-old has been offered Â£110,000, around Â£20,000 more than his current deal, which has two years remaining.<br>John Terry's attempts to agree a new, improved contract have also stalled although, according to a Stamford Bridge executive, 'he is not offering himself to the market like Frank. So we think this means he will stay'.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lampard and Terry will have to accept what has been offered to them since before the end of last season and get on with it. I think its no big secret that the offer is already on the table, the $110,000 per week deal has been there for a long time. Getting his agent to hold a learn Spanish book isn't going to help. Kenyon is too sly for such tricks. I doubt Kenyon is going to change his mind now... Asking pay parity with Michael Ballack and Andriy Shevchenko, who earn about Â£130,000 a week is just stupid. Chelsea is still a long way from breaking even per season and giving in to his demands will only make things worse as giving in to him then Terry will also want, and giving in to Terry, Robben will also want, Then giving in to Robben Joe Cole will be the next one... Then where does it ends, with Peter Cech?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
