              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Roberto Mancini will be handed £50million to spend in January to get Manchester City's title challenge back on track.</strong></p>
              <p>The City hierarchy have told Mancini they will spend whatever it takes to revive the club's title hopes following Monday's 2-1 home defeat to Everton.</p>
              <p>That result cost City the chance of going top of the table at Christmas for the first time in 81 years, and the club's mega-rich owners are determined to address the shortcomings in Mancini's squad.</p>
              <p>Top of the City manager's list is a new striker to ease the burden on captain and leading scorer Carlos Tevez, who has now pledged his future to the club after withdrawing a transfer request.</p>
              <p></p>
              <div class="news_mpu_article"></div>
              <p>City have scored just nine times at home in the league this season - only Birmingham and Wigan have managed fewer in the top-flight. That is why Mancini is looking at the possibility of signing two strikers next month.</p>
              <p>Wolfsburg's £30m-rated Edin Dzeko and Porto's Brazilian forward Hulk, who would cost around £20m, are his top January targets, but the City boss is also planning a swoop for Barcelona full-back Dani Alves.</p>
              <p>MirrorSport has learned that City representatives met with the Alves camp in a Barcelona hotel last week, with a view to bringing the Brazil World Cup star and Champions League winner to Eastlands.</p>
              <p>Although Barca are unlikely to let Alves go next month, midway through their assault on La Liga and the Champions League, it is understood the player is keen on a move to City.</p>
              <p>Alves is out of contract in 18 months' time and City could get him for as little as £12m next summer if he does not sign a new deal and Barca are forced to cash in on him for fear of losing him for nothing.</p>
              <p>Despite their unrivalled spending power, City will part-fund Mancini's New Year spree by offloading a number of disaffected players, including Emmanuel Adebayor, Roque Santa Cruz, Wayne Bridge and Shaun Wright-Phillips.</p>
              <p>The City hierarchy know they must get their spending under control to comply with UEFA's fair play regulations, which come into effect in 2012 and which set a limit on the financial losses which can be incurred by clubs wanting to play in Europe.</p>
              <p>Under the rulings, clubs playing in Europe cannot have losses in excess of £40m over a three-year period from 2012.</p>
              <p>City's last reported losses were £121m - a sum they will have to drastically reduce in order to comply.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>It is understood that while Dzeko appears set to join </strong><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>City</strong><strong> — with one club source on Tuesday claiming a “decisive move” is being made this week for the Wolfsburg striker — Luiz may move to </strong><strong>Chelsea</strong></span><strong> if Benfica lower their excessive demands. They have quoted a fee of €40 million (£34 million) for the 23-year-old Brazilian who is wanted by Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti and who can play in any position across defence and as a holding midfielder. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>However, the Portuguese club may now realise that their expectations are unrealistic, especially as it is well known that they are desperate for cash and have been touting left-back Fabio Coentrao to Europe’s leading clubs, including Bayern Munich, for €20 million (£17 million) — €10 million less than his release clause.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>Indeed City’s football administrator, Brian Marwood, is believed to have been in Spain at the weekend to watch Victor Ruiz play for Espanyol against Barcelona, but who is now regarded as a strong alternative to Luiz.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>The 21-year-old left-sided defender would cost around €15 million (£13 million) although City hope to secure him for less.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>Ruiz is in no rush to leave the Catalan club but it is thought they are keen to cash in on one of the rising stars of Spanish football.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>Intriguingly Chelsea and City are both planning to strengthen in the same areas of the team next month — central defence and centre forward.</p>
              <p>Chelsea have already been offered striker Hugo Almeida and have been considering whether to sign the Portuguese international who has failed to agree a new contract at Werder Bremen, with his deal expiring next summer.</p>
              <p>However, Ancelotti is understood to be unconvinced about Almeida, who has also interested Lazio, and the 26 year-old now appears set to join Turkish club Besiktas who are prepared to meet his wage demands of €2.5 million (£2 million) a year, net of tax.</p>
              <p>It is believed Ancelotti would like Chelsea to bid for Carlos Tévez but it will be virtually impossible to prise him away from City — for now — after his transfer-request withdrawal.</p>
              <p>Dzeko has been monitored by both City and Chelsea for some time and both have also balked at the price being quoted for him by Wolfsburg which, at one time, was close to €50 million (£42 million) but has since dropped to a more negotiable fee.</p>
              <p>There is no pressure for the German club to sell but the 24-year-old Bosnian, who had set his sights on a move to Serie A last year, is determined to secure a transfer to England with his representative having been a guest at the Manchester derby earlier this season.</p>
              <p>His arrival would facilitate the exit of Roque Santa Cruz — who City signed instead of Dzeko — and, probably, Emmanuel Adebayor, as manager Roberto Mancini steps up his plans to reshape his squad for the second half of the season.</p>
              <p>City also hope to move on Shaun Wright-Phillips and Shay Given while if either Luiz or Ruiz signs, the club will attempt to offload both Wayne Bridge and Joleon Lescott next month.</p>
              <p>Chelsea understand that they also have to be active in the transfer window. Ancelotti has received a personal assurance from club owner Roman Abramovich that funds will be made available next month to strengthen his squad and he is determined to test that promise.</p>
              <p>As expected, Chelsea announced on Tuesday that winger Gaël Kakuta has signed a new 4½-year contract.</p>

              <p><br>Are Real Madrid assemble with peanuts? Definitely not right... They have spent a lot more than Barce, man for man, they have just as good if not better players at their club than Barce... They also have one of the most experienced and expensive coach compare to a relatively novice one who is into his first managerial job only...</p>
              <p>Anyway, Mourinho preside at Chelsea over a time when there was really no challenger to it's kind... The spending powers of Chelsea those days were unheard of or unseen before not just in the Premier league but anywhere else in the world...</p>
              <p>So it wasn't exactly surprising that they could win it when a bad purchase could easily be loan out or removed and get a new one in with ease in short notice... Those like Tiago, Jarosik, Del Horno, Shevchenko, Boulahrouz, Swp, Veron, Duff, Crespo... All could be replace with new players at great loss where no other club could afford... They can even afford to throw Mutu away for free... lol.</p>
              <p>Any other club couldn't do such a thing. They probably have to preserve with the bad purchase until hopefully he comes good or finally sold after a few poor seasons... But not at Chelsea... Compare with the way Man City are at today, it's a lot more easier back then cos the mid table clubs were average at best and those at the bottom were really poor... But today, these clubs could also afford more foreigners and better players too... Even just promoted clubs are no easy meat either, just ask Arsenal... Thats the reason we are seeing more defeats for bigger clubs this last two seasons.</p>
              <p>Like I said, Mourinho came to Chelsea at a period when United and Arsenal were in the state of rebuilding... So even the 'greatest manager' around couldn't do a thing in such short notice. But he sure did something cos despite the millions Chelsea spent, they were able to catch them by the 3rd yr.</p>
              <p>Mourinho, despite his success, he has never rebuilt a team from scratch before... I can't even remember a youngster he brought in... Perhaps the closes there is i guess is John Obi Mikel and Salomon Kalou ?</p>

              <p>Mourinho is doing a fabulous job at RM too, defence is tight while midfield and attack gelled. But there's no way their team could play when against barca, whose players have been playing together for so many years. Their kind of play is telepathic one touch football and that kind of play is so vital to tearing up the opponents' defences. Some teams show brief flashes of brilliance in the whole 90 minutes but barca does it minute in minute out, even RM also no fight.</p>

              <p><br>Yup... Whatever they have write up or you have read up about him it's irrelevant... Cos what do you call someone in his first managerial job? A novice precisely right...</p>
              <p>And despite him doing well at Barce, they are still contemplating whether to give him a new contract that's why we are still seeing reports about him being considered for the Chelsea or even the United job as Fergie's understudy (meaning assistant manager only possible to take over one day)... His stock is so low that such a thing is even being mentioned... And let's not get into salary cos his first managerial job's pay can't be much compare to Jose who was considered the highest paid manager in Europe at Inter (reported at about $8m per season) Compare this to Wenger, Fergie, Rafa (Pool) at $5m, Lotti $6m or Harry and Mancini at $3m to $4m... Imagine how much Real had to offer to made him come over? I won't be too surprise if Guardiola's salary is only 1/4 of Jose at Barce... or maybe even lesser...</p>
              <p>What Mourinho did during his first season was he brought up the level that's all... Before he came, other clubs were willing and able to drop some points here and there but keep their club financially stable. Again like i said, Jose had something the rest never had before... He was given a very big squad stuff with highly paid players all around and not like others who had a handful of talented players but made up with other average ones in order to balance the books... Mourinho didn't even had that concern to consider unlike Wenger and Fergie whose club was still a plc back then.</p>
              <p>I don't think we need excuse for the way Real are doing or what Barce have... Cos if you are good enough, you can do it. And I don't for one second think Real cannot win the title this season. Its very much a 50 / 50 chance. And if we look carefully at their squad, Barce apart from their first 11, their reserved players aren't real quality kind unlike Real's where they can bring in a player of $35m in Benzema or $20m Diarra... In general, Real buy ready made talent, while Barce try to buy talent and their recent interest in Arsenal's Denilson seems like a long way for them wouldn't you think so?</p>
