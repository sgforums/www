              <p><strong>Roy Keane will decide today whether to continue as Sunderland manager after 72 hours of behind-the-scenes drama.</strong></p>
              <p>The Irishman has been on the brink of quitting during three days of personal trauma, but has promised a final decision in the next few hours.</p>
              <p>Chairman Niall Quinn returned from a break abroad yesterday to hold talks with Keane and his advisors, as they face their first big crisis together after six defeats in seven games.</p>
              <p>Keane was spared a trip to the Sunderland reserves last night against his old club Manchester United, which was postponed because of snow, allowing further discussions to take place. But after 27 months with the Black Cats, it was Keane who raised the prospect that he might not be the right man for the job five days ago.</p>
              <p>Keane, who is still backed by most of the fans, has spent the week reflecting on a 4-1 home defeat to Bolton. Last Friday he hinted he “may not be a football manager for very long”. And a day later he said he “might wake up one day and think the job is not for him”.</p>
              <p>Keane has the immediate backing of Quinn and major shareholder Ellis Short, as long as he can put together a plan to lift the mood and results at the Stadium of Light.</p>

              <h1>Sunderland boss Roy Keane 'isn't a serious manager', says biographer Eamon Dunphy</h1>
              <p></p>
              <p class="up"> </p>
              <p class="up"><img src="http://images.mirror.co.uk/upl/m4/nov2008/3/9/A5DE3875-ADAD-C05A-8315B092A1A02D08.jpg" border="0" alt="Cisse shakes hands with Roy Keane" width="450" height="310"></p>
              <p class="up"><em>Keane: Will he still be around for this weekend's match against his old club United?</em></p>
              <p class="up"> </p>
              <p><strong>Roy Keane has been told he has “lost the plot” and “isn’t a serious manager” as his future at Sunderland hangs in the balance.</strong></p>
              <p>The Ireland legend has been ridiculed by former pal Eamonn Dunphy – the man who helped write his life story. Keane has also been accused of wasting a “staggering” amount on players.</p>
              <p>Dunphy declared: “I have the highest regard for him, remarkable man, intelligent, family man – but he has lost the plot, big time. He is in a fog at the moment. Everyone gets there at some point in your life, when things get too much for you.</p>
              <p>“He’s making some really silly decisions.”</p>
              <p>Former pro footballer and Irish broadcaster Dunphy was Keane’s chief defender when he quit the 2002 Ireland World Cup squad in a row with Mick McCarthy.</p>
              <p>Keane threw his future into doubt at the weekend by admitting he might wake up one day and decide to quit the Black Cats job.</p>
              <p>Dunphy added: “It has been apparent to me for the last 18 months that he isn’t going to be a serious manager. If you look at the players he has brought in and out, remarkable, staggering – and he has wasted a lot of money.</p>
              <p>“Maybe he needs to start, like Clough or Shankly, down in the lower leagues and learn the business of management and all its aspects. If you go in too quick you are <br>struggling.</p>
              <p>“I don’t think Roy had the chance to learn the business of management. “I just don’t think Roy has the qualities. He wants to win and he is in serious danger of getting relegated.”</p>

              <p><br>I thought Cisse is still ok afterall he is still a loan player but Richardson for $6m pounds... That one really odd... I think he has spent more money than Martin O'Neill at Villa... and maybe even Everton's David Moyes...</p>
              <p>I think maybe if he wants to quit, better now than after the weekend as he may not want to go to United and get beaten by Fergie and his old boys like Fletcher and Rio he criticized... </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Of the 5 he mentioned, 3 are still there... 1 he bought and the other don't know go where already... Rio Ferdinand, John O'Shea, Alan Smith, Kieran Richardson and Darren Fletcher. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Sam Allardyce has been installed favourite to be the next permanent manager of Sunderland.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <a id="more"></a>
              <div class="entry-more">
              <p>Allardyce, a former Sunderland player who has gone on to manage  Bolton Wanderers and Newcastle United, is quoted at 4-1 by Paddy Power, with Gordon Strachan (5-1) and Alan Curbishley (6-1) also prominent in the market.  Niall Quinn, the club chairman, is chalked up at 100-1.</p>
              <p>Keane parted company with Sunderland this morning and his departure has prompted Paddy Power to cut the odds on the Black Cats being relegated to 2-1. They have lost five of their past six league matches and were woeful when losing 4-1 at home to Bolton last Saturday.</p>
              <p>Paddy Power do not believe that Keane will be out of the spotlight for long, though, and have begun betting on what his next post will be. They make the former Manchester United midfielder  just 5-2 to take over as manager as Celtic, followed by Nottingham Forest at 5-1. They are followed by the Irish national job at 6-1, with Manchester United 9-1 and Cobh Ramblers among the outsiders at 66-1.</p>
              <p>Darren Haines, spokesman for Paddy Power, said: “Just as managerial betting markets were getting a bit quiet, you can rely on Roy Keane to shake things up. His next job and likely destination should prove very popular markets such is the interest that always follows him.</p>
              <p>“Sam Allardyce seems to be an unpopular name amongst any clubs’ fans when he is linked to their management post but as a former Sunderland player he is the early favourite for Black Cat fans to consider.”</p>

              <p><strong>Quinn praises outgoing Keane</strong></p>

              <p class="small bold"><em>TRIBUTE ... Niall Quinn</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">SUNDERLAND chairman Niall Quinn has paid tribute to departing boss Roy Keane.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Black Cats manager's reign at the Stadium of Light ended today after a recent poor run of form.</p>
              <p class="article">Quinne said: “First of all on behalf of everyone here I would like to pay thanks to Roy Keane for all his hard work in progressing this club, lifting its status and growing its worldwide profile.</p>
              <p class="article">“Roy deserves huge respect for his contribution and the manner in which he guided the club from the depths of the Championship back to the Premier League.</p>
              <p class="article">"His winning mentality and single-mindedness were just what this club needed when Drumaville took over shortly before his arrival.</p>
              <p class="article">“Roy’s decision to stand aside and allow someone else to take charge of the next chapter sums up his desire to always do what is best for the club.</p>
              <p class="article">"Even in his departure he has been more concerned for the welfare of the players and his staff than himself.</p>
              <p class="article">“The board has reluctantly accepted his decision and wish him and his family well for the future.”</p>
