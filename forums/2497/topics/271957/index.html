            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Liverpool and Arsenal will be hoping to avoid Spartak Moscow in the qualifying stage of the Champions League</span><br><br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/CLlogo.jpg"><br><br>Arsenal or Liverpool have featured in each of the past three Champions League finals, but must take the long way round if they are to preserve English footballÂ’s recent good record in the competition by reaching next yearÂ’s final in Moscow. The past two seasonÂ’s beaten finalists take their place in todayÂ’s third qualifying round draw in Nyon, Switzerland, alongside such luminaries as FC Pyunik of Armenia and Tampere United of Finland, either of whom they would be happy to face in the two-legged ties scheduled to take place on August 14-15 and August 28-29. </strong><br><br>Such European footballing heavyweights as Valencia, Lazio and Seville, the Uefa Cup holders, are also in a draw that contains five former winners of the trophy, but both English clubs are protected by being among the 16 seeds, which also prevents them being drawn against each other. Celtic are also seeded and Rangers will be, too, should they complete an expected second qualifying round victory over FK Zeta, of Montenegro, whom they beat 2-0 at Ibrox in the first leg. The draw, which will take place at 11am, is complicated by the fact that five of the seeds and nine of the nonseeds will come from second qualifying round ties that will be completed next week.<br><br>Although Arsenal and Liverpool will have genuine designs on reaching the Russian capital, neither will want to do so this month, with Spartak Moscow perhaps the most dangerous potential opponents in the draw. Liverpool have suffered from starting slowly in recent seasons, but they would have to be up to speed against the Russians, who are top of their domestic league after 18 matches. Arsenal were beaten in Moscow by CSKA in last seasonÂ’s group phase. ArsÃ¨ne Wenger has not won in Russia in 11 years at the club, with Spartak beating them 4-1 at home in a Champions League group match in November 2000.<br><br>There is a strong chance of both clubs being forced to revisit familiar journeys, with Arsenal surely hoping for another tie against Sparta Prague. WengerÂ’s side have won all four of their meetings with the Czech Republic club and completed a Champions League double over them on their way to the final two seasons ago. Thierry Henry broke the clubÂ’s goalscoring record in the away game. A reunion with Salzburg, who beat Arsenal in a friendly during this seasonÂ’s Austrian training camp, would also hold few fears.<br><br>Liverpool could return to the scene of either of their Champions League final appearances in the past three years, given that the non-seeds feature AEK Athens and FenerbahÃ§e, of Istanbul, while Dynamo Bucharest, Tou-louse and FC Zurich are also potential opponents.<br><br>Although beginning a Champions League campaign only a few days after the start of the Barclays Premier League season is an unwanted inconvenience, Liverpool know it could be even worse after being forced to enter at the first qualifying round stage two years ago when they met TNS, the Welsh club, on July 13, seven weeks after lifting the trophy in Istanbul.<br><br>Any club beaten in the third qualifying round have the consolation of entry into the first round of the Uefa Cup, with the draw for the second qualifying round taking place today. Blackburn Rovers take their place after qualifying via the Intertoto Cup and will hope to join Bolton Wanderers, Tottenham Hotspur and Everton in the first round next month.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool must overcome a tricky trip to Toulouse if they are to reach the Champions League group stage.<br><br>Click here<br>The Reds, who have won the competition five times and were beaten in last season's final, must face the Ligue 1 side over two legs for a place in the lucrative section of the competition.<br><br>Arsenal's first European tie since the departure of talismanic striker Thierry Henry will be a tough one too, against Czech side Sparta Prague.<br><br>Scottish champions Celtic face a tough test against Spartak Moscow in their bid to reach the group stage.<br><br>Last season's SPL runners-up Rangers will face either 1991 European Cup winners Red Star Belgrade or Estonian side Levadia Tallinn if they overcome FK Zeta in the second qualifying round. They lead 2-0 from the home leg.<br><br>The first legs will be played on August 14 and 15, with the return matches taking place on August 28 and 29.<br><br>Toulouse reached the Champions League qualifiers by finishing third in Ligue 1 behind champions Lyon and runners-up Marseille.<br><br>They are coached by former Bordeaux boss Elie Baup and one of their star players is Sweden striker Johan Elmander, who was a reported target of Manchester City boss Sven-Goran Eriksson and also Lyon. He scored 11 times for the club, including a last-day hat-trick against Bordeaux.<br><br>Arsenal's opponents Sparta are the champions of the Czech Republic. Their success last season was their 34th domestic title and they became the first club since the break-up of Czechoslovakia in the early 1990s to win the domestic double.<br><br>Their best performance in Europe came in 1992-93, when they reached the semi-final group stage under an old format of the Champions League.</div>
