              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>The worst fears of Fernando Torres and Liverpool were confirmed last night when the Spain forward was ruled out of action for at least a fortnight with a recurrence of his hamstring injury.</strong></p>
              <p>Torres has only recently returned to action after missing six matches with a hamstring tear, but, still searching for full fitness, he aggravated the injury during Liverpool's 1-0 victory over Marseilles in the Champions League at Anfield on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The problem did not become clear until after the game, as he complained of tightness in his hamstring, but the club confirmed last night that a scan had picked up a strain that will keep him out of action for two to three weeks.</p>
              <p>Fábio Aurélio, the full back, faces a two-week absence with a calf strain suffered against Marseilles, but it is the news about Torres that is far more troubling for Liverpool. Although they have registered impressive victories over Manchester United and Chelsea without him in the Barclays Premier League this season - with the forward having started only half his team's 14 league matches to date - Liverpool are a far better team with Torres than without him.</p>
              <p>The only consolation for Rafael Benítez is that the Spaniard would expect to miss no more than three league matches - at home to West Ham United on Monday, away to Blackburn Rovers on December 6 and away to Hull City seven days later - and that, with qualification for the Champions League knockout stages secured, there is little riding on the final group match against PSV Eindhoven on December 9.</p>
              <p>The absence of Torres will put more responsibility on Robbie Keane, who has yet to produce anything like his best form since his £20.3million summer move from Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
              <p>Liverpool, meanwhile, have become the latest Premier League club to reduce ticket prices after the cut in VAT from 17.5 per cent to 15 per cent. They have reduced the price of all match tickets at Anfield by £1, following the example of other clubs such as Everton and Newcastle United.</p>

              <p class="article-icon-links-container"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/11/28/article-0-02977ACB000005DC-756_468x330.jpg" alt="liverpool" width="468" height="330"></p>
              <p class="article-icon-links-container"><em>Fernando Torres during a Liverpool training session</em></p>
              <p class="article-icon-links-container"> </p>
              <p><strong>Fernando Torres' entire lifestyle will come under scrutiny after Rafa Benitez vowed yesterday to root out the cause of a hamstring problem that could jeopardise his standing as Liverpool's title talisman.</strong></p>
              <p>The Liverpool manager admitted he was concerned that Torres had succumbed to a hamstring injury for the third time this season, following the latest diagnosis that he will be out for three weeks after reporting discomfort at the end of Wednesday's Champions League win over Marseille.</p>
              <p>Torres said: 'It's alarming. I have noticed it's in a similar place to some of my other recent injuries. I need to be more careful, to recover properly without rushing back or setting deadlines to make sure it doesn't happen again.'</p>
              <p>A series of specially designed exercises is already in place to try to ensure that the £21million record signing meets his target of being fit again for the Anfield showdown with Arsenal on December 21.</p>
              <p>Benitez places just as much emphasis on guarding against any recurrence, though, and is adamant that the Spain striker will not suffer in the same way as Ryan Giggs, who was troubled by hamstring problems for 10 years.</p>
              <p>The Manchester United winger's susceptibility was finally traced to his posture, as he sat behind the wheel of his car, and Benitez confirmed that Torres will be quizzed in the same way to try to find out why his right hamstring keeps troubling him.</p>
              <p>'Sometimes it can be a problem with your back or how you walk or sit or even sleep, so we need to analyse everything and get to the bottom of it,' said Benitez. 'Even something small can make all the difference so we need to check him out thoroughly and see what needs changing.</p>
              <p>'We have been doing a lot of strengthening work with him that entails specific exercises and stretching, but now we have to look at what we can do to stop it happening again.</p>
              <p>'I am confident we will come up with a solution sooner rather than later and that this will not be a long-term problem. 'I know about the difficulties Giggs had but, in a few weeks, Torres will be OK. There is no danger of it becoming a mental problem. I am sure of that. He was raring to go against Marseille, and I am certain he will come back fit and strong again.'</p>

              <p>Torres said: 'It's alarming. I have noticed it's in a similar place to some of my other recent injuries. I need to be more careful, to recover properly without rushing back or setting deadlines to make sure it doesn't happen again.'</p>
              <p>A series of specially designed exercises is already in place to try to ensure that the £21million record signing meets his target of being fit again for the Anfield showdown with Arsenal on December 21.</p>
              <p>Benitez places just as much emphasis on guarding against any recurrence, though, and is adamant that the Spain striker will not suffer in the same way as Ryan Giggs, who was troubled by hamstring problems for 10 years.</p>
              <p>The Manchester United winger's susceptibility was finally traced to his posture, as he sat behind the wheel of his car, and Benitez confirmed that Torres will be quizzed in the same way to try to find out why his right hamstring keeps troubling him.</p>
              <p>'Sometimes it can be a problem with your back or how you walk or sit or even sleep, so we need to analyse everything and get to the bottom of it,' said Benitez. 'Even something small can make all the difference so we need to check him out thoroughly and see what needs changing.</p>
              <p>'We have been doing a lot of strengthening work with him that entails specific exercises and stretching, but now we have to look at what we can do to stop it happening again.</p>
              <p>'I am confident we will come up with a solution sooner rather than later and that this will not be a long-term problem. 'I know about the difficulties Giggs had but, in a few weeks, Torres will be OK. There is no danger of it becoming a mental problem. I am sure of that. He was raring to go against Marseille, and I am certain he will come back fit and strong again.'</p>

              <p>impact wise, i am not worried about torres being injured  for now. Only when the season is left with 3 months, then the presence of torres would be tremendous. Of course there's still a chance that players like babel would rise to the occassion.</p>

              <h1>Liverpool 0 West Ham 0: Reds limp to the top - cheers for the cause but boos at the whistle</h1>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1091036/Liverpool-0-West-Ham-0-Reds-limp--cheers-cause-boos-whistle.html"><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/12_01/gerrostrikeIH_482x449.jpg" alt="Steven Gerrard" width="482" height="449"></a><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1091036" rel="1091036_3" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1091036/Liverpool-0-West-Ham-0-Reds-limp--cheers-cause-boos-whistle.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The political statement was well choreographed, the statement of intent less so. </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong> rose to the summit of the Barclays Premier League but their journey there was nothing like as impressive as their campaign for the release of Michael Shields.</strong></p>
              <p>Their supporters let them know as much at the sound of the final whistle. Never before, surely, has a team gone top to a chorus of boos. The fans, it has to be said, need to take a share of the responsibility for what amounted to another desperately disappointing draw.</p>
              <p>A goalless, strangely soulless encounter to rival those here at Anfield earlier this season with <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/stoke-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Stoke</span></a> and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/fulham.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Fulham</span></a>. They were great when it came to uniting behind the campaign to release Shields who was jailed three years ago, wrongly they insist, for assaulting a waiter in Bulgaria.</p>
              <p>After the players wore Free Michael Now T-shirts during the warm-up and Sue Johnston delivered a rousing speech, the Kop followed the actress by delivering a message in their own inimitable style. But give it 20 minutes and no sign of a goal and anxiety spreads like a virus, first in the stands and then on the pitch, with the same once-vocal supporters watching in silence as their team wrestle with the pressure of expectation.</p>
              <p>Clearly, and perhaps understandably, it comes from 18 years of waiting for another League title. But the supporters need to relax and so do the players, remembering first that it is December and secondly that their rivals are dropping points, too.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1091036/Liverpool-0-West-Ham-0-Reds-limp--cheers-cause-boos-whistle.html"></a></p>
              <p>It is that failure to take advantage of a defeat for <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span></a> that will most frustrate Benitez this morning. <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/west-ham-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">West Ham</span></a> deserve some credit for securing a share of the points. In Robert Green and Matthew Upson they possessed two outstanding Englishmen. And the result will succeed only in cementing Gianfranco Zola’s position as a darling of Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>On a night when they should have gone three points clear they managed only one, making that six points dropped — the same as two defeats — in those three home games.</p>
              <p>If Benitez wants to point to the absence of Fernando Torres, the results do not support the argument. He missed those victories against Manchester United and Chelsea, too, and in the five Premier League fixtures the Spaniard had missed prior to this one, Liverpool<br>actually won four of them.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>In Robbie Keane, though, they have a player struggling to demonstrate why, at £20million, he cost almost as much as Torres. Last night Craig Bellamy looked the sounder of the two investments and Benitez sold the Welshman to West Ham for less than a third of Keane’s fee.</p>
              <p>Not once did Keane even go close to taking advantage of the many chances created, for the most part, by a certain Steven Gerrard.</p>

              <p><br>20mil is pretty much a joke. yes. But i guess they wanted to bring in a more experienced striker especially with the departure of crouch. While keane may not have contributed much to liverpool's season as of now, he has already added intangible experience to the squad. I am sure kuyt, torres, babel and many other players (including midfielders) would have learnt quite a lot from him.</p>
              <p>Players like quaresma may be good but he  has never scored more than 10 goals in a league before. Buying a player (age 25) like that is high risk and dont add much experience to the squad. </p>
              <p>However, there is no doubt buying keane is for short term and quaresma, being younger, will always have more long term benefits and potential.</p>
