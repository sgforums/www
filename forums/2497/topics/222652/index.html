            <div class='col-md body'>When Andriy Shevchenko joined Chelsea, Jose Mourinho described it as "a day when the dream became reality". Six months later the words dream and Shevchenko appear in the same sentence the Ukrainian hopes the episode will turn out to be a bad dream and he will find himself back in Milan.<br><br>The reality is that Shevchenko is determined to succeed at Chelsea but doubts are growing about whether he will be able. Tonight's game at Bolton is unlikely to have him salivating, Regardless, it remains too early to write him off, given the scale of his past achievements.<br><br>"You think each week that goes by, 'Is he going to get a bit sharper and fitter and stronger?' and at the moment it doesn't quite seem to be happening," says the former Chelsea midfielder Gavin Peacock.<br><br>"I don't think he's as quick as he used to be. He's lost half a yard and Shevchenko was quick but never Henry quick. Having lost half a yard it is stopping him getting there but I think he has got enough clever movement, if used in the right way, to be effective.<br><br>"With the fact that Chelsea have played a [midfield] diamond a lot they are not getting so many crosses in."<br><br>Peacock feels Shevchenko would benefit from at least one of Arjen Robben and Joe Cole being in the team. "I think he needs the ball to be carried and worked to that final third and then his quick brain can get him into positions and I think we would see more from him," he says. "I wouldn't write him off in November. I know Chelsea were looking at him a lot last season, and his record is huge."<br><br>Shevchenko received strong support from Chris Coleman, "It's only a matter of time," Coleman said. "Look at [Didier] Drogba when he came over - he couldn't get to grips with it. He just couldn't get with the pace of the game and was having a bad time, getting bad press, and opposition supporters were giving him stick for diving.<br><br>"I know they are two different players but once he finds his feet he'll be just as good."<br><br></div>
