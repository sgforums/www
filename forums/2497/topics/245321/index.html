Maradona, who led his team to victory in the 1986 World Cup and is revered in his country, has suffered from health problems in the past. </strong><br><br>He has battled both his weight and an addiction to cocaine. He has also been in hospital twice with heart problems. No reason was given for his admission, but the hospital said it was "not linked to his addiction to drugs". The statement issued by the Guemes hospital said Maradona was suffering from "an imbalance" and was undergoing tests. "He's staying, he's staying... his life is not in danger," said his personal doctor Aldredo Cahe, speaking outside the hospital.<br><br>His two daughters, Dalma and Giannina, were seen arriving at the hospital a few minutes after he was admitted. Families of patients on the 13th floor of the hospital were asked to leave and police and security guards were brought in to control the area. Maradona is still revered in Argentina and his fans will be watching and waiting for any news of their idol, the BBC's Daniel Schweimler reports from Buenos Aires.<br><br>Maradona led Argentina to World Cup victory in 1986, and won league titles at home and in Italy. But in 1991, he was banned for 15 months after failing a drugs test and tested positive again for banned drugs at the 1994 World Cup in the US. He retired from competitive sport in 1997. In 2004, he spent 10 days in intensive care with high blood pressure, breathing problems and a lung infection.<br><br>Two years ago, he had a stomach stapling operation. He lost 30kg (66lb), began playing football again and appeared to be getting his life back on track. But the Argentine media reported at the weekend that Maradona had put on weight and was considering taking a slimming cure in Switzerland. Earlier this month, Argentina's central bank said it was investigating him for alleged financial irregularities.<br></div>
