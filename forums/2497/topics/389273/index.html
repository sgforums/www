              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> Paraguayan international Salvador Cabanas
              remains in critical condition following an incident in which the
              29-year-old was shot in the head in Mexico City on Monday around 5.30pm
              local time.<br><br>There has been much confusion and many conflicting
              reports since the incident. What we do know is that Cabanas received a
              gunshot wound to the head during an exchange with a man in the bathroom
              of a popular drinking establishment in Mexico City called ‘Big Bar’.<br><br>Cabanas
              had been drinking in the popular nightspot with his brother-in-law and
              wife. The incident occurred as they were leaving the establishment and
              Cabanas’ wife found him bleeding on the bathroom following the attack.<br><br>Mexico City Attorney General, Miguel Angel
              Mancera, has alleged the culprit is a man called Joseph J. Balderas
              Garza aka ‘JJ’ or ‘El Modelo’ (The Model), described as a ‘businessman’
              who frequented the bar.<br><br>CCTV
              footage shows Garza walking into the bathroom with his bodyguard
              moments before Cabanas was shot. The same footage also showed staff at
              the bar allegedly assisting the assailants escape, with Mancera
              exclaiming, “They did nothing to stop them.”<br><br>“Joseph J. Balderas Garza is a person who appeared to be a businessman, he was a frequent visitor [to the bar],” he continued.<br><br>Mancera
              went on to suggest that the incident may have stemmed from an argument
              over a Cuban woman that had accompanied Garza to the bar. The woman in
              question has already spoken with the police. <br><br>“She tells us that she established a dialogue, a closeness, not with Salvador Cabanas, but his brother [in-law],” he said.<br><br>Cabanas
              was taken straight to hospital following the incident and was conscious
              when he went into emergency surgery, telling his agent Jose Maria
              Gonzalez to “tell my parents I am fine.”<br><br>Cabanas underwent a
              seven hour surgery at Los Angeles Pedregal at around 6pm, however
              doctors were unable to retrieve the bullet that was lodged in his skull.<br><br>"We
              operated on his cranium and stopped the bleeding and the clotting and
              the brain is in a stable condition,” said surgeon Dr. Francisco
              Martinez at a press conference.<br><br>Dr. Alfonso Diaz, head of
              medical services at Cabanas’ club America, told the press that the
              striker’s future was in god's hands. <br><br>“You have faith, nothing else in a delicate situation, you have to wait and as days go by expectations are higher," he said.<br><br>Apparent
              X-rays of Cabanas with the bullet lodged in his head have been
              published by many media outlets over the last 24-hours, however, the
              photo has been confirmed to be of a child who took an arrow between the
              eyes in 2008 in China, and not of the Paraguay international.<br><br>There
              has been a barrage of public outcry from all over the globe since the
              incident, with two prominent figures in Mexico offering their
              condemnation of the attack.<br><br>Mexico's president Felipe Calderon
              has publicly condemned the shooting, insisting of his government’s
              “willingness to contribute to investigating the case” and Jorge
              Vergara, owner of Chivas, Club America’s fierce rivals, offered his
              side’s support with a banner on the the team's website saying “Chava
              are with you, come back soon."<br><br>Cabanas’ parents landed in Mexico City today to be with their son during his recovery and spoke briefly to reporters.<br><br>“For
              us, it doesn’t matter whether he will play again or not. The most
              important thing is to survive. He is strong and I’m sure he can,” said
              his father.<br><br>There has been some good news today, with reports
              that Cabanas has responded to stimulus and is currently showing regular
              brain activity. His condition has not worsened in the 24-hours
              following the shooting.<br><br>“We have to wait a little longer, he is
              still sedated. His brain activity is still within the usual
              categories,” confirmed surgeon Dr. Martinez.<br><br>Cabanas remains in
              “critical but stable” condition tonight as doctors continue to closely
              monitor his brain activity and hope that further complications do not
              arise from the bullet that remains in his skull. </span></p>
