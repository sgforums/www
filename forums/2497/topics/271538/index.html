            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/graphics/2007/07/31/sfnbes131.jpg"><br><span class="small"><span style="font-style: italic;">In the wake of John Terry's record pay deal, David Miller rates him against the greats.</span></span><br><br><strong>Stopper, sweeper, terrier, thinker? There are so many categories of central defender, one of the core elements of any successful team, along with goalkeeper and clean sheets as was defined by Brian Clough.</strong><br><br>The apotheosis in the valuation of central defenders, as oppose to goal scorers - and a regrettable reflection on the contemporary game - has been reached with John Terry's wage of Â£130,000 per week with Chelsea: an Aladdin's lamp world grossly initiated by immigrant owner Roman Abramovich.<br><br>If Terry's ability is essentially to keep his own penalty area clear, then my chimney sweeper must comparably be worth at least per year what Terry absurdly trousers on a Saturday. And by this scale, what price Bobby Charlton, Jimmy Greaves, or Gary Lineker? Or Michael Owen?<br><br>Terry is of that stopper-brand, they-shall-not-pass, occupied by Billy Wright, Maurice Norman, Jack Charlton, Brian Labone, Norman Hunter and Dave Watson. Though not unskilled, and a formidable header of the ball in the opposition's penalty area, Terry lacks, in my opinion, the all-round ability to place him in the top 10.<br><br>A handful of stoppers narrowly miss my top 20, including Peter Swann (Sheffield Wednesday), curtailed by a bribery scandal in the early Sixties, Martin Keown (Arsenal) and Gary Pallister (Middlesbrough and Manchester United) and several all-rounders such as David Sadler (Manchester United), Colin Todd (Derby), Gary Mabbutt and Ledley King (both of Spurs), the latter yet to mature.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>1 Bobby Moore (108 Caps) West Ham.<br>An average teenager but, guided by Malcolm Allison and Ron Greenwood and by meticulous personal attention, Moore (above) created an art form of the game second to none.<br><br>2 Roy McFarland (28 ) Derby.<br>The near complete defender, who but for injury might have helped make Don Revie's England career a success instead of ignominious failure. An inspiration whether playing with or against you.<br><br>3 Sol Campbell (69) Spurs, Arsenal.<br>Maybe an enigma as a man, but a Bentley among footballers: athlete, role model, worth a goal at either end to any team, eg World Cup '98.<br><br>4 Neil Franklin (27) Stoke.<br>A chandelier among defenders, "a master, two-footed, floated about the pitch, always wanting the ball" said Stanley Matthews. His England career terminated by departure to Bogota.<br><br>5 Tony Adams (66) Arsenal.<br>Woeful baptism in Euro '88, yet developed with growing maturity, reaching peak alongside Southgate in Euro '96 under Terry Venables, epitomised professionalism in mastering his alcoholism.<br><br>6 Jack Charlton (35) Leeds.<br>No-nonsense, Gibraltar-figure, renowned for his 'little black book' of awaited reprisals, preferred the ball on the grandstand roof to any possibility of marginal risk.<br><br>7 Terry Butcher (77) Ipswich, Rangers.<br>Tailor-made hero's jacket, no player ever gave more for England, his commitment as doggedly fulsome as Bobby Robson's praise was over the top.<br><br>8 Gareth Southgate (57) Aston Villa, Middlesbrough.<br>The definitive self-made player whose tactical and positional intelligence enabled his performances consistently to exceed his natural talent. The ideal professional and team man.<br><br>9 Dave Watson (65) Sunderland, Manchester City.<br>Ace stopper, dominant in the air and on the ground. Watson (below) forged another of the enduring partnerships, with Thompson, which could have succeeded in Euro '80.<br><br>10 Des Walker (59) Nottingham Forest, Sampdoria, Sheffield Wednesday.<br>Terrier rat-catcher, in his prime perhaps the fastest there has been. Ideal partnership with Butcher in Bobby Robson's team that flirted with triumph in 1990.<br><br>11 Billy Wright (105) Wolves.<br>Exemplary sportsman, never booked despite tenacious tackling (more tolerant era), 59 caps at wing-half before switching to centre-half. Great motivator, technically limited, captain 90 times.<br><br>12 John Terry (39) Chelsea. Valuably quick for a modern game so geared to speed, a perceptive reader of opposition and a last ditch interceptor, though needs midfield sweeper as link man.<br><br>13 Phil Thompson (42) Liverpool. Master of Bob Paisley's passing game, and therefore predictably a fixture of Ron Greenwood's teams, conceding only 26 goals in 36 matches 1979-82.<br><br>14 Rio Ferdinand (59) West Ham, Leeds, Manchester United.<br>Gifted, yet not as peerless as he would like to believe, failing to distinguish between precision and casualness. Ferdinand (above) needs a touch of the Campbells.<br><br>15 Emlyn Hughes (62) Liverpool, Wolves.<br>Dynamic, any-position leader, foreshadowing Steven Gerrard, with similar long-ball fixation and scorer of some memorable goals, but occasionally tactically suspect.<br><br>16 Ron Flowers (49) Wolves.<br>Part of the Stan Cullis furniture alongside Billy Wright, a principally defensive wing-half in the old 4-2-4 formation, probably restricted by conditioning to the fashionable long ball game.<br><br>17 Norman Hunter (28 ) Leeds.<br>Denied longer European tenure by the presence of Moore, 'Bites-Yer-Legs' was so much more accomplished than his reputation for excesses would suggest.<br><br>18 Brian Labone (26) Everton.<br>Successor to Charlton with the defending champions in World Cup '70 who should have contested the final. Intelligent and technically sound, an old-school Evertonian.<br><br>19 Maurice Norman (23) Spurs.<br>Tiller of Tottenham's Double side, undramatic but 99 per cent reliable as backbone of Alf Ramsey's team until replaced by Jack Charlton.<br><br>20 Paul Madeley (24 caps) Leeds.<br>So versatile and polished in any defensive position he was probably best at full-back, yet could have flourished in a Beckenbauer-style attacking role.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The funny thing is they mentioned Terry is "Valuably quick for a modern game so geared to speed". I think Carvalho is always doing the track back with his pace and Terry is always the one cutting out passes and directing attacks.<br><br>Cheers.<br>CK</div>
