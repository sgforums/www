              <p>The Reds lifted their first silverware for six years in the Carling Cup final and have an FA Cup semi-final date with Everton.</p>
              <p>And Dalglish insists another Wembley win would still be an excellent return considering how competitive the game is these days.</p>
              <p>Liverpool's faint hopes of finishing in the top four evaporated when they let a 2-0 lead slip at QPR in midweek, losing 3-2.</p>
              <p>But the Kop boss said: "The fact is we've won a trophy and everyone really enjoyed it. It's not Swap Shop is it? We've got what we've got.</p>
              <p>"There's not a priority, and I think we have proved that in the games we've played in the cups, whether it's been the FA Cup or the Carling Cup.</p>
              <p>"We've just gone out on the pitch for every game with the same attitude — to try to win.</p>
              <p>"Unfortunately we have not won as many games in the league as we have done in the cup ties.</p>
              <p>"Because the English teams have done well we've got a play-off spot for the team who finishes fourth, so the rewards are greater.</p>
              <p>"But I think it's more difficult to be successful now because there's more competition.</p>
              <p>"You've got loads of people with money — and people who've been at it for a lot longer than others who have a good back up of players they have accumulated over the years.</p>
              <p>"There have always been teams who have more finance than others. But the difference between the financial clout at some clubs is a lot more than it was in years gone by."</p>
              <p>Liverpool have been infuriatingly inconsistent and Wednesday's crazy collapse at Loftus Road sums up their season.</p>
              <p>But Dalglish maintains his team are heading in the right direction.</p>
              <p>He added: "There has been progress — but we want more.</p>
              <p>"Whether it's been at the rate of knots people anticipated I don't know. You can't tell me you just thought they were going to turn up and get everything they wanted in the first season.</p>
              <p>"There were 18 players moved on last summer and a lot came in who are in their first season. It was never going to be an over-night sensation."</p>
              <p>Dalglish, 61, insists he faces no problems lifting spirits for today's match against Wigan — despite watching his side concede three goals in the final 13 minutes at QPR.</p>
              <p>He said: "How can they be demoralised when they have been brilliant for 77 minutes?</p>
              <p>"We won't erase what happened in the last 13 minutes but we will need to learn from it.</p>
              <p>"We have said that the last bit of progress is the hardest. That's the phase we are in. We are just looking for the last bit to click into place."</p>
