              <p><br>Brazilian striker Ronaldo's return to action after a 13-month knee
              injury layoff was marred by an ugly media scrum following Wednesday's
              Copa Brasil game that left the 32-year-old nursing a black eye.</p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/DJ/20090303/ron_RicardoRafael275.jpg" border="0" alt="Ronaldo" width="275" height="200">

              </div>
              <p>Second-half substitute Ronaldo survived his 23 minutes
              intact in Corinthians' 2-0 win at Itumbiara but was then
              injured by a microphone as around two dozen reporters and
              cameramen surrounded him on the pitch for interviews at the end
              of the game.</p>
              <p>Pictures showed Ronaldo being struck as he was escorted off
              and one showed him with a badly bruised and swollen right eye.
              Following the incident, he left the stadium without talking to
              the media.</p>
              <p>"He had a good debut, moved well and tried a few dribbles,"
              Corinthians coach Mano Menezes told reporters.</p>
              <p>Last February, Ronaldo ruptured a tendon in his left knee
              in a Serie A game playing for AC Milan against Livorno and
              later left the Italian club.</p>
              <p>He joined Corinthians in December in a surprise move and
              has taken nearly three months to reach match fitness.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo was involved in another off-field controversy last
              week when he was fined by the club for arriving late at the
              team hotel after a day off.</p>
              <p>Corinthians were already 2-0 ahead when Ronaldo came on,
              Chicao and Andre Santos having scored either side of halftime.</p>
              <p>Wearing his favourite number nine shirt, Ronaldo had only a
              few touches of the ball in an unspectacular debut. It was his
              first game for a Brazilian club since leaving Cruzeiro in 1994.</p>
              <p>The former Barcelona, Real Madrid, PSV Eindhoven and Inter
              Milan player had previously suffered two serious injuries to
              his other knee and many observers speculated that he would not
              recover from the latest setback.</p>
              <p>Even before the latest injury, he had been suffering from a
              loss of form and weight problems and had not played for Brazil
              since his much-criticised performance at the 2002 World Cup.</p>
              <p>• Flamengo also advanced after trouncing Ivinhema 5-0 in Campo Grande.</p>
              <p>Ze
              Roberto netted twice and Leonardo Moura, Kleberson and Maxi Biancucci
              scored a goal each to help the Rio de Janeiro side set up a clash
              against either Barras-PI or Remo-PA.</p>
              <p>Internacional went through after the Porto Alegre side claimed a hard-fought 2-0 home win against Union Rondonopolis.</p>
              <p>The
              home side had to wait until the 66th minute to take the lead with an
              Indio goal and Alecsandro's strike five minutes later ensured a meeting
              in the next stage with Guarani-SP.</p>
              <p>Atletico Paranaense won 3-0 at
              Tocantins with goals by Marcinho, Rafael Moura and Julio Cesar while
              Goias also advanced to the next stage after beating Atletico-RR 3-1
              with a brace by Amaral and a header by Ramalho.</p>
              <p>In other games on
              Wednesday, Coritiba hammered Holanda 3-0 while Criciuma defeated Tupi
              and Fortaleza beat Desportivo by the same score.</p>
              <p>The champions of the tournament will earn a spot in the 2010 Copa Libertadores.<br><br><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=624806&amp;sec=global&amp;cc=4716">ref: http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=624806&amp;sec=global&amp;cc=4716</a></p>
