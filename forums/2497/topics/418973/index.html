              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">CARLO ANCELOTTI'S Chelsea future looked bleaker than ever last night. His Blues were torn to shreds by Arsenal and have now picked up just six points from their last eight league games.</h2>
              <p>Only Fulham have a worse record over the same period and Roman Abramovich's patience may now be close to breaking point.</p>
              <p>Asked if he felt owner Abramovich still has faith in him, Ancelotti admitted: "I don't really know. I believe I have his confidence but obviously he will not be happy at the moment.</p>
              <p>"I will take my responsibility but this is a question you have to ask him, not me. I'm not afraid about my job. Everyone said I did a fantastic job last year. We have to do better. It's not usual Chelsea cannot win for six games."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Chelsea's previous worst run in the Premier League saw them go six games without a win. Then manager Gianluca Vialli paid for that with his job back in September 2000. </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While the rampant Gunners soared to second to prove they mean to be Manchester United's chief title rivals, Chelsea remain stuck in fourth and could slump to sixth if they lose to Bolton tomorrow.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti added: "At the moment, it's no good for anybody. But we have to have confidence. We are sleeping now.</p>
              <p>"If you play against a good team like Arsenal, you lose if you don't wake up. We have to wake up. Maybe I have to be the first to wake up."</p>
              <p>The defending champions were five points clear in October but are now six behind and have not won a league game since Ray Wilkins was axed as Ancelotti's No 2 last month.</p>
              <p>The Italian said: "We must get back to playing the way we were last season and the start of this season. But it is not so easy. "Arsenal played better than us here and deserved to win."</p>
              <p>Gunners chief Arsene Wenger was delighted with the win - Arsenal's first against the Blues after four successive league defeats against them.</p>
              <p>Three goals in nine minutes from Alex Song, Cesc Fabregas and Theo Walcott left the visitors shattered.</p>
              <p>Wenger said: "It was a double impact. Mathematically, it keeps us in touch with the leaders of the league. And psychologically it was important. We were questioned about our capability of winning big games. I'm happy with the desire in the team.</p>
              <p>"Cesc Fabregas said we were maybe scared to win. That was a strong word but maybe there was something in it. We didn't see that tonight."</p>

              <p>Should get at least one cos they won't know when Drog is going to come back or will he ever from this given his age... Or is he just on the wane cos of ageing? And Anelka seems like not relevant anyway... Shouldn't offer him a new contract. I think they need another centre-back too as Terry is getting slower, Alex injury prone and Ivanovic though ok, he seems better on the right-back position.... In midfield well, they already paid a lot for Ramires so don't think more funds will be put there. Anyway, Benayoun would be back sometime next year so could help...</p>
              <p>Chelsea are in quite a serious decline...  I heard the commentator said 6 players starting last night against a quick Arsenal side were over 30 yrs old... Thats interesting... Seems Lotti likes to use older players like in his AC Milan days... But the Premier League is a lot faster than Serie A, too many over 30s may not last the full season...</p>

              <p><br>That's what most thought about Sunderland too...</p>
              <p>I am thinking if Chelsea don't buck-up or the way Lotti puts it... "wake up" soon, I think wednesday's match against Bolton might even be a problem for them... Though most don't think so lah, expecting another Chelsea win at home...</p>
              <p>But I am not going to discount Bolton cos they have been quite a stylish side this season and at the same time still managing to keep their physical play... Can't wait to see Terry, always the physical one at Chelsea going against an even bigger physical player in Kevin Davies and also <span lang="EN-GB">Johan Elmander... Only bad thing for Bolton is their Korean winger won't play.</span>
              </p><p>And not to forget they have an extra day rest as they played on Sun... I kind of find this match interesting... Should catch it.</p>

              I don't think its fair to label Ramires as a flop now, as this is his first season in Epl. Lets wait to see whether he filfils his full potential.

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">PETR CECH piled the heat on Carlo Ancelotti by admitting: Chelsea have never been so bad.</h2>
              <p>Blues boss Ancelotti is facing the axe after a shocking run of <strong>SIX</strong> league games without a win. The 3-1 defeat at Arsenal on Monday leaves the champions in fifth spot with just six points from 24. And Cech twisted the knife into Ancelotti by saying the display at the Emirates was the worst in the keeper's six years at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>And the Czech stopper admits the Blues <strong>CANNOT</strong> defend and <strong>CANNOT</strong> attack. He said: "We are making the wrong choices all over the pitch, defensive-wise and attacking-wise.</p>
              <p>"We have stopped doing the things we were doing at the start of the season when we didn't concede goals and we were scoring a lot. "We can't find the same rhythm. We're making wrong choices, wrong passes.</p>
              <p>"Every time we attack we are offside and we are making mistakes too in the defensive third. This is exactly the reason why we are not winning games."</p>
              <p>Cech believes the shambles at the Emirates was the <strong>WORST</strong> defensive display he has seen in his seven years at the club.</p>
              <p>Howlers from Michael Essien and Florent Malouda for Arsenal's second and third goals in the space of 100 seconds left Cech stunned.</p>
              <p>He said: "On the second and third, it was really unlike Chelsea. I don't remember since I've been here us conceding two goals in one minute like that.</p>
              <p>"We are not used to seeing Chelsea play the way we are playing at the moment." Didier Drogba had a pop at skipper John Terry for his weak pass to Florent Malouda that put Theo Walcott in for Arsenal's third.</p>
              <p>It was indicative of the blame culture that has started in an unhappy camp. Owner Roman Abramovich has axed four managers in seven years - yet none of Ancelotti's predecessors under the Russian ever had such a bad run.</p>
              <p>Chelsea face Bolton at home tonight in a must-win game. Cech added: "You have to ask him how he's coping, but I think he's coping well. Last season there was a period where there was a lot of pressure, yet we turned things round and we won the Double."</p>
              <p>Walcott admits the Gunners made the champions look 'average' on Monday. He said: "I thought everyone got their jobs right and we made Chelsea look quite average at times."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>CHELSEA</strong> (likely): Cech, Bosingwa, Ivanovic, Terry, Cole, Essien, Ramires, Lampard, Kalou, Drogba, Malouda.</p>

              <p>I don't think thats true. Maybe Wilkins is a missing link, but defintely not the one who is helping with the tactics.</p>
              <p>Maybe Ancelotti just couldn't express himself well in English as compared to Wilkins issuing the instructions to the players.</p>
