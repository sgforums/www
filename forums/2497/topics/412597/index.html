              <p><strong>Yossi Benayoun could face months on the sidelines after suffering an achilles tendon injury on international duty.</strong></p>
              <p>The Chelsea midfielder was already due to miss Israel’s Euro 2012 qualifiers against Croatia and Greece because of a calf injury and had only joined up with the squad for treatment.</p>
              <p>However, a scan has revealed unrelated damage to his achilles and the Israel FA fear he will be out until the new year.</p>
              <p>Israel spokesman Gil Levanoni said: ‘He arrived from Chelsea on Tuesday morning complaining of pains. The team doctor sent him for a scan and it revealed a significant tear. He did not train while he was here.’</p>
              <p>A statement on the Israel FA’s website added that ‘he could be sidelined for months’.</p>
              <p>Sportsmail understands Benayoun has been carrying an achilles problem since his £5million move from Liverpool this summer, limiting him to only six games as the club sought to manage the problem.</p>

              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Yossi Benayoun last night revealed how Chelsea missed the badly torn achilles tendon which has wrecked his first season at Stamford Bridge.</strong></p>
              <p>Benayoun travels to Finland this weekend for an operation on Monday which will rule him out for up to six months after the full extent of his injury was diagnosed by Israel’s<br>team doctor in Tel Aviv last week.</p>
              <p>‘The truth is that this entire situation is very strange,’ said Benayoun, 30.</p>
              <p>‘Chelsea were sure it was something small. They have compared all the images and they do not understand how they missed it. I had three MRIs and three ultrasounds and they all said there was no problem, and it was just a small tear. I came to Israel ready to play and they told me it was a big tear. They said it is unusual to have such a big tear and not be in terrible pain. Even now I am not in pain but I cannot take one step by myself until I undergo surgery.’</p>
              <p>Benayoun, signed for £5.5millionfrom Liverpool in the summer, returned to London from Israel on Saturday and consulted a leading Swedish specialist, who confirmed the Israeli diagnosis.</p>
              <p>Chelsea confirmed yesterday that the midfielder is likely to miss six months, a week after the same news came out of Israel.</p>
              <p>Salomon Kalou and Alex will miss Saturday’s game at Aston Villa. John Terry is doubtful after back spasms forced him out of England’s qualifier.</p>
              <p>Jeffrey Bruma expects to train normally today after pulling out of Holland’s Under- 21 squad with tight hamstrings</p>

              <p><strong>The Israel FA have disputed </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span></a><strong>'s claims that midfielder Yossi Benayoun suffered an achilles tendon tear on international duty. </strong></p>
              <p>Benayoun is facing up to six months on the sidelines with the injury but the IFA insisted he arrived from England with the problem.</p>
              <p>IFA chief spokesman Gil Lebanony said: 'When Yossi Benayoun came to Israel he didn't practise with us, even for a single second.</p>
              <p>'He came with pain in his achilles tendon and with a diagnosis from Chelsea that it was only a small tear.</p>
              <p>'But our doctor said immediately that it was a very serious problem and sent him for an MRI scan. The MRI doctor diagnosed the big tear immediately.</p>
              <p>'We're sorry that he is injured because Yossi is so important for us, as he is for Chelsea but we're not to blame for the injury.'</p>
              <p>Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti had insisted Benayoun was injury free when he went to Israel.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti said: 'We are sure that, when he left England, they didn't have a tear on his tendon. We are sure of this.</p>
              <p>'He had a calf problem. The MRI showed this problem, but the tendon was clear. He had a problem at the start of the season with inflammation on his tendon, had treatment and came back to play for us and the national team.</p>
              <p>'I don't know what happened after he left England. I haven't asked him because I haven't seen him. I trust my doctor at this club, and we are sure. I can say this: he didn't have a tear on his tendon when he left England.'</p>

              <p><strong>As Yossi Benayoun recovers from surgery in Sweden on a ruptured achilles tendon, Israel national team doctor Dr Mark Rosnovsky has rubbished </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span></a><strong> manager Carlo Ancelotti's claim that the player did not leave England with a torn tendon.</strong> </p>
              <p>Dr. Rosnovsky said: 'Does he (Ancelotti) think that Benayoun tore the achilles tendon on the plane? Lucky I didn't let Benayoun practice. Chelsea never even scanned the achilles.'  </p>
              <p>Benayoun, who is expected to be out for six months, was given a scan for the calf muscle injury sustained during Chelsea's Carling Cup defeat against Newcastle last month and was being given the controversial placenta treatment in Serbia on that injury. </p>
