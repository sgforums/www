              <p><strong>Ronaldo: a world-record £100million target for Real.</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Spanish reports claim Real Madrid have decided to offer Manchester United a world-record £100million for Cristiano Ronaldo. It is believed Real told United last summer they would pay up to 120million euros for the Portuguese star.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Red Devils made it quite clear they had no plans to sell Ronaldo - but the wonderful form of the player, which has seen him score nearly 40 goals this season, will prompt a new bid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Real have made little secret of their desire to lure Ronaldo to the Spanish capital and now <em>La Sexta</em> is claiming that an incredible £100million bid is imminent. <em>La Sexta</em> - who have the rights to La Liga television coverage in Spain, are said to have close ties with high-ranking Real officials, from where the news on the possible bid have emanated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, it is also being reported that despite the huge bid, Real are not expecting United to accept the deal. The current world record for a footballer is already held by Real, after they £46million to Juventus for Zinedine Zidane in 2001.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Recent speculation intensified after it was reported in Spain that Real's sporting director Predrag Mijatovic met with Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes in London and Rome in recent weeks.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>$100m leh...if he jump ship and don the color of Madrid, i daresay he will be a flop..look at RVN...nuff said..score few goals and then quiet like a mouse <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> In fact, i cant even see anyone who jumped from Man Utd who perform as well as they do when they were in Man Utd..

              <p>If they got him for $100m or more and developed further the brazilian wunderkinds and they turn out to be better than Ronaldo..wah lau...Glazers will be sibei rich sia..</p>

              <p>Well, if a player has a marketing value that can attract $10m a year and maybe even more in the near future... Then i would say its still a good deal. Ronaldo is only 23 yrs old... He still has at least 7 more yrs of top football in him so it don't sound as crazy as some makes it out to be...</p>
              <p>The best would be for United to keep him for another 3 yrs then sell him for top dollar... Cos at 26 or 27, he will still be at the top of his game or maybe even better but it will probably be his last big contract. United should continue with his service until then.   </p>

              <p>Real Madrid paid United $25m for Beck but they generated about that same amount from the percentage of his image and marketing rights yearly... That why they may have learned something from it... So $100m still won't be too impossible.</p>

              <p>Lucky the Glazers isn't like the 2 Pool owners... They have left everything to the CEO and managements to run the football club. Real and perhaps even Barcelona have been trying for the last 2 years already to get Ronaldo... So its not surprising if they have already had offers turned down... They have tried almost every means even to the extend of getting his mom to say she would like to see him at Real...</p>
              <p>United on their part won't sell him so easily cos of his age... They have even re-newed his contract at the beginning of this season till 2012. And word has it that they will re-new it again and bring his weekly salary closer to what Terry and Shevchenko's are making... and perhaps another 2 yrs extension taking it to 2014.</p>
              <p>Now is not the time to let him go... In 3 to 4 yrs time they can cash in on him and i belief they will still get a very good transfer fee for him then...</p>
