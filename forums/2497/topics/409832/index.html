              <p><strong>Jose Mourinho has warned Real Madrid fans not to expect miracles from him and told them: 'I'm not Harry Potter.'</strong></p>
              <p>The Portuguese oversaw a goalless draw at Real Mallorca in his opening La Liga match in charge, a result which was something of a disappointment for supporters following the fanfare of his arrival at the Bernabeu.</p>
              <p>But Mourinho believes his team, including new men such as Ricardo Carvalho, Angel Di Maria and Mesut Ozil, need time to gel.</p>
              <p>'Look, I'm a coach, I'm not Harry Potter,' he told AS. 'He is magical, but in reality there is no magic. Magic is fiction and football is real.</p>
              <p>'I have been in Madrid a couple of months and we've had 40 training sessions. Do you know how many training sessions we have had together, including the new signings? Not 10. I repeat: not 10.'</p>
              <p>Mourinho is determined to completely change the way Real played last season and says the players are still adapting to his new style of play.</p>
              <p>'The easiest thing for me would have been not to change anything,' he said, 'To play like we played last year and keep the structure that already existed.</p>
              <p>'That would have been easier to start the season, but it would have been misleading. That's not the direction that I want to go.'</p>
              <p>Mourinho insists he is not overly concerned by the opening draw and revealed his superstitious side.</p>
              <p>'Early matches are always very strange," he said. "Bayern lost this weekend, Inter drew, Juventus lost, Manchester United drew with Fulham.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Language barrier:  Mesut Ozil is struggling to understand Mourinho's instructions</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>'I'll say one thing for the superstitious. My seasons at Porto and Inter always started with a draw.</strong></p>
              <p>'In Porto we then won four titles and at Inter we got two in the first season and three titles in the second. I do not see a draw as a drama on the first day.</p>
              <p>'Winning this game was not a pre-requisite for a great season. But I'm not going to lie, obviously I wanted to win my first game.'</p>
              <p>Mourinho left new signings Mesut Ozil and fellow German Sami Khedira on the bench at Mallorca and admitted the language barrier was a problem as neither speak any Spanish.</p>
              <p>'It's not easy for the Germans,' he said. 'They do not speak a word of Spanish. They can just say 'buenos dias' and 'hola'.</p>
              <p>'The work we do is intense and luckily I have an assistant who speaks some German and has given them my instructions.</p>
              <p>'But it's not easy for my message to get across as I wish. In addition, the social life of the group is still zero for them Patience. Give them time.'</p>
