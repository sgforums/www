              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">KENNY DALGLISH is concerned Craig Bellamy is getting a raw deal from referees after an incredible run of bookings.</h2>
              <p>The striker has picked up <strong>FOUR</strong> yellow cards in just 195 minutes on the pitch.</p>
              <p>But all have been given for unsporting behaviour or dissent and even those not associated with Liverpool reckon he has received rough justice.</p>
              <p>First up was his booking in the trip to Fulham when he was carded despite refusing to react after Clint Dempsey squared up to him.</p>
              <p>Further yellow cards followed against QPR and Aston Villa, while Liverpool claim ref Michael Oliver refused to give a reason for brandishing the fourth at Wigan.</p>
              <p>Dalglish pointedly did not go as far as accusing officials of picking on Bellamy deliberately — but there are growing fears within the club that there could be some form of agenda.</p>
              <p>The Kop boss said: "Craig has been booked four times and he hasn't deserved any of them.</p>
              <p>"You would hate to believe there is an agenda against him.</p>
              <p>"You would like to think that if you had been unlucky four times, you would not be unlucky for a fifth.</p>
              <p>"Mind you, you might have said that after the first two.</p>
              <p>"One of the bookings was at Fulham when Dempsey stuck his head in Craig's face. When he was booked at Wigan, we asked the ref why and he said, 'Craig knows' - but he didn't.</p>
              <p>"And there was another against QPR when Joey Barton approached him. I haven't seen any of them as reasonable.</p>
              <p>"It's all well and good having rules but the rules should be the same for everyone, not split up for different people."</p>
              <p>If Luis Suarez's eight-game ban for racially abusing Patrice Evra is upheld, the last thing Liverpool need is losing another striker.</p>
              <p>Yet Dalglish will not rest Bellamy just to save him from a possible suspension.</p>
              <p>He added: "If Craig needs to play, he will play. We have just got to take that chance."</p>
              <p>Dalglish has close links with Ewood Park, having led Blackburn to the title in 1995.</p>
              <p>He admitted: "It is sad to see somewhere you enjoyed working being in this position but we won't give them any sympathy.</p>
              <p>"We will be as ruthless as we can be."</p>

              <p><strong>Andy Carroll sported a Christmas shiner, but failed to sparkle as Liverpool dropped yet more precious home points in a 1-1 draw with bottom side Blackburn.</strong></p>
              <p>Carroll, who collected his black eye in training at the end of last week, was only one of several Reds guilty of missing good chances.</p>
              <p>It was good news for beleaguered Rovers boss Steve Kean, who believes his side have shown the festive spirit to win over even their own humbugging fans.</p>
              <p>Anfield manager Kenny Dalglish admitted his side need to start believing in themselves more when they see the white of the keeper’s eyes.</p>
              <p>He said: “My reaction seems to be the same as it has been after so many games here: No complaints about the performance again, but we have not converted the chances - it’s the same old story.</p>
              <p>“Most of the things we did very well. We just need a bit more belief in ourselves and maybe a goalkeeper coming here and having a nightmare.</p>
              <p>”The most important thing is our attitude, we are still determined to get stuck in there, and we have to keep doing that, and then things will come right.”</p>
              <p>At least Dalglish finally got his skipper Steven Gerrard back, with the midfielder returning as a second half substitute after being absent for most of the season.</p>
              <p>“It’s good to see Steven Gerrard back, he’s done really well in training, he looks really fit, and he just needs some time on the pitch now to get to full fitness,” the manager explained.</p>
              <p>Under-siege Kean was overjoyed with the perfect Christmas gift of an unexpected point at Anfield, as his team battled bravely against an under-par Liverpool.</p>
              <p>And, after his team celebrated a late save by Mark Bunn as if he had stopped a penalty, Kean insisted he can still turn things around despite being anchored at the foot of the table, because he has the full support of those battling players.</p>
              <p>“I think our spirit has always been there to see, and if anybody thought it wasn’t then they are pulling the wool over their own eyes,” he said.</p>
              <p>“I hope I can win the supporters round. You can see there is belief in the team, you can see they are prepared to dig in and give it everything, and I hope the supporters can see that and get behind us.</p>
              <p>”We haven’t got as many results as we should have got, but we have still shown spirit, and we’ll do that at Old Trafford next. There are two ways to go at it, you can have fear, or you can go there and not leave any regrets out on the pitch. We did that here, and we will go to United with the same attitude.</p>
              <p>“It’s a patched-up team, we’ve got so many players injured at the moment, we lost our keeper and we had to give a teenager his debut. But they are digging in magnificently. They put in such an effort, and they deserved what they got.”</p>
              <p>Stand-in keeper Bunn produced a fine display, and 17 -year-old debutant Adam Henley performed heroics when he cleared from his own line with the last kick of the game.</p>
