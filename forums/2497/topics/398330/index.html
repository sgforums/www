              <p>Liverpool want England and Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole to spearhead an Anfield 
              revival.</p>
              <p>Cole is known to have infuriated Chelsea owner Roman 
              Abramovich with his wage demands during preliminary contract talks.</p>
              <p>The
               28-year-old is potentially one of the best Bosman free transfers on the<br>market
               and Liverpool, who are driving to bolster their English contingent, 
              have earmarked the skilful Londoner as a potential signing.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/03/article-1271454-06F48AD8000005DC-61_468x379.jpg" alt="In demand: Joe Cole is seen by Liverpool as having the star

              </div>
              <p>Manager Rafa Benitez has already signed up-and-coming stars Raheem 
              Sterling (from QPR) and Jonjo Shelvey (from Charlton) and has talked 
              openly about his desire to instill more ‘English passion’ into the club.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/03/article-1271454-0966964D000005DC-828_306x423.jpg" alt="High jump: Cole was celebrating Chelsea's crucial win with his

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>High jump: Cole was celebrating Chelsea's 
              crucial win with his team-mates at Anfield on Sunday</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Even if Benitez leaves, the club will look to sign at least two more 
              English players over the next month as they pursue a policy of signing 
              more homegrown players<br>to prepare for new UEFA guidelines.</p>
              <p>Cole,
               who has struggled to hold down a Chelsea first-team place under Carlo 
              Ancelotti, would give the club Premier League experience, plus the star 
              quality that would appease disillusioned fans.</p>
              <p>He would not 
              command a transfer fee but is looking for around £6.2million a year in 
              wages — £120,000 a week.</p>
              <p>A move to Liverpool is believed to 
              interest Cole as a next-best alternative to staying at Chelsea.</p>
              <p>But
               that plan was originally smoothed by the idea of the Anfield club 
              qualifying for the Champions League — which they have not — and being in
               a position to build this summer.</p>

              <p>Instead, Liverpool find themselves in turmoil with big questions over
               the management and ownership still to be resolved.</p>
              <p>That could
               open the door for Tottenham and Manchester City to make rival offers for Cole.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <h2>JOE COLE IS INTERESTING - WENGER</h2>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p>Arsene Wenger admits Joe Cole would be an "interesting target", but
               believes Arsenal's midfield is not an area that requires urgent 
              strengthening.</p>
              <p>Cole's contract at Chelsea expires at the end of the season and 
              he has yet to reach an agreement regarding an extension with the Premier
               League leaders.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's title rivals Manchester United have been mooted as 
              admirers of the England international, while Tottenham Hotspur and 
              former club West Ham United have been linked with a surprise swoop.</p>
              <p>Reports have also claimed that Arsenal could make a bid for the 
              schemer, but while Wenger acknowledges Cole's status as a free agent has
               some appeal, adding another creative element to his team is not a 
              priority.</p>
              <p>"Joe Cole is an interesting target, but do I have enough players 
              in those positions? We shall see," said Wenger in the <em>Daily Star 
              Sunday</em>.</p>
              <p>The Arsenal manager has been happy with the performances of his 
              midfielders this season and, with the likes of Alex Song, Abou Diaby and
               Denilson at his disposal, he no longer needs to worry about finding a 
              replacement for Patrick Vieira.</p>
              <p>He added: "First of all I must say that no matter how much money 
              you spend to find a Patrick Vieira [it is hard to do]. Since I am in 
              England, I hear 'this is the new Patrick Vieira' when a guy is tall and 
              strong.</p>
              <p>"But I believe strongly that our midfield are developing very 
              well with Song, Diaby and Denilson because they are young, very young, 
              but different to Patrick Vieira.</p>
              <p>"I believe in them because if you compare them two years ago and 
              this year they are tremendously improved and if they continue to play 
              together, especially with Fabregas, they have a good understanding.</p>
              </span></div>
              <p>"I believe the midfield was not a problem this year because we 
              created so many chances from midfield and we dominated nearly all the 
              games in midfield. I don't think we had a big problem in there. I 
              believe we had a problem of efficiency defensively."</p>

              <p>He's undoubtedly one of the most talented English players, but his attitude could be a problem.  It'll still be interesting to see him at Liverpool though.</p>
              <p>Anyway, Liverpool seems to have this little side business in recent years - buy players for free, then sell them 1-2 years on for a small profit.</p>

              <p class="article">Cole's Chelsea contract ends this summer and he would jump at the chance to be re-united with his old boss Harry Redknapp.</p>
              <p class="article">Spurs clinched a place in Europe's biggest club competition with their 1-0 win at Manchester City on Wednesday. </p>
              <p class="article">But Cole, 28, was already looking to White Hart Lane even before that result.</p>
              <p class="article">The England midfielder has been mulling over a huge offer from City themselves and knows of interest from Liverpool.</p>
              <p class="article">But he does not want to move north and Spurs would suit him if they can come up with wages over the £100,000-a-week mark.</p>
              <p class="article">However that could be a stumbling block as until now they have been reluctant to go above £60,000.</p>
              <p class="article">Redknapp nurtured Cole from the age of 14 at West Ham.</p>
              <p class="article">The Spurs boss is also interested in a fresh move for Craig Bellamy, whom he missed out on last year.</p>
              <p class="article">He is also keen on midfielder Steven Pienaar, who has 12 months left on his Everton contract.</p>

Anyway, for a free player, $100k is still very much ok. Cos any club would have to pay a transfer fee of between $12 to $15 million for him. But now they will only pay him weekly over a period of 4 to 5 yrs... No need to come out with one lump sum + salary somemore... A good deal in my opinion.</p></div>

               move over Liverpool</h1>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> contract rebel <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Joe
               Cole</span></abbr> would prefer a move to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> over <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p><em>The Sun</em> says Cole's <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> contract ends this summer and he would jump at the chance to be 
              re-united with his old boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Harry Redknapp</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Spurs clinched a place in Europe's biggest club competition with their 
              1-0 win at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>But Cole, 28, was already looking to White Hart Lane even before that 
              result.</p>
              <p>The England midfielder has been mulling over a huge offer from City 
              themselves and knows of interest from <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>But he does not want to move north and Spurs would suit him if they can 
              come up with wages over the £100,000-a-week mark.</p>

              <p>If he demand for 120k wage per week, then I can almost certainly say go luck to Cole becos Spurs has a very strict wage structure, otherwise players like Bale, Modric  etc etc will all start to ask for more.</p>
              <p>So so player like Cole should not in the first place, be paid so much, no wonder Chelski do not earn much every year.</p>
