              <h2>LIVE GRENADE FOUND AT DALGLISH HOME</h2>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Police were investigating on Monday after a live hand grenade was found
              on a garden wall at the home of football legend Kenny Dalglish.</p>
              <p>The explosive device was discovered on Sunday night as police
              made searches in connection with an on-going incident unconnected with
              the former Liverpool manager.</p>
              <p>The Army's bomb disposal team were called to the address, in
              Selworthy Road, Southport, Merseyside, and the area was cordoned off
              for the public's safety.</p>
              <p>A Merseyside Police spokeswoman said: "The device was removed and made safe and is currently undergoing forensic examination.</p>
              <p>"The road remains cordoned off at its junction with Sandringham
              Road and high-visibility patrols have been stepped up in the area to
              reassure the public.</p>
              <p>"Detectives believe this incident is linked to a series of
              other recent incidents in this area and not to the owner of the
              property where the device was found."</p>
              <p>It is not known if anybody was at the Dalglish home when the alarm was raised at around 10.15pm.</p>
              <p>A member of the public alerted police after seeing two men acting suspiciously in the area.</p>
              <p>The men, aged in their 20s, were arrested a short time later on suspicion of witness intimidation.</p>
              <p>Mr Dalglish was returning to the UK on Monday after attending the club's tour of the Far East.</p>
              <p>It was announced earlier this month that he had resumed his Anfield career with a senior role at Liverpool's Academy.</p>
              <p>His club said it had received no information about the incident and would not comment.</p>
              <p>Mr Dalglish lives at the house with his wife Marina.</p>
