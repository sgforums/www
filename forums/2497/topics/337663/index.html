              <h1>Walcott joins England crocks: Arsenal winger out for 12 weeks after dislocating shoulder</h1>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/11/18/article-0-028D200A00000578-535_306x516.jpg" alt="Theo Walcott" width="306" height="516"></p>
              <p><em>Blow: Theo Walcott faces three months out with shoulder injury</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">ENGLAND and Arsenal have been stunned by a freak injury to Theo Walcott which could keep him out for three months. </h2>
              <p class="article">Winger Walcott dislocated his right shoulder at the end of the England training session in Berlin last night. The 19-year-old was challenged by Scott Parker and went down on the wet pitch. He was rushed to hospital in the German capital where his shoulder was put back in place. </p>
              <p class="article">Walcott, who has just returned from injuring the same shoulder against Stoke, would have started tonight’s friendly for England against Germany but instead was due to fly home to have his injury assessed for immediate surgery. </p>
              <p class="article">Shaun Wright-Phillips will replace him but England boss Fabio Capello hopes he will recover quickly. Capello said: “Our priority is Theo and making him as comfortable as possible before he returns to England. “We’re all very disappointed but the most important thing is for Theo to travel home and make a quick recovery.” </p>
              <p class="article">It is another blow for Capello, who had already seen a string of his first-choice players ruled out of tonight’s Berlin match by injury. But it is Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger who will be most disappointed since it looks likely Walcott will be out for a crucial period in the Gunners’ faltering Premier League campaign. </p>
              <p class="article">Ironically, Wenger is one of the few Premier League bosses who has not made any bones about allowing his players to travel for international duty. </p>
              <p class="article">Walcott has already had the same problem in his left shoulder and had an operation to resolve that problem 15 months ago. He is hopeful he will return in time for the knockout phase of the Champions League, which starts in February.</p>

              <p style="clear: both;">More surgery for Rosicky</p>
              <p style="clear: both;">Arsenal winger Tomas Rosicky has had more surgery on a knee injury which has sidelined him since January.</p>
              <p style="clear: both;">The 28-year-old orginally had surgery on the tendon in May but has been unable to return to action, and underwent another operation in Germany on Monday in a bid to finally cure the problem. The Czech Republic star, who suffered the injury in an FA Cup tie against Newcastle, is expected to continue his rehabilitation in Germany and no date has been set for his return.</p>
              <p style="clear: both;">"Tomas Rosicky yesterday underwent routine revision surgery in Germany," an Arsenal statement confirmed. "The operation went as planned and Tomas will now spend at least a few weeks convalescing in Germany. Thereafter, he will follow a tailored rehabilitation programme devised by our medical team."</p>

              <h1>Fears grow for Arsenal starlet Walcott's future after latest injury setback</h1>
              <p class="article-icon-links-container"> </p>
              <p class="article-icon-links-container"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/11/19/article-0-02851B71000005DC-464_468x286.jpg" alt="Crestfallen: Walcott faces an uncertain future following his latest shoulder injury" width="468" height="286"></p>
              <p class="article-icon-links-container"> </p>
              <p><strong>Theo Walcott is expected to be ruled out for the rest of the year after dislocating his right shoulder in the final minutes of England’s training session in Berlin last night.</strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal</span></a> winger Walcott sustained the problem after a challenge from Scott Parker and was taken to hospital to have the shoulder put back in place.</p>
              <p>This is the fourth time the 19-year-old has had a problem in that area. He suffered a separation, an injury to the junction between the collarbone and the left shoulder, in 2006.</p>
              <p>Walcott then had surgery last October on a congenital fault from his father, Don, that left him with weak ligaments in the same shoulder.</p>
              <p>He then took a knock to the right shoulder in the defeat at Stoke and Nicola Maffulli, Professor of Sports and Exercise Traumatology at St Bartholomew’s Hospital in London, believes the problem will blight the rest of his career.</p>
              <p>He said: 'It will be a question of managing it for the rest of his career. There is always the possibility that other structures around the shoulder have been affected.</p>
              <p>'Seeing as he has dislocated his shoulder, it is highly likely that the problem would be related to his old injury. During his period out, he will still be training but avoiding situations where he would be suffering another knock.'</p>
              <p>The news on Walcott will come as a major blow to Arsenal.</p>
              <p>Arsene Wenger’s side are already nine points behind Chelsea in the title race. He is sure to be furious having only yesterday reiterated his frustration over the staging of international friendlies.</p>
              <p>England coach Fabio Capello has already expressed his sympathy and said: 'We are all very disappointed but the important thing is for Theo to travel home and make a quick and speedy recovery.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So is Walcott the new Robben? Both are wingers, both are small size... fast but physically not very strong... and get injure easily... I see rather many similarities between them...</p>

              <p>Well, in terms of his injury rate lah at least... He looks so young, his bones like not fully develop or something and he has already got knocks left, right, centre...</p>
              <p>At the rate he is going... He could become an injury prone player throughout his career... By the time he reach 23 or 25, he could get injure easily maybe from all the weak ligaments in his body...</p>

              <p>So is Walcott the new Robben? Both are wingers, both
              are small size... fast but physically not very strong...
              and get injure easily... I see rather many similarities between
              them...</p>

              <p>Not really... probably similar in the fact that they are one dimensional players, where big part of their attacking channel revolves around the flanks. Walcott has yet to reach robben's quality because he can only beat opponents with his pace, his control is not as good as robben's</p>

              <p><img src="http://www.setantasports.com/upload/Sport/Football/2008-2009/Internationals/England/walcott_england_356.jpg" alt="" width="356" height="190"></p>
              <p><strong>Arsenal could be compensated for Theo Walcott’s injury if the
              youngster is out for the three months that has been predicted following
              his shoulder injury sustained on international duty, The FA have
              confirmed.</strong></p>
              <p>Walcott dislocated his shoulder in training as England prepared for
              Wednesday’s 2-1 friendly win over Germany and underwent surgery on
              Thursday morning, with Gunners boss Wenger confirming the 19-year-old
              would be out for three months, possibly more, as he recovered.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.setantasports.com/Templates/News/NewsArticle.aspx?id=68772&amp;epslanguage=EN">While
              the Frenchman accepted that Walcott’s injury was an unforeseeable
              accident and conceded neither he nor Arsenal had contemplated making a
              claim for compensation</a>, the news that The FA has revealed that its
              insurance policy would financially offset such situations will soften
              the blow of having lost the talented youngster.</p>
              <p>An FA spokesman said: “The FA is one of only a handful of national
              associations who voluntarily insure our players against injury while on
              international duty. Almost all foreign international players who play
              for English clubs will not have been insured in this way.</p>
              <p>“The policy pays up to £50,000 per week for the first two weeks out
              of action through injury and up to a ceiling of £100,000 per week after
              that, to a maximum of 100 weeks.</p>
              <p>“This compensation is paid by The FA's various insurers, not The FA itself.</p>
              <p>“Our policy also provides up to £50,000 of medical expenses and
              provides compensation for permanent total disability in the case of
              career-ending injury incurred while with England.”</p>
              <p>If Walcott is out of action for the projected 12 weeks then Arsenal
              could be set for a potential sum of £1.1 million in compensation, with
              that fee rising to £1.5m if the recovery period takes 16 weeks, as has
              been suggested.</p>
