              <p><strong>Super-agent Pini Zahavi was unmasked in the Sunday papers as the </strong><em><strong>Soccernet</strong></em><strong> source who broke the story last week of a £1 billion cash bid 
                  for Manchester United.</strong></p>
              <p>Zahavi's identity was well known to Old Trafford insiders as the man who had 
                  placed the cash offer on the table - and which had been rejected by the Glazer 
                  family, the club's American owners. </p>
              <div class="byLine">Zahavi has close links with Sir Alex Ferguson, counting him as a personal 
                  friend, he is the agent for Rio Ferdinand, dealing with his big money transfers 
                  and contracts, while he has brokered other takeover deals, and is close to 
                  Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. His contacts worldwide give him access to the 
                  world's richest men.</div>
              <div class="byLine"> <br> The Worlds No 1 wheeler dealer would have put the bid through the proper 
                  channels, via chief executive David Gill, as Zahavi has a good relationship with 
                  the Manchester United hierarchy, despite being involved in brining Juan 
                  Sebastian Veron to the club!</div>
              <div class="byLine"> </div>
              <div class="byLine">The Red Knights, by contrast, have angered Gill and brought an 
                  uncharacteristic response from the chief executive publicly rebuking key-man 
                  Keith Harris for trying to persuade United fans to rebel against the club and 
                  damage it financially by declining to buy merchandise and not renew season 
                  tickets.</div>
              <div class="byLine"> <br> Zahavi has poured cold water on the Red Knights' attempts to takeover 
                  United, arguing that the Glazers decline to deal with individuals who can 
                  instantly produce proof of funds, and would be put off by the strong arm tactics 
                  of the group.</div>
              <div class="byLine"> </div>
              <div class="byLine"><em>Soccernet</em> had quoted Zahavi at length about the reasons why the 
                  Glazers are refusing to sell, because they actually enjoy running the world's 
                  biggest sporting brand and have no intention of giving it up.</div>
              <div class="byLine"> <br> We reported that it would take a knockout bid close to £1.5 billion to 
                  tempt the Glazers, who had turned down that figure just over two years ago from 
                  a Chinese consortium.</div>
              <div class="byLine"> </div>
              <div class="byLine">Zahavi declined to disclose the two groups now bidding for Manchester 
                  United, but other sources indicated one was from the Middle East, while the 
                  other was, presumably, the Chinese group returning to the negotiating table.</div>
              <div class="byLine"> <br> However, the Glazers are refusing to even negotiate, and any offer, at 
                  least for the time being, is dead in the water.</div>
              <div class="byLine"> </div>
              <div class="byLine">The only chance would be a straight forward cash offer of £1.5 billion 
                  which would buy out the Glazers and show funds available for new players and 
                  investment.</div>
              <div class="byLine"> <br> At the moment Zahavi has proof of funds with the cash lodged in a Swiss 
                  bank account, but he knows he will have to up the bid considerably to tempt the 
                  Glazers even to discuss it.</div>
              <div class="byLine"> </div>
              <div class="byLine"><em>Soccernet</em> has learned that the Red Knights value Manchester United 
                  at £800 million and are not prepared to pay the Glazers a premium price.</div>
              <div class="byLine"> <br> While the Red Knights have allowed their talks to become public 
                  knowledge, Zahavi works in secret and it is a shock that one of the Sunday 
                  papers should have unmasked him.</div>
              <div class="byLine"> </div>
              However the identities of the Zahavi bidders still remain a mystery, but 
                  he does have powerful connections in Russia and the Middle East, and he has been 
                  the man behind the scenes trying to help his friend and client Avram Grant at 
                  cash stricken Portsmouth.
