              <p><strong>Chelsea’s two-goal hero
              against Liverpool Branislav Ivanovic has revealed he is settled in West
              London for the first time since his move to Stamford Bridge.</strong></p>
              <p>Ivanovic’s two goals have given The Blues every chance of making the
              semi-finals of the Champions League, but he has found it difficult to
              hold down a first-team place since signing for Chelsea back in January
              2008 from Lokomotiv Moscow.</p>
              <p>But the Serbia international’s patience has been rewarded, and he is
              now aiming to be given the chance to partner John Terry in the centre
              of defence on a more regular basis now he used to living in London.</p>
              <p>He told the Daily Mail: “I am settled in English football now and it
              always helps to be playing. It has taken a long time to establish
              myself.</p>
              <p>“I will play better wherever the manager tells me, but I’m better in the centre of defence.”</p>
              <p>Ivanovic has seen three managers at the helm at Chelsea after being
              signed by Avram Grant and given his debut by Luis Felipe Scolari, but
              feels Guus Hiddink has shaken things up at the Bridge with his side
              still eying a slim chance of Premier League glory, as well as the
              Champions League.</p>
              <p>“There’s been a definite change under the new manager, and that has
              helped me feel a lot more comfortable being a Chelsea player,” added
              Ivanovic.</p>
              <p>“The new coach has lots of different ideas. I don’t mind where I play, as long as I can make a contribution".</p>
              <p>Ivanovic also revealed that his two headers against Liverpool were
              part of a tactical ploy by Hiddink with many sides not knowing about
              the 6’ 2’’ defender’s ability in the air.</p>
              <p>Terry was used as the decoy, and with Liverpool’s zonal marking
              focusing on the England captain, Ivanovic was free to twice head home
              for his first goals for the club.</p>
              <p>He said: “It is our Chelsea secret and I don’t want to say too much
              about it because other teams will be able to work on a way to stop it.
              It is something we work on in training.</p>
              <p>“We all have different jobs and different positions to take up, as
              instructed by the manager. Of course it doesn’t always work, but
              sometimes teams are caught out.”</p>
