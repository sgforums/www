BirminghamÂ’s new boss quit as Scotland coach after a heart-to-heart with the Manchester United chief. </strong><br><br>Fergie reckoned St AndrewÂ’s would be right up McLeishÂ’s street after his stint with the national team and Rangers. McLeish, nicknamed Big Eck, has been given three-and-a-half years to take Brum from Premier League strugglers to top-eight contenders. And he admitted: Â“I spoke to Sir Alex about taking this job. He was definitely positive about this move.<br><br>Â“I know him from my early Aberdeen days. I knew how hard he worked and I think that kind of rubs off on you. Â“You hear people telling him to retire and he has still got an absolute desire to carry on. Â“There is probably a desire to prove yourself out of Scotland as well Â— the old chip on the shoulder that we Scots have.Â” McLeish, who had four-and-a-half years at Ibrox, came within a whisker of taking Scotland to Euro 2008.<br><br>But when Brum came calling and indicated they were willing to treble EckÂ’s Â£400,000 pay packet, it was no contest. The Scot inherits a squad from Steve Bruce which is one point above the drop zone after a miserable run of one win in eight league games. But McLeish, 48, is bullish when it comes to talking up the chances of survival.<br><br>McLeish is BrumÂ’s fourth manager in 15 years and chairman David Gold believes that he has found a gem. Gold said: Â“You can see how relaxed, measured and confident Alex is.Â” McLeish replaces Bruce, who left St AndrewÂ’s for Wigan because of uncertainty about the clubÂ’s future.<br><br>There is still a Â£50million takeover in the offing, although no one at Brum believes Carson Yeung will complete it. Tomorrow is D-Day for the Hong Kong businessman to get his documentation together or he will miss the December 21 deadline set by co-owner David Sullivan. Gold hopes to stay on as chairman whatever happens and that was enough to persuade McLeish to sign without an escape clause.<br></div>
