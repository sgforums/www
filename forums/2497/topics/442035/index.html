              <p class="introcopy"><strong>ANDRE VILLAS-BOAS has been told the only way to stamp his authority on Chelsea is to get rid of England skipper John Terry. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="padding7north" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 17px; margin: 4px 5px 4px 0px; font-size: 12px;">
              <p class="storycopy"> </p>
              <p class="storycopy">That is the typically blunt advice of former Blues and Wimbledon hardman Vinnie Jones, who warns that <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/football/teams/17/Chelsea"><span style="color: #2a166d;">Chelsea</span></a>’s young manager - facing the most testing month of his short reign - will not be in complete control at Stamford Bridge as long as the influential Terry is around.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Terry showed worrying signs of defensive frailty in Sunday’s 2-1 loss against Liverpool and Villas-Boas faces some tough decisions. Shipping out club stalwart Terry would be the hardest of all, but Jones, above, said: “I wouldn’t be surprised if JT moves on.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“Sometimes, you’ve got to clear the decks. You think, ‘How can you leave someone like JT out?’ But sometimes your big, high-profile players go and other players come in and, all of a sudden, the coach is in charge again.”</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Jones, who compared the situation at Chelsea to the one Sir Alex Ferguson discovered at Manchester United 25 years ago, also believes the Terry racism inquiry is unsettling the club.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Terry is the subject of a police investigation into claims he racially abused QPR defender Anton Ferdinand, something he strenuously denies.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“That’s all got to be sorted out,” said Jones.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Chelsea have lost three of their last four Premier League games to lie 12 points adrift of Manchester City, putting pressure on Villas-Boas. Jones urged trigger-happy Blues owner Roman Abramovich to stand by the manager but admitted the fans could turn on the Portuguese if his revolution continues to falter.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“They made a bold statement putting such a young fellow in charge of such a high-profile club and Abramovich has got to stick with it, especially until next season,” he said. </p>
              <div class="padding7north">
              <p class="storycopy">“I think he’s definitely going to give him some time, I really do.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“If you look at the guy’s record, he’s going to make decisions the fans are not going to be happy with. If a coach comes into a new club and makes decisions fans are not happy with, but gets the results, they go with the coach. It’s as simple as that.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“If results don’t go the right way they start shouting for his blood.”</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Meanwhile, MLS champions LA Galaxy are to offer Didier Drogba, 33, a way out of Chelsea with a massive £7million a year contract.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Vinnie Jones is an ambassador for npower’s ‘Tackling it Together’ campaign. The initiative aims to tackle anti-social behaviour in the nation’s youth through football.</p>

              <p><strong>Chelsea manager <span style="color: #000000;">Andre Villas-Boas</span><span style="color: #000000;"> has hit back at Gary Neville's "ridiculous" criticism after the former Manchester United fullback said </span><span style="color: #000000;">David Luiz</span><span style="color: #000000;"> looked like he was being controlled by a ten-year-old on a Playstation during the Blues' 2-1 defeat to Liverpool on Sunday.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Centre-back Luiz was part of a Chelsea defence that failed to deal with Liverpool goalscorers </span><span style="color: #000000;">Maxi Rodriguez</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and </span><span style="color: #000000;">Glen Johnson</span> at Stamford Bridge and have now conceded 11 goals at home this season - only Premier League strugglers Bolton and Blackburn have shipped more.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's leaky defence has been much criticised following four defeats in 12 games this term and Brazilian defender Luiz, a £21 million signing from Benfica, has bore the brunt.</p>
              <p>Following Sunday's home defeat, Neville, now a <em>Sky Sports</em> pundit, said Luiz's gung-ho, all-action style left him out of position and made it look like the former Vitoria defender was being "controlled by a ten-year-old in the crowd on a Playstation."</p>
              <p>But in his post-match comments Villas-Boas, whose position as a manger has come under close scrutiny in the press, jumped to the defence of his much-maligned defender and rounded on Neville.</p>
              <p>"Gary Neville was a fantastic defender but it is a stupid approach to an opinion," the Chelsea manager said. "If that's the way he wants to take the game that is ridiculous."</p>
              <p>Villas-Boas went on to insist that he thinks his job is safe despite Chelsea's worst start to a season under Roman Abramovich.</p>
              <p>"The owner didn't pay €15 million to get me out of Porto just to pay me another fortune to get me out," he said.</p>
              <p>"It's not a question of the owner having patience. We are committed to what we are creating for the future. We have enough talent to compete in all competitions and that is our perspective at the moment.</p>
              <p>"The situation in the League is not good, it's not the brightest start for Chelsea but we believe we can still turn it around. It doesn't look good being 12 points behind such a strong leader as Manchester City but the December fixtures give us hope."</p>
              <p>Chelsea's next Premier League match is at home to Wolves.</p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Andre Villas-Boas admits it is down to him to lift his players from their rut of despair and ensure Chelsea are not dumped into the Europa League. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>On a night when Robin van Persie's double in Arsenal's 2-1 win over Borussia Dortmund secured their place in the last 16, Villas- Boas watched his team surrender the lead to Bayer Leverkusen and lose 2-1 to a goal in stoppage time. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>It means the Blues must beat Valencia at home in their final group game or draw 0-0 - any other result and they will almost certainly go out of the Champions League at the group stage for the first time.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Villas-Boas said: 'Confidence is low but they expect the manager to inspire them. That's my job. The talent is immense, the work is good. I have to motivate them to get a win against Wolves on Saturday and then against Liverpool in the Carling Cup next Tuesday.' </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Didier Drogba gave Chelsea the lead three minutes into the second half, but Eren Derdiyok levelled with 17 minutes left and Manuel Friedrich headed the winner in the final seconds. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Leverkusen are through and will win the group if they beat Genk. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Villas-Boas said: 'There was no good football by either team, which is a pity. But that's not what matters. We go into the final game against Valencia to decide our qualification. </span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Chelsea were without Ashley Cole, injured in training on the eve of the game, and David Luiz played for 69 minutes despite feeling 'sick and dizzy'.</span></p>

              <p>John Terry showed worrying signs of defensive frailty
              in Sunday’s 2-1 loss against Liverpool</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div style="margin: 0px 0px 15px;">
              <p><strong>ANDRE VILLAS-BOAS has been told the only way to
              stamp his authority on Chelsea is to get rid of England skipper
              John Terry.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div style="text-align: justify; line-height: 17px; margin: 4px 5px 4px 0px; font-size: 12px;">
              <p> </p>
              <p>That is the typically blunt advice of former Blues and
              Wimbledon hardman Vinnie Jones, who warns that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.express.co.uk/football/teams/17/Chelsea"><span style="color: #2a166d;">Chelsea</span></a>’s young
              manager - facing the most testing month of his short reign - will
              not be in complete control at Stamford Bridge as long as the
              influential Terry is around.</p>
              <p>Terry showed worrying signs of defensive frailty in
              Sunday’s 2-1 loss against Liverpool and Villas-Boas faces some
              tough decisions. Shipping out club stalwart Terry would be the
              hardest of all, but Jones, above, said: “I wouldn’t be surprised if
              JT moves on.</p>
              <p>“Sometimes, you’ve got to clear the decks. You think,
              ‘How can you leave someone like JT out?’ But sometimes your big,
              high-profile players go and other players come in and, all of a
              sudden, the coach is in charge again.”</p>
              <p>Jones, who compared the situation at Chelsea to the one
              Sir Alex Ferguson discovered at Manchester United 25 years ago,
              also believes the Terry racism inquiry is unsettling the club.</p>
              <p>Terry is the subject of a police investigation into
              claims he racially abused QPR defender Anton Ferdinand, something
              he strenuously denies.</p>
              <p>“That’s all got to be sorted out,” said Jones.</p>
              <p>Chelsea have lost three of their last four Premier
              League games to lie 12 points adrift of Manchester City, putting
              pressure on Villas-Boas. Jones urged trigger-happy Blues owner
              Roman Abramovich to stand by the manager but admitted the fans
              could turn on the Portuguese if his revolution continues to
              falter.</p>
              <p>“They made a bold statement putting such a young fellow
              in charge of such a high-profile club and Abramovich has got to
              stick with it, especially until next season,” he said. </p>
              <div>
              <p>“I think he’s definitely going to give him some time, I
              really do.</p>
              <p>“If you look at the guy’s record, he’s going to make
              decisions the fans are not going to be happy with. If a coach comes
              into a new club and makes decisions fans are not happy with, but
              gets the results, they go with the coach. It’s as simple as
              that.</p>
              <p>“If results don’t go the right way they start shouting
              for his blood.”</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, MLS champions LA Galaxy are to offer Didier
              Drogba, 33, a way out of Chelsea with a massive £7million a year
              contract.</p>
              <p>Vinnie Jones is an ambassador for npower’s ‘Tackling it
              Together’ campaign. The initiative aims to tackle anti-social
              behaviour in the nation’s youth through football.</p>

              <p>I think he is making the decision very hard for roman not to find a new replacement.</p>

              <p>Every top team undergoes to this stage; Man Utd included.</p>

              <p>chelsea is seriously in danger of not qualifying for CL next season. liverpool, arsenal and spurs are coming on strongly for top 4. man u and city will be fighting for the title, made no mistake about it. the rest are fighting for 3rd and 4th placing.</p>
              <p>it will be a shocked if chelsea is not into the draw for the second round of the CL. the writing is already on the wall, just ask scolari</p>

              <p>haha ya, but then since he is already a millionaire, money is no long a motivation for him already. its the stigma, hurt and disappointment that  he didnt do what he was hired to do the job at chelsea by roman. sure he will gain a lot of money thru compensation, but then that must be secondary concern to him.</p>
