Talks over a new contract have broken down. Now the BluesÂ’ skipper is ready to use FIFA rules to buy out the two years left on his current Â£90,000-a-week deal.</strong><br><br>Terry expected a Â£130,000-a week offer at least when he had talks with chief executive Peter Kenyon last week. That would put him on the same contract as Andriy Shevchenko and Michael Ballack.<br><br>Terry, 26, said he wanted to stay for life, having been at the club since the age of 14. He believed Chelsea were prepared to give him a nine-year contract. But Chelsea insisted the maximum available was five and offered him only a minor pay increase.<br><br>Terry is furious and could now join Frank Lampard in possibly heading to the likes of Barcelona. Doctors will decide today if he can return for tomorrowÂ’s FA Cup quarter-final with Spurs.<br><br>Meanwhile, Jose Mourinho admits he has not met Roman Abramovich for more than two months. The Russian billionaire was last seen by the players or manager in person after the Boxing Day home win over Reading.<br><br>Mourinho revealed: Â“The last time I saw him happy was at the end of the game against Porto. I saw him on TV.Â”<br></div>

No matter how influential they can be, its still a team game.

Terry may return from his horror head injury to face Tottenham in the FA Cup quarter-final at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. </strong><br><br>If he is unable to agree a new deal with the Blues Terry could use FIFA rules to buy out the two years left on his current deal, which is worth a reported Â£90,000-a-week. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho insisted on Friday that the club would do all it could to keep its English stars.<br><br>Mourinho said: "We are in a good situation, we don't have players whose contracts end this summer. "We don't have to make quick decisions about players who are in their last year.<br><br>"Everybody knows about the players we want to keep and Chelsea will do everything they can to keep them. "In the case of John and Frank Lampard and other players, Chelsea will do everything to make them stay."<br><br>Meanwhile Kenyon says the club are hopeful that Lampard will re-sign soon. Kenyon added: "We have had some initial discussions. Clearly he has two years left on his contract and we would expect him to enter into serious negotiations quickly with us and hopefully re-sign him for the future as we see Frank as a long term player."<br></div>
