              <h2>Chelsea manager Luiz Felipe Scolari has been handed a timely injury
              boost with the news that Michael Essien's comeback from injury is ahead
              of schedule.</h2>
              <p>The Ghanaian powerhouse has been out of action since the start of
              September when he suffered a knee injury on international duty.<br><br>In
              a World Cup qualifier against Libya in Tripoli, Essien damaged knee
              ligaments and was expected to miss the entire 2008-09 campaign for club
              and country. <br><br>However, estimates have been reassessed and Essien pencilled-in for a comeback towards the end of February. <br><br>Now,
              his club manager Luiz Felipe Scolari has revealed that the 25
              year-old's progress has been swift, and the Brazilian even expects to
              see Essien in action for his club in January. <br><br>Chelsea have
              been struggling for midfield cover after unloading some of their fringe
              players over the summer. Although the club signed Deco after releasing
              Claude Makelele and Steve Sidwell among others, the Pensioners have
              been hit with a spate of injuries this season. <br><br>Michael
              Ballack, Deco and Essien have all spent time on the sidelines and
              Scolari was forced to recruit his out of contract compatriot Mineiro as
              cover. <br><br>The prognosis looks less bleak for the Stamford Bridge outfit now however, even if their league form has stuttered. <br><br>With Didier Drogba expected to feature before the end of November, Scolari is set to see his squad replenished. <br><br>He
              told the press: "Essien. I think he’ll be back a month earlier than the
              doctors said. I think God helped me and, in January, I think he will
              play for us at the last few days in January.”</p>

              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Injured Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien has admitted it could be as late as March before he returns to action.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The
                  Ghana star needed surgery on a knee injury after landing awkwardly
                  during the World Cup qualifier against Libya in September.</p>
              <p>Chelsea manager Luiz Felipe Scolari claimed earlier in the week
                  that Essien could be back by January but the 25-year-old, currently at
                  the Centre Technique National Fernand-Sastre (CTNFS) in Clairefontaine,
                  France, believes he could be sidelined for longer.</p>
              <p>"It's the surgeon who operated on me who recommended to me to
                  come to Clairefontaine," he told the France football federation
                  website. "It's the first time in my career that I have been so
                  seriously injured.</p>
              <p>"It's difficult for the moment to fix a date for my return. But
                  I know that my recovery period will last a total of four to six months.</p>
              <p>"At the moment I'm not thinking about it much. I'm following the treatment calmly. Everything's going well.</p>
              <p>"It's actually the third time I've come to the CTNFS. I'm very
                  well looked after and the club doctor and physiotherapist have visited
                  me.</p>
              <p>"This weekend I will return to London but it's possible that I'll then come back to Clairefontaine.</p>
              <p>"Chelsea play in Rome next week in the Champions
                  League. Being immobilised, I can't do anything but follow the match on
                  television, but the team have the assets to bring back the three points
                  from the trip."</p>
