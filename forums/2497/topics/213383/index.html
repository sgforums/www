            <div class='col-md body'>PARIS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Arsene Wenger, who has just celebrated 10 years as Arsenal manager, believes his side can beat champions and London rivals Chelsea to the Premier League title this season.<br><br>"It's satisfying to think that Chelsea are not the only ones who can be successful, even with money", the Frenchman told French sports daily L'Equipe in an interview on Tuesday.<br><br>"Chelsea can be beaten this year in England. I'm profoundly convinced of that. And I believe we can beat them."<br><br>Wenger said his major achievement of the past decade was to have transformed the London club's image, from "boring Arsenal" into a spectacular side.<br><br>"That's what I'm the most proud of," he said. "Our leitmotiv is to win, but to win in style. Frankly, I'm satisfied in a way, as well as surprised, when I'm travelling abroad and people tell me 'We like Arsenal because they play nice football'."<br><br>"That was one of the goals, to bring a bit of the French culture, to make the English game more technical, to force England to look at the game differently".<br><br>Wenger said one of the first steps he had taken at Arsenal had been to force the players to have a healthy diet. "I banned those chocolate bars the players were stuffing themselves with," he said.<br><br>"On the bus to Blackburn (for Wenger's first game in charge), the players were chanting 'We want our chocolate bars'.<br><br>"At halftime, they expected me to yell like a madman and I didn't say a thing. They were used to being shouted at."<br><br>Despite all his years of living in England, the Arsenal manager said he still felt himself to be a Frenchman.<br><br>"I'm French. I have not become an Englishman. I have the impression of living on an island called Arsenal.<br><br>"If you fancy a sightseeing tour of London, don't ask me. You would get lost."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>JOSE MOURINHO has suffered a double blast from Manchester United and Arsenal.<br><br>United star Mikael Silvestre taunted Chelsea by saying they are worse than last year.<br><br>And Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger weighed in by insisting MourinhoÂ’s champions will end up handing over the Premiership title to Arsenal.<br><br>Defender Silvestre said: Â“Are Chelsea untouchable? I have the feeling rather that their machine can get jammed at the moment and that they are not as strong as last year. ThatÂ’s my impression.<br><br>Â“LetÂ’s just carry on in our own sweet way without looking at others and see how things go.Â”<br><br>Wenger said: Â“It is deeply satisfying to me to feel sure that Chelsea will not have a monopoly on success in England, despite all the money that they spend.<br><br>Â“Chelsea can be beaten in the Premiership this season and IÂ’m deeply, totally convinced of that.<br><br>Â“Indeed IÂ’m certain the team to beat them will be us.Â”<br><br>United and England star Wayne Rooney also believes the morale of MourinhoÂ’s side could be affected by having stars frozen out of the team.<br><br>Rooney said: Â“Chelsea are going to have some top stars sitting on the bench and you can see how that unnerves some players.Â”<br><br></div>
