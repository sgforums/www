              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span>The team's recent performances and results have not been good enough and the owner and the Board felt that a change was necessary now to keep the club moving in the right direction as we head into a vitally important part of the season. </span><br></span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Roman Abramovich fired Roberto Di Matteo this morning after an 'unacceptable' run of results.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The Chelsea owner, furious with the club's disastrous Champions League campaign, sacked him this morning just hours after their 3-0 defeat at Juventus.</span></p>
              <p><span>Chelsea executives met at Stamford Bridge to tell Di Matteo that his reign was over just six months after leading them to glory in the European Cup.</span></p>
              <p><span>Abramovich's No 1 target is former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola, but the Blues owner needs to persuade him to end his year-long sabbatical from football. If he fails in this bid, he will turn to Rafa Benitez to take the helm. </span></p>
              <p><span>Guardiola is spending time in Manhattan with his family after four years in charge at the Nou Camp and is the Russian's top target to take over. </span></p>
              <p><span>Sources close to the 41-year-old say it will take a 'phenomenal' offer for the manager to change his mind.</span></p>
              <p><span>However, it is understood Guardiola's advisers are willing to begin negotiations with prospective employers ahead of next season.</span></p>
              <p><span>Discreet enquires from Chelsea, City and Milan have already taken place, with all three clubs keen to steal a march on their rivals in the race to land the talented manager.</span></p>
              <p><span>Benitez is understood to be willing to take the job until the end of the season. This is despite turning down a similar offer last season after Andre Villas-Boas was sacked. </span></p>
              <p><span>The former Liverpool and Inter Milan boss is addressing a conference in Abu Dhabi today and is scheduled to fly back into London tomorrow. </span></p>
              <p><span>Abramovich was furious that the team, who started the season with the chance to win seven trophies, are already in freefall.</span></p>
              <p><span>Although he was prepared to overlook the Community Shield defeat against Manchester City, he was furious with the 4-1 defeat against Atletico Madrid in the Super Cup.</span></p>
              <p><span>Abramovich’s circle made it clear that they had to play seven games to 'qualify' for the Community shield and that it should be treated seriously.</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Likewise the 4-1 defeat against Atletico in Monaco came after they won the Champions League final against Bayern Munich and they wanted to win it.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Chelsea need a miracle to qualify from Group E of the Champions League and are in danger of becoming the first holders in the history of the competition to go out in the group phase.</span></p>
              <p><span>They are four points behind this weekend’s opponents Manchester City in the Barclays Premier League and cannot afford another defeat after last week’s 2-1 loss at West Bromwich.</span></p>
