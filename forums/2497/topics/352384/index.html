              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has admitted that even he had not
              expected new signing Andrey Arshavin to adjust to the pace and style of
              the Premier League quite so quickly, but is glad he has been proved
              wrong.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Russian international joined the Gunners from Zenit St
              Petersburg for £15 million at the end of the winter transfer window,
              and has made an instant impression at his new club, netting a stunning
              first goal against Blackburn last weekend.</p>
              <p>The diminutive playmaker needed eight stitches in his right foot at
              half-time against Sam Allardyce's side, but was determined to play on
              and bag his first goal in Arsenal colours, with his resilience - as
              well as his intelligent play - impressing the Gunners boss.</p>
              <p>"I've said in the past that we shouldn't expect too much from
              players that sign in January until the following season - I was
              obviously wrong about that for Andrey Arshavin! And I'm happy about
              that," he said in his programme notes ahead of Tuesday night's FA Cup
              clash against Hull City.<br> <br> "He has personality, vision and intelligence, and he's adapted very
              quickly because he is resilient and works very hard. Also, because he
              is cup-tied in Europe, he knows he can concentrate purely on domestic
              football.<br> <br> "Andrey had eight stitches in his right foot at half-time on Saturday. He is a tough boy though, and if you want to win
              things you need people like that.<br> <br> Softness is detrimental to success, but he is not soft."<br> <br> While, club captain, Cesc Fabregas also commented on the immediate impact Arshavin has had at the north London outfit.<br> <br> "I think he's made a big difference since coming into the team and you
              can see straight away that he's a special player." he said.</p>
              <p>"When he plays his first touch, when he goes through and dribbles,
              he always makes the right decision - I was very happy for him to score
              his first goal because I'm sure it was the first of many he will score
              for Arsenal.<br> <br> "He certainly likes that kind of goal [against Blackburn] - in these
              situations defenders see such a small space that they don't think he
              can do anything from the byline, but small, quick players like him can
              produce from there. It was a great strike."</p>

              <p>Yeah Arshavin is a great signing... seeing him plays makes me happy. Unlike before his arrival... arsenal just sucks!!!</p>
              <p>Anyway arsenal should take more long shots. Everytime sense an opening just shoot. Be selfish, just like CR. If the keeper cannot hold onto the ball at least still can tap in. Knn dont always go for the perfect goal. I see already also very sian. Lucky got arshavin, he dares to shoot from further out, and he is the only one that does that. LAst time nasri also try, but dont know why now also try to play the perfect goal. haiz.....</p>

              <p>only time will tell. but i must admit i like the way he plays too. small but stands out... was it due to the fact that arsenal are mostly black thats why he stands out? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>

              <p>this guy got guts to shoot, dribble, got vision and tries to be quick. He make his time worthwhile by running around a lot. (not a slacker) And he keep aiming for goals.</p>
