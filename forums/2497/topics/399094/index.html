              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><em>Carvalho, on his way out?</em></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Chelsea are planning a summer clear-out to raise funds for new signings. Ricardo Carvalho, Deco, Juliano Belletti and Paulo Ferreira will all be allowed to leave as the club seek to reduce their wage bill and create space in the squad for new players and emerging talent from the youth team.</strong></p>
              <p>Ron Gourlay, the chief executive, said yesterday that in an ideal world future signings would be funded by player sales, and although that seems a remote prospect, the decision to trim the squad is a sign that the club are at least making some efforts to operate as a self-sustaining business.</p>
              <p>Of the quartet who have been told they can leave Carvalho is the only player with any significant resale value and attracted strong interest from Inter Milan last summer before opting to stay at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>Chelsea now accept that their determination to keep hold of Carvalho was mistaken, as his performances have dropped during a season ruined by injuries. Although there are no new offers José Mourinho may make another move for one of his trusted lieutenants, particularly if he leaves Inter to become the coach of Real Madrid, who have also bid for Carvalho in the past.</p>
              <p>Chelsea value the defender at £10 million, but have little hope of gaining any fees for the other players they want to offload and will be happy simply to reduce their wage bill. Belletti is out of contract and can leave on a free transfer, and Deco has one year of his contract remaining, but will be allowed to leave for nothing if he wishes to return to Brazil. Ferreira has three years left on his contract, but with José Bosingwa and Branislav Ivanovic also at the club Chelsea will even consider paying him off to secure his departure.</p>
              <p>Chelsea have also made it clear that Ashley Cole is not for sale after interest from Real. The England left back said yesterday that Chelsea’s Premier League title triumph had vindicated his decision to leave Arsenal four years ago, for which he was widely vilified.</p>
              <p>“It has been a long time and this is my first title at Chelsea and now people will realise why I came here,” he said. “I came here to win the big ones, the Premier League or the Champions League. Hopefully we can get the Double and make history for this club. I am happy and hopefully there is more to come.”</p>

              <p>i will miss ballack though, i know most people say he doesn't do much, but i think thats because they associated him as the goal scoring midfielder from his days at bayern.</p>
              <p>in chelsea he plays in a more deeper role, and do the dirty job quite well actually, fouling and breaking up play without getting carded and also spreading passes around. but i doubt he will want to be a bench warmer with essien back next season.</p>
              <p>ferreira is not so good, but if he's willing to take a pay cut i dont see why they should let him go since he can be a very good spare replacement kind of defender..</p>
              <p>deco and beletti can go..carvalho if he goes then chelsea will need another centre back.</p>

              <p>Ballack is still at Chelsea because he can sell shirts.</p>
              <p>I hope Mikel can be pushed up to play MC instead of DM. DM is not his position, seriously!</p>
              <p>Chelsea got plenty of defenders from its Youth Team, Michael Mancienne/Sam Hutchingson are all pretty ripe for the job, so I doubt there will be any more defenders coming in.</p>
              <p>I would want a big mega signing of a striker though.</p>
              <p>Its sad to see Zhrikov a 18m signing sitting on bench :l</p>

              <p>You guys really think Joe Cole is good? From his past few matches' performance, I don't see the confidence that used to be in him anymore. He can't run past defenders, he doesn't have the confidence to shoot when he has a clear sight of goal and his passing accuracy has gone down greatly.</p>
              <p>Btw, Mikel is not a DM, but due to the injury of Essien, he was forced down. He is a good strong CM or AM who can add that attacking edge to Chelsea. His shot is damn powerful.</p>
