              <p class="first"><strong>Former Wales, Arsenal and Celtic striker John Hartson has testicular cancer which has spread to his brain, it has been confirmed.</strong></p>
              <p>The 34-year-old player, who was capped by his country 51 times and retired last year, was diagnosed on Sunday at hospital in his home city of Swansea.</p>
              <p>Hartson was capped 51 times for Wales and played for five years for Celtic.</p>
              <p>Hartson's other former clubs included West Ham, Wimbledon, Coventry City, West Brom, Norwich and Luton Town.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>The hospital said he would start a course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy which would last "for many months".</p>
              <p>Dr Gianfilippo Bertelli, consultant medical oncologist for Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University NHS Trust, said: "Mr Hartson attended Singleton Hospital on Friday displaying symptoms consistent with testicular cancer.</p>
              <p>"A number of clinical tests were put in place and these have confirmed the presence of testicular cancer. Unfortunately, it has also been confirmed that this cancer has spread to Mr Hartson's brain.</p>
              <p>"We are awaiting the results of further tests to establish a full picture of Mr Hartson's diagnosis.</p>
              <p>"We will be commencing a course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy as soon as possible and foresee many months of treatment.</p>
              <p>"We realise that Mr Hartson is a much-loved figure and there are many fans and well-wishers who will be keen to hear news of his progress.</p>
              <p>"However, while treatment is ongoing we would ask that the privacy of Mr Hartson, and all the patients who attend our hospital, is respected."</p>
              <p>His family released a statement saying: "All the family, and John's friends, are doing all we can to support him and praying that he will make a full recovery.</p>
              <p>"John is getting excellent care from the oncologists at the hospital as he begins his treatment.</p>
              <p>"John is a family man and we appreciate all the messages of support we have already received."</p>
              <p><strong>'Well-liked'</strong></p>
              <p>His former club Celtic issued a statement of support.</p>
              <p>"Clearly, everyone at the club fully supports John and his family at this extremely difficult time.</p>
              <p>"It is very difficult for us to understand what John is going through at the moment, but we will offer any support we can to a great Celtic player."</p>
              <p>Peter Rafferty, president of the Affiliation of Celtic Supporters' Clubs said: "He was one of our major heroes and really well-liked and appreciated by the fans. He always gave 100%.</p>
              <p>"It's so sad that something like this could happen to someone so young. He is still a very young man and has a young family.</p>
              <p>"It's a real tragedy and we just wish him well with his treatment."</p>
              <p><strong>Articulate and knowledgeable</strong></p>
              <p>Hartson was signed by then Celtic manager Martin O'Neill in 2001 for £6m and spent five years at Parkhead, scoring 89 goals.</p>
              <p>He was voted player of the year by his fellow professionals and the Scottish Football Writers Association.</p>
              <p>During his international career, he scored 14 goals before stepping down in February 2006 to concentrate on his club football.</p>
              <p>Hartson made his Wales debut in March 1995 in an away match against Bulgaria, often leading the line as a lone striker, until his last game in November 2005 against Cyprus.</p>
              <p>He began his senior career at Luton in 1992 as a 17-year-old and the player's bustling style soon caught the eye of bigger clubs.</p>
              <p>Arsenal paid £2.5m for Hartson in January 1995.</p>
              <p>A £3.3m move to their London rivals West Ham followed two years later, although that stay was marred by an altercation with team-mate Eyal Berkovic.</p>
              <p>In 1999 Wimbledon paid £7.5m for Hartson, while spells at Coventry, Celtic, West Bromwich Albion and Norwich - on loan - followed before he announced his retirement as a player in February 2008.</p>
              <p>When the 6ft 1in target man retired he said his biggest regret was not having played for his beloved Swansea City, the local club he had supported since a boy.</p>
              <p>Since his retirement as a player, Hartson has proved himself an articulate and knowledgeable football commentator for media outlets, including the BBC.</p>
              <p>Hartson seemed destined to move into football management and has been linked with vacant posts at the likes of Falkirk, Swansea and East Stirlingshire.</p>

              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold">John Hartson has undergone emergency neurosurgery at Morriston Hospital in Swansea after being diagnosed with cancer.</p>
              <p>The former Celtic, West Ham and Arsenal striker was
              told he had testicular cancer which has also spread to his brain at the
              weekend.</p>
              <p>Hartson, 34, underwent tests at the Singleton Hospital
              after complaining of severe headaches before being transferred to
              Morriston for an operation to relieve pressure on his brain.</p>
              <p>A
              spokesman for the NHS Trust which runs Morriston Hospital later
              confirmed that the disease had now also been found in Hartson's lungs.</p>
              <p>The
              spokesman said: "He is currently being cared for by the critical care
              team at Morriston and is receiving round-the-clock care aiming to
              stabilise his condition.</p>
              <p>"Unfortunately, cancer has now also been
              diagnosed in his lungs. He will resume radiotherapy and chemotherapy as
              soon as possible."</p>
              <h4>Overwhelmed</h4>
              <p>Hartson's family issued a
              statement paying tribute to the medical attention he was receiving and
              requesting privacy for the former Wales international.</p>
              <p>It read:
              "His partner Sarah, mum (Diana), dad (Cyril), three children, brother,
              two sisters and very close friends are all continuing to support John
              in any way they can.</p>
              <p>"He is receiving outstanding care from all
              the medical and surgical staff and we would like to thank everyone at
              both Singleton and Morriston, as well as the excellent ambulance staff.</p>
              <p>"We
              have been overwhelmed by the support and goodwill from many thousands
              of football fans, players, clubs and sporting figures and we have drawn
              strength from this support.</p>
              <p>"Finally, we would like to ask that
              John's privacy, and that of our family, is respected as John continues
              his treatment in hospital."</p>
