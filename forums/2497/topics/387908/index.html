              <p><strong>Sol Campbell will complete a shock £20,000-a-week return to Arsenal in the next few days. The 35-year-old defender has been training with Arsene Wenger’s side since walking out on Notts County in September after one game. He will sign for them on a free transfer until the end of the season.</strong></p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Campbell played the first half of the Gunners’ reserves game against West Ham at Upton Park on Tuesday night and has been pencilled in for the FA Cup fourth-round tie against Stoke City on January 24.</p>
              </div>
              <p>After his side’s 4-2 win Campbell said. ‘I felt fine - 45 minutes was enough after four months out.'</p>
              <p>Earlier he had talked about his excitement at getting the opportunity of returning to play for Arsenal.</p>
              <p>‘I cannot tell you how much I’ve missed playing after being out so long since leaving Notts County,’ he told ESPN. ‘There are still a few technicalities to be ironed out but I am signing until the end of the season, and it’s fantastic, great, marvellous.</p>

              <p><strong>‘I’m ecstatic to be back at Arsenal and I have worked bloody hard to get there. Arsene Wenger has been an inspiration.</strong></p>
              <p>‘He has watched me closely after letting me train at Arsenal for nearly two months. He’s not stupid - he wouldn’t have taken me back if he didn’t like what he has seen.</p>
              <p>‘I’ve missed it and I’ve a gut feeling this is the right move. It’s no longer a hunger to get back - it’s turned into a craving. I’m raring to go.’</p>
              <p>Wenger has been prompted to re-sign Campbell, who last played for Arsenal in May 2006, owing to concerns over the fitness of William Gallas.</p>

              <p>sol gamble is a free man and very smart man. the reason why he always run down his contract is because he want to get a higher salary. if i am not wrong, arsenal pay sol gamble extra if he is free man( FOC). what why spurs are angry for letting him go for getting nothing back, he refuse to sign new contract.</p>

              <p><br>You serious? The club that groom him offers him a contract and he didn't want to sign and run out his contract instead and joint their most dislike rival for more money... And he did the same with the gunners too years later... Wenger offered him a one yr deal and he didn't want stating he wanted to try himself overseas then ended up signing for Portsmouth to the surprise of Wenger...</p>
              <p>There is nothing to be lauded and praised by what he did... If anything, I thought he was rather greedy... But he was only looking out for himself, so its his right. Nevertheless, greedy and self serving still. Its really big of Wenger to help him after he left County and without a club to train and keep fit.</p>
              <p>Wenger himself has his own agenda to stay at Arsenal... Cos its like a gold rice bowl for him... They won't sack him cos they are not expecting him to win at all cost. And he gets to experiment with what he wants to do... Build a fancy side with kids that could win the title... </p>
