Quite apparently you've missed the whole point of this thread. I think you should know that there are some people who are neither pro-Chelsea nor anti-Chelsea like myself.<br><br>However, it is bl00dy irritating to see you and your clones posting all your hate and anti messges when you simply have no real nor objective knowledge of soccer.<br><br>Moreover, people like you spend more time and effort hating the club you dislike rather than your own favourite club which is downright stupid.<br><br>To even create a nickname just to show how much you hate a certain club says a lot about the kind of soccer fan you are.<br><br>The issue was never really about which club you supported or not in the first place. But rather, the amount of effort you spend in hating another club just for the sake of it. And the dumb thing is these clones don't even know what they hate and make comments and 'observations' that make a total mockery of football.<br><br>You have every right to support your own favourite club, but it's a different thing to blatantly disregard facts, blindly hate another team and prove to the world how much of an idiot you are when it comes to soccer. Really, all those clones should shut up, because they make soccer fans look bad. Then again, these clones probably aren't real fans to begin with.<br><br>Coming back to your post again though, could I ask you, are there any anti-Chelsea fans who spend more time and effort making hate posts about Chelsea than about their own teams? To the point that they create clones just to support their own feeble comments about Chelsea? And even create nicks just to diss another club? So is it really a case of pot calling kettle black? Ask yourself these questions before you start blindly pointing your fingers around and saying the wrong things again.</div>

But sometimes I just post specific things only for those few clones by that one pro-Chelsea fan, especially when he is so blindly supporting his own club and conveniently leaving out things about his own favourite club. I don't think you should claim I am anti-Chelsea just because I attempt to give him a balanced viewpoint and remind him his team isn't as unfallable as he says it is.<br><br>For eg, the same guy makes a thread about how Rooney is the only one singled out for blame in England's poor performance, when the news has clearly been talking about Lampard and his role in midfield with Gerrard. Even the other forumites here have been talking about the Lampard Gerrard partnership debate as well. So by pointing out to him what the media and other forumites are talking about then I am anti-Chelsea? Weird......<br><br>And similarly, when I posted vids to that same Chelsea fan showing him that his own players dived as well, I get a whole reply with posts of Man U players diving when I am not even a Man U fan. My point exactly was that diving wasn't unique to one club, and it even included Chelsea players. A fact that the clone master clearly missed. Also, it seems that person was obsessed with Man U players or something.</div>

Something which you have conveniently ignored, or forgotten. I do admit that some of my posts on Chelsea were specifically directed at the clone master. Not exactly with other people in mind, so for someone to take it so personal upon himself like I were talking about him is it an admission of guilt? I wonder.<br><br>I'm not anti-Chelsea, it's just that a particular pro-Chelsea clone master is extremely annoying.</div>

I never really used to discuss soccer online or even read other people's views. But been wanting to find out more of other people's views instead of my regular friends and TNP, so started venturing a bit.<br><br>But it was an eyesore to see all those nonsensical posts by the same person under different nicks. And apparently, that same person is now getting irritated by how I am mentioning it in the open. One thing though, it's a known fact about him and his clones whether or not anyone mentions it openky. His reaction does say a lot about him though.<br><br>What a joke.....</div>

Besides, you really are cloning.<br><br>You and cloning is already known around sgforums. It's just a matter of whether people talk about it.<br><br>Rather than keep posting rubbish under different nicks, how about actually learning more about soccer and use your head to think before you post and make a fool of yourself. Rubbish by many different nicks still makes it rubbish. The rubbish is just multiplied, that's all.</div>
