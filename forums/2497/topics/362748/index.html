              <h1>Kaka decision set to be made on Monday</h1>
              <p><br> <img src="http://fourfourtwo.com/contentimages/news/Kaka35.jpg" alt="Kaka35" align="right"> </p>
              <p><strong>ROME
              - A decision on the future of AC Milan playmaker Kaka will be taken on
              Monday, club owner Silvio Berlusconi said on Wednesday.</strong></p>
              <p>Real Madrid and Chelsea, now
              coached by former Milan boss Carlo Ancelotti, have both been linked in
              the media with world record deals for the 27-year-old Brazilian.</p>
              <p>"I will talk with Kaka next
              Monday and on Monday I will be able to reveal the decision," he told
              the recording of an Italian television programme.</p>
              <p>"It is early to think about what happens next."</p>
              <p>Chelsea denied on Wednesday
              they had made an offer for the player, which Sky Sports News reported
              as a bid of 73.5 million pounds.</p>
              <p>"We have never made an offer to
              AC Milan for Kaka and therefore not one of this extraordinary level,"
              the Premier League club said in a statement on their website. <br> <br> "As a consequence we have not discussed a salary with the player either. Any reports to the contrary are untrue."</p>
              <p>Italian prime minister Berlusconi compared the situation to the sale of Ukraine striker Andriy Shevchenko to Chelsea in 2006.</p>
              <p>"I can only say that we were very attached to Sheva," he said.</p>
              <p>"When an offer arrived that we
              could not equal, because I had a great friendship with him, I did all I
              could to convince him but in the end I left it up to him.</p>
              <p>"It is always our lads who must decide where they want to play. Now we will see."</p>
              <p>Kaka, the 2007 world player of
              the year, almost joined Manchester City in January for a world record
              fee in excess of 100 million euro. However, he opted to stay at the San
              Siro despite Milan sanctioning the move.</p>
              <p>Berlusconi has said it will
              again be difficult to hold onto the player given the amount of money
              involved but Kaka reiterated on Monday that he wanted to stay with
              Milan, who finished third in Serie A this term.</p>
              <p>Milan chief executive Adriano
              Galliani, who said economic factors were hurting the club when he
              unveiled new coach Leonardo on Monday, fuelled the transfer rumours on
              Tuesday when he was spotted in Madrid.</p>
              <p>The Rossoneri said he was
              solely there as a guest for the re-election dinner of Real president
              Florentino Perez, who has long courted Kaka.</p>
              <p>A sprinkling of Milan fans protested against the sale of Kaka outside the club's city centre offices on Wednesday.</p>

              Milan general manager Adriano Galliani insists Real Madrid are the only
              side in the running for Kaka, who has also been linked with Chelsea.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Galliani admits the
              Rossoneri may be forced into a sale for economical reasons, but insists
              an agreement will only be reached with Real - not Chelsea.</p>
              <p>"Ricky didn't want to go to Manchester City (in January),
              instead he wanted to go to Madrid," Galliani told Gazzetta dello Sport.</p>
              <p>"An agreement with Chelsea could not exist. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kaka goes to Real
              or he remains at Milan</span>. That is his will and we are doing everything in
              complete agreement."</p>
              <p>He added: "Negotiations (with Real) do exist, but an agreement is not done.</p>
              <p>"Kaka has behaved very professionally with us, he has never asked for his deal to be revised or his contract extended.</p>
              <p>"He has been here six years and won everything there is to win.
              But <span style="color: #ff0000;">we can't afford to miss out on 70million euros</span> (Â£60.8million). The
              motivation behind Kaka's sale would be economical."</p>
