              clear he wanted to go back to Spain, the Gunners have managed to hold 
              onto their man...for now. Prepare yourself for another instalment next 
              year. Yawn. <br><br><img style="float: left; margin: 5px;" src="http://u.goal.com/35000/35026_thumb.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="80"><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>9) Ricardo Quaresma<br>Porto - Inter (2008) </strong></span><br><br><br><br>Having
               fallen out with Frank Rijkaard, Quaresma rebuilt his reputation at 
              Porto when Jose Mourinho came calling in 2008. Inter's then new manager 
              was shot down by his president Massimo Moratti, who said: "We don't need
               Quaresma". It didn't help that Porto were looking for silly money for 
              the winger, believed to be around €40m. Mourinho played hard ball with 
              his old club and urged Moratti to get out his cheque book before a deal 
              was finally done for a fee of €18.6m, with young Inter player Pele 
              moving in the opposite direction. <br><br>Inter fans were left wondering
               what all the fuss was about as Quaresma failed to make an impression at
               the San Siro. Went on loan to Chelsea, where he flopped, and has since 
              moved to Besiktas.<br><br><img style="float: left; margin: 5px;" src="http://u.goal.com/100700/100795_thumb.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="80"><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>8) David Villa<br>Valencia - Various (2008, 2009)</strong></span><br><br><br><br>Along
               with the old chestnut of retired genius Zinedine Zidane moving to the 
              MLS despite hanging up his boots in 2006, the prospect of Villa leaving 
              the Mestalla has been mooted heavily for at least the past two years.<br><br>Linked
               with Chelsea as long as three years ago, Villa was rumoured to be on 
              the way to Manchester United and latterly Manchester City for £40m since
               then. Chelsea were best placed and offered Villa a salary of £10m a 
              year, but the player was always keen to remain in Spain. <br><br>"I do not close the door to either Real Madrid or Barcelona.<br><br>"I
               am 27 years old and I do not know what will happen in my future. I have
               a contract with Valencia until I'm 32, but nobody knows what the future
               holds," he said in December 2009. <br><br>Villa joined Barcelona for €40m prior to Spain's victory in the World Cup. <br><br><img style="float: left; margin: 5px;" src="http://u.goal.com/43800/43857_thumb.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="80"><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>7) Franck Ribery<br>Bayern Munich - Real Madrid (2009)</strong></span><br><br><br><br>Seemingly
               intent on buying every single attacking player in the world, Real 
              Madrid set their sights on Bayern Munich playmaker Franck Ribery last 
              summer. Endorsed by Zinedine Zidane, the Frenchman was tipped to follow 
              in the footsteps of Kaka and Ronaldo by moving to the Bernabeu. <br><br>Desperate to leave the Allianz, Ribery told <em>L'Equipe</em>:
               "I have made up my mind, I want to leave. It will be Real or nothing." 
              It was claimed a deal was done for Ribery to do one more season - a la 
              Ronaldo - and join in 2010. He won't be going anywhere until at least 
              2015, having signed a new contract with his current club last May. <br><br><img style="float: left; margin: 5px;" src="http://u.goal.com/40100/40184_thumb.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="80"><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>6) Alfredo di Stefano<br>Barcelona - Real Madrid (1953)</strong></span><br><br><br><br>Madrid
               legend Di Stefano initially moved to Spain to play for Barcelona after 
              his Colombian club Millionarios accepted an offer from the Catalans. The
               Argentinian played a few friendly games for Barca but things got spicy 
              when Real Madrid wanted the player too and offered money to Millionarios
               to get him. A lengthy saga ensued, forcing the Spanish football 
              authorities to get involved before the player made the move from 
              Barcelona to Real Madrid in time for the new season. Read more about 
              this controversial transfer in the top 10 transfers that never were. <br><br><img style="float: left; margin: 5px;" src="http://u.goal.com/55000/55037_thumb.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="80"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><br>5) Dani Alves <br>Sevilla - Chelsea (2007) </strong></span><br><br><br><br>Chelsea
               fans awoke to news in August 2007 that the Blues had signed Alves for 
              €30m. Turned out it didn't happen, as Sevilla turned down two bids for 
              their star full-back who made his feelings perfectly clear. <br><br>"I 
              want to continue growing as a player and if that has to be somewhere 
              else, then it will be somewhere else," Alves said at the time. <br><br>He
               was dismayed at being told he would have to remain at Sevilla and fell 
              out with the club's president as his form suffered. Coach Juande Ramos 
              was happy with the news but then jumped ship himself to London to coach 
              Tottenham a few months into the season. Alves moved to Barcelona in 2008
               but has recently been linked with a transfer to Manchester City. <br><br><img style="float: left; margin: 5px;" src="http://u.goal.com/105800/105806_thumb.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="80"><strong><br><span style="font-size: medium;">4) Patrick Vieira <br>Arsenal - Real Madrid (2002,2003,2004)</span></strong><br><br><br><br>Much
               like picking up your tennis racket for two weeks during Wimbledon, the 
              Vieira to Real Madrid story became an annual summer event. After getting
               shot of Vieira's French team-mate Claude Makelele to Chelsea, the 
              Spanish outfit were desperate for some steel to add to their superstar 
              line-up. In 2004 the deal finally looked like being done, with Arsenal 
              accepting a £30m fee for their captain. Vieira pulled out at the last 
              minute after it emerged he wouldn't be on a Galactico level salary. 
              Eventually left a year later for Juventus.<br><br><img style="float: left; margin: 5px;" src="http://u.goal.com/92800/92809_thumb.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="80"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><br>3) Rafael van der Vaart<br>Hamburg - Valencia (2007) </strong></span><br><br><br><br>So
               confident was the Dutchman of joining Valencia that he was pictured 
              holding the club shirt back in 2007. Hamburg weren't willing to let him 
              go for the €14m offered and the player went out of his way to make the 
              move happen. Van der Vaart pulled out of a European game for the German 
              club claiming he had hurt himself - lifting his one-year-old son - so he
               wouldn't be cup-tied. The sage was dubbed 'Van der Farce' by the German
               press and the final straw was when the player invited journalists to 
              his house to talk about his dream move so his Spanish grandparents could
               see him play in La Liga. <br><br>Hamburg remained firm and the player 
              was forced to stick it out for another year before joining Real Madrid. 
              Apparently Van der Vaart's Hamburg team-mates gave him a Christmas 
              present of a Valencia shirt with the name van der Verrat on it. Verrat 
              being the German word for betrayal. <br><br><img style="float: left; margin: 5px;" src="http://u.goal.com/92700/92735_thumb.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="80"><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>2) John Obi Mikel<br>Lyn Oslo/Manchester United - Chelsea (2006) </strong></span><br><br><br><br>A
               controversial transfer involving agents, strange TV interviews, death 
              threats and the eventual payment of millions to a club which Mikel never
               kicked a ball for. <br><br>The player had been identified by Manchester
               United in 2003 after starring in the FIFA U-17 World Youth 
              Championships. He joined Norwegian side Lyn Oslo to enable him to get a 
              work permit and was announced as a Manchester United player shortly afer
               his 18th birthday. Mikel wore a United shirt in the press conference, 
              saying he was delighted to be joining the club. <br><br>Chelsea then 
              intervened, claiming they had a deal with the player. In the meantime 
              Mikel was the target of death threats in his native Nigeria and 
              disappeared when he was meant to play a match for Lyn. He showed up in 
              London and gave an interview saying he had been pressured into signing 
              for United and wanted join Chelsea instead. <br><br>FIFA were forced to 
              get involved and the transfer looked to be going down the legal route. 
              Chelsea avoided this by paying Manchester United £12m and Lyn £4m to 
              settle the saga. Former Lyn director Morgan Andersen was convicted of 
              fraud for his part in the long running transfer. <br><br><img style="float: left; margin: 5px;" src="http://u.goal.com/94800/94803_thumb.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="80"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><br>1) Cristiano Ronaldo<br>Manchester United - Real Madrid (2008,2009) </strong></span><br><br><br><br>This
               one was always going to happen once Ronaldo put himself in the Madrid 
              shop window after a stunning 2007-08 season when he scored 42 goals. 
              Desperate to join Los Blancos, the player, who was earning £120,000 a 
              week with Manchester United, compared himself to a modern day slave when
               the Red Devils dug their heels in and insisted he give them one more 
              season. The saga dominated the summer of 2008 until Ronaldo agreed to 
              stay with the Red Devils for another campaign. The media went into 
              collective mourning when Ronaldo joined Madrid early the following 
              summer, ensuring there was no repeat of the previous year's saga. <br></span></p>
