              <h2><img src="http://dynimg.rte.ie/0001abcd10dr.jpg" alt="" width="269" height="202"></h2>
              <h2>Arsenal defender Mikael Silvestre has admitted he believes the
              current crop of youngsters at the Emirates is better than the side
              produced by Manchester United in the 1990s which dominated the Premier
              League.</h2>
              <p>The Frenchman, who swapped Old Trafford for the Emirates over the
              summer, has seen at first hand the likes of Jack Wilshere, Carlos Vela,
              Aaron Ramsey Henri Lansbury and Theo Walcott and has admitted they have
              the potential to eclipse that famous United team.</p>
              <p>According to the <em>News of the World</em>, Silvestre said: “Arsenal’s kids can be better than that group at United – but there is a long road ahead for them.”</p>
              <p>Silvestre played alongside the likes of David Beckham, the Neville
              Brothers, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes at Old Trafford winning five
              league titles with the club and admits the youngsters need to keep
              their concentration and consistency if they are to claim silverware
              this season.</p>
              <p>“I just hope they are 100 per cent committed for the whole season.
              It is difficult when they are young to stay focused for such a long
              period,” admitted the defender, “Often in the Premier League you have
              to go down to the last three games to win it. We can’t have any gaps in
              form and consistency is the key.”</p>
              <p>Arsenal’s young guns have already impressed several times this
              season, most notably in the Carling Cup where they thrashed Sheffield
              United 6-0, and Silvestre admitted it was his job to help the players
              mature.</p>
              <p>“There is great potential in the young players at Arsenal,” he
              confessed before continuing, “As an experienced player I need to keep
              everyone on their toes and help them mature. I just hope I am here long
              enough to see titles coming to Arsenal.”</p>
              <p>Ironically it is at the back where Arsenal have suffered in recent
              games, leaking goals from set pieces and their new recruit confessed it
              would take time to put things right.</p>
              <p>“I have played to two games and it’s difficult to get consistency.
              Everyone expects me to guide everyone at the back but I expect my team
              mates to do the same,” admitted the former Red Devil, “At United I
              played a different way with Ferdinand, Vidic, Evra and Gary Neville. We
              played together for a long time and now this is a new beginning.”</p>
              <p>However, despite the occasional problems Silvestre admitted he will
              use his experience to try and help the team. He concluded: “It’s a
              learning curve and I have to push myself because I am not a real
              leader. But at this age, if I don’t try to lead the team it will be a
              waste.”</p>

              <p>no use one lar...this is not a league for kids. Maybe 50 years ago where players were in general more unfit, these team of speedy kids could win trophy. These days, everybody trained and played very hard.</p>
              <p>Speed is no longer an advantage. It is a prerequistie to have in BPL. What else do you need? You need a winning mentality, teamwork, good reading of the game and good football techniques.</p>
