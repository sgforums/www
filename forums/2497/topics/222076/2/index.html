Steven Gerrard tried to be the one-man hero, but not even his Captain Marvel act could rescue anything for Liverpool in this one.<br><br>Jamie Carragher got the nod as Steven Gerrard's emergency central midfield partner, a situation caused by injuries to Xabi Alonso, Mohamed Sissoko and now Bolo Zenden.<br><br>Such was Liverpool's depleted squad that youngster Danny Guthrie was named on the bench, having previously only played in the Carling Cup while Moroccan forward Nabil El Zhar was involved as a substitute for the first time.<br></div>

Pompey got in just a first shot of the night - a 25-yard free-kick from Matt Taylor that flew well wide.<br><br>Gerrard did his best to break the deadlock with an angled 12-yard effort just wide before Luis Garcia sent in a flicked header into the side-netting.<br><br>But it was a frustrating half for Liverpool who never really got close enough to James to have a decent inspection of their former colleague's new haircut.<br><br>After the break, Gerrard continued to provide almost all of Liverpool's attacking threat, and an edge-of-the-box piledriver hit Campbell's elbow and deflected into James' arms. Penalty appeals were waved away by referee Alan Wiley.<br><br>Carragher was booked for tugging back Pedro Mendes before Jermaine Pennant sent Gerrard away on the right, his low cross causing trouble for James who was forced to make two saves in quick succession from Luis Garcia.<br><br>Pompey were getting more adventurous and Taylor saw a 25-yard shot crash into Riise on the edge of the box before Liverpool sent on Robbie Fowler on the hour for Crouch to try to add some variation.<br><br>Gerrard by now was attempting to be everywhere - providing the long balls from the back, breaking up attacks in midfield and trying to get into the box as well.<br><br>Pennant got himself booked after a series of altercations with referee Wiley before Pompey sent on Manuel Fernandes for the injured Mendes.<br><br>Liverpool then gave El Zhar his debut in place of Luis Garcia on 72 minutes.<br><br>With eight minutes left Pompey sent on Kanu for Benjani Mwaruwari, Guthrie making his Liverpool league debut in place of Pennant on 84 minutes.<br><br>Two minutes from time Gerrard hurled himself at a Dirk Kuyt cross in sheer desperation, the ball flashing into the side netting. Referee Wiley booked Noe Pamarot for time wasting and allowed five minutes added time.<br><br>In that spell Campbell had to go off with a split boot and, as Pompey staff searched for a replacement they were on the brink of sending on Andy O'Brien before a spare boot was found for Campbell. That bout of comedy just about summed up Liverpool's night.<br></div>

However, the assistant's flag had already been raised in what looked a marginal call at best.<br><br>Tomas Rosicky was given a rest, with England starlet Walcott set to inject some pace down the Arsenal right.<br><br>On 63 minutes, the visitors were reduced to 10 men when centre-half Senderos, who had already been booked, received a second yellow card for a clumsy challenge on Boa Morte, just outside the penalty area.<br><br>The Fulham captain was within inches of restoring his side's two-goal advantage - but the free-kick rattled back off the crossbar with Lehmann rooted to the spot.<br><br>Arsenal had to take risks now, and continually left themselves open on the quick counter attack.<br><br>However, the visitors almost snatched an equaliser when Walcott's first-time shot from the edge of the Fulham penalty area struck the outside base of the far post as the Gunners rallied.<br><br>Tempers were close to boiling point in the closing stages, Flamini and McBride both cautioned for their part in a touchline tussle.<br><br>Henry nearly connected with Walcott's low centre, as the Gunners were left to reflect on what might have been as their title dreams faded - a result which no doubt would have been greeted with just as much jubilation a few miles down the Fulham Road.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Man Utd 3-0 Everton: United ring the changes</span></strong><br><br>Much-changed Manchester United took another stuttering step forward in their bid to land the Barclays Premiership title but the manner of their 3-0 win over Everton left lingering question marks over the depth of Sir Alex Ferguson's squad.<br><br>Cristiano Ronaldo put the Red Devils in front before the break, before Patrice Evra, with his first for the club, and John O'Shea netted to maintain a three-point lead over Chelsea.<br><br>But the decisive scoreline could not mask the lacklustre nature of some of United's play and the imbalance in Ferguson's side at the final whistle only emphasised the desperate requirement for striking reinforcements in the January transfer window.<br><br>Fortunately, Ronaldo had identified himself as a man the Toffeemen needed to stick to, skimming one long range effort wide before uncharacteristically ballooning a free-kick so high it almost ended up in the second tier of the East Stand.<br><br>Rooney was not quite the same threat, although he was just off target with one header before Ronaldo finally broke the deadlock.<br><br>In keeping with the contest, it was a single moment of excellence rather than any sustained brilliance which brought the Portugal international his fifth goal of the season.<br><br>Having set up Michael Carrick in the first place, Ronaldo was then on hand when the midfielder's shot cannoned back off Nuno Valente, lashing a first-time effort into the corner of Richard Wright's goal.<br><br>Given his first start of the season because of the Premier League rules that prevented on-loan Tim Howard appearing against his own club, Wright enjoyed better luck when he kept out a Rooney shot that was heading towards the bottom corner just before half-time.<br><br>By then though, Everton should have been level but James Beattie inexplicably failed to control when completely free inside the United box.<br><br>Having been somewhat subdued by his own high standards during the opening period, Rooney was at the centre of everything at the start of the second.<br><br>Rooney's next involvement with a Neville saw him beating the ground in anger at referee Mark Halsey's failure to punish Phil's forceful tackle with a free-kick.<br><br>The 21-year-old was still seething when Evra was booked for bringing down Mikel Arteta and quickly jogged over to offer his thoughts.<br><br>His presence brought an instant reaction from the Everton fans. Rooney's response to the predictable abuse was to turn in their direction and kiss the badge on his red United shirt.<br><br>It duly arrived after 62 minutes when Evra sprang the Everton offside trap, racing onto Rooney's lay-off before drilling his first Red Devils goal through Wright's legs.<br><br>The goal killed Everton off long before O'Shea's audacious flick brought United their third.<br><br>But the sight of Rio Ferdinand limping towards the tunnel after the final whistle, coupled with the knowledge Wes Brown and Evra had finished the game in midfield, will do little to dispel genuine fears about United's ability to keep their noses in front of Chelsea until next spring<br></div>

I like to be first but I am very happy with this situation.'<br><br>The Blues manager described his players as 'heroes' after withstanding constant Bolton pressure in the second half.<br><br>He said: 'In the first half we played amazingly well.<br><br>'I don't remember Bolton even touching our box and the goal in the last few seconds was more than justice.<br><br>'In the second half they put pressure on us and played very well and we defended very well.<br><br>'We had in every player a fighter because we had to fight for every ball. It is difficult to play against them.<br><br>'I think we fought like heroes. We fought to deserve this victory.'<br><br>Opposite number Sam Allardyce bemoaned his side's inability to take their chances and believed the Trotters had performed well enough in the second half to deserve a point.<br><br>'They are very good at it (set pieces) and that's the difference in terms of the result,' Allardyce told Sky Sports.<br><br>'In open play we limited them to shots outside the box. But right on the very stroke of half-time on a corner was very disappointing but I have to praise the players for the way they approached the second half.<br><br>'Unfortunately our finishing has let us down.<br><br>'Certainly on second-half performance I think we deserved a point.'<strong></strong></div>
