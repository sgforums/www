              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Birmingham City</span></abbr> boss Alex McLeish is being tipped to succeed <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Such has been his impact at Birmingham, that one veteran judge believes
              it is not fantasy to suggest he could be a candidate to succeed his
              former mentor <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> when - and if - he eventually heads into retirement.</p>
              <p>Former Old Trafford boss Ron Atkinson told the <em>News of the World</em>: "I have seen a lot of Birmingham games since Alex took over and I have been very impressed with the job he has done.</p>
              <p>"He has brought a stability and substance to the place which hasn't
              always been there. He has gone about the job quietly and efficiently. I
              reckon he will continue to to raise the bar gradually and establish
              them as a solid <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> club without spending vast amounts of money.</p>
              <p>"It is not beyond the realms of possibility that he could be a candidate for the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> job eventually. Sir Alex knows him and would encourage his appointment if he felt he was ready for it.</p>
              <p>"I happen to think there is a dearth of good young British managers in the game and McLeish is one of the outstanding ones.</p>
              <p>"Don't forget, he knows his way around a big club having been at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rangers</span></abbr> so Old Trafford would not faze him."</p>

              <p>There are many people waiting for the job... As long as Fergie is still there, names will pop out every once in a while especially those who are seen to be doing well at the moment... I don't think Fergie have recommended anyone yet but names like Mourinho, Moyes, Bruce, Blanc, Hughes, Keane, O'Neill and many more will continue to come up... All these are a waste of time until we know Fergie is really going to step down. lol</p>

              <p><strong>Guardiola, 38, despite becoming the youngest ever Champions League winning coach in May, could part company with Barcelona at the end of the season as his contract will have expired.</strong></p>
              <p>After claiming a La Liga title, the Champions League, Copa del Rey, Supercopa Espana, UEFA Super Cup and, most recently, the FIFA Club World Cup, Guardiola has still attracted detractors who claim he has achieved this with the team he inherited from predecessor Frank Rijkaard. <br><br>Furthermore, Guardiola is believed to be keen on a move to the Premier League as he admires the freedom that managers in England have over all team affairs. By contrast, Guardiola is restricted by a "technical secretariat", Txiki Begiristain, and is undermined when it comes to transfer window acquisitions. <br><br>The decision to appoint directors of football in England is one still met with derision.<br><br>However, Barcelona supremo Joan Laporta is eager to tie Guardiola down to an extended deal, with a two-year contract allegedly to be offered to the coach - although much depends on the upcoming presidential elections, and who will succeed Laporta.</p>

              <p><strong>There are rumours in Spain that Guardiola could leave the Nou Camp as early as April to work under Ferguson at Old Trafford before eventually taking the reins when the 67-year-old Scot retires.</strong></p>
              <p>The leaks could be seen as an attempt to clinch a favourable new deal at Barca, but it is thought that the 38-year-old has a long-term ambition to manage in England and also admires Chelsea.</p>
              <p>It is understood that he admires the power that managers like Ferguson get over all matters of the club in the Barclays Premier League.</p>
              <p>In contrast, Guardiola works with a technical secretariat at Barca, headed by Txiki Begiristain, who is in charge of player recruitment and strategy.</p>
              <p>The model is common in Spain, Italy and other European leagues, though in England there has been resistance to director-of-football-style roles.</p>
