              <h1>Real Madrid Moot Lassana To Replace Mahamadou</h1>
              <h2>Lassana Diarra has been lined up by Madrid to replace their forlorn star Mahamadou Diarra in a move that would please many supporters that think the Portsmouth star would be the new Claude Makélélé.</h2>
              <p> </p>

              <p><em>Diarra: a former Chelsea and Arsenal defensive midfielder.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Real Madrid are considering trying to tempt Portsmouth into parting with Lassana Diarra as they look for a replacement for his namesake Mahamadou, who has been ruled out for the rest of the season.</strong><br><br>The Spanish giants are keen to dip into the transfer market again in January and bolster their midfield having lost two players for the remainder of the campaign.<br><br>As well as Mahamadou Diarra, Madrid have also been told that Rubén De la Red will not play again this term and that has made signing a new player a priority, according to <em>AS</em>.<br><br>Didier Zokora was reported to be a target in the British press given Juande Ramos' knowledge of the player and it was thought that Tottenham would then move for Lassana Diarra.<br><br>But AS believe that Los Merengues will instead move for the former Chelsea and Arsenal defensive midfielder themselves with a bid lined up in the next few days.<br><br>Lassana Diarra is seen in some quarters at the Bernabéu as the player that the club should sign to bring back the stability that Claude Makélélé gave the team.<br><br>Many felt that selling Makélélé in 2000 was a mistake that Madrid never really compensated for and that they have missed a player of his ilk ever since.<br><br>Portsmouth would demand a huge fee for their 23-year-old midfielder, who stated upon joining the club that he would not be staying should one of Europe's major sides make a move for him.</p>

              <h1>Manchester City &amp; Real Madrid To Battle For Portsmouth's Diarra - Report</h1>
              <h2>Portsmouth's highly-rated French international midfielder Lassana Diarra is attracting the attention of Spanish giants Real Madrid and English money-men Manchester City...</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Manchester City will enter a tug-of-war with Real Madrid for Portsmouth midfielder Lassana Diarra when the January transfer window opens, according to a report in the British tabloid<em>.<br><br></em>It is claimed that the Citizens are prepared to offer £18 million (€20 million) for the French interntational as they look to establish themselves as a major footballing force.<br><br>However, following the injury to Mali international Mahamadou Diarra, it is claimed that Los Blancos are ready to enter the race for his signature as new manager Juande Ramos has recommended the 23-year-old as a replacement.<br><br>Jose Mourinho brought the player to England from French club Le Havre in 2005 and he was widely regarded as Chelsea's successor to Claude Makelele.<br><br>But Diarra became increasingly frustrated at spending life on the subs' bench at Stamford Bridge and in 2007, somewhat surprisingly, he moved across London to Arsenal.<br><br>Again, manager Arsene Wenger was unable to offer regular first-team football and after only half a season he secured a transfer to south-coast club Portsmouth.<br><br>A move away from Fratton Park in January would not come as too much of a surprise as upon his arrival, he was quoted as saying: "The people at Portsmouth know I will not spend my life at the club.<br><br>"If I shine and a really big club wants me, I already know everything will go well."</p>

              <p><strong>Ashley Young is the shock name on Real Madrid's wanted list for the January transfer window. Predrag Mijatovic, the Real sporting director, has identified the </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/aston-villa.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Aston Villa </strong></span></a><strong>striker as the player to reinforce the Spanish champions' attacking threat.</strong>  </p>
              <p>Real have already secured Ajax's Klass-Jan Huntelaar, who will join them next month, after Ruud van Nistelrooy was ruled out for the season.  </p>
              <p>And Real have also targeted Young to join the Dutch international and Madrid legend Raul in their attack.  </p>
              <p>Real trail La Liga leaders Barcelona by 12 points but hope the January recruits can kick-start their season.  </p>
              <p>Real inquired about Lassana Diarra, the Portsmouth midfielder, but were put off by the £20million transfer fee quoted by the south coast club.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Real Madrid's new head coach Juande Ramos is eager to strengthen the La Liga champions by signing Aston Villa winger </strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=31810&amp;cc=4716"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ashley Young</strong></span></a><strong>, according to reports in the Spanish press.</strong></p>
              <p>Madrid based daily <em>Marca</em> claim that Ramos is concerned about the quality of Real's wide men and has identified Young, who the newspaper label as 'the new Beckham', and Inter Milan winger Mancini as the club's top targets.</p>
              <p>Former Tottenham Hotspur boss Ramos was known to be scouting for wingers during his time in at White Hart Lane and with the clout of Real Madrid now behind him he is in the position to sign some of the Premier League's top talent.</p>
              <p>Ramos confirmed that Madrid would be looking for "new signings" during the January transfer window, adding: "I want two players with quality and fighting spirit who get stuck in."</p>
              <p>Villa manager Martin O'Neill described Young as "world class" following the 23-year-old's two goals in the 3-2 victory against Everton last week and the England winger scored again in Saturday's 4-2 win against Bolton Wanderers.</p>
              <p>If a predicted price tag of €30 million proves too expensive for Madrid then Ramos' second option would be Mancini. The Brazilian, who like Young is comfortable playing on both flanks, has struggled to break into Jose Mourinho's first team since his transfer from Roma earlier this summer.</p>
              <p><em>Los Blancos</em> have already a confirmed the signing of Klaas-Jan Huntelaar form Ajax and are also looking to add a defensive midfielder following news that both Mahamadou Diarra and Ruben de la Red will be out of action for the rest of the season.</p>

              <p>Wow £24million for him... A bit over priced already I feel... Biggest winner... Portsmouth. They paid little for him, got his service to win the FA Cup then now sell him away for a handsome profit...</p>

              <p><br>Yeah I also wonder how Wenger could have missed him and not the likes of Diaby, Eboue and <span style="color: #000000;">Denilson... He is better than all of them.</span></p>
              <p>Anyway, its from Chelsea to Arsenal then Portsmouth... Not Arsenal to Chelsea...</p>
              <p>If I am not wrong, Chelsea got him at $1m, sold to Gunners for $3m and they in turn sold him for $5.5m to Pompey...</p>
              <p>Not Pompey can pocket $19m from Real... after giving Arsenal $4.5m...</p>
