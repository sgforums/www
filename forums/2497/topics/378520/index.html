              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> attacker Dirk Kuyt has aggravated an ankle injury while on international duty in Australia.</p>
              <p>The <em>Mail on Sunday</em> says Rafael Benitez will be furious
              after Kuyt came off injured at half-time in yesterday's friendly for
              Holland against Australia.</p>
              <p>Kuyt had missed training all week with an ankle injury yet
              despite that, Holland coach Bert van Marwijk started the game with the
              striker, who will now return to training having exacerbated his injury.</p>
              <p>Worse, the 24-hour return flight is likely to increase the swelling on the ankle.</p>

              <p>It will be good for Ah Ben to dig deep and show his managerial power at this time.</p>
              <p>Time to show case the youth talent that he have bought for the last three years.</p>
              <p>You dun win the title with only 11 capable players.</p>

              <p><br>i do agree with you. Hope to see more youth products come out. Out of the big four, only Arsenal has been more successful with their youth players in recent years.</p>

              <p>liverpool only got torres, gerrard and kuyt that are good players. Other than that all are not exactly good, even if good, they are under used (benayoun, babel, mascherano, agger)</p>
              <p>I dont understand why spend so much money on glen johnson?? He is not worth the money.</p>
              <p>Now with kuyt out, more responsibilities would be on torres and gerrard's shoulder. Gerrard is getting old, and torres is injury prone. Liverpool has already lost 3 games this season. They have yet to face city, united and arsenal. They are bound to drop more points.</p>
              <p>I dont see liverpool winning anything this season. There are definitely too weak this season.</p>

              <p>Btw, Glen is a decent athlete. Do judge him fairly after 1 season has passed (with LFC), before passing any.</p>
              <p>LFC got many good players hor. It's just that they lack game-changing players, like Torres and Gerrard. IMHO, of the current crop, only Benayoun, Johnson, Agger and Kuyt has the 'guts' to mimic the 2 pillars of LFC.

              <p><br>and the midfield is supposed to cover it? btw, it was mascherano who lost the ball, so it's oso not entirely johnson's fault when u expect a gd player like mascherano to actually keep possession when mascherano tried to hold on the ball for too long...</p>

              <p>Spot on, but still it's a team's game. Like why didn't the leftback cover his centerback? Like why didn't he anticipate Drogba curling it towards the backpost, so he can challenge Anelka, and add some pressure.</p>
              <p>As for Kuyt, it's been a long time since he got injured -- not saying he should get injured, touch wood! I'm just saying, maybe it's about time. Should provide him with some rest time before the season stretches further.</p>
