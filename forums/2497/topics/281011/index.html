If you do not keep clean sheets, how can you expect to win games," said the Bolton boss.<br><br>"Because we did not do that part of our game well, it was a struggle. We have an inability to deal with high balls.<br><br>"It would be wrong to name individuals. It is a team game and we all have to defend when we do not have the ball.<br><br>"It is a question of taking responsibility and we are working hard to try to remedy this situation.<br><br>"I feel the players have the passion and commitment needed to turn things around and improve our situation."<br><br><strong>Meanwhile</strong> Bolton's head of sports science and medicine, Richard Freeman, has explained why they declined to use the showers in the visiting Rabotnicki dressing room.<br><br>Instead the players returned to their hotel nearby before catching a late flight from Skopje to Manchester.<br><br>Freeman said the dressing room was not equipped to handle the ice baths for the players.<br><br>"It was agreed with the Macedonian officials we would use the hotel for the rehabilitation work the players have to go through immediately after the game," he told the Bolton News.<br><br>"Not being disrespectful, the stadium is not big enough to house the ice baths that are part of our post-match rehab work with the players.<br><br>"It was decided to use the hotel facilities and everyone was happy with that.<br><br>"The Macedonian officials understood our professionalism and our approach to the game and were more than happy with the arrangements.
