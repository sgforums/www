              <p>Rafael Benitez might end up having the last laugh after all as his
              Liverpool side hauled themselves back into the title fight with a
              decisive 4-1 hammering of 10-man Manchester United at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>The
              Merseyside giants battled back from a goal down to defeat the Premier
              League leaders in clinical fashion, Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard
              turning the match on its head before the break, with Fabio Aurelio and
              Andrea Dossena easing Liverpool well clear before the end.</p>
              <p>In
              contrast, it was an day to forget for Nemanja Vidic, who gifted Torres
              the equaliser before being sent off against Liverpool for second time
              this season as Benitez's side reduced United's lead at the top to four
              points, albeit having played a game more.</p>
              <p>It represented Liverpool's biggest win at United since 1936 and could yet trigger an amazing championship revival.</p>
              <p>Liverpool
              were the ones who needed the win and there appeared an extra sharpness
              about them from the start, especially Torres who gave the Red Devils
              defence a torrid time.</p>
              <p>Once Jamie Carragher had recovered his
              composure after being unsettled by a late switch to right-back because
              of Alvaro Arbeloa's late withdrawal, they had the edge in vital areas,
              the hosts no better than their nervy first-half display against Inter
              Milan in midweek.</p>
              <p>Indeed, it was a surprise when United went ahead.</p>
              <p>Pepe
              Reina read Carlos Tevez's through ball for Park Ji-sung well enough but
              came out too quickly for his own good. When the South Korean nicked the
              ball away, the Liverpool keeper could not stop.</p>
              <p>And though Reina pleaded for leniency, referee Alan Wiley correctly pointed to the spot.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo is not the type of player to waste such opportunities and duly dispatched his 17th goal of the season.</p>
              <p>Had
              Sir Alex Ferguson's men been able to hold their advantage for a decent
              length of time, the visitors might have panicked. But five minutes
              later Liverpool were level thanks to a rare mistake from Nemanja Vidic.</p>
              <p>The
              Serbian has been virtually foot perfect this season, so much so that he
              is favourite to win the PFA player of the year award.</p>
              <p>But first
              Vidic let Martin Skrtel's long punt forward bounce when he could have
              headed it back into the Liverpool half quite easily. Then, he failed to
              deal with the loose ball, allowing Torres to nip in and streak clear,
              beating Edwin van der Sar with clinical efficiency.</p>
              <p>Conceding one goal was amazing enough for the Red Devils, yet before half-time Liverpool had scored again.</p>
              <p>Hull
              were the last team to score more than once against United in Premier
              League combat - and that was four-and-a-half months ago.</p>
              <p>But when
              Torres tried to send Gerrard racing into the box and Patrice Evra
              mis-timed his tackle, the Liverpool skipper found he converted his
              penalty with the same confidence Ronaldo had shown earlier.</p>
              <p>Gerrard's
              glee was obvious. And Liverpool's lead was fully deserved, condemning
              Ferguson to his first interval rallying call in league combat at Old
              Trafford all season.</p>
              <p>The Scot injected a greater sense of urgency into his team, even if there was no improvement in their retention of the ball.</p>
              <p>Carrick in particular was having a pretty bad day, twice putting his side in danger with wayward passes.</p>
              <p>United
              at least managed to generate some momentum, with Tevez almost getting
              on the end of a Wayne Rooney knock-back and then rolling a shot on the
              turn just wide.</p>
              <p>Having expressed his `hatred' of Liverpool
              earlier in the week, the last thing Rooney wanted was to suffer an
              immediate defeat and a chance for Gerrard - a long-time friend - to
              gloat.</p>
              <p>Yet as time ticked by, that was the fate Rooney was
              condemned to, especially as Ferguson waited until less than 20 minutes
              remained before he made the introductions of Dimitar Berbatov, Paul
              Scholes and Ryan Giggs.</p>
              <p>It is the kind of strength Benitez does
              not have and one of the major reasons why Liverpool have found
              themselves on the wrong end of a 14-point swing in fortunes since
              United returned from their Club World Cup campaign in Japan just before
              Christmas.</p>
              <p>What Liverpool have managed to do this season is beat
              Chelsea and United, against both of whom they have now registered
              'doubles'.</p>
              <p>Any hope United had, evaporated within a minute of
              Ferguson's spectacular triple substitution as another woeful first
              touch, again from Vidic, left the Serbian little alternative other than
              to haul down Gerrard.</p>
              <p>For the second successive game against
              Liverpool, it brought Vidic a red card and he was still making his way
              down the tunnel when Aurelio curled home a superb free-kick.</p>
              <p>And
              Liverpool were not finished as Andrea Dossena lobbed Van der Sar to
              complete a memorable win, whose significance remains unknown.</p>
