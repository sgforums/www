              <h3>WAYNE ROONEY had a series of romps with a £1,200-a-time hooker when wife Coleen was pregnant, we can reveal today. </h3>
              <div class="inline-image-right-280">
              <div class="caption">Last night she told us: "Wayne chased me with sex texts and paid in wads of cash. He didn't seem to care he was betraying Coleen."</div>
              <div class="caption"> </div>
              </div>
              <p>The Cheating England ace begged Jenny, 21, and her pretty friend to fulfil his fantasy with a sordid THREESOME. </p>
              <p>Then he summoned the vice girl back again and again - while trusting wife Coleen was expecting their son Kai.</p>
              <p>Last night Jenny, 21, exclusively told the News of the World: "Wayne certainly enjoyed all our meetings and didn't seem to care what he was doing to his wife. </p>
              <p>"I think he believes he's invincible and untouchable. As a woman, I wouldn't like that done to me - especially if I was pregnant."</p>
              <p>In an interview that will shatter Rooney's carefully-nurtured family man image - which has helped earn the celebrity couple millions - Jenny revealed how the Manchester United star took astonishing risks as he:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>BEDDED her at Manchester's top five-star hotel, a favourite with celebs and team-mates. </li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>BEGGED her to join him on TOUR with the Premier League side. </li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>FIXED for a pal to pay her cash when he ran short of readies. </li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>ROMPED with her at a team party. </li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jenny told how she first met Rooney, 24, in June last year at the Manchester 235 Casino where he was drinking with relatives and team-mate Rio Ferdinand. </p>
              <p>"I was at the bar in the VIP area with another escort girl and they called us over for a chat," she said. </p>
              <p>"We went for a smoke in the toilets with Wayne and his brother and exchanged phone numbers. At that point Wayne didn't know what sort of work I did." </p>
              <p>But the star quickly made it plain what he was after. "He told me to meet him in a quiet corner of the casino and we had had a kiss for about three or four minutes," said Jenny.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="inline-image-right-280"><img title="SAFE BET: 235 casino where they met" src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00147/rooney1_03_0509_147626a.jpg" alt="SAFE BET: 235 casino where they met">
              <div class="caption">SAFE BET: 235 casino where they met</div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>"It was about 3am when my friend and I left and I started getting texts from Wayne as he was going home. He said, 'Do you fancy meeting up?'</strong> </p>
              <p>"I said yes but told him it wouldn't be for free. He texted back saying, 'Fine, that's not a problem.' Then he asked if my friend would like to join us and she agreed." </p>
              <p>A week later Rooney met the girls at the famed five-star Lowry hotel. "My friend and I made an effort," said Jenny. </p>
              <p>"We both wore identical black lacy bra-and-brief sets specially bought from La Senza. </p>
              <p>"Wayne told us he'd never had a threesome before. He was shy and awkward - and me and my friend were left to do all the work.</p>
              <p>"He didn't want us to put on a lesbian sex show, he was more into two girls pleasuring him at the same time. But it was all over far too quickly." </p>
              <p>"I asked Wayne if he'd ever been with vice girls before and then, all of a sudden, I remembered he HAD!</p>
              <p>"I told him, 'I remember reading in the newspapers about you and the old granny!' Wayne just laughed. He thought that was really funny." </p>
              <p>Rooney's earlier brush with scandal came in 2004 when he confessed to visiting a seedy massage parlour in a rundown area of Liverpool for £45-a-time sex, including a romp with a 48-year-old grandmother nicknamed Auld Slapper - the first time he was caught cheating on devastated childhood sweetheart Coleen. </p>
              <p>Since then Rooney, who played for England on Friday night at Wembley, has crafted a brand of happy family life that's helped win big-money sponsorships and endorsements. </p>
              <p>But the tawdry truth is just a year ago he was at it again. </p>
              <p>After the threesome the second vice girl stayed out of the arrangement but Rooney kept up his liaisons with Jenny. It was two weeks later the pair met again at the Lowry.</p>
              <p>Jenny, who normally charges between £150 and £200 an hour, headed straight to the star's room on the third floor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="inline-image-516"><img title="PLAYS LONG: They romped repeatedly in bed and on chaise longue at Lowry Hotel" src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00147/rooney1_516_0509_147627a.jpg" alt="PLAYS LONG: They romped repeatedly in bed and on chaise longue at Lowry Hotel">
              <div class="caption"><em>PLAYS LONG: They romped repeatedly in bed and on chaise longue at Lowry Hotel</em></div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>"It was about 11am," she said. "The door was off the latch and I just walked in. "He was on the bed, in his bathrobe with nothing underneath, ready for it. There was an iPod and a few clothes lying around. We went straight into it. It lasted for about half an hour."</strong> </p>
              <p>Jenny also had sex with Rooney on a chaise longue next to the bed. "I did most of the work, and he was saying nice things about my body," she added. "He was trying to be filthy but he couldn't quite do it. He's quite shy. Five minutes after sex he said he wanted a smoke and got the guy from the desk downstairs to go and get them. He paid him £200 or something ridiculous like that for a packet of Marlboro.</p>
              <p>"We were chatting but he didn't mention anything about Coleen and I didn't bring it up. The money was in his jeans pockets. He counted it and handed £1,200 to me in twenties and fifties. He said he'd enjoyed it and we'd have to meet up again. </p>
              <p>"I never imagined Wayne Rooney would ever be one of my clients. I know a lot of people call him Shrek but he's actually not that ugly when you're sat in front of him."</p>
              <p>Jenny said most of their meetings followed the same pattern. "Wayne had a few different mobile phones to contact me, all pay-as-you-go throw-aways," she added. "Wayne was actually quite boring in bed. We always had sex with a condom. I'd stay about 45 minutes with him in his hotel room.</p>
              <p>"Then he'd pass me the money, the correct amount, all counted out, sometimes in an envelope, sometimes just a bundle. When he didn't have the money with him I'd pick it up later from a pal of his who worked in a designer clothes shop." </p>
              <p>One night Jenny and her star punter met up again at the 235 Casino. Again they went to the toilets but this time it was business. "It wasn't full sex," said Jenny. </p>
              <p>"It was me on him. I was in there for about 15 minutes. He was a bit drunk. He gave me a £1,000 gambling chip. I lost about £500 but took the rest home." </p>
              <p>The next time Jenny saw Rooney was at a party in Rio Ferdinand's Rosso Italian restaurant. </p>
              <p>"I went with a few girls and the whole team were there," recalled Jenny. "They were all very drunk. </p>
              <p>"We hadn't arranged to meet but Wayne spotted me int the crowd. About half hour later he held my hand in front of everyone and led me away down these stairs.</p>
              <p>Michael Owen was looking at him in disgust. Wayne made no effort to be discreet and I was embarrassed. </p>
              <p>"Wayne took me downstairs into the cooking area and into an office. Again we didn't have full sex, I pleasured him. He couldn't say much because he was so drunk. He was sat on a chair. </p>
              <p>"We were only down there for about 10 to 15 minutes. A few days later he texted saying he'd left some money at the clothes shop. </p>
              <p>"I wasn't really that concerned but there was about £600 in an envelope marked 'Jenny'."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Wayne Rooney's marriage was under intense pressure last night after it was revealed that he had a series of encounters with a prostitute while his wife was pregnant.</strong></p>
              <p>The Manchester United and England star, widely criticised during the World Cup for a series of lacklustre performances, broke the news to a 'devastated' Coleen yesterday afternoon.</p>
              <p>They married two years ago, after six years of dating, becoming one of football's highest-profile couples. But last night there were fears that their union is unlikely to survive the new revelations.</p>
              <p>Rooney, 24, reportedly slept with 21-year-old Jennifer Thompson, who charges £1,200 a night, seven times in four months. They had sex in one of Manchester's most exclusive hotels, and visited nightclubs and casinos together.</p>
              <p>In 2004 it was reported that he had visited brothels in Liverpool as a 16-year-old and admitted to paying for sex with a 48-year-old grandmother. Writing of this period in her autobiography, Coleen said: 'I was so upset, my head was all over the place. The truth is, and I've never said this before, at that time in our relationship I'd never even slept with Wayne.'</p>
              <p>The latest disclosures will prompt speculation that the striker's chaotic private life affected his form at this summer's World Cup in South Africa. Until late last month, he had not scored a goal for club or country since March.</p>
              <p>Last night, Miss Thompson, from Bolton, was reported as saying: She first met Rooney in June last year at the Manchester 235 Casino, five months before Coleen gave birth to the footballer's son Kai. Rooney was there drinking with relatives and United teammate Rio Ferdinand.</p>
              <p>He called her over to the VIP area and, she says, they ended up kissing in a corner. Later, at 3am, he texted her to ask if they could meet up. She told him he would have to pay. He responded: 'That's not a problem.'</p>
              <p>He then invited her friend, who he had also met in the club, to join them, it is alleged. They met a week later at the five-star Lowry hotel in Salford, Greater Manchester. She said: 'Wayne told us he'd never had a threesome before. He was shy and awkward.</p>
              <p>'I asked Wayne if he'd ever been with vice girls before. Then I remembered he had. I told him I remembered reading about him and the granny, but he just laughed it off.'</p>
              <p>She says they met many times, although from then on it was only the two of them. At each meeting he would pull out a 'wad of notes' from his pocket and hand her £1,200 in twenties and fifties. Miss Thompson said: 'Wayne had a few different mobile phones to contact me, all pay-as-you-go throwaways.'</p>
              <p>On another occasion, she ran into him at a party at Rio Ferdinand's Rosso Italian restaurant. 'I went with a few girls and the whole team was there. They were all very drunk,' she said. 'We hadn't arranged to meet but Wayne spotted me in the crowd. About half an hour later he held my hand in front of everyone and led me away down these stairs.</p>
              <p>'Michael Owen was looking at him in disgust. Wayne made no effort to be discreet and I was embarrassed. He took me downstairs into the cooking area and into an office.'</p>
              <p>Rooney, 24, was so careless in his pursuit of extra-marital sex he actually asked Jenny to join him on a Manchester United tour.</p>
              <p>"He was texting me pleading for me to join him," she revealed. "He was saying that I should get a flight and stay at the hotel. He said if I paid for the flight he'd give me the money when I got there. I thought it was too risky going there, in a hotel with the rest of the team.</p>
              <p>"I was surprised he suggested it. I said I couldn't make it. He said he'd see me when he got back." "But Wayne never really spoke about football other than to mention that he'd been training.</p>
              <p>Once his son Kai was born, Rooney stopped using Jenny's services. But he was well aware of the risks he'd been running.</p>

              <p><strong>Miss Thompson posted provocative pictures of herself in a bikini on the internet and wrote about how she was desperate to become a glamour model. In the profiles, 'Juicy Jeni' described herself as a party girl who often frequents hip bars in Leeds and Manchester popular with footballers. Alongside such information as that she 'always drinks in style on a Saturday night,' she lists her religion as Catholic.</strong></p>
              <p>She added: 'You can either love me or hate me! Don't really care what people think. I'm young free and single and loving life.</p>

              <h3>THIS is the moment soccer star Jermain Defoe was caught with a young woman performing a sex act on him in a car as children played nearby. </h3>
              <p>Back in April, the Spurs and England striker - who has boasted of being "the best role model I can" - risks jail after his obscene behaviour with the 20-year-old in a public street.</p>
              <p>The photographer said: "Defoe was completely brazen. It was obvious what was going on." The player, who was recently linked to 22-year-old model Roxy Townsend, went straight to a blue Toyota RAV4 parked just 50 yards away.</p>
              <p>Once inside he motioned to the red-head to drive to a nearby cul-de-sac of luxury homes where she again parked. With a gaggle of children aged around seven or eight playing 100 yards away, the couple climbed into the back of the car.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="inline-image-right-280"><img id="mainpic" src="http://images.football365.com/10/09/Others/441684.jpg" alt="Capello Claims Credit For Revitalising Rampant Rooney " width="224" height="193"></div>
              <p><em>England's best partnership?</em>  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The photographer said: "It was still light and anyone passing could see what they were up to. They chatted for only a few minutes before the girl disappeared from view.</strong> </p>
              <p>"You could then see her head move up and down. It was clear what they were doing and clear the girl had come to meet him for only one purpose. He looked like he was enjoying himself." </p>
              <p>While the sex act was being performed, two individuals and a family walked past the car. By the time Defoe and the girl, who we are not naming, were snapped it was 8.35pm and dark but the car was close to a street light. The shocked girl at first tried to hide in the footwell of the rear passenger seat while Defoe shielded his eyes.</p>
              <p>Our witness went on: "It was only when they were rumbled that they stopped what they were doing and broke off.</p>
              <p>"Defoe got out and casually walked home as if nothing had happened. The girl sat in the car for five more minutes before she drove off looking quite upset." </p>
              <p>Neighbours were shocked that the £60,000-a-week star could behave so disgustingly in such a public spot. One young mum, whose house is near where the car was parked, said the footballer was known for cruising around looking for girls.</p>
              <p>She said: "This is disgraceful. He's got a reputation around here for picking up girls but you don't expect this type of behaviour on your own doorstep." </p>
              <p>And an elderly neighbour said: "What they do with girls is up to them but they should do it in the privacy of their homes." </p>
              <p>Defoe could still face police action over the incident for outraging public decency. The offence carries a maximum six months' jail or a £5,000 fine. </p>
              <p>By law no one needs to actually see the act being committed but two or more people must be "capable" of seeing it. It was only in February that Defoe said: "Footballers have to be aware they are role models for kids. I want to be the best role model I can." He has dated a string of celeb beauties including Danielle Lloyd.</p>

              <p><strong>Fabio Capello watched his England side race off to a perfect start in the European Championship qualifiers with a 4-0 victory against Bulgaria and then revealed how he had rejuvenated Wayne Rooney.</strong></p>
              <p>The Manchester United striker, who has been struggling for his best form ever since his disappointment at the World Cup, made a vital contribution in all four goals as Jermain Defoe netted a hat-trick and Adam Johnson scored his first for his country.</p>
              <p>Capello put it down to the new, freer role he had handed Rooney.</p>
              <p>The England manager said: "I played Rooney in a position different than usual. He did very well. I spoke with him before the game.</p>
              <p>"He had to stay just in front of the two central midfielders and from this position to go forward and to be free. The quality of Rooney was really high."</p>
              <p>Capello also hailed the finishing of Defoe, whose goals, the first coming after just three minutes, helped heal some of the scars of England's shambolic World Cup defeat against Germany in South Africa.</p>
              <p>Capello said: "Defoe is always very important for us. He can shoot with his left foot and his right and his performance was really, really good and his movement without the ball was fantastic."</p>
              <p>The victory gets England off to a flying start in their group</p>

              <p>There are some things in life that is very strange... For most men, cheating on your wife isn't the greatest sin... Otherwise, why do lots of them still do it?</p>
              <p>In reality, Some guys probably know their good friend is cheating on their wives or for the younger ones, your good friend is cheating on his GF with another gal... but hey, they won't think too much about it cos it's not their problem... Some may even joke about it when the wife or gf isn't around... But cheating with your best friend's wife... This has to take the cake cos it's something that most men simply cannot take it... It's strange but I think it could be b'cos their is like an invincible line between good friends among guys that is like a brotherhood thing... And doing so seems more unethical.</p>
              <p>For instance, If i know a friend who is cheating on his gf, honestly it's not my business if they are all still happy... But if he cheats with a fellow good friend's gf...  It becomes my business unfortunately cos I would feel sorry for the other good friend of mine and would think a lot lesser of the fellow who didn't consider and broke a brotherhood code.  It's strange, but it's a reality...</p>

              <p>Yeah i find that true too. If you have many girlfriends and all, your friends might call you a flirt jokingly. But once you cheat with a friend's girlfriend then i think they will start to dislike you and might even stay away from you cuz your not safe if you cheat with friends' girlfriend. I guess it normal to side with the victim whose girlfriend is being stolen. What will you actually do? Call and scold the cheater friend?</p>
