              <h1>Manchester City will fulfil their Champions League destiny, promises new signing Roque Santa Cruz</h1>

              <p class="up"> </p>

              <div class="art-o art-align-left"><img src="http://images.mirror.co.uk/upl/m4/jun2009/0/5/roque-santa-cruz-458160431.jpg" border="0" alt="Roque Santa Cruz (Pic:PA)" width="450" height="322"></div>
              <p><strong>Roque Santa Cruz signed up last night to the Eastlands dream - and immediately insisted Manchester City will fulfil their Champions League destiny.</strong></p>
              <p>The Paraguay striker agreed a four-year deal after passing a strenuous medical, to make the £17million switch from Blackburn.</p>
              <p>And after speaking at length to the club's Arab bosses, Santa Cruz insisted that they sold him a vision of the future that he couldn't resist. "The owners want the club to be more successful - they want to break into the top four, and they are passionate about it," he explained.</p>
              <p>"I spoke to the chairman and I know his ambitions are known to everybody at the club - he made sure that I know as well. It was a good conversation. He wants the best for the club and to give something back to the fans.</p>
              <p>"It is an inspiration to join this club. I am very motivated to play for these fans, for the club and for what they want to achieve."</p>
              <p>Santa Cruz admitted he was excited about the prospect of teaming up again with Mark Hughes, who brought him into the Premier League from Bayern Munich two years ago at Blackburn.</p>
              <p>"I'm very happy to have signed for City - it's been close to happening for a while, and now I can just focus on football," he said."I know the kind of football Mark Hughes wants to play. He's a winner, he wants to make things happen and to be successful."</p>
              <p>City boss Hughes said: "It was very important that we signed Roque - it's an area of the squad we have needed to address for some time. His ability in the air and his physical presence are qualities we've been missing, but he also has technical ability and good pace for a big man."</p>
              <p>City are still busy negotiating over Carlos Tevez, and confident of getting him. Talks are also progressing over a move for Samuel Eto'o, but he is still in talks over a new deal at Barcelona and could yet decide to stay at the Nou Camp.</p>
              <p>Manager Mark Hughes is hoping to bring in at least another FOUR new faces, and possibly more.</p>
