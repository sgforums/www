              <h3>RAFA BENITEZ is considering his Anfield future as Liverpool chiefs line 
              up a 
              new £100million investment in the club.</h3>
              <p>The Kop boss has reached breaking point and accepts it is now virtually 
              impossible to take the team forward.</p>
              <p>But off the field, the club has lined up a spectacular deal with the 
              Rhone 
              Group - reported to be worth £3billion - to dilute the controversial 
              ownership of Tom Hicks and George Gillett.</p>
              <p>The New York-based private equity firm have begun due diligence with a 
              view to 
              buying around a 40 per cent stake in the club.</p>
              <p>The £100m deal would see controlling interest pass to billionaire 
              financiers 
              Robert Agostinelli and Steven Langman.</p>
              <p>If the deal goes through it would repay the club's Royal Bank of 
              Scotland debt 
              and enable work to begin on the £350m new stadium.</p>
              <p>There would also be considerable investment in the transfer market - 
              although 
              it is unlikely Benitez will be the man to spend it.</p>
              <p>He has reached the stage where he believes it is time to quit Anfield, 
              with 
              Real Madrid a possible destination in the summer.</p>
              <p>That would then allow potential new owners to install their own man at 
              the 
              Liverpool helm.</p>
              <p>Managing director Christian Purslow has been scouring the globe to meet a
               
              summer deadline to repay £100m of a £237m debt to RBS.</p>
              <p>There is still interest from India, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait but the 
              Rhone 
              Group are seen as the most viable proposition in the market.</p>
              <p>Founded by Agostinelli and Langman in 1996, the Rhone Group describes 
              itself 
              as 'one of the world's leading mid-market private equity firms'.</p>
              <p>They specialise in mergers, acquisitions and leveraged buy-outs and have
               
              offices in New York, London and Paris.</p>
              <p>The new Americans would take a controlling interest, leaving Hicks and 
              Gillett 
              with around a 30 per cent stake each.</p>
              <p>The Rhone Group's co- founder Agostinelli, 56, is an Italian-American 
              executive based in Paris who lists former US President George W Bush and
               
              current French President Nicolas Sarkozy amongst his friends. His 
              high-flying wife, Mathilda, runs the French office of Prada and was a 
              witness at Sarkozy's secret wedding to Carla Bruni.</p>
              <p>Agnostinelli and Langman, 48, have worked together at several top Wall 
              St 
              firms before setting up the Rhone Group 14 years ago.</p>

              Benitez</h1>

              <p>The new unity between <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett is weakening the position of 
              manager <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rafa Benitez</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Even in the most troubled times of his Anfield reign ­Benitez has always
               stuck to his personal mantra that he would honour his contract. That 
              still has four years to run.</p>
              <p>But life has changed for ­Benitez. He will be aware that all public 
              messages of support from the boardroom have dried up, says the <em>Sunday
               Mirror</em>.</p>
              <p>A <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> insider said: “The fall-out ­between the ­owners initially strengthened
               Benitez’s position because each had a different opinion. The 
              appointment of Christian Purslow as chief executive changed all that and
               the ­owners were made aware that decisions must be made on the basis of
               what his best for ­Liverpool Football Club rather than their own 
              agendas.”</p>
