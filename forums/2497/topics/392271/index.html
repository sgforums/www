              <p><span class="italic">
              </span></p><p>John Terry has hit back at Craig Bellamy over a television jibe about his conduct.</p>
              <p>Although Terry has remained silent about the alleged affair with Wayne Bridge's former girlfriend Vanessa Perroncel, which cost him the England captaincy and a long-time friendship, he felt Bellamy's attack after Chelsea's 4-2 defeat to Manchester City was a step too far.</p>
              <p>Given his own chequered past, Bellamy knew he was leaving himself open to a counter punch when he claimed: "Everybody in football knows what the guy is like. But that is off the field."</p>
              <p>And while Terry is clearly not in the mood for an in-depth discussion about their respective personal lives, he felt Bellamy's snide comment could not go unchallenged.</p>
              <p>"People in glass houses should not throw stones," said the Chelsea captain.</p>
              <p>Given the bad blood that so obviously now exists between Terry and certain members of the City squad, it is probably just as well Roberto Mancini's men did not book a return visit to Stamford Bridge in the FA Cup next week.</p>
              <p>That was the prize on offer in their replay with Stoke last Wednesday but it is now the Potteries outfit, minus Ryan Shawcross, who will slug it out for a place in the semi-finals.</p>

              <p>As a Chelsea Fan, seriously I am more and more disgusted by Terry. Sure if the off-field matters does not affect his performances, I am glad...but apparently his performance had dipped.</p>
              <p>The worst thing is I feel is that, Ancelotti is not the manager to bring Chelsea forward, to be honest, Terry should have been sack of his captain position in Chelsea as well. So far I only feel Guus Hiddink is the only one who can being discipline and winning formula to Chelsea.</p>

              <p>well, it is a collective thingy, in the past, as a team, Chelsea was able to help pull each other out of trouble. but now, the spotlight is on an individual, so it is harder to justify his performance. </p>
              <p>if Ancelotti were to dig into his captain now, with 10+ games to go, Chelsea may collapse. but instead he choose to back his captain. So maybe a wise decision.</p>

              I think Terry is just too powerful a figure at Chelsea that even Lotti don't really want to go head to head with him until he is stronger as he know the power Terry holds in Chelsea club... Remember Mourinho drop him and he was totally unhappy with him and in the end, he was one of the players along with Ballack, Shevchenko and J Cole that went to Roman and said Jose had lost the dressing room...
              
              The only one Terry bothers with is Roman... The rest he won't care... Afterall, he is Mr Chelsea isn't he?
