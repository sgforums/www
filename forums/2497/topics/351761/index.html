              <p>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson insists they were the better team after being thrashed 4-1 at home by Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"It is a hard one to take because I felt we were the better team," he said.</p>
              <p>"That is not reflected in the scoreline and quite rightly, when you win 4-1 you get all the plaudits. I can't deny that."</p>
              <p>Fergie added: "We have lost a game. We need to respond and that is what we will do.</p>
              <p>"If the league started now and we had a four-point start I would take it.”</p>

              <p>I guess you could say the United players didn't look strong enough... In a way, they look rather weary, especially the backline... All of them have been playing non-stop recently as Fergie normally rest the midfielders and strikers only.</p>
              <p>And while they were playing in the Carling cup and FA cup, Pool players were resting. They have been playing a match almost every 3 to 4 days for sometime already and I guess it took its toll yesterday.</p>
              <p>Another thing was, they just played Inter and it ended on Thur morning only... In a way they only had 2 and a half days of rest and preparation... It would have been better if the match was today as this would give them 3 days... So i guess we have to take that into consideration too cos its weird to see the back 4 all making mistakes... It wasn't just Vidic alone, all of them did, even the goalkeeper...</p>
              <p>Anyway, we will only know what this result will mean in May... Will is cause United to lose the title or will it make no difference its still anybody's guess... But one thing i belief will come out of this from the United side is, it will serve them well for their next meeting against Pool... The hurt could be just what is needed when they next meet them... possibility in the CL. It is better to happen now than to happen in the first leg of a CL match cos if last night was a CL game, then they won't even need a 2nd leg after letting in 4 away goals...</p>
              <p>For Pool, I think it would be a shame if after beating Chelsea and United their 2 main rival for the EPL title home and away, still end up not winning the title... weird...</p>

              <p>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson
              blanked a post-match interview with Sky Sports after their thumping by
              Liverpool, it has been revealed.</p>
              <p>The <em>Daily Mail</em> says Ferguson showed he's not the best
              of losers by refusing to speak to Sky Sports interviewer Geoff Shreeves
              after his team's heavy home defeat by Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Fergie's grouse - despite his friendship with Shreeves - was
              over Sky screening the game on Saturday lunchtime rather than Sunday
              afternoon, which would have allowed United more time to recover from
              their midweek Champions League game, which took place the night after
              Liverpool's European tie.</p>
              <p>However, the scheduling had more to do with the Manchester
              Police not allowing a match against United's bitter rivals Liverpool to
              start at 4pm due to fears of drink-influenced crowd problems.</p>
