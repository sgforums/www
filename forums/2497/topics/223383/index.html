            <div class='col-md body'>Southgate feels cheated by Ronaldo's dive<br><br>Middlesbrough boss Gareth Southgate accused Manchester United winger Cristiano Ronaldo of cheating after he earned his side a controversial penalty at the Riverside Stadium.<br><br>Television replays showed that Boro goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer made no contact with the Portuguese international in the 19th-minute incident which saw referee Chris Foy give Louis Saha the chance to fire his side ahead.<br><br>Asked if Schwarzer felt he had been cheated, Southgate replied: "Yes, it is as simple as that. It is very difficult for the referee because it happens very quickly, but how many times are we going to see it? The lad has got a history of doing it and in the end, that has cost us the game. If you go behind to a goal against a team like United, it is a mountain to climb. Our goalkeeper has done everything he can to get out of the way. There was clearly no contact, I did not think so at the time and when you see the replays there is nothing there. For me, it is never a penalty. I do not know what you do. That is for people who are better qualified than me to deal with. I am not interested in talking about him, really. He plays the way he obviously thinks is the right way. Thats fine, but on the day, that has given us a mountain to climb."<br><br>Sahas spot-kick was cancelled out by substitute James Morrisons 66th-minute strike but Darren Fletcher headed home a Ryan Giggs cross two minutes later to extend Uniteds lead over Chelsea at the top of the Barclays Premiership to six points.<br><br>Asked about the incident, United boss Sir Alex Ferguson said: "I thought it was a clear penalty to be honest with you."<br><br>After being shown a replay, he added on PremPlus: "He is trying to evade it, isnt he? But would he have scored? I think he would have. Anyway, it is a penalty kick."<br><br>Ferguson was delighted with the three points on an evening when his side perhaps should have killed off the game long before they did.<br><br>Ronaldo, who was booed at virtually every touch after the penalty incident, repeatedly carved the Teessiders open, although they rallied after the break and might have snatched a point in a late flurry.<br><br>The win extended Uniteds unbeaten run in the Premiership to 11 games and made it eight away games in the league without defeat.<br><br>Ferguson said: "Today was a very important result for us. It is not an easy place to come to, as we have experienced in the past, but they (United players) showed a great resolution today. Even when they equalised they came straight back at them and they wanted to win it. That is important. It is not an easy place and it was a very difficult game. It was hard for the referee with the crowd but it is a good result."<br><br>A clearly angry Southgate was nevertheless happy with the efforts of his players.<br><br>He added: "It was always a very tough game for us. They are the best side, at the moment, in the league and it is made a lot harder when you go behind to a goal like that as well. We started the game quite brightly, we were well in it when they scored and that knocked our confidence a bit, and when you go behind to a team like United, it is a very difficult ask to come back."<br><br>Meanwhile, Wayne Rooney expressed his delight at United opening that six-point lead.<br><br>The England striker said: "Its gone to six points and Chelsea have the game in hand. As weve said before, wed rather have the points than the games in hand," said Rooney.<br><br>"We had to work hard out there today. It was probably our toughest game of the season. I think we deserved the three points."<br><br>Rooney told PremPlus that United are in shape to maintain their serious title bid.<br><br>"Were playing well," he added. "If we keep playing like that, Im sure well be up there near the end."<br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=218837" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=218837</a></div>
