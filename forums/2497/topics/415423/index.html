              <p class="art-txt-first"><strong>Chelsea captain John Terry says his long-term 
              nerve injury is now causing him so much pain that he may need months on 
              the sidelines to recover.</strong></p>
              <p>The complaint forced Terry to miss the shock 3-0 home
               defeat against Sunderland on Sunday, which served to underline the 
              importance of the defender to the Blues' title defence.</p>
              <p>The 29-year-old admitted that he was no longer able to play with 
              the pain of the injury, which he has battled since the end of last 
              season, and is worried he will now have to take a long-term break in 
              order to fully recover.</p>
              <p>"It is at a point where I cannot carry on with it," he told The Sun.</p>
              <p>"I used to be able to make it through games because the adrenalin gets you going and you blank the pain out.</p>
              <p>"But now there is no decision to make. After games I'm in agony and not sleeping at all."</p>
              <p>Terry will miss England's friendly against France at Wembley on 
              Wednesday night and is reportedly considering whether to fly out to 
              Italy before the end of the week to find a cure.</p>
              <p>"I'm at my wit's end," he added. "I know I won't play against Birmingham on Saturday but beyond that there are no clues.</p>
              <p>"It could be weeks, it could be months."</p>

              <p>Chelsea's Brazilian central
              defender Alex will be sidelined for up to eight weeks with a
              knee injury, the Premier League club said on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Alex has pulled out of Brazil's squad to play Argentina this
              week and is poised to have surgery, the champions added on their
              official website (www.chelseafc.com).</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">FABIO CAPELLO feels John Terry has put Chelsea before his country.</h2>
              <p>The England boss said: "He didn't play for us this season because he wasn't completely fit.</p>
              <p>"He preferred not to play so he could be fit for his club. He played many games with injections."</p>
              <p>SunSport revealed last week how the former England skipper had been asked by Capello's assistant Franco Baldini whether he was still up for playing for his country.</p>
              <p>Terry replied that he remained strongly committed to the England squad, even though he now fears he could be out for months with a nerve problem in his right leg.</p>
              <p>Capello's claim that Terry is putting his club before country is backed up by the stats.</p>
              <p>The defender has played only 45 minutes for England since the start of the season, when he came off at half-time in the August friendly against Hungary.</p>
              <p>He then missed the next three internationals. Yet after all those Three Lions matches he played for Chelsea in their next game.</p>
              <p>Terry has now confessed the pain has got the better of him and he will need to take an indefinite time out to try and recover - which may mean many months on the sidelines.</p>
              <p>Capello added: "I read that he will be out for a long time.</p>
              <p>"I think his decision is good because he can't play every game with injections. He has to be fit for our qualifying games next year."</p>
