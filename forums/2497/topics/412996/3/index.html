              <p>yes so it is bye bye with Hodgson. why persist and continue with him when they dun even have confidence to beat blackpool, bolton or WBA? u need a wholesome change ie replace him with another new manager who can.</p>

              <p>If you have a lousy car, changing the driver does not win you the race.</p>
              <p>Now, there are no sufficient good players for 1st team.</p>
              <p>There are no depth in the team so there will be a crisis when some one is injured.</p>
              <p>Plus some of the players are not playing with their heart.</p>
              <p>There is nothing a manager can do.</p>
              <p>The new owner have to dig very deep in his pockets to get players so that Liverpool can stay in EPL next season.</p>

              <p>Hodgson is not the kind of revolutionary manager that can bring Liverpool to the next level or help them win a title like Mourinho, Ferguson etc. He is the kind that is good for stabling the ship and give them consistency after awhile but unable to make the jump.</p>
              <p>If Liverpool wants to change totally, they will need someone like Guus Hiddink.</p>

              <p>Personally, I feel Roy is a good manager, but not good enough to make Pool champions of England type...</p>
              <p>One thing I am very surprise is, he is not able to motivate the Pool players even after being given so much time...</p>
              <p>The question is, does Pool really have that bad players? I don't agree. They can't be any worse than those at Blackpool of West Brom who are earning peanuts compare to them. And just now I heard on tv Blackpool's most expensive player cost $500,000 only and not $20 over million kind at Pool... And West Brom's $1m striker <span lang="EN-GB">Peter Odemwingie is like... a fighter on the pitch highly motivated to play well for the club. Can't say the same for most of the Pool players at the moment... For this, I feel the manager should take the blame on this part... I guess sometimes, the players are not afraid of a Mr Nice guy as manager...</span></p>

              <p>They dropped into 19th place in front of new co-owner, Boston Red Sox chief John W Henry.</p>
              <p>The Kop boss is now 15-8 favourite to be the next Premier League manager out of a job.</p>
              <p>And next-to-bottom Liverpool are just 11-1 to be relegated, their lowest price in Premier League history.</p>
              <p>Yet, after seeing his side leak goals to Everton's Tim Cahill and Mikel Arteta, Hodgson insisted: "The way we played was as good as I have seen us play all season.</p>
              <p>"The shape, the passing and moving was good.</p>
              <p>"I refuse to accept we were in any way outplayed or inferior. But I fear everything revolves around the fact Liverpool did not win."</p>
              <p>New owner Henry was in the Goodison directors' box.</p>
              <p>And Hodgson added: "Getting a good result here would have been Utopia.</p>
              <p>"We're not trying to disguise the fact this is a predicament. For any team, taking six points from the first eight games would be a predicament.</p>
              <p>"We are conceding too many goals but I thought today we were unlucky to do so."</p>
