              <p><strong>Harry Redknapp last night claimed "one of the best results of my career" will send "shock-waves" through QPR's relegation rivals.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Former Chelsea winger Shaun Wright-Phillips surely ended the Blues' remaining title hopes as he claimed Rangers' first win at Stamford Bridge in 30 years.</span></p>
              <p>And just three days after QPR were humiliated by Liverpool at Loftus Road, thrilled Redknapp suggested the fight for survival had taken a huge turn in his side's favour.</p>
              <p>Redknapp's Spurs beat both Inter and AC Milan but the Rangers boss said: "I said to Joe Jordan I can't remember having many better wins than this one.</p>
              <p>"Chelsea are absolutely flying and on the back of the Liverpool game, after I had a meeting and tried to convince the players I believe we can stay up, this was a great result for us.</p>
              <p>"People probably thought I was mad but I genuinely believe and didn't go home thinking 'we're doomed'.</p>
              <p>"This will send shock-waves through all the teams down there, even those on 20 points. They will be looking at what we've done and thinking 'Oh my God!'. Now we've got to make the most of it."</p>
              <p>Redknapp revealed he believed Joe Cole had decided to <span style="color: #000000;">join</span> West Ham rather than his side because the former England man did not believe Rangers could stay up.</p>
              <p>"I think this could help us with other players," added Redknapp. "They'll think they can come here and help us out of the mess we're in, achieve something rather than just going to a middle of the road side."</p>
              </div>
              <p>Where Redknapp was exultant, Rafa Benitez suggested he had been let down by his players after his decision to make five changes from the side that won at Everton backfired and appeared to accept they are now fighting for a top four slot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/01/02/article-2256145-16BAD405000005DC-392_634x478.jpg" alt="Gamble: Benitez rested several key men for the west London derby" width="634" height="478">

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Benitez rested Juan Mata and Eden Hazard but defeat left Chelsea still in fourth, 14 points adrift of leaders Manchester United.</strong></p>
              <p>"You can't carry on with the same players every game," said Benitez. "If you are playing against the bottom team in the table, at home, you have to trust your players.</p>
              <p>"We didn't have the precision in our passing or the high tempo we were expecting, then we made a mistake and paid for it.</p>
              <p>"It was frustrating and disappointing. If we want to reduce the gap now we had to be almost perfect. Losing one game makes that even harder, especially when we've played so many games with the same players.”</p>

              <p><span><strong>Queens Park Rangers boss Harry Redknapp has piled the pressure on Rafa Benitez before Wednesday’s west London derby by claiming ‘only a dope’ could fail at Chelsea.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Redknapp takes the Barclays Premier League bottom club to Stamford Bridge as he tries to breathe life into their fight against relegation.</span></p>
              <p><span>Rangers have won just once all season and will struggle to improve on  that on Wednesday.</span></p>
              <p><span>In contrast, Chelsea go into the clash on the back of five consecutive domestic wins and, after a rocky start to his time as their interim manager, Benitez is starting to turn the tide.</span></p>
              <p><span>But Redknapp said: ‘It’s different at Chelsea. He  walked into a squad of  players there who are  Champions League winners, so you’ve got a chance.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘You would have had to have been a real dope to have messed it up with that group. They have incredible players and Rafa is an intelligent guy.’</span></p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><span>‘After, little by little, you can see they enjoy the movement, the positions, the things we are trying to do and they are playing better football.</span></div>
              <p><span>‘I think we can move forward with another good result and confidence will grow more.’</span></p>
