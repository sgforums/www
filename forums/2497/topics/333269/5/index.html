              <p>The one thing I notice most of Pool's football is... they play a style of chasing and rushing kind of football... Such styles are rather useful when you play against very good sides as they don't allow their opponents to play their passing game or give them time on the ball. And you don't need many skilful players for this style too, just physically fit and hardworking ones will do. </p>
              <p>But such tactics has its flaws also... Like if they have to play 3 games in 8 days (Sat, Wed, Sat) or 4 in 10,11 days... (plus tues), They cannot perform at their peak after a few games... Thats why I feel when the CL comes around again in Feb, Pool will drop more points in the league as I feel they channel most of the enengy into the CL and cannot balance their form in the premier league with the kind of style they play.</p>

              <p>Should have 3 points in the pocket? Please give credit to The Tigers, they have archeived some great results against the top teams and everything else in general this first half of the season. They scalped Arsenal &amp; lost narrowly to Man Utd so they are not really the sort of team getting whipped easily.</p>
              <p>I'm just as disappointed as the rest of you guys since we're playing at home but we were beaten by a team playing good football and of cos the unfortunately own goal. I hope to see more of playing time from Yossi Beneyoun who created the pass for Gerrard to score the equaliser.</p>
              <p>I think the team has enough experience to last the campaign but they have got to forget abt relying Torres or Gerrard to provide goals. I like to see more of the players taking each game as if it's their last.</p>

              <p>Well at least liverpool are faster now. Liverpool used to be slow, uncreative and always pump the ball up. At least now they show more creativity and more enthusiasm in the game. As for lack of skills, i think they do have much more skilled players this season than any other epl season.</p>

              <p>I disagree.  I feel Liverpool loves to flood the midfield with holding midfielders and that allows Gerrard to cut and thrust into the middle. For example, his two goals against Hull.Hull did well by trying to play Liverpool, but a bit naive in protecting their lead. They can't pump the ball now with no central striker.</p>
              <p>Whether Liverpool will win the title depends on only one person, their captain. If I were the opponents' team, I would always try to mark him out of the game. Once Gerrard is out, Liverpool is a car without his engine. Just surprised that teams are not doing that.On the other hand, Pool is doing a good job of killing any attacks with Weasel face and Xavi..</p>
              <p>With the top teams all drawing which is favouring Liverpool and Villa, it may be a tight race to the end. UCL will be a big factor.</p>

              <p><br>I disagree with the most part.</p>
              <p>I believe rafa is a good manager. He has won two la liga with valencia even though valencia has not won a league title for 30 years. He has also achieved uefa cup success with valencia.</p>
              <p>And also, he instantly transformed liverpool into champ league champion in his first season. He has transformed a gerard houllier's joker team into a team with belief, speed, creativity and versatility.</p>
              <p>But yeah Rafa tend to play too defensively sometimes. Playing lucas was a joke. He tends to tinker sometimes but he is the real special one.</p>

              <p><br>Yes manutd will be within 1 point away from liverpool if they win the two games in hand. And they will most likely do so anyway.</p>
              <p>I have always considered manutd to be a stronger rival than chelsea because manutd always have a stronger finish in the second half of the season. Either that or manutd give up chasing like in the season 03/04, 04/05.</p>
              <p>Chelsea will probably need to sign one or two prominent players in order to win. Losing robinho on the signing in the last min was a big blow. Having old players like lampard(form drop), terry(red cards), drogba(form drop), ballack(form drop) playing again and again doesnt really help in their title cause.</p>
