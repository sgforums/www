              <p><strong>When Jorge Mendes was asked to write a column for the Portuguese
                              sports daily, O Jogo, during the European Championship, the title that
                              was originally suggested, somewhat jokingly, was "My Millions". Mendes
                              said no to that, instead agreeing to the column being called "The Value
                              of Euros" which could, even so, be interpreted two ways. It's not just
                              the football competition; it's the currency.</strong></p>
              <p>Mendes'
                              name doesn't mean much to the average football fan. But it should.
                              Still just 42, he is one of the most powerful men – maybe in terms of
                              deals the most powerful man – in the game. Mendes is also an agent, a
                              shrewd businessman and a clever media operator with his own management
                              company, website, which employs full-time journalists, and contacts
                              that spread from his Portuguese base throughout the world, particularly
                              in the valuable markets of South America.</p>
              <p>Pini Zahavi has long
                              been regarded as the number one super-agent but, this summer, as with
                              last year, Mendes' name is being mentioned by the biggest clubs in
                              Europe as the man with the greater influence. He has just taken Jose
                              Mourinho to Internazionale and Luiz Felipe Scolari to Chelsea to make
                              the pair the highest-paid club managers in world football.</p>
              <p>That
                              Mendes has found time to write a column is astonishing. He has been,
                              and is set to continue to be, the busiest agent in the business and
                              makes many millions indeed. Having been allowed by Scolari to have
                              access to the Portugal team hotel during the European Championship,
                              Mendes has been a visible presence at the opulent lakeside complex as
                              he looks after his clients and plots their futures.</p>
              <p>Referred to
                              as a "tranquil oasis" in the hotel blurb, the Beau Rivage in Neuchâtel
                              has been anything but that for Mendes. Not only has he schemed to get
                              Scolari to Stamford Bridge but he is also at the heart of deciding what
                              will happen to his star client, Cristiano Ronaldo, who wants to move to
                              Real Madrid. Then there is Deco, Ricardo Carvalho, Ricardo Quaresma.
                              The list goes on.</p>
              <p>Not a single player, it seems, leaves
                              Portugal, or moves clubs, without Mendes being involved and it has
                              already been calculated, probably correctly, that Scolari's squad is
                              the most valuable in the tournament on the transfer market. And Mendes
                              represents the eight biggest names.</p>
              <p>After securing Scolari's
                              three-year contract, worth between £5.5m and £6.25m, with Chelsea,
                              negotiating first with Peter Kenyon, the club's chief executive, and
                              then directly with Roman Abramovich, Mendes, on Wednesday, flew to
                              Italy to meet with Mourinho, who has returned from holiday, to direct
                              Inter's transfer dealings.</p>
              <p>With Scolari's appointment it appears
                              Inter's chances of securing Carvalho have been thwarted – the defender
                              can, however, expect to receive a new, improved contract even though he
                              has four years left on his present deal – although the Italian club
                              will battle with Chelsea for Deco and Quaresma. Either way, for Mendes,
                              it's a win-win situation. He represents both players, both clubs, both
                              managers.</p>
              <p>Mendes is a straight-forward character who has earned a
                              reputation for honesty – he would rather tell someone straight that he
                              can't give them information rather than lie – and loyalty. A former
                              semi-professional footballer, Mendes also has, according to his
                              associates, a brilliant eye for talented players and is a terrific
                              scout who is quick to sign up those who catch his eye.</p>
              <p>He doesn't
                              forget either, and still talks to those journalists and football people
                              who helped him in his early days. Mendes also learned a very valuable
                              lesson at the start of his career as he watched the waning of another
                              agent, Jose Veiga. Veiga was the number one agent in Portugal which
                              meant he was the number one agent with Porto, the club where the most
                              lucrative deals are cut. He took Luis Figo to Real Madrid, he was
                              involved in Zinedine Zidane's move also but he fell out with Porto
                              after Sergio Conceicao, a midfielder, was sold to Lazio.</p>
              <p>Veiga
                              had lined up a deal for him to go to Deportivo La Coruña and, angry,
                              went to war with Porto. Inevitably he was cut out of the picture which
                              allowed Mendes to step forward. He seized his opportunity and realised
                              it was better to work with, rather than against, big clubs and other
                              agents which is why one of his most significant alliances was with
                              Zahavi.</p>
              <p>The Israeli was the biggest, so Mendes wanted to work
                              with him. But now the biggest deals appear to go through Mendes first.
                              Last summer it was Pepe to Real Madrid for £25m, Anderson and Nani to
                              Manchester United for £46m, Simao to Atletico Madrid for £16.5m.
                              Mind-blowing figures. Mendes was quick to assemble a superb roster of
                              players and was a constant presence at the soccer schools and youth
                              teams throughout Portugal, spotting and signing up the Sporting Lisbon
                              pair of Ronaldo and Quaresma before others could get close. He also
                              forged alliances in South America which netted him Anderson, for
                              example.</p>
              <p>Part of his way of working is to jointly buy players
                              with clubs, such as Anderson whose registration was acquired for £6.3m
                              with Porto eventually paying Mendes £3m when the midfielder was sold to
                              United. Mendes is also good at looking after his clients. Anderson,
                              Ronaldo and Nani all receive frequent house visits from him while his
                              nephew, Luis Correia, who works for him as a financial adviser, is
                              friends with all three.</p>
              <p>But Mendes is also tough. Time and again
                              players have moved to him, from other agents, just before they have
                              moved clubs. Even Mourinho did it. His agent, Jorge Baidek, a
                              relatively small-time Brazilian who he had known since his coaching
                              days at Uniao Leiria, had lined up a move for him to Liverpool. That
                              was until Mendes intervened, armed with offers from Chelsea and,
                              ironically considering subsequent events, Inter. Mourinho, having led
                              Porto to the Champions League final, which they then won, dropped
                              Baidek.</p>
              <p>Every Portuguese player who then followed Mourinho,
                              including Paulo Ferreira, Tiago Mendes and Maniche, were Mendes'
                              clients. Similarly Nani's move to United only followed the winger's
                              decision to drop his agent, Ana Almeida, and Jose Bosingwa's £16m
                              transfer to Chelsea was facilitated by Mendes even though he wasn't the
                              right-back's agent. He is the gatekeeper. And those gates are golden.</p>
