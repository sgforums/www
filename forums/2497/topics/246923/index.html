            <div class='col-md body'>As far as statistics go, Frank Lampard is a better player than Steven Gerrard.<br><br>In England, a debate has been going on about Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard. These two are the golden Premiership midfielders, the idols of millions. So who is the best?<br><br>Liverpool are not a patch on Chelsea domestically, but Gerrard has broken record set up by Ian Rush for Liverpool goals in European competitions.<br><br>And playing for England recently, Gerrard shone while Lampard rather limped.<br><br>So is Gerrard better than Lampard?<br><br>Not so fast, my friends.<br><br>You can work out who is the best player, but the calculations are rather complicated.<br><br>Let me share with you some work we've done on analysing the best striker because, if you can follow that, you'll see how we reached on Lampard and Gerrard.<br><br>We quickly encountered a problem in devising the best method of calculation.<br><br>Using data for every on-field action by every striker in the Premiership, we were able to compare the contribution made to a side by a particular forward, compared with that made by the average striker.<br><br>The statisticians simulated the entire season(so far) over and over again, replacing each striker in each team by an average player one at a time, to see how much difference the replacement made to that team.<br><br>From this, one can calculate the numbers of points each striker has added to their team.<br><br>Now, let me take Didier Drogba in order to illustrate to you the difficulty we had.<br><br>Chelsea have a sensational defence. Scoring slightly a fewer goals doesn't impack thair number of points all that much.<br><br>So even though Drogba scores freely, he doesn't add as many points to his sides as players in less exalted sides.<br><br>There is a way round this: To get a crude measure of who the best striker is, you simulate the season for an average side with the different strikers in and out of the team.<br><br>Why crude? Because Drogba scored his goals for high-scoring Chelsea.<br><br>Would he have been so impressive playing for, say, Charlton?<br><br>The two methods produce different results. When you use the average team simulation, Drogba tops the strikers' list, and Wayne Rooney, Louis Saha and Thierry Henry all figure.<br><br>Team data<br><br>But when you use the data from the teams themselves, former Portsmouth star Nwankwo Kanu comes top despite the fact that his contribution has been dropping off.<br><br>The performance of Blackburn Rovers' Shabani Nonda has been extraordinary. He only comes second because he spent a great deal less time on the pitch than his rivals.<br>Blackburn's Benni McCarthy is also right up there, while Bolton's favourite El Hadji Diouf comes bottom of the entire 82-strong list.<br><br>Bobby Zamora's contribution is also noteable given his relatively scarce appearances for West Ham.<br><br>Comparing this season with last, Henry had one of the worst campaigns in the Premiership and Jon Stead of Sheffield United one of the best.<br><br>Now back to Lampard and Gerrard.<br><br>Fortunately, the dilemma evaporates. Why? Because for all the guff about Gerrard, his domestic contribution is little better than made by the average player.<br><br>I know that is difficult to believe, but it is at least partly the result of the position Rafael Benitez plays him in.<br><br>Gerrard's stats bounce around. A couple of seasons back, he was receiving best player accolades but out model didn't rate him at all.<br><br>Last season, we raved about him, putting him right up there. This campaign we felt he's little better than okay.<br><br>Lampard, on the other hand, is a super soar-away player. Year after year, he comes top or nearly top of out table.<br><br>And this season is no exception.<br><br>He absolutely thumps Gerrard.<br><br>On one measure(the average team method), he is eight times better than the Liverpool star while non the other, he is more than 10 times better.<br><br>Scoring 20 goals from midfield is an extraordinary achievement but Lampard also adds his assists and his accurate passing.<br><br>Successful pass completion is a very important part of a team's portfolio. If you don't believe me, as Arsenal's side of invincibles.<br><br>So we can resolve the issue without to dispute about method. Lampard is, far and away, the more valuable player.<br><br>From TNP 7 april 2007</div>
