              <p><strong></strong><strong></strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/carlo-ancelotti"><span style="color: #005689;">Carlo Ancelotti</span></a> anticipates Andriy Shevchenko leaving <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chelsea"><span style="color: #005689;">Chelsea</span></a> before the end of the transfer window, though Didier Drogba has informed the manager that he will sign a new three-year contract on his return from the team's pre-season tour of the United States. </p>
              <p>Chelsea travelled to the US with seven recognised strikers in their 26-man party, including Shevchenko and Claudio Pizarro who spent last season on loan at Milan and Werder Bremen respectively. Ancelotti indicated after the 2-0 victory against Seattle Sounders that he hopes to field two forwards in games in the season. With the young signing Daniel Sturridge having already impressed in training and on debut against the MLS side on Saturday, Ancelotti feels he boasts the firepower to unsettle opponents next term.</p>
              <p>Given the options the manager already boasts, Shevchenko is expected to move on ahead of the new campaign. Dynamo Kiev and Fenerbahce have expressed interest in securing the Ukrainian, who has a year to run on his £130,000-a-week contract, with the club to hold talks with the forward on the team's return to London.</p>
              <p>"For now, Shevchenko works with the team and plays with the team," said Ancelotti. "He's a [Chelsea] player now until 31 August and then, together, we will make a decision. I speak to Shevchenko every day and the situation is this: he's with us until 31 August and then we take a decision together. But I don't know what will happen as the club has not received any offers."</p>
              <p>Ancelotti intends to trim his squad ahead of the new season from the 27 who have featured in the US – Michael Ballack has returned home with a toe injury, while Yuri Zhirkov has linked up with the party – to a more manageable number, although those cuts will not include the winger Florent Malouda who has signed a new three-year contract.</p>
              <p>"It would be better to have 23 players, but now I want to see them, people I don't know very well," he said. "There will be less players [at the start of the season], but 24 or 25 is not a problem."</p>
              <p>Confirmation that Drogba, a player revitalised by Guus Hiddink's brief tenure last season, intends to remain at Stamford Bridge was anticipated, but will be welcomed by the management team nevertheless. The Ivorian was admired by Ancelotti while he was at Milan and, when fit and focused, remains a potent weapon.</p>
              <p>"Drogba is a very important player for us and we want him to play for Chelsea," said Ancelotti. "I think he's irreplaceable as no other striker in the world can do the same job. I've spoken with Drogba and know very well what he wants. I believe in Drogba and told him this. He told me he's happy to stay."</p>
              <p>There is an assumption that Drogba and Nicolas Anelka will be the first-choice forwards under the Italian, though Sturridge has already shown flashes to justify Chelsea's efforts in prising him away from Manchester City, much to Mark Hughes' frustration. The fee for the striker has still to be decided by a transfer tribunal – City are seeking up to £10m for a player they nurtured in their youth academy – but Ancelotti already considers him in his senior-team plans for the season ahead.</p>
              <p>"He's a young player and has good quality and we expect him to have a very good season," added Ancelotti, who will also see Mikel John Obi, Ashley Cole and Joe Cole sign new contracts before the start of the season. "He's [Sturridge] started very well. To score a goal in the first game [against the Sounders] and that's good for us and good for him. He will improve and has to improve. He has a lot of quality as a striker who is quick and intelligent with his movement for others – I like that. It's important that he improves, but he's a good striker for Chelsea and will be in the first-team [squad] this season.</p>
              <p>"He's not a star. He's a young player, a very good player. But it's a good sign that he wants to improve. We have a lot of strikers at this club, but he is young and we believe in young players at this club."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Malouda revealed that, despite signing a new contract, he will have to adapt to a new system with Ancelotti preferring a diamond formation up front. "This year he wants to try the new system with a diamond so I have to adapt myself and that is why we are training really hard to do what the manager wants," Malouda said.</p>

              <p>The 4-4-2 diamond is a scary formation not scary for the opposition teams, but for Chelsea itself...watching the pre season matches, again width is given by the fullbacks like Cole and Bosingwa... Just like what it was under Scholari.</p>
              <p>Wingers not even really 'used'. Malouda played in middle again...doesn't look good for me. Anelka back to his preferred position of striker. Kalou not even playing. ):</p>
              <p>Deco instead of the AMC became the DMC(to send crosses down the middle) to the 2 strikers up front. The thing though is, he is protected by Lampard and Ballack/Mikel/Essien infront.</p>
              <p>Some says Deco is now becoming the "Pirlo" of Chelsea...</p>
              <p>I hope Ancelotti thought of a plan B before he gets exposed and those "expected"/"predicted" tactics/game plan during the EPL season or CL.</p>
