            <div class='col-md body'>What Wigan did is to play the offside trap, you can count how many times Arsenal was offside until Flamini one. They are really gamble till the last moment. On the 2nd goal, Rosicky and Baptista had past all the defenders who r really hope they are offside. Arsenal win it becos they never giveup, Wigan had to learn that offside is not always successful, and it's up to the linesmen to give or not becos sometime the passes may hit the defender b4 the striker got the ball, and so its dun consider offside.<br><br>As for the panelty, we already know that Fifa ruling is cannot use video to help the referee and linesman, so these kinda of error is ongoing. The more they argue the more fine they kana, so LL.</div>

Wigan are to write an official letter of complaint to the Premier League, the FA and referees' chief Keith Hackett in relation to the conduct of referee Phil Dowd.<br><br>In a statement, the club 'allege that a number of their players were verbally abused in an aggressive and menacing manner by Mr Dowd'. Jewell, meanwhile, is to contest "tooth and nail" a charge of improper conduct issued by the FA for his on-the-pitch rant towards Dowd.<br><br>A second charge is likely to follow for his post-match comments as he roundly condemned the performance of the Staffordshire official. The FA gave Jewell until February 28 to respond, but he delivered his reply just over four hours later, with the backing of several Premiership bosses.<br><br>"We, as a club, will be fighting this tooth and nail," insisted Jewell. "We owe it to our supporters to fight this, because if I just shrug my shoulders and do nothing when I feel an injustice has been done, it would be letting them down." Jewell added: "I have been overwhelmed with the support I have had from inside the game, big figures who I respect a great deal.<br><br>"They have told me in no uncertain terms that I must take this all the way, and that's what I intend to do." Jewell's emotions ran high after the loss to the Gunners, albeit understandable given the circumstances. The 43-year-old was initially incensed at Dowd's failure to award his side an 80th-minute penalty, and with Wigan leading 1-0.<br><br>Mathieu Flamini pulled Emile Heskey back by the shoulder, yet Dowd has apparently claimed he saw nothing more than contact between two players. That could have led to Wigan taking a 2-0 lead and a red card for Flamini, who moments later set up the equaliser - an own goal from Fitz Hall - from an offside position.<br><br>In between, Dowd further angered Jewell by not letting Josip Skoko back onto the pitch after he had received treatment, leaving the Australian to watch from the sidelines as Arsenal made it 1-1. After berating Dowd on the pitch at the final whistle and pointing an accusing finger, Jewell later claimed the official had made "a catalogue of mistakes".<br><br>Jewell, whose side remain five points above the relegation zone, added: "He has cost our team the points - it could cost us Â£50million. "Referees just do not realise the significance of football matches. "I think some of them consider it to be more of a hobby and they do not take it as seriously as we do as managers and players. "I just do not understand where they are coming from."<br><br>But it is Dowd's own conduct that is in the spotlight as Jewell maintains the 34-year-old used foul and abusive language. After the game, Jewell said: "He is telling our players to F-off and stuff, which I do not mind because it is a man's game. "But then he is telling me that I will be sent into the stands for having a go at him. It cannot all be one way."<br><br>The Latics will want answers from English football's two governing bodies, as well as Hackett with regard to Dowd's behaviour. Hackett today explained the four match officials on duty at the Emirates Stadium were all in contact with one another throughout the game.<br><br>Although there is no recording, the FA will call upon the fourth official and the two assistant referees for their views.<br></div>
