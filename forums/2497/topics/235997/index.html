A brilliant strike from Denny Landzaat had given Latics a shock half-time lead, but the Gunners produced their customary late rally to secure victory through a Fitz Hall own goal and a Tomas Rosicky header six minutes from time.</strong><br><br>With Bolton having won earlier in the afternoon, Arsene Wenger knew there was little room for manoeuvre in the race to stay in the Champions League places and take advantage of Liverpool's unexpected defeat at Newcastle on Saturday.<br><br>Theo Walcott had been recalled to the starting XI, and looked lively down the Arsenal right during the opening exchanges. It needed a timely sliding challenge from Emerson Boyce to stop the 17-year-old collecting Cesc Fabregas' through ball.<br><br>There was an early chance for Wigan when a left-wing cross from Julius Aghahowa was deflected through to Emile Heskey at the far post - but the former England striker could not steer his volley back on target. On 10 minutes, Walcott's low pass across the area was just too far ahead of Julio Baptista, arriving at pace towards the penalty spot.<br><br>At the other end, Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann had to be alert to parry a decent strike from Landzaat - a warning of what was to come. It should have been 1-0 to Arsenal on 15 minutes as Baptista released Walcott down the right. His cross was just too far ahead of Fabregas - but fell right into the path of Thierry Henry at the far post, six yards out.<br><br>However, the normally composed Frenchman somehow contrived to balloon the ball high over the crossbar with his left foot. Neither he nor the fans behind Chris Kirkland's goal could quite believe it. Slowly Arsenal started to mount a sustained period of pressure.<br><br>On 22 minutes, Lee McCulloch pulled back Baptista to concede a free-kick in a central position, 25 yards out. Henry struck the effort well, and Kirkland had to stretch down to his right to save. Rosicky's low cross from the left was then almost sliced into the Wigan goal by Boyce.<br><br>Arsenal were on top, but without really giving the visitors' defence too much concern as the choice of final pass was poor. Wigan then took a shock lead on 35 minutes with a brilliant strike from Landzaat. Arsenal failed to clear their lines following a determined run by Aghahowa into the right side of the box.<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42560000/jpg/_42560615_wigan270.jpg"><br><span class="small">Landzaat [left] and Baines celebrate Wigan's opener</span><br><br>The ball fell to midfielder Landzaat some 25 yards out. The Dutchman took one touch before smashing a fierce strike past Lehmann into the top left corner. Not for the first time this season, Arsenal found themselves trailing at home. And in first-half stoppage time Heskey was within inches of making it 2-0. He latched onto McCulloch's pass into the area and shot goalwards - but Lehmann got just enough of a touch for the ball to bounce back off the right-hand post.<br><br>Arsenal broke quickly - and Henry headed wide from Gael Clichy's centre. Just after the restart, Johan Djourou had to be taken off for treatment on what looked like it could be a broken nose following an accidental clash with Heskey. With Arsenal a man short at the back, the ball was chipped through for the ex-Birmingham striker - but Heskey looped his angled shot over. On 51 minutes, Djourou had to be replaced. Striker Emmanuel Adebayor came on and Gilberto dropped back into defence as Wenger reshuffled his pack.<br><br>Clichy darted into the penalty box, and went down in a crowd of blue shirts. Referee Paul Dowd was unmoved. As the hour mark approached, Arsenal upped the tempo and the home fans responded with an increase in volume. Josip Skoko sent a rasping, angled effort just over from 20 yards after Wigan broke down the left.<br><br>The hosts, however, continued to press and forced a succession of corners. Wenger made a double change with 24 minutes left when Mathieu Flamini came on for Justin Hoyte and Walcott was replaced by Jeremie Aliadiere. Emmanuel Adebayor saw a well-taken effort ruled out for a marginal offside call.<br><br>Heskey got ahead of Flamini - and looked to have been bundled over inside the box. The referee, though, waved away the appeals. With nine minutes left, Arsenal felt the benefit of the official's decision 10 minutes from time, when Flamini was generously ruled onside and the Frenchman's cross was slid into his own net by Hall.<br><br>Wigan boss Paul Jewell was clearly furious, but his anger turned to despair moments later when a superb move involving Adebayor and Baptista was finished off by Rosicky's flying header.<br><br>There was no time for Wigan to respond and the defeat leaves them just five points off the bottom three.<br><br><img src="http://www.football365.com/Images/ThierryHenryWigan365.jpg"> <img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42560000/jpg/_42560609_rosicky203.jpg"><br><br>Henry and Chris Kirkland were then involved in what looked a heated exchange of words.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.teamtalk.com//Images/92647.jpg"><br><br><strong>FURIOUS JEWELL SLAMS DOWD</strong><br><br>Wigan manager Paul Jewell blamed referee Phil Dowd for costing his side victory and potentially Â£50million in the 2-1 defeat at Arsenal. The Barclays Premiership strugglers were leading 1-0 through Denny Landzaat's long-range strike when Emile Heskey appeared to be brought down on the edge of the penalty area by Mathieu Flamini late in the second half.<br><br>However, Dowd ruled no foul had been committed and Arsenal equalised moments later from a Fitz Hall own goal before Tomas Rosicky snatched victory with five minutes to go. "I thought we should have had a penalty which would hopefully have made it 2-0," said Jewell, whose side are just five points above the relegation zone.<br><br>"It is penalty. He (Flamini) puts his hand on his shoulder. Why would Emile want to go down? Some of the officials don't understand the game. "He (Dowd) has cost our team the points. It could cost us Â£50million."<br><br>The Latics boss was also unhappy his side were temporarily reduced to 10 men for Arsenal's equaliser - which was set up by an offside Flamini - as midfielder Josip Skoko's return after treatment was delayed by Dowd.<br><br>"One of our players was having treatment, Dowd didn't let him back on and then it looked like offside for their goal," he added on Sky Sports 1. "I don't like blaming referees but why is our player not allowed back on the pitch after receiving treatment? Even the fourth official doesn't know why he has not been allowed back on and if the officials don't understand each other we've got no chance.<br><br>"I'll be in trouble (for his comments) but no doubt these fellas (the officials) will have a game next week." Despite his criticism of the officials, Jewell was pleased with his team's performance.<br><br>"Whatever we got would have been a bonus. I thought our players were great today," he said. "We have had a sticky run in the last few weeks but we have to show that [determination] for the next 12 games and if we do that we will be comfortable."<br><br><img src="http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p143/zococl/Wenger.jpg"><br><br><strong>Gunners chief Arsene Wenger hailed the determination of his team. </strong>"I felt we deserved it because we did fight until the last second and we have shown again fantastic fighting spirit and character," he said. "It was a good Wigan side and they could have won as well, they hit the post at 1-0 and after that there were one or two situations that could have gone both ways."<br><br>Asked whether he thought Wigan could have had a penalty, Wenger told Sky Sports 1: "Maybe, yes. I didn't see it again. It was difficult to see and very difficult to say. The referee was close. It's not for me to decide that."<br><br>Jens Lehmann is out of contention for the Carling Cup final with Chelsea this month after being booked for time-wasting, though Wenger admits Manuel Almunia would have started that match anyway.<br><br>"I would not have played him (Lehmann) anyway. "I feel he wanted to show that we can also waste time and the referee didn't like it." Rosicky admits the Gunners must learn to start games better.<br><br>"We need to try to improve that, because it's always difficult to try to come back in every game. "We got the three points today but we know we could have done much better.<br><br>"It's probably the closest to losing the unbeaten record here but Wigan played quite well and have some good players. They are not easy games in this league. "It's always great when you can turn a game around but we need to start better from the beginning."<br><br></div>
