              <div><br>Liverpool celebrated the 50th anniversary of the appointment of Bill Shankly with a 2-1 victory over Wigan Athletic at Anfield.<br><br>It
                  was a night for legends at Merseyside, and Fernando Torres duly obliged
                  by scoring the winning goal late in the second half after youngster
                  David Ngog opened the scoring with a header early on. Charles N'Zogbia
                  scored a late consolation in stoppage time.<br><br>Liverpool took the
                  lead nine minutes into the game. The Reds had a corner cleared to Fabio
                  Aurelio on the right flank, the Brazilian took a touch and delivered a
                  fantastic cross into the penalty area. Ngog met the ball 10 yards from
                  goal, ahead of Chris Kirkland, and headed it past the Wigan 'keeper and
                  into the back of the net: 1-0 to Liverpool.<br><br>Wigan had a good
                  chance three minutes later, they broke down the left with Charles
                  N'Zogbia and the former Newcastle United man delivered a precise cross
                  to Paul Scharner in the penalty box. The Austrian had made a run in
                  between the center backs and headed unchallenged towards goal.
                  Fortunately for the home side the chance was wasted as Scharner headed
                  straight at Pepe Reina.<br><br>A piece of quick thinking from Yossi
                  Benayoun almost got Liverpool a second goal in the 16th minute. The
                  Israeli released Ngog down the right flank with a quick throw in, and
                  the youngster attacked the penalty area. Spotting Kuyt making a run to
                  the near post, Ngog drilled the ball inside as the Dutch forward got in
                  front of his marker and unleashed a powerful shot with his right foot.
                  Kirkland managed to save with his right hand and the ball skewed over
                  the crossbar. <br><br>Wigan withstood the ensuing period of Liverpool
                  pressure, clearing the ball off the line after a scramble in the
                  penalty area, and the game became increasingly scrappy. Both sides had
                  brief passing moves that broke down after fleeting signs of promise. <br><br>As
                  the first 45 minutes drew to a close Liverpool finished the half on
                  top. Steven Gerrard attempted a cross-field pass from the left that was
                  deflected into the path of Ngog. The Frenchman latched onto the ball,
                  entering the left hand side of the penalty area. He took the shot on
                  with his first touch and fired it back across goal, missing the
                  right-hand post by inches.<br><br>Wigan had a decent chance at the
                  start of the second half, breaking on the counter attack N'Zogbia was
                  released on the left. He hammered a left-footed shot towards goal, but
                  didn't worry Reina, who spilled the shot but collected on the second
                  time of asking.<br><br>Liverpool re-enacted a chance for the first half
                  when Ngog and Kuyt combined to almost unlock the Wigan defense. Ngog
                  attacking down the right and cut the ball back across goal for his
                  strike partner. Kuyt connected with a vicious shot and Kirkland
                  produced a brilliant reaction save to deny the Dutchman.<br><br>Kuyt
                  almost returned the favor minutes later, he was released on the right
                  by a wonderful pass by Gerrard that left Maynor Figueroa stranded. Kuyt
                  pulled the ball back towards Ngog, who had made a run to the front
                  post, but Titus Bramble read the danger and cleared the ball before it
                  got to the 20 year old forward.<br><br>Ngog was withdrawn in the 64th
                  minute and replaced by Fernando Torres. Liverpool should have had a
                  second goal moments after his introduction. Gerrard crossed into the
                  area from a corner and Daniel Agger had a free header six yards from
                  goal, the Dane failed to make a good connection with his header and the
                  chance was wasted.<br><br>Liverpool's inability to kill the game off
                  was almost punished in the 74th minute as substitute Jason Scotland
                  came close to equalizing for Wigan. The visitors crossed the ball into
                  the box from a free-kick high on the right flank, Scharner challenged
                  Reina and nodded the ball back to Scotland who volleyed towards the top
                  left-hand corner. His strike was ferocious, but it lashed off the
                  crossbar and bounced out to safety. <br><br>This was to prove a
                  critical miss for Wigan as Liverpool extended their lead with their
                  next opportunity on goal. A long ball forward wasn't dealt with by the
                  Wigan defense and this released Torres for a one-on-one with Kirkland.
                  The Spaniard skipped past the 'keeper and flicked the ball goal wards
                  with his right foot, Bramble managed to block this attempt but Torres
                  pounced on the rebound and showed neat footwork before tapping the ball
                  into the open net: 2-0 to Liverpool.<br><br>The Reds looked to close
                  out the game in the final stages, with Rafael Benitez introducing
                  Alberto Aquilani for another cameo appearance. The Italian made an
                  impression, attempting an overhead kick in the box shortly after coming
                  off the bench.<br><br>Despite looking comfortable, Liverpool conceded a
                  late goal. The impressive N'Zogbia collected the ball in the right-side
                  hand of the box and ran across the area, skipping past multiple
                  challenges. He then drilled the ball back across Reina, beyond the
                  'keeper's outstretched left hand and into the Liverpool goal: 2-1.<br><br>The
                  Reds managed to hold out to claim the three points, but Benitez will be
                  concerned his side conceded such a cheap goal late in the game.</div>
