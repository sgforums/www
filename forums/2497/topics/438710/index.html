              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>MUNICH, Germany: 
              Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini has insisted striker Carlos Tevez 
              is 'finished' with the club after he refused to go on in the defeat at 
              Bayern Munich in Tuesday's Champions League match.<br><br>"Yes, he 
              refused to go on," confirmed Mancini, who had wanted to make Tevez his 
              second substitution during City's 2-0 defeat in Munich.<br><br>"I don't 
              know, but with me he is finished," fumed the Italian when asked where 
              Tevez's future lies now and added the decision to sell Tevez is in the 
              hands of City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak.<br><br>"Yes, I am really disappointed, because he is Carlos.<br><br>"When one player refuses to go on to help his teammates in a match as important as this, it is very disappointing."<br><br>The
               former City captain has had a troubled time at City since being 
              released from Manchester United in 2009 with Tevez even handing in a 
              written transfer request last December citing family reasons and a 
              break-down in relations with the club.<br><br>The matter was later resolved with Mancini saying he thought the Argentian star would stay but stripped him of the captaincy.<br><br>Tevez for his part later spoke briefly through an interpreter to Sky Sports.<br><br>"It is his (Mancini's) decision," he said.<br><br>"I've
               been professional in the last year. This last year I was the best 
              scorer and I put my opinion through that I wanted to leave for family 
              reasons but I keep trying to do my best."<br><br>However, despite his claims his latest tantrum at Munich's Allianz Arena has left Mancini with little room for manouevre.<br><br>"He refused to warm up, he was going to be my second substitution," said Mancini<br><br>"If one player earns a lot of money for Manchester City and refuses to go on, for me, he is finished.<br><br>"If we want to improve, Carlos can't play with us, he is finished.<br><br>"We will speak about this with the chairman in the next few days.<br><br>"He is the chairman, he makes the decision."<br><br>Tevez's
               anger stems from Mancini's decision to bring off striker Edin Dezko and
               replace him with defender Nigel de Jong after 56 minutes, instead of 
              the Argentinian.<br><br>Dzeko was visibly unhappy with the substitution and could also be disciplined after Mancini insists he makes the decisions.<br><br>"I
               can understand one player is disappointed, but I am the manager I 
              decide everything, every manager has the right to make these decisions,"
               said the Italian.<br><br>"For Dzeko, it is different to Tevez, but that is the last time a player has this sort of behaviour."<br><br>Germany striker Mario Gomez scored twice for Bayern which gave the winners their tenth straight victory.<br><br>After
               their 2-0 win at Villarreal a fortnight ago, the result leaves Bayern 
              firmly in control of Group A as the German league leaders subdued City's
               star-studded attack.<br><br>City, currently second in the Premier 
              League to neighbours Manchester United, had few answers to Bayern's 
              all-out attack and now have just one point from their opening two 
              Champions League games in their debut campaign.<br><br>- AFP/de</span></span></p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">CARLOS TEVEZ was branded a "disgrace" after his unprecedented strike action stunned the game.</h2>
              <p>The stroppy hitman refused to come on as a sub when Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini asked him to help his team-mates as they trailed Bayern Munich 2-0.</p>
              <p>Tevez's betrayal of his manager, his club, their fans and his team-mates was as repulsive as it was shocking — and was no doubt a calculated move by him to engineer a move away from the club.</p>
              <p>All summer the Argy tried unsuccessfully to leave City, citing "family reasons" for desperately needing to escape Manchester.</p>
              <p>Last night, Mancini insisted he would never pick Tevez again.</p>
              <p>But kicking him out of the club now would only give the 27-year-old exactly what he craves — a dream move away.</p>
              <p>Furious City fans bombarded Twitter after the match saying City should now let Tevez rot in the reserves rather than allow him to leave.</p>
              <p>And football legends were quick to turn their back on the player last night, with former Liverpool boss Graeme Souness leading the backlash.</p>
              <p>The Sky Sports pundit said: "Tevez is one bad apple. He's a disgrace to football.</p>
              <p>"He epitomises what most people think is wrong with modern football.</p>
              <p>"It is totally unacceptable. He's a football player and he is paid to play.</p>
              <p>"He is refusing to help his team-mates. It's all about him, him, him."</p>
              <p>Tevez looked certain to leave City after he spent the summer in Argentina telling the world he had to get away.</p>
              <p>But no big offers materialised and to everyone's surprise he returned for the new season. However, the striker — who was the Premier League's joint Golden Boot winner last season with Dimitar Berbatov after banging in 20 goals — has been out of the first team during the current campaign, with the likes of Edin Dzeko, Sergio Aguero and Mario Balotelli all ahead of him.</p>
              <p>Souness added: "Mancini walked into a hornets' nest with him and several other players who were at the club at the time.</p>
              <p>"That would cause you to walk away from the job. How can you deal with players acting like that?</p>
              <p>"Tevez has crossed the line."</p>
              <p>Former City and England defender Danny Mills also joined the anti-Tevez chorus.</p>
              <p>He said: "You cannot keep disrespecting the manager.</p>
              <p>"Whether you like him or not, it doesn't make any difference. You're playing for yourself, your club, your team.</p>
              <p>"There's quite a few managers I didn't get on with but you put your shift in, you play for pride because you're a professional.</p>
              <p>"You simply cannot refuse to play in a football match. It's selfish, it's cowardly and bang out of order."</p>
              <p>Tevez was not the only petulant player confronting Mancini on a wretched night for the City boss.</p>
              <p>Bosnian Dzeko was also angered by the Italian's decision to substitute him and threw a strop after leaving the pitch.</p>
              <p>Mancini said: "Dzeko is disappointed but the manager can do what he thinks.</p>
              <p>"No player can play very well in every game. I need to speak with him."</p>

              <p>This is the first time I've heard of such bullshit. Nobody is bigger than the club. Then again, I'm quite happy that city lost. Getting a bit too cocky of late. They played really well until Bayern settled in. Positive thing is aguero looked pretty ordinary when up against top club defenders. Nasri was easily shoved off the ball at times, same old crap when playing top opposition at arsenal. The really class ones were only richards and silva.</p>
              <p>And this mario gomez is really a poacher, like hernandez? He appears at all the right places. Like Ian Rush too maybe.</p>

              <p>City is so rich, they should just let him rot, Keep him away

              he has already influence <span style="color: #000000;">Pablo
              Zabaleta so if you keep him within the first team, he will cause
              more problems...</span></p>
              <p>Just put him play and train with the under 15 squad
              daily and not come in contact with the first team... lol.</p>
              <p>They must also 'kill' one to show many wanna be pre-madonnas in

              <p><br>I don't think Mancini should be in any fault cos he pick his best side and clearly Dzeko and Aguero have been doing the business... It is up to Tevez to win his place back like Dzeko have done. But to refused to play is almost unheard of at this highest level... Isn't he a professional? he is picking up almost $200k per week surely he must at least put in a shift when called upon...</p>

              <p><br>I guess they can fine him 2 to 4 weeks wages for a start... But by right they should be given the avenue to sue him afterall, they did pay $20 plus million for his transfer fee and now he is refusing to play...</p>

              <p>And the former captain's future could now lie in the hands of the team-mates who sat with him on the bench in the Allianz Arena.</p>
              <p>The Argy striker refused to play when asked to come on as a sub by Roberto Mancini.</p>
              <p>Incredibly, Tevez claims it was a misunderstanding and he did not refuse to play.</p>
              <p>So City have launched an investigation and will quiz everyone in the dugout.</p>
              <p>A club statement read: "Carlos Tevez has been suspended until further notice for a maximum period of two weeks.</p>
              <p>"The suspension is pending a full review into his alleged conduct during Tuesday evening's 2-0 defeat to Bayern Munich.</p>
              <p>"The player will not be considered for selection or take part in training whilst the review is under way.</p>
              <p>"Carlos will be given full opportunity to explain his side of proceedings."</p>
              <p>Boss Mancini made a formal complaint to the club about Tevez's behaviour.</p>
              <p>PFA rules say the maximum fine is two weeks' wages — which would be £500,000 for Tevez — but City feel that would not suffice.</p>
              <p>They have called in legal experts to go through the small print of his contract to find out whether he is guilty of gross misconduct.</p>
              <p>Mancini is set to discuss the situation today with club owner Sheikh Mansour and chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak. </p>
              <p>The feeling from Abu Dhabi is they will back their manager 100 per cent. City were also sceptical of the apology put out by Tevez yesterday morning.</p>
              <p>In it, he said: "I would like to apologise to all Manchester City fans, with whom I have always had a strong relationship, for any misunderstanding that occurred in Munich.</p>
              <p>"They understand that when I am on the pitch I have always given my best. In Munich on Tuesday I had warmed up and was ready to play.</p>
              <p>"This is not the right time to get into specific details as to why this did not happen. But I never refused to play."</p>
              <p>Yet this appeared to contradict the version of events he gave to Sky television within minutes of the full-time whistle.</p>
              <p>Then he said: "I didn't feel I was right mentally or physically to play, so I didn't."</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.goal.com/en-gb/teams/england/109/man-city"><span style="color: #004276;"><strong>Manchester City</strong></span></a><strong> striker </strong><a href="http://www.goal.com/en-gb/people/argentina/9874/carlos-tevez"><span style="color: #004276;"><strong>Carlos Tevez</strong></span></a><strong> has responded to </strong><a href="http://www.goal.com/en-gb/people/italy/170/roberto-mancini"><span style="color: #004276;"><strong>Roberto Mancini</strong></span></a><strong>’s statement that the Argentine will never play for the club again by suggesting that he does not have the backing of his Italian boss, insisting he doesn't deserve such treatment.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mancini looked visibly shaken by an exchange of words with Tevez during Tuesday’s 2-0 away defeat to Bayern Munich in their Champions League Group A clash, with the 46-year-old later claiming the forward had refused to warm-up and play as a substitute in Munich.</p>
              <p>The former Manchester United and West Ham player now looks unlikely to feature again for the Eastlands outfit, but still insists he is happy at the club - despite a division of opinion with Mancini.</p>
              <p>Speaking to reporters, Tevez said: "Those are decisions which he makes and I agree with that. It's just I have been professional up until now. I was the top goalscorer last season so I don't think I deserve this treatment.</p>
              <p>"Yes I wanted to leave. I asked to leave because I had family problems but now my family is here and I'm happy, but I don't have the manager's backing."</p>
              <p>The 27-year-old also suggested that his refusal to warm-up was due to illness and that, when called upon, his head "wasn’t in the right place".</p>
              <p>"I didn't want to warm up because I wasn't feeling very well so I thought it was better not to," he continued.</p>
              <p>"So I didn't think I was in a good situation to come on because my head wasn't in the right place."</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">The Italian believes Tevez has no future at the club, but wants City to sell his former captain in the transfer window, rather than sacking him if the allegations against him are substantiated. </span></span></span></p>

              </span></p><p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Mancini fears the dispute has already wiped £30million off the player’s transfer value to somewhere near the £20m mark. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>That would not be enough to replace him with Mancini’s main 2012 target, Robin van Persie. </span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>He is prepared to tolerate Tevez’s presence back at the training ground when his current two-week suspension ends rather than attempt to throw him out and then watch him negotiate a high-profile free transfer to a big club. </span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Mancini called a meeting of his players on Thursday and told them they must not allow the drama to overshadow their efforts on the field. </span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>He also spoke privately with Bosnian striker Edin Dzeko, who apologised for a show of petulance on being substituted in Munich. </span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Dzeko has not been fined and will be in the squad for the game at Blackburn tomorrow. </span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">He said: ‘I know my reaction was bad. I have apologised for the reaction and Roberto has accepted it. He says it is ok .’ </span></span></span></p>
