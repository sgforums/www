            <div class='col-md body'>Defeat to Celtic will inspire us against Chelsea says Ferguson<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson is convinced Manchester Uniteds gut-wrenching Champions League defeat to Celtic can inspire them to victory over Chelsea on Sunday.<br><br>After taking maximum points from their opening three games, Uniteds European hopes now rest on a last-day encounter with Benfica for the second season on the trot.<br><br>Twelve months ago, the task of beating the Portuguese giants at the Stadium of Light proved too much for Fergusons men, who crashed out of Europe before Christmas for the first time in a decade.<br><br>At least this time, on home soil, a draw will do, although it is hardly a situation Ferguson and his team could have imagined when they made their flying start.<br><br>However, the long-serving Red Devils chief has enough faith in the character within his squad to believe they can lift themselves this weekend, when victory over Jose Mourinhos men will see United open a six-point lead at the Premiership summit.<br><br>"Obviously we are disappointed but the good thing is we have big matches before the Benfica game to focus on," he said, after last nights 1-0 defeat.<br><br>"We can put Europe on the backburner and concentrate on Sundays match, which is massive for us. I am sure it is a game the players will relish given this result. We have five days to lift the team now. But if the players have ambitions to win the league they know how important Sunday is and I dont think they will not let anyone down."<br><br>Although comparisons with 12 months ago are bound to be raised, the situation is more like the one United faced in 2000 when they entertained Dynamo Kiev needing a win to seal a spot in the last 16.<br><br>On that occasion they succeeded, but only after a late scare when the Ukrainian side came agonisingly close to knocking them out.<br><br>Ferguson accepts the current scenario should not have arisen, with Louis Saha wasting a golden opportunity to put them through in the final minute at Celtic Park when he saw his penalty turned away by Arthur Boruc, leaving the hosts to toast Shunsuke Nakamuras 80th-minute free-kick.<br><br>"It is a shock to lose, really hard to take," admitted Ferguson.<br><br>"We have thrown this game away because we did not take our chances. As a club, we always seem to do things the hard way and we have to do it the hard way again this time. To qualify we need a point off Benfica. It is a home match, so we will try to win. I have no worries about our home form, or our character. But we need to get that result."</div>

I would probably go with Cudicini for his experience of these types of games.<br><br>He may have weaknesses, but we are comparing him with Petr Cech, who is arguably the best in the world.<br><br>In the absence of Cech, you have to say United have the edge in the goalkeeping department.<br><br>Edwin van der Sar brings vast experience and has been an excellent signing.<br><br>It took United a long time to get Peter Schmeichel's successor sorted out, with Mark Bosnich, Massimo Taibi, Roy Carroll and Tim Howard all getting a chance prior to Van der Sar's arrival.<br><br>A club of Manchester United's size and stature deserves a world-class keeper and Van der Sar is in that category.<br><br><strong>THE DEFENCES</strong><br><br>Some interesting selection decisions here. I think Chelsea will go for Khalid Boulahrouz at right-back because of his power, and despite criticism from some quarters, Ashley Cole will always get the vote as first choice ahead of Wayne Bridge on the other flank.<br><br>If you don't play an expansive game in terms of having wingers on the pitch, you need width from elsewhere, and there is no defender better than Cole at getting up and down the line.<br><br>Cole is not easy to pass, and he has relished clashes with Cristiano Ronaldo before at club and international level.<br><br>Patrice Evra has done well for United, but I regard Gabriel Heinze as the best left-back in Britain - and I think he is even better as a left-sided central defender. He would be my man for a game like this.<br><br>Defensively, I think United have the slight edge purely because of Van der Sar.<br><br>I think Chelsea are better through the middle with John Terry and Ricardo Carvalho, but United are better in the full-back department with Heinze and Gary Neville.<br><br>I think Neville has been outstanding this season. Much was made of his playing relationship with David Beckham, but I think he's better without him.<br><br>He gets beyond the midfield on more occasions and gets into better attacking positions, with Ronaldo inclined to move into the middle while Beckham remained static. Neville is playing a bolder game than we have seen from him and he has excelled.<br><br><strong>THE MIDFIELD</strong><br><br>Fascinating. You have United's classic midfield four, with two wide men, up against Chelsea's diamond formation without a traditional wide man.<br><br>Chelsea used a 4-3-3 or 4-5-1 last season, but the arrival of Andriy Shevchenko means they have switched to a 4-4-2.<br><br>I think if you cut Jose Mourinho open, it would reveal that in his heart he likes to play with wingers, but he is a pragmatist and will not play square pegs in round holes.<br><br>Claude Makelele will lie the deepest of the four, playing a role that is not about tackling and negativity, but about intelligence and reading the game.<br><br>I can see him killing the space in front of the back four that Wayne Rooney is so brilliant at exploiting.<br><br>Neil Lennon did it in Celtic's Champions League win against United, and an added difference is that Makelele is the best in the world at it.<br><br>Louis Saha plays up front with Rooney just off, but I can see Makelele sitting in there to nullify this.<br><br>Chelsea will have Michael Essien on the left and Frank Lampard on the right of the diamond, with Michael Ballack at the point in the most attacking formation.<br><br>In truth those three are interchangeable, but I would have Ballack pushed forward.<br><br>United's midfield is more traditional, and it will be interesting to see if either manager blinks and changes formation. I would be surprised if they did.<br><br>I really admire United's attacking approach. Ryan Giggs, Ronaldo and Paul Scholes are all forward-thinking midfield players.<br><br>Michael Carrick has had criticism this season, but with that positive attitude, he is occasionally being asked to be the midfield. You can be out-numbered and it can lead to this sort of unfair criticism.<br><br>Usually United are in control of a game so it's not a problem. It is more of a problem when they come up against the best in the business and you are not controlling the game - so Sunday will be very interesting.<br><br><strong>THE STRIKERS</strong><br><br>People argue that Wayne Rooney is world-class. There is no argument that Andriy Shevchenko is world-class.<br><br>Throw in that Didier Drogba is playing as well as any striker on the planet at the moment, and you have quite a formidable strike force.<br><br>Shevchenko has not flown off the blocks as he adapts to the Premiership, but do not question him. He is world class.<br><br>I spoke to Drogba recently and put the point to him about whether he has benefited from Shevchenko's arrival.<br><br>He told me he is more mature now, and also that there was never any question of him leaving to accommodate Shevchenko.<br><br>Mourinho told him as soon as it became clear Shevchenko was coming that he would be playing alongside him, not being replaced by him. Bold words from Mourinho, but a decision that is proving fruitful.<br><br>He realised they would have adapt to each other, and that is what they are doing.<br><br>The credit, however, must be given to Drogba's development as opposed to Shevchenko's arrival.<br><br>Comparisons were made between Drogba and Saha some time ago, but now you would have to say Drogba is some way ahead.<br><br>This is not to say Saha is a bad player, it is simply a sign of how well Chelsea's striker is playing.<br><br>Rooney will be key, but watch out for Makelele.<br><br></div>
