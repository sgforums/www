              <p><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span><strong> midfielder Deco is close to finalising his reunion with Jose Mourinho on a free transfer to Inter Milan.</strong></p>
              <p>Inter manager Mourinho has not been put off by Deco’s recent struggle to make an<br>impact — and the ex-Chelsea boss may yet return for Ricardo Carvalho.</p>
              <p>Deco, 31, said: ‘It would be a pleasure to be back with Mourinho, but I don’t want to go into details, because it’s not me who’s dealing with the matter.’ </p>
              <p>Carvalho is prepared looks set to leave Chelsea also after suffering what he called<br>'the worst year of my life' while battling with injury.</p>
              <p>'First they have to reach an agreement with the club and then talk to me, but I am available for whoever wants me the most,' the Portuguese said.</p>
              <p>'It has been the worst year of my life, with injury after injury.'</p>
              <p>'I want to be where I feel good. It's obvious that it's hard now to respond to these questions because I had four fantastic years at Chelsea and this last year hasn't been good at all.'</p>
              <p>Chelsea’s on-loan winger Ricardo Quaresma is also heading back to Inter, although the Italians are considering an offer from Genoa.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/blackburn-rovers.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Blackburn</strong></span></a><strong> manager Sam Allardyce is close to sealing a $2.5million deal for Newcastle striker Alan Smith.</strong></p>
              <p>Allardyce, who has rejected a $2m offer from Olympiakos for Matt Derbyshire, has been targeting the ex-England man since he took over at Ewood Park.</p>
              <p>Newcastle are desperate to offload Smith following their relegation and may help contribute to his $60,000-a-week wages.</p>
              <p>Smith failed to make an impact despite being bought from Manchester United for $5m. Allardyce is convinced the one-time England front man could be a bargain priced replacement for the departing Roque Santa Cruz.</p>
              <p>Derbyshire, meanwhile, wants to return to Olympiakos but Rovers have demanded closer to $5m for the 23-year-old.</p>
