              <p><em>Arsenal's worst defeat in more than a century</em></p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ARSENE WENGER refuses to quit as Arsenal boss — despite feeling humiliated by this thrashing.</h2>
              <p>Wayne Rooney led the blitz with a stunning hat-trick as United condemned the Gunners to their worst defeat since 1896.</p>
              <p>Even Arsenal chiefs walked out of the Old Trafford directors' box before the final whistle.</p>
              <p>Asked if he would quit, Wenger said: "No. Of course, it hurts. It is humiliating.</p>
              <p>"But we've played three games and you should give me more time to say if I have got it completely wrong.</p>
              <p>"We are working very hard to find players but are behind other teams when it comes to wages.</p>
              <p>"I know that in England when you lose, signings are always the solution."</p>
              <p>Even United boss Alex Ferguson was pleased his side did not score MORE.</p>
              <p>He said: "You don't want to score more when you play against a leaking team like that.</p>
              <p>"Of course, I feel sympathy for Arsene Wenger. You look at the Arsenal team and it was very weakened but you still have to win these games."</p>
              <p>Gunners legend Paul Merson laid into Wenger.</p>
              <p>He said: "It was Arsene's worst day in management.</p>
              <p>"A League Two team would go there and give them more of a game. There was no plan B.</p>
              <p>"Which Arsenal players would get in United's team? Maybe Van Persie. He needs a whole new spine to his team."</p>
              <p>Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola, though, leapt to Wenger's defence.</p>
              <p>Guardiola, whose Barca side knocked Arsenal out of Europe last term, said: "We must remember what Wenger has done for football in general. Arsenal is a great team."</p>

              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Re-births have been ­celebrated with happy and heady regularity in the 25 years since Sir Alex Ferguson took over at Manchester United.</strong></p>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>But amid the euphoria that accompanied the latest rampage of gilded youth at Old Trafford yesterday, an element of sorrow intruded, too.</p>
              <p>Because some of the 75,000 spectators felt as if they had stumbled upon a funeral at the heart of the carnival.</p>
              <p>This was an iconic and unforgettable scoreline, 8-2 as memorable for those who saw it as for the spectators who gazed in awe at England’s 1-517 writ large on the scoreboard at the Gabba during the Ashes last year.</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>Even Ferguson and Gary Neville felt there was something sombre about it. As they watched Arsenal disintegrate, it was as if they were mourning the death of a philosophy and the loss of a cherished rivalry.</p>
              <p>Ferguson seemed to suggest after the match he was glad United hadn’t won by more because he felt awkward at the demise of a once great club. And Neville seemed more dismayed than delighted when he said United’s performance might only have merited a 2-0 win over many Premier League sides.</p>
              <p>Arsenal took over as United’s most bitter foes when Liverpool slipped into decline and Arsene Wenger took over at Highbury 15 years ago.</p>
              <p>There was something to admire about them, something more than just spending and acquiring. They stood for something. They stood for a style of football and Ferguson and United respected that.</p>
              <p>But as Arsenal were swept aside with embarrassing ease, and as Wenger sat with his head in his hands, it felt as if that era had passed.</p>
              <p>Arsenal aren’t part of the big picture any more. Earlier in the afternoon, Manchester City had demolished Spurs at White Hart Lane to underline their threat to United’s crown. For the first time since the late 60s, they are the enemy again.</p>
              <p>And Arsenal? Well, they lost their two best players, Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri, within the space of 10 days this month and have, as yet, made no effort to replace them.</p>
              <p>Whether that is because they can’t or won’t is a moot point that centres around the personality and the ideals of Wenger.</p>
              <p>It has seemed for several years now as though trophies at Arsenal have been sacrificed for the purity of the pursuit of a principle.</p>
              <p>It has been tolerated because faith in youth is seen as a noble cause and it suited Arsenal’s financial pragmatism but yesterday’s result will surely force a shift in attitude.</p>
              <p>What is not in doubt is that the club is in stasis, mired in a state of near-paralysis and self-doubt and marooned near the foot of the infant table. They will not stay there, of course, but their 8-2 defeat was merely a particularly brutal confirmation that the summit of their ambition this season will be making the top four.</p>
              <p>Sure, they were hugely depleted yesterday, weakened by injuries and suspensions, but it was the manner of their capitulation that suggested they should not expect any swift return to the Premier League’s top table.</p>
              <p>They were called many things in the aftermath of this football massacre and ‘naive’ and ‘lacking in spirit’ were two of the more gentle charges laid against them.</p>
              <p>It would be just as fair to say that they were spineless, directionless and clueless. It is also worth pointing out that at least six of the side who started yesterday’s match are first choice players.</p>
              <p>Much of the blame for their defeat was immediately directed at Wenger. Celebrity fans like Piers Morgan and Ian Poulter took to Twitter, berating the man who for so long has been regarded as the father of the club for his failings.</p>
              <p>Many, predictably, called for him to quit, seizing on yesterday’s result as proof that Wenger’s experiment with youth had run its course and that now was the time for a change.</p>
              <p>When Wenger walked into the post-match press conference, he said that he would not resign and it is doubtful that the Arsenal board has any appetite to fire him.</p>
              <p>This is his club and these are his players and replacing him would spark a more traumatic upheaval than that which will follow even the retirement of Ferguson.</p>
              <p>When asked whether he was confident he could turn the club’s fortunes around, Wenger responded archly. “What is to turn around?” he said.</p>
              <p>Well, there is plenty. More than will be solved by the return even of fine players like Jack Wilshere, Thomas Vermaelen and Gervinho.</p>
              <p>Wenger should have anticipated the departures of Fabregas and Nasri and recruited reinforcements, but he didn’t.</p>
              <p>That was one of the reasons Arsenal looked so utterly out of their depth yesterday. But it has also been evident for some time that he needs to leaven his youth policy with experienced players who, as Neville put it, ‘have been around the block’.</p>
              <p>When those criticisms were put to him, Wenger dodged them. He said a team of 20 people at the club were working on transfers and had not found anyone.</p>
              <p>Even for devout Wenger fans, that is not good enough. United, Liverpool and Chelsea have refreshed their ranks. Arsenal have stagnated.</p>
              <p>Last Wednesday, it seemed victory over Udinese would be more significant than any reverse Arsenal might suffer here. That was wrong. This result shook the club to its foundations and confirmed its fall from power.</p>
              <p>Wenger is still the best man for the job but the time for fiddling while his club burns has passed. He must act and act quickly.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>I think we have to look at the board also... Wenger can only identify players he wants and it's the CEO who does the negotiation and agree on the fee at the end of the day... How much are they willing to pay for the transfer and the players salaries is all down to the CEO along with the board who takes into account whether the club can affort to pay the contract period or not... Wenger's job is to train the squad and find the players he wants... But if the board don't want to pay... There is very little he can do.</p>
              <p>Look at Mata, Arsenal were the first one to be interested in him but wouldn't pay after negotiation, or right now Bolton's Gary Cahill, same case... Phil Jagielka and Scott Dann too...</p>
              <p>Nasri would have stayed back had the board offer him a deal earlier but they want to pay him on his minimum salary for one more year when he balance 2 yrs... At the end, just because to save on that one year salary, they lost him when others notice him and made known how much they are willing to pay him... By then, the board then offer him a new deal. But it's too late already cos even their new offer of $90k is half or less than half of what others have offered him...</p>
              <p>So I think the board is the main problem... Wenger is just made the fall guy. Sometimes I think he is too loyal to the board... Just see how Rafa was... lol. He openly put the blame on the board rather than took it quietly...</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ARSENE WENGER has apologised to Arsenal's fans following yesterday's 8-2 humiliation at Manchester United.</h2>
              <p>The Red Devils ran riot as Wayne Rooney hit a hat-trick, Ashley Young bagged a brace and Ji-Sung Park, Danny Welbeck and Nani got one each.</p>
              <p>It was the Gunners' biggest defeat since 1896, when Loughborough Town recorded an 8-0 victory.</p>
              <p>The North London club have today offered a free away match ticket to all supporters who went to the match.</p>
              <p>And under-fire manager Wenger was quick to say sorry to them for his team's drubbing at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>He said: "I can only apologise for the score — it hurts very much.</p>
              <p>"The fans were great and I feel sorry for them. They do not want to see their team like that.</p>
              <p>"We can only apologise and come back in our strength and desire in the next game."</p>
              <p>Confirming the offer to their travelling fans, an Arsenal statement said: "Sunday's result was obviously disappointing for everyone connected with the Club.</p>
              <p>"Our travelling fans were magnificent throughout and we want to recognise their fantastic support.</p>
              <p>"We will be writing to them shortly with the details."</p>
              <p>Wenger is hoping the upcoming two-week break for international matches will help his side regroup.</p>
              <p>He added: "The players go away for two weeks and maybe that is a good thing.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Now and again, a ­journalist will write an article that is proved ­spectacularly wrong by time. I wrote a book about Bill Shankly and Sir Alex Ferguson. It was published five years ago. The Shankly part was fine. The Ferguson part was the problem.</strong></p>
              <p>It suggested he had gone on too long as Manchester United manager and that he should quit.</p>
              <p>It had been a difficult period for Ferguson back then. He was just emerging from The Djemba Djemba Years.</p>
              </div>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>He had made a series of poor acquisitions such as Liam Miller and David Bellion, Roy Keane was a fading force and the arrival of Jose Mourinho at Chelsea was making him look old.</p>
              <p>He had become involved in an undignified and highly damaging feud with the powerful Irishmen JP McManus and John Magnier, major stakeholders in United, over ownership of the racehorse Rock of Gibraltar. The BBC had ­broadcast their 2004 documentary Fergie and Son about Jason Ferguson’s activities as an agent which prompted the United manager to refuse interviews with the ­corporation for seven years.</p>
              <p>And United went three years without winning the Premier League and, in December 2005, were knocked out of the Champions League in the group stages, finishing bottom of a group made up by Benfica, Lille and Villarreal.</p>
              <p>Things didn’t look good for Ferguson. But three Champions League finals, four league titles and two Carling Cup triumphs later, they look rather better.</p>
              <p>So even though the ­circumstances are different and the two men come from vastly different ­backgrounds and have contrasting personalities, you will forgive me if I don’t call for the head of Arsene Wenger.</p>
              <p>Because I can’t help feeling that, bleak though the prognosis is at the moment, the Arsenal manager will oversee a renaissance at the club in the next few years.</p>
              <p>“There is no allowance for the fact team-building goes in cycles,” Ferguson wrote in defence of Wenger in his programme notes on Sunday, “and sometimes you just have to be patient.”</p>
              <p>I know Arsenal fans have been patient already. I know they haven’t won a trophy for six years. I know they seem further away than ever from breaking that run.</p>
              <p>And yes, their 8-2 defeat to United at Old Trafford was a traumatic and humiliating event in what has been a difficult start to the season for Wenger and his club.</p>
              <p>And for his failure to plan for the departures of Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri and his reluctance to invest in the transfer market, Wenger deserves much of the criticism that has come his way.</p>
              <p>But even though the manner of the defeat confirmed the sense that Arsenal will struggle to make the top four this season let alone be contenders for the title, there are still reasons to believe Wenger will rise again.</p>
              <p>For a start, the Arsenal side crushed by United was missing some of its best players, notably Jack Wilshere and Thomas Vermaelen. That 8-2 scoreline was a freak result.</p>
              <p>It also appears Wenger has finally taken the first steps towards improving Arsenal’s defensive woes by moving for Germany defender Per ­Mertesacker.</p>
              <p>There is every reason to think the massacre by United was a nadir. Wenger was right when he said a ‘special set of circumstances’ (injuries and suspensions and the departures of Nasri and Fabregas) had left Arsenal peculiarly exposed on Sunday.</p>
              <p>So they will improve when some of those absent players return. They will improve when whatever investments Wenger has made before the end of the transfer window are integrated into the squad. Arsenal are a well-run club. They make a healthy profit. They have a fine, money-making new stadium and a hi-tech training ground. They have money to spend.</p>
              <p>Part of the process of recovery after the 8-2 result is that Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis has to persuade Wenger to spend more of it.</p>
              <p>Wenger still has the basis for a very good side at The Emirates. With two or three top-quality ­signings, they could be title contenders again next season.</p>
              <p>The Frenchman knows how to build a title-winning side. Let’s not forget that. He knows what it takes. When a manager has done it before, there is always a better chance he will be able to do it again.</p>
              <p>Those who have been scathing in their criticism of Wenger’s recent record are perfectly ­justified but managers as good as him don’t just fade away.</p>
              <p>Everything seems to be against him at the moment. But it was just like this for Ferguson once, too. Trust me, I remember.</p>
              <p>***</p>
              <p>Three most memorable scoreboards I’ve ever seen at live sport: Deutschland 1-5 England, England 1-517 at the Gabba and Manchester United 8-2 Arsenal.</p>
              <p>Australia 17-20 England at the 2003 Rugby World Cup Final was good, too, but it didn’t have quite the same shock value.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>hmmm write off fergie? but he already planted and build for the future when he bought ronaldo and rooney in 2003 and 2004 respectively, 2 world class youngster in their teens. wenger did tried to build for the future, but he has to sell off fabregas and nasir before he can reap the fruits, and also flamini, who left for AC Milan. furthermore fergie has the experiences of scholes, giggs, VDS, gary neville (although he was often out injured in the last few seasons). Arsenal has already sold off old heads such as viera and henry, old warriors of the 2004 unbeaten season.</p></div>
