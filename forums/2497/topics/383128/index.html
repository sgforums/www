              <h2>XAVI WANTS BARCA TO ATTACK</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/09/05/240/Xavi_2311320.jpg" border="0" alt="Xavi - ready for 'El Gran Clasico'."></div>
              <p><br><br>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Xavi has demanded Barcelona remain faithful to their attacking philosophy by dictating the game against bitter rivals Real Madrid on Sunday - and insists the league leaders' tactics "do not interest him".</strong></p>
              <p>After seeing the capital club depose them at the summit of La Liga last weekend, the Catalans began a crucial week with an impressive 2-0 Champions League win over Inter Milan on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>With top spot and the ever-crucial head-to-head record at stake when Madrid come to the Nou Camp on Sunday, Spain's 'El Gran Clasico' is attracting more headlines than ever.</p>
              <p>Despite hammering Madrid 6-2 at the Bernabeu last season en route to winning the league, Champions League and Copa del Rey, Xavi insists victory - and not the margin of it - is most important.</p>
              <p>"We are not thinking about beating Real Madrid by many goals," he said. "We want the three points and that is what we will go out to win. We have a lot of respect for them and we must be careful because historically these are complicated games.</p>
              <p>"They are the leaders at the moment and they are scoring goals at the moment. But we are at home and we are highly motivated for the game. "The clasicos are unpredictable games that are decided on small details," the Catalan playmaker continued.</p>
              <p>"We have to try and dominate possession and play like we know how, which is to go forward. We want to play our own game and maintain the style that has brought us good results so far. "We have our philosophy and how Madrid play does not interest me."</p>
              <p>Barca's treble success, combined with Madrid's unprecedented recruitment drive in the summer, has ensured even more hype for this instalment of world football's biggest club clash.</p>
              <p>Xavi, however, refused to gloat when asked about Madrid's habit of spending over the odds. "I do not like to think like that," he said. "The teams both have their own ideas of how to play. Real Madrid were the victims of our success last season and now, with new players there, they are looking for their style of play and things have yet to turn out well.</p>
              <p>"Now if I had to choose one of the philosophies I would say that I prefer ours." Barca captain Carles Puyol has attempted to ease the pressure on his side by insisting the home team are not favourites.</p>
              <p>"We have great respect for Madrid," he said. "They are league leaders and that means something. They have won nearly all their games and are a difficult side. "I think our game with them is 50-50."</p>

              <div class="sp-story">
              <p><strong>Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo was quick to switch his focus to <em>El Clasico</em> with Barcelona this weekend after making his return to action against FC Zurich following almost two months out through injury.</strong></p>
              <p>Ronaldo appeared as a 70th-minute substitute in the 1-0 Champions League win over the Swiss side on Wednesday, the Portugal international making his first appearance for Madrid since sustaining an ankle injury at the end of September.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo was unable to mark his comeback with a goal, although he did come close near at the end when he was denied as Zurich goalkeeper Johnny Leoni dived low to his left.</p>
              <p>Having only returned to full training on Friday, he told Spanish television channel <em>Telemadrid</em>: "I'm tired because I'm still not at 100%, but I'm sure I will return to be how I was before the injury, scoring goals, having good games and helping the team."</p>
              <p>Ronaldo, who scored nine goals in helping Madrid win their opening seven competitive games this season, has been sorely missed by the Spanish giants, who won just half of their ten matches in his absence and were embarrassingly dumped out of the Copa del Rey by third tier Alcorcon.</p>
              <p>He received a loud cheer from the Madrid supporters when he started warming up during the second half of the Zurich game, and then another ovation when he replaced club captain Raul.</p>
              <p>"I had a very good reception and now I want to show them the best of me," he said. "I want to play in the <em>Clasico</em> if I feel good, although that is the reasonability of the coach. In any case, with or without me, the team are first in La Liga and in their Champions League group.</p>
              <p>"Good players always have to play. (Against Zurich) I didn't score, but I hope to do in the following game. It doesn't bother me if it's 1-0, 2-0 or 2-1 - the important thing is to win."</p>

              <div><br></div>
              <p>After a deadlock in the first half, substitute Zlatan Ibrahimovic became Barcelona's
              newest darling when he scored the only goal of the game in the 159th
              edition of El Clasico to bag three points to the Catalans.</p>
              <p>Injuries and fitness issues had deprived to threaten the world’s
              Clasico of the biggest duel in football after reports emerged in the
              morning of matchday that neither Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo
              would start the game.</p>
              <p>But the legions of fans and the global media were relieved to see
              both players in the starting XI, although the two other big guns,
              Ibrahimovic and Karim Benzema only started on the bench.</p>
              <p>Barca wasted little time charging forward as Messi and Dani Alves looked to exploit Madrid’s weak left-back spot immediately, but the Brazilian wasted two early crosses as he uncharacteristically over-hit them.</p>
              <p>Kaka launched the visitors’ first attack after four minutes when he
              lofted a through ball into the box but Gonzalo Higuain just couldn’t
              control, leaving Victor Valdes to gather easily.</p>
              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo’s first meaningful contribution was to carve up an
              opening on six minutes when he easily breezed past Carles Puyol down
              the left flank and dinked a low cross to Marcelo, who miscued his half
              volley and sent it well into the stands.</p>
              <p>Minutes later, Messi danced past three players and slipped in
              Thierry Henry into the area down the left channel, but his tame shot
              was saved comfortably by Iker Casillas. Alves then sent yet another
              cross into empty space before Xavi pummelled in a 20 yard drive which
              sailed over the bar.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo had a shooting opportunity of his own on 11 minutes as he
              stood over the ball for a freekick from nearly 30 yards out while
              deafening whistles rained down from the Camp Nou stands on 11 minutes
              when Ronaldo stood over the ball for a freekick from nearly 30 yards
              out, but his blistering effort crashed into Sergio Busquets in the
              wall, much to the delight of the Catalan faithful.</p>
              <p>The best chance of the game came on 20 minutes. Kaka careened down
              the left, cut into the middle and squared the ball to Ronaldo, but his
              low drive was kick-saved by Valdes, leaving the Portuguese in
              disbelief. Barca’s normally flawless passing game collapsed a minute
              later when they lost the ball in their own half and Ronaldo’s deft
              backheel released Kaka, but Valdes dashed off his line to thump it
              clear.</p>
              <p>The Blaugrana backline was sliced opened again on 25 minutes when
              Kaka teed-up an unmarked Marcelo, but Puyol lunged forward and blocked
              off the Brazilian’s shot.</p>
              <p>Casillas was finally called to make his first big save of the game
              on 36 minutes when he tipped over Henry’s cheeky angled cross at the
              byline which was heading for the back of the net. The Madrid shot-stopper then dived low to save Iniesta’s left-foot drive as Barcelona
              looked to end the half the stronger, but both sides marched back into
              the dressing room evens-stevens, although Los Blancos appeared the
              happier of the two sides with the way the contest was unfolding.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/62250_hp.jpg" border="0" alt="" align="bottom"></p>
              <p>All the game needed was a goal to light the spark and Pep Guardiola
              decided to introduce the first of the two missing big guns as Zlatan
              Ibrahimovic replaced a quiet Henry after 50 minutes. And the Catalans
              immediately upped the tempo.</p>
              <p>But it was again Madrid
              who looked the more likely to score. Barca failed to make the most of a
              corner and Sergio Ramos led the counterattack as he played in Higuain,
              who checked past one defender inside the box but Puyol again came to
              the rescue with a brilliant tackle just as the Argentine was about to
              pull the trigger.</p>
              <p>The capital giants would pay for their profligacy as Barcelona surged infront on 55 minutes. Dani Alves drilled in an inch-perfect cross to <strong>Ibrahimovic</strong>, who stayed onside before he rifled in a masterful cushioned volley past Casillas at the backpost.</p>
              <p>But the Blaugrana were stunned on the hour mark when Busquets’
              clumsy handball earned him a second yellow card and Guardiola suddenly
              found himself a man short. Ronaldo had another chance on 65 minutes but
              he thumped Marcelo’s cross over. That was his last contribution as
              Manuel Pellegrini made his first change, sending in Karim Benzema for
              ‘CR9’.</p>
              <p>Gerard Pique almost killed off the contest in the 70th minute but
              hammered his header from a freekick agonisingly wide. Straight to the
              other end, Kaka danced his way past Alves at the byline and cut it back
              to Benzema, but Puyol, for the umpteenth time, made a pivotal
              interception to block the French striker’s close-range attempt.</p>
              <p>Eric Abidal was next to queue up to become the hero for Barcelona
              when he latched onto Xavi’s through ball but pulled his shot marginally
              wide of Casillas’ left post. Over at the other side, Benzema almost
              became Madrid’s saviour when Xabi Alonso’s corner bobbled into this path, but the former Lyon man ballooned his shot from five yards out.</p>
              <p>With two minutes left on the clock, Messi thought he had the icing
              on the cake. He ran onto Dani Alves’ squared ball but he was denied
              brilliantly by Casillas in a one-on-one. But it would be game over a
              minute later when Madrid’s midfield talisman, Lassana Diarra was dismissed.</p>
              <p>It wasn't the goal rush fans around the world were expecting, as
              Barcelona did just enough to fight off a valiant Madrid in a
              fascinating encounter nonetheless.</p>

              <p>Now I know why La Liga is not really selling... If this match can't even be exciting, what about the others? This match was suppose to be one of the best games but it was so boring in the first half that I could hardly kept my eyes open... lol</p>
              <p>In the first half, I thought Madrid played much better than Barce... They moved the ball well and had the best chance only for the Barce keeper to save it... Messi was like didn't turn up during the first half... And Ronaldo gave Puyol problems...</p>
              <p>Overall, this match was boring lah, and the commentary... What can you say, it's like help put me to sleep... lol.</p>
              <p>Even the Villa v Spurs match the day before was much much better than this...</p>

              <p>Zlatan to the rescue? And the reason why La Liga WILL sell this season is all because of their world superstars. Do you think any of the EPL teams have a World Footballer of the Year in their ranks? Messi? Ronaldo? Kaka? The answer is no. People will pay to watch these guys play. Heck! People will even pay to see Ronaldo get formally introduced in the Bernabeu!</p>

              <p><br>Do you see us paying to watch La Liga? No! Why? Cos La Liga is all about Barce and Real only... Those in the middle are average, those in the lower half will continue to stay there for years to come or drop to the lower league with new weaker teams replacing them...</p>
              <p>Many will be willing to leave Starhub next year and go over to Singtel for the only reason of the EPL. I for one won't miss the La Liga and I belief many will feel that way too... But of course if you provide it free for me to watch, I might catch one or two matches but only if its free and when I am free as well. But if you expect most to pay even $10 for it monthly... I think you can forget it, it won't sell... Starhub, a profit driven company with all its market and business planners ready to squeeze any profit out of a product isn't planning to sell it, then you should ask why? I think the asnwer is very simple isn't it?</p>
              <p>Talk about the stars at both clubs, we can watch them in the champions league... Where there is a more genuine chance of a proper challenge to them. In La Liga, its just cruise mode for these two clubs almost every week, the others won't make it cos foreign ownership is not allowed, so you won't see a Chelsea or a City happening... No club will be allowed to sustain a period of success, only these 2.</p>
              <p>The rest of the clubs are poor or in debts, can't afford to buy good players and must sell theirs if he becomes good. Tv deals are sold individually, Real gets the lion share while the rest get peanuts... The gulf just grow bigger and bigger by the years... Everything is monopolize between these 2 clubs. The government isn't helping things either, they control the rules that will always favour Real Madrid and Barce only...</p>
              <p>So what is some crowd turn out to watch the unveiling of the world's best player? Did they do the same with Benzema or Alonso? No! And are you very sure they paid to watch the unveiling or was it free? I believed if was the latter.</p>
              <p>So where is the fun in watching? Unless you are a spanish speaking individual, it is hardly attractive even with the stars at both clubs... Cos everything is more or less predictable even before the season starts.</p>
