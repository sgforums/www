              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Alan Shearer insists
              everyone connected with Newcastle must continue to focus on the club's
              battle against relegation from the Premier League. </strong></p>
              <p>The Magpies have dominated the sporting agenda since Tuesday evening when <em>Sky Sports News</em> revealed that Shearer would be returning to St James' Park.</p>
              <p>The
              club's all-time leading goalscorer has taken the helm for the final
              eight games of the season with Joe Kinnear continuing his recovery from
              major heart surgery.</p>
              <p>Newcastle are currently in the bottom three
              of the Premier League, two points from safety, and with the shadow of
              relegation spreading across the North East.</p>
              <p>And Shearer, who will give his first press conference live on <em>Sky Sports News</em> from 2.30pm, does not want the excitement over his appointment to distract anyone from their parlous position.</p>
              <p>"I have to clarify straight away that I don't want this to be about me, it's about this football club," he told the club's <em>official website</em>.</p>
              <h4>Results</h4>
              <p>"I was asked to see if I could help them stay in this division and that's why I'm here - I love the football club.</p>
              <p>"It's
              a difficult situation we're in but I believe we can do it. We've got a
              set of players here who, at the minute, are low on confidence and
              that's my job to try and change that.</p>
              <p>"It's not ideal, we have
              got injuries, but I promise you one thing, we'll give it a good go. I
              know quite of few of the players well already and that will be a help.</p>
              <p>"But
              I'll be looking to all of those players and the rest of them to pick
              this club up, move it forward and get us the results to keep us in the
              division."</p>
              <p>Shearer, who has no managerial experience, has brought
              former Crystal Palace, Charlton, Coventry, Oldham and QPR boss Iain
              Dowie in as his assistant and admits the knowledge of his No.2 will be
              vital.</p>
              <p>He said: "I do go into it very inexperienced but I've got Iain Dowie next to me who will play a huge part.</p>
              <p>"He has been a manager before and has been in this position before which I think will be invaluable to us.</p>
              <p>"He's a very good coach and the players will like him. It's a big job but we're looking forward to getting started."</p>
              <h5>Difficult</h5>
              <p>Shearer's
              short-term appointment begins with Saturday's testing home meeting
              against Chelsea and he has urged his new charges to only focus on the
              future.</p>
              <p>He added: "There are some very, very good players here at
              this football club. But, for whatever reason, they haven't really shown
              that.</p>
              <p>"It's been a difficult season but I'm not really bothered
              what's gone on in the past. I'm only bothered about the next eight
              games, starting with Chelsea on Saturday.</p>
              <p>"And I'll be telling
              the players that, 'Look, forget about what's gone on. We're in the
              position we're in because results haven't gone our way for whatever
              reason, be it injuries, form or confidence. That doesn't matter, we
              start on Saturday'."</p>

              Shearer's appointment will be made on Wednesday afternoon, but it would
              appear he is already putting in place his own people.</p>
              <p>Dowie has
              been out of football since leaving Queens Park Rangers earlier in the
              season but will be a key part of Shearer's coaching staff.</p>
              <p>Shearer and Dowie remain friends from their time together as players at Southampton.</p>
              <p>While
              Shearer is a novice in the managerial game, Dowie has accrued
              considerable experience during spells at Oldham, Crystal Palace,
              Charlton, Coventry and QPR.</p>

              Alan Shearer is not a dumb fellow, he knows it can be done that's why he is taking up the job... Whichever way you look at it, he can't do any worse as if they go down, he won't get the blame, the owner will get it as people can say ah, they were poor anyway before he came but if they stay up... He will get all the credit...
                      
              Its not as though Newcastle are really that bad a side... They have good players all around. Just a new manager will give them a new motivation. Had their manager not got a heart problem, they wouldn't be in this position at all. 
                      
              So home matches against Portsmouth, Middlesbrough and Fulham are enough to see them stay up...
                      
              I feel this is just one more of those moments Shearer see the opportunity and is trying to increase his popularity with the Toons... But he will never replace Keegan in their hearts.

              <div id="div_article_main_content">
              <p><strong>Alan Shearer’s arrival at Newcastle has brought an end to Dennis Wise’s tenure at the club.</strong></p>
              <p>The Magpies confirmed the executive director of football had left St
              James' Park after just over a year in the job, with Shearer arriving as
              manager.</p>
              <p>Wise was recruited by owner Mike Ashley in January 2008, but he
              became something of a hate figure on Tyneside and was widely blamed for
              the resignation of former manager Kevin Keegan.</p>
              <p>The former Chelsea midfielder was vilified as part of the ‘cockney
              mafia’ along with Ashley and was castigated by fans suspicious of his
              role within the club.</p>
              <p>Shearer had been critical of the structure at St James’ Park and
              Wise’s departure paved the way for the former England striker's
              return. </p>
              <p>"Newcastle United can today confirm that Dennis Wise has left his
              position as executive director (football)," said a club statement.</p>
              <p>"The club would like to take this opportunity to wish Dennis well for the future.</p>
              <p>"There are no plans to appoint a replacement in this role."</p>
