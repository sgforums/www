              <p><strong>Phil Brown has been sacked as Hull City manager with the Tigers revealing they felt a change of leadership was the "correct option" in order to protect the club's top-flight status.</strong></p>
              <p>Hull have taken the decision to relieve Brown of his duties following a 2-1 defeat to Arsenal on Saturday in which the Tigers conceded an injury-time goal having battled admirably despite being down to ten men following the first-half dismissal of George Boateng.<br><br><strong>But Brown had been forced to deal with embarrassing headlines prior to the game when Nick Barmby and Jimmy Bullard were involved in a scrap in front of members of the Women's Institute near the Humber Bridge.</strong><br><br>With the club in 19th place having won only five of 29 Premier League games this season, the board have now removed Brown and placed Brian Horton and Steve Parkin in temporary charge of the side as Hull seek to avoid relegation.<br><br><strong>A statement from chairman Adam Pearson read: "Retention of Premier League status is paramount and the board believes that a change in managerial direction is the correct option at this time.</strong><br><br>"The club will complete supporters up-to-date in respect of any managerial appointment but, in the meantime, Brian Horton and Steve Parkin will prepare the team for our important game at Portsmouth next Saturday.<br><br>"We would like to place on record our sincere thanks to Phil for the major success achieved during a period of four seasons in charge at the club and wish him every success for the future.<br><br>"Promotion to the Premier League in 2008 and retention of our status on the last day of the 2009 season are unique events in the history of Hull City AFC and both were achieved under Phil's stewardship during a period which will never be forgotten by all connected with the club."<br><br><strong>Brown led Hull City to promotion in the 2007-08 season and the Tigers enjoyed a superb start to life in the Premier League, beating Arsenal and Tottenham in London to generate speculation that they could challenge for European football after an impressive first half of the 2008-09 season.</strong><br><br>But a 5-1 hammering at Manchester City on December 26 - which famously saw Brown conduct his half-time team talk on the pitch - ushered in a difficult run for the club and they won just one league game in the remainder of the season, finally avoiding relegation on the final day of the season, despite losing 1-0 at home to Manchester United.<br><br>Brown met news of survival with an impromptu bout of karaoke on the pitch at the KC Stadium - just one of a string of incidents that saw the manager attract headlines and a generate a larger public profile due to an unconventional streak.<br><br>Their form failed to improve markedly at the start of the 2009-10 season as Brown's side won only two of their opening 11 games and the return of chairman Pearson to the club at the end of October led to speculation that Brown would be sacked by the new regime.<br><br>He clung on to his job, but with results failing to improve and negative headlines surrounding the club, Hull on Monday brought an end to Brown's four-year reign at the club.</p>

              <h1>Hull hope ex-Manchester City manager Mark Hughes falls to temptation
               in quest to replace sacked boss Phil Brown<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Hull
               chairman Adam Pearson is planning to meet Mark Hughes for one last 
              ambitious attempt to convince the former Manchester City manager to save the club from 
              relegation.</p>
              <p>Pearson is likely to fail - <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span> understands Hughes has already turned down 
              the job offer - but he wants to try the personal touch as he looks for a
               successor to Phil Brown, who was sacked on Monday.</p>
              <p>Hughes, who 
              has recently watched Arsenal and Real Madrid on Champions League scouting
               trips, is believed to have his eyes on bigger jobs in England, but 
              Pearson wants to hear it from him face-to-face.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/15/article-1258207-07A93041000005DC-261_468x286.jpg" alt="Mark Hughes" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Survival spark: Embattled Hull want to appoint 
              Mark Hughes as their new boss</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Hull hope Hughes can be tempted, even on a short-term deal until the 
              end of the season with a massive bonus for staving off relegation.</p>
              <p>The news emerged just as it looked as if former Bolton manager Gary Megson, who was in hospital with
               kidney stones on Monday, would be taking over the hot seat.</p>
              <p>However,
               the £1million transfer fee to be paid to Bolton, who are still paying 
              his wages, is putting off Hull.</p>
              <p>Iain Dowie, Paul Jewell and 
              Doncaster's highly rated manager Sean O'Driscoll were other contenders, 
              although Alan Curbishley has been ruled out.</p>
              <p>Pearson wants the 
              new man in place for Saturday's must-win bottom-of-table battle at Portsmouth.</p>
              <p>With the club around £40million 
              in debt, they are desperate to avoid the drop. Brown was sacked after 
              three years in charge following the 2-1 defeat by Arsenal - as revealed 
              by <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span> - a decision 
              which is believed to have been instigated by club owner Russell 
              Bartlett.</p>

              Megson remains a possibility to replace Phil Brown but ex-West Ham

              </div>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span> has learned that 
              the Hull board first made moves to find Brown's replacement last week, 
              but Hughes turned down an approach, as did former Wigan manager Jewell, who worked with Pearson at 
              Derby County.</p>
              <p>Curbishley, who was finally freed from his West Ham contract last month after leaving the club 
              in 2008, has told his advisers he is not interested in the job and is 
              hoping to find his next club in the south.</p>
              <p>Pearson said: 'I 
              wouldn't think that is someone we will be pursuing. He is a fantastic 
              manager, but it's someone we need to be able to get in straight away and
               he is not on that list.'</p>
              <p>Pearson revealed there are 'about five 
              people' on his shortlist and he is hoping to have made his decision, 
              with Bartlett's backing, by Tuesday night.</p>
              <p>Asked whether it would 
              be Megson, Pearson said: 'I'm not going to go through them all.'</p>
              <p>Megson,
               who was in the frame before Brown was appointed in 2006, would fit the 
              profile of a manager who has a proven track record in relegation 
              battles.</p>

              <p>He 
              infamously dragged his players in front of players for a halftime

              <p>Last
               week he was forced to issue a humble apology to members of the Women's 
              Institute after captain Nick Barmby and record £5m signing Jimmy Bullard
               had a fight in a public park as up to 100 women took part in a march on
               the Humber Bridge.</p>
              <p>The embarrassing incident was not well

              <p>'Although I am extremely sad to be leaving. I am very proud of my 
              achievements during my time as manager, especially having led the team 
              into the top flight of football for the first time in the club's 
              104-year history and ahead of schedule.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hull made the decision to sack Brown is because they still have about 9 matches to save themselves from the drop. I think it's a good one to take. A new manager might actually bring the best out of the present players... Sometimes a new man is what it might take to bring back the confidence for the players... But the man is also very important. Don't be like Newcastle who went to get an imexperienced Shearer... Mark Hughes should be a good choice provided he wants the job...</p></div>

              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Hull City" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/hullcity"><span style="color: #005689;">Hull City</span></a>'s perilous status as a <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Premier League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span></a> club is expected to be placed in the hands of Iain Dowie, who was last night on the verge of being appointed manager in succession to Phil Brown.</p>
              <p>It is a safe assumption the majority of supporters will not be celebrating considering that Dowie appears to be the only viable alternative open to the troubled club after a succession of preferred candidates rejected the job. The former Crystal Palace and Charlton manager has not taken charge of a team since his sacking by Queens Park Rangers in October 2008.</p>
              <p>It is understood Mark Hughes was Hull's preferred candidate but following discussions with the chairman, Adam Pearson, the former Wales and Manchester City manager politely declined the invitation.</p>
              <p>Avram Grant, whose Portsmouth side entertain Hull on Saturday, was also understood to be a genuine target along with Alan Curbishley, Gary Megson and Terry Venables, all of whom made it clear they were not interested. Gareth Southgate is doing media work for ITV and has told friends he has no intention of returning to the game until after the World Cup.</p>
              <p>One other contender discussed by Pearson and his directors was Paul Jewell. Pearson worked at Derby County with Jewell, who took Bradford City and Wigan Athletic into the Premier League. He is also doing media work and appears content to remain out of the game at present.</p>
              <p>It is understood the club's board, who have a limited budget to play with, even considered allowing Brian Horton, Brown's assistant, to take charge in a caretaker role for the remaining nine games, but Dowie remained the favoured option.</p>
              <p>It will be a brave decision from Pearson because he knows he can expect a barrage of criticism from fans who craved someone with a bigger standing in the game and greater experience at this level.</p>
              <p>Dowie was relegated from the Premier League with Palace in 2005, after taking them into the top flight against expectations, and lasted only 15 games at Charlton after succeeding Curbishley the following year. He has also managed Oldham Athletic, QPR and Coventry City and his most recent job was as an assistant to Alan Shearer at Newcastle United last season.</p>
              <p>It seems Dowie appealed to Hull because he was a cheap option, instantly available and desperate to prove he can succeed against the odds, which are stacked heavily against him.</p>
              <p>But what supporters also have to accept is that Hull are not an attractive proposition. They are second from bottom of the table following one victory in 16 games and have mounting financial problems that have increased the need even more for them to remain in the richest league in world football.</p>
              <p>Pearson said: "We are looking at this appointment as a nine-game survival plan and we are very much looking for an impact manager to come in and get things together to re-focus for the last nine games. We will then reassess the situation in the summer, either with that manager or another one depending on how successful we have been."The fact that we would like the new manager to take the team down to the south coast on Friday has always been our aim and I am pretty confident we will be in that position.</p>
              <p>"We have obviously got two extremely experienced people in charge of the team, but that has always been our aim and that is the timetable we are sticking to."</p>

              <h1>Iain Dowie named Hull City boss after Mark Hughes and Avram Grant 
              reject job</h1>

              <p>Hull
               have named Iain Dowie as their new manager as they battle to stay 
              in the Barclays Premier League.</p>
              <p>Hull chairman Adam Pearson went 
              for the former QPR and Crystal Palace boss after Mark Hughes turned him 
              down and Avram Grant underlined his wish to stay with Portsmouth.</p>
              <p>Paul
               Jewell and Alan Curbishley also snubbed Pearson, who sacked Brown on 
              Monday morning following Hull's weekend home defeat by Arsenal.</p>

              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/17/article-1258416-08C0FBD0000005DC-937_468x286.jpg" alt="Iain Dowie " width="468" height="286">

              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/17/article-1258416-08BA2BFA000005DC-211_306x423.jpg" alt="Phil Brown" width="306" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Gone: Phil Brown was sacked</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Dowie's last job was as Alan Shearer's 
              assistant at Newcastle, but the pair were unable to save them from 
              relegation to the Championship.</p>
              <p>He will be assisted by Steve 
              Wigley and Tim Flowers.</p>
              <p>Dowie said: 'It's a city that has a 
              ferocious fan<br>base, the infrastructure is here. It's an area that can
               more than justify having a Premier League team.</p>
              <p>'I think there is
               some value in the team. I think it's a working-class area that deserves
               a team that reflects that - a team that plays with a bit of tenacious 
              endeavour, that is aggressive on the<br>field and also pass the ball a 
              bit.</p>
              <p>'I'm only going to talk about the good things Phil Brown 
              has done, it's very important he should be recognised for the job he has
               done here.</p>
              <p>'He should be applauded for his job, this is just a 
              different chapter. I've had it in my life, sometimes you get curve 
              balls.'</p>
              <p>Pearson added: 'He is up for the challenge and we are 
              in a position we need to<br>fight and battle for every point.</p>
              <p>'I
               think they are classic Iain Dowie attributes and I am sure he will 
              bring that to this club and we are all in this fight together and we are
               looking for that fresh impetus to get us over the line, 13, 14, 15 
              points - whatever that is but we are still going to need to win four 
              games.'</p>
              <p>Pearson also 
              rejected advances from the likes of Terry Venables, Gareth Southgate and
              Peter Reid who were all among the leading candidates.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meanwhile,
               
              Pearson has managed to reduce City's bank debt from more than £15million
              to £4.6m since returning to the club last year.</p>
              <p>However, the 
              Tigers will still face a funding shortfall of £21m should 
              they lose their Premier League status, auditors have again warned.</p>
