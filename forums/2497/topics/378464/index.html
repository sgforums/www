              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> co-owner Tom Hicks is prepared to see George Gillett sell his half of the club.</p>
              <p>The <em>Sunday Mirror</em> says Hicks has paved the way for Prince Faisal bin Fahd bin Abdullah al-Saud to buy Gillett’s stake in the club.</p>
              <p>But Hicks has made it clear he will be staying at Anfield, whether or not his fellow American Gillett sells up.</p>
              <p>A source close to Hicks confirmed: “Tom would be open to considering a
              partnership with someone willing to buy George Gillett’s shares.</p>
              <p>“It is still the case that the sale of any shares in <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> FC requires the other partner’s consent.</p>
              <p>“Tom has made it clear, though, that he still has a long-term commitment to the club.”</p>
              <p>Prince Faisal has stated that he is willing to pay up to
              £350million for Gillett’s 50 per cent share of the Merseyside club –
              but that figure will depend on Liverpool’s owners substantially
              slashing debts which are more than £300m.</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> co-owner Tom Hicks is fully behind manager <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rafa Benitez</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Last week, fellow owner George Gillett told the fans to place the blame
              for an inconsistent start to the season – which has seen three defeats
              in the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> and one in the Champions League – on the shoulders of the manager
              rather than criticise the owners for a lack of player investment.</p>
              <p>Benitez, however, retains the total backing of Hicks. A source told the <em>Sunday Mirror</em>: “Rafa has Tom’s full support.</p>
              <p>“Losing two early games was disappointing but perhaps it was a
              wake-up call because the team then had six straight wins before losing
              at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>, which is always a tough match.</p>
              <p>“There is no panic because there seems to be a lot more balance in the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> this year. As for the stadium plan, there is a YouTube clip that proves
              George Gillett said a spade would be in the ground in 60 days, not Tom.</p>
              <p>“In fairness to George that was the plan, but it was discovered
              two weeks later that the plans were seven years old and obsolete and
              when new designs and approval were completed. then came the credit
              meltdown.</p>
              <p>“The plan now is to reduce bank debt and have a strong balance
              sheet to facilitate obtaining new stadium finance when the markets
              reopen in a year or two.”</p>

              <p>The <em>Sunday Times</em> reports Hicks says he would be keen to work
              alongside anyone ready to buy some or all of George Gillett’s shares.
              This sets up the prospect of Prince Faisal al-Fahad bin Abdullah bin
              Saud becoming co-owner at Anfield.</p>
              <p>However, Hicks would even consider buying some of Gillett’s
              shares himself to rid Anfield of his countryman. Gillett will meet
              Prince Faisal in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday to try to sell some or all
              of his stake.</p>
