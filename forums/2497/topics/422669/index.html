              <p><strong>He's the multi-millionaire footballer who has so much money, he hired an entire beach for his New Year holiday - but Cristiano Ronaldo and girlfriend Irina Shayk proved they're just like us when it comes to embarrassing holiday snaps.</strong></p>
              <p>There was more than a whiff of Cheddar about their poses outside their villa at an exclusive resort in the Maldives in these pictures which have just emerged.</p>
              <p>Irina, 25, was showing off her enviable bikini body in a brightly-coloured neon pink and blue and white polka two-piece - and her boyfriend, also 25, was no slouch when it came to flashing his famous abs either.</p>
              <p>But whether the sun had gone to their heads or whether there had been a little too much light refreshment on the sunloungers, the stagey shots weren't a patch on their usual glossy poses.</p>
              <p>And as the pictures have only just been released, perhaps the photos got lost as the local high street photo developers just like with normal people too...</p>
              <p>Cristiano of course is more used to posing oiled up in Armani pants, and Russian supermodel Irina has graced the pages of Sports Illustrated for their prestigious swimwear issue.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>It's rumoured that the Portuguese football star hired the entire beachfront to avoid prying eyes and enjoy utter privacy, but he was more than happy to pose with his model girlfriend for resort staff.</strong></p>
              <p>He was taking a break from playing for Real Madrid and according to a blog by one of the resort workers, was staying on the island of Rania on the Faafu atoll.</p>
              <p>There was no sign however of Cristiano's little boy, who was allegedly born to a 20-year British student last year after a fling with the star after meeting in a London club.</p>

              <p><strong>The Portuguese star shocked the world when he announced out of the blue last July that he had become a father. </strong></p>
              <p>The winger said from the start that the child, called Cristiano Ronaldo Junior, would be under his 'exclusive guardianship'.</p>
              <p>But he is having lots of childcare help from his family, including his mother Dolores and his sisters and brother, who he's exceptionally close to.</p>
              <p>It's claimed the birth mother accepted £10 million from Ronaldo to give up her rights as a parent.</p>
