              Chinese</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.breakingfootballnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/france-04-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168"></p>
              <p><strong>It may well be good that Raymond Domenach is stepping down as France 
              coach after the 2010 World Cup finals as fans are hardly likely to be 
              able to suffer more shocks like the one earlier today as France crashed 
              to a 1-0 defeat by minnows China.</strong></p>
              <p>Despite all its history, China have only made one World Cup finals 
              appearance while France were champions as recently as 1998. Yet Les 
              Bleus were made to look distinctly ordinary on the night as they 
              struggled to break down their opponents’ well organised defence.</p>
              <p>There was worse to come when China’s Deng Zhuoxiang scored in the 
              68th minute to condemn Domenach’s side to a defeat in their final warmup
               match before they begin their World Cup campaign against Uruguay in 
              South Africa.</p>
              <p>The Irish may now point to karma as France are only making the trip 
              after having widely viewed as “stealing” the berth in a play-off 
              qualifier against Ireland. Thierry Henry admitted using his hand to 
              control the ball before crossing for William Gallas to score the goal 
              that sent Les Bleus through in place of the Irish, with the referee 
              failing to spot the infringement.</p>
              <p>Training preparations prior to the finals also came with several 
              accidents that saw Gallas and Nicolas Anelka crashing in team bonding 
              sessions, fortunately without injuries.</p>
              <p>Results on the pitch have also been poor with France struggling to 
              beat Costa Rica 2-1 before scraping to a 1-1 draw with Tunisia. Both 
              performances have failed to convince the French public and critics that 
              their team would do any better than qualifying for the second round in 
              South Africa after the group stage, perhaps not even going that far.</p>
              <p>Manchester United defender Patrice Evra – now captain of Les Bleus – 
              boasted in the weeks leading up to the tournament that the French had 
              the best players in the world. However, they have come together to form a
               dismal group together and unless they lift their performances quickly 
              enough, it could be a quick trip back home.</p>

              <p>frankly, the coach is a clown but since the team is made up of so many black players, i hope Domenech stays on as coach !</p>
              <p>this dumbass shouldn't even play anymore matches ! the players risk more injuries and they'll be exhausted !</p>
              <p>what's the point even if they beat China by 10-0 ? boost their fragile confidence ?</p>
              <p>and now, they suffer humiliation !</p>

              <h1 class="h2">Domenech shrugs off China defeat</h1>
              <p><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2010/0511/raymonddomenech_275x155.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="155"></p>
              <p><strong>France coach Raymond 
              Domenech has played down the importance of Friday's friendly defeat 
              to China but admits there is some cause for concern.</strong></p>
              <p>The defeat capped a series of disappointing results which has seen 
              them held to a 1-1 draw by Tunisia and come from behind to narrowly beat
               Costa Rica 2-1. But Domenech insists he can turn things around in the 
              next six days.</p>
              <p>"There are always reasons to worry when you lose a 
              match and when you don't score a goal,'' he said. "No-one's going to say
               that's a joy, a pleasure.</p>
              <p>"There are days like that when what you
               see on the pitch makes you think you could have done better. We lacked 
              freshness and spontaneity. With regard to all the chances which were 
              created, there was something missing, that was obvious.</p>
              <p>"Now I'm 
              not saying that it's not worrying, but it's only a warm-up game. We 
              still have a week of work to prepare for another match - that against 
              Uruguay.''</p>
              <p>France paid the price for their profligacy as the 1998 
              world champions dominated possession but failed to find the cutting 
              edge.</p>
              <p>The French press have lambasted the team after they lost to
               a nation ranked 84th in the world, while the ecstatic Chinese media are
               hailing a historic night. However, Domenech believes there are many 
              positives to be taken from the game.</p>
              <p>"Look at the match and the 
              number of chances we had, especially at the end,'' he continued. It's 
              true that once again we're asking ourselves how we could have missed 
              them, but it's also the match where we created the most of them.</p>
              <p>"That's
               the positive side. We just lacked the last touch, the dangerous 
              positioning. Once again, I don't say that it's perfect, but it's 
              better.''</p>
