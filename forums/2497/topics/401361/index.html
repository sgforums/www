              <p>Ten is the number worn by the football gods. Pele, Maradona, Platini,
               Zidane. But England’s No 9 at a World Cup has also long been associated
               with greatness.</p>
              <p>In 1966 and 1970 it was Bobby Charlton; in 
              ‘98 Alan Shearer. Nat Lofthouse was the first back in 1954 (in 1950 they
               did not have fixed squad numbers) and some other<br>wonderful players 
              have since followed Bolton’s ‘Lion of Vienna’. Glenn Hoddle and Peter 
              Beardsley are members of the same exclusive club, as is a certain Wayne 
              Rooney.</p>
              <p>But Rooney’s preference for the 10 this time around 
              has provided a vacancy and the player chosen by Fabio Capello to wear 
              the nine in South Africa this month is not someone who necessarily 
              captures the imagination like his more illustrious predecessors.</p>

              </div>
              <p>As a scorer of seven goals in his last six England appearances, Peter
               Crouch might beg to differ. Might argue that he is a more than worthy 
              successor to the heroes of England’s past. He has scored 21 goals in 38 
              games in all, which he could quite rightly point out equates to a better
               strike-rate than Charlton. It took our favourite football knight 106 
              games to score the 49 goals that remain an English record.</p>
              <p>Later 
              today the FA will officially announce the squad numbers of the England 
              players but yesterday sources close to Capello said it would be wrong to
               read too much into the selection of Crouch for the No 9.</p>
              <p>Emile
               Heskey remains in contention for a place alongside Rooney if, that is, 
              Capello decides to kick off that opening encounter with the USA on 
              Saturday week with two<br>strikers.</p>
              <p>But Crouch must wonder if he 
              is in the box seat; if, judging by the allocation of the other numbers, 
              Capello has him in mind for a starting place against the Americans.</p>
              <p>If
               the squad numbers are relatively meaningless, why has Steven Gerrard 
              been given No 4 and Glen Johnson No 2? Why is Jamie Carragher No 18 and 
              David James No 1?</p>
              <p>James is the one that could yet prove misleading when Capello has
              publicly declared a desire to leave the selection of his goalkeeper
              until the last possible minute. Robert Green and Joe Hart are also
              under strong consideration, the Capello camp insisting it was purely
              ‘out of respect’ that they gave the jersey to 39-year-old James. This
              will be his third World Cup, after all.</p>
              <p>Crouch is no World
              Cup novice, either. After a hat-trick against Jamaica that was
              memorable for the robot dance he then performed in the final friendly
              before travelling to Germany, Crouch started the tournament as partner
              to Michael Owen in the absence of Rooney, who was injured.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/03/article-1283535-09DD2528000005DC-482_468x476.jpg" alt="lets hope hes as good as him.jpg" width="468" height="476"></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He followed a solid performance in the 1-0 defeat of
               Paraguay with a goal in the 2-0 win against Trinidad and Tobago, before
               stepping off the bench in the draw that followed with Sweden and coming
               on again in the quarter-final with Portugal that marked the end of 
              England’s German adventure.</p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/02/article-0-09BC5F70000005DC-967_233x393.jpg" alt="Prolific: Peter Crouch (right) hugs Ledley King after another 
              goal" width="233" height="393">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Prolific: Peter Crouch (right) hugs Ledley King 
              after another goal</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>That he remains an international force is great credit to Crouch. He 
              was a Liverpool player in 2006 but he has extended his international 
              career despite the upheaval of moving first to Portsmouth and then to 
              Tottenham.</p>
              <p>The international goals have continued to come, 
              most recently against
              Mexico, but before that against Egypt in March and Belarus in the final
              fixture of England’s World Cup qualifying campaign.</p>
              <p>Ask 
              Rooney to identify his preferred partner and he would probably say 
              Heskey, if only privately. Rooney does seem to be at his best when 
              Heskey is on the pitch, and has<br>scored nine goals in his last nine 
              games alongside the Aston Villa forward. Capello might also favour 
              Heskey for the qualities he brings to the team.</p>
              <p>Goals might not be one of them but England attack with more dynamism 
              when Heskey is selected ahead of Crouch. Going into this tournament, 
              however, Capello has other factors to consider, not least the lack of 
              first team football that appears to have affected Heskey’s form. His 
              miss against Japan in Graz on Sunday was painful.</p>
              <p>There is 
              nothing Crouch can do about the obvious lack of power and athleticism. 
              All any footballer can do is play to his potential, and Crouch has done 
              just that. He has consistently delivered for England and if Capello does
              reward him with a starting place as well as the No 9 shirt, he can 
              certainly say he has earned the right to be there.</p>
