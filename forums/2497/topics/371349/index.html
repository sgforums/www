              <p><strong>According to sources close to Empire of the Kop
              Liverpool-bound midfielder Alberto Aquilani has had some problems with
              his medical examination which may break down a deal for the Italian.</strong></p>
              <p>It has not been confirmed what the problem is but questions have
              been raised over the injury-prone players fitness ever since he was
              linked with a move to Anfield in the early part of this transfer
              window. If the player fails to pass a medical it may cause the deal to
              be called off or Liverpool may ask for a reduced price for the player
              due to the risk involved with taking a player with medical problems.</p>
              <p>Whatever the result it is a concern for all Liverpool fans with no
              current replacement for Alonso other than Brazilian Lucas Leiva who was
              average at best in the reds’ last league campaign.</p>

              <h1>Alberto Aquilani completes Liverpool switch</h1>
              <p><img src="http://fourfourtwo.com/contentimages/news/Aquilani6.jpg" alt="" width="286" height="161"></p>
              <p>LONDON, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Liverpool confirmed the signing of
              AS Roma midfielder Alberto Aquilani on a five-year contract on
              Friday after he passed a medical.</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old Italy player has been bought by manager Rafa
              Benitez as a replacement for Xabi Alonso who returned to his
              native Spain to join Real Madrid on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>No financial details were given but British media estimated
              the transfer fee at 20 million pounds ($33.52 million).</p>
              <p>Aquilani suffered an injury-hit campaign with Serie A side
              Roma last season and is recovering from ankle surgery in May.</p>
              <p>"The player will now continue his rehabilitation from an
              ankle operation under the guidance of Liverpool's medical team
              and is expected to be fully fit in approximately four to eight
              weeks' time," said a statement on www.liverpoolfc.tv.</p>
              <p>Aquilani is Liverpool's second major signing of the close
              season after Portsmouth's England right-back Glen Johnson joined
              the Premier League club in June.</p>

              <p>The <em>Daily Mail</em> says Aquilani, Liverpool’s new £20million signing, has been ruled out for up to two months with a damaged ankle.</p>
              <p>Aquilani, 25, whose transfer from Roma was competed last night, passed
              a lengthy medical but was told he was still several weeks from being
              match fit following surgery.</p>
              <p>The verdict underlined the risk element in the deal. His latest
              setback flared up late last season and he had surgery in May. Anfield
              sources said he would be out for ‘between four and eight weeks.</p>
