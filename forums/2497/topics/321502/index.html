              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"> </p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Video: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loCUeWdNgDo">Tunnel Bust Up</a></span></strong></p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"> </p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Doomed France coach Raymond Domenech revealed last night that his players went to war with each other during their Euro flop.</strong></p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Domenech
              is expected to be sacked and replaced by Didier Deschamps next month
              after Les Bleus were humiliatingly dumped out of the tournament
              following a goalless draw with Romania then thumpings by Holland and
              Italy.</p>
              <p>And his fate was sealed as it emerged that Manchester United defender Patrice Evra and former Arsenal skipper Patrick Vieira had to be dragged apart in the tunnel after the 4-1 defeat by the Dutch
              last Friday, with the midfielder also then rowing with old enemy Ruud
              Van Nistelrooy.</p>
              <p>Evra and Vieira had to be separated by former Newcastle defender Jean-Alain Boumsong and Franck Ribery.</p>
              <p>The bitter bust-up was captured by a TV crew from Norway in the
              aftermath of the game in Berne. Vieira, who failed to play a minute for
              France after coming into the tournament with thigh problem, tried to go
              back for a second bite at Evra as he was hustled away by Boumsong.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Vieira was also confronted
              by longstanding enemy Van Nistelrooy after the match, with the Dutch
              striker launching a verbal ambush as he reopened their five-year-old
              feud which started after the first Battle of Old Trafford between
              United and the Gunners in 2003.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Van
              Nistelrooy, angry at being branded "a cheat and a coward" in the Inter
              Milan star's recent autobiography, went for the midfielder by mocking
              the woeful French display.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Domenech
              signalled the spat between the pair was just part of the chaos which
              engulfed the French camp as he revealed the old guard in his squad
              considered that the younger players were "stupid jerks".</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"The objective of every generation is to kill those who are above them," Domenech said. "It is the same in everything.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"The
              young might listen to old men, but also believe it would be better if
              they were not there any more. That is normal for players as well.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"I think that the younger players have respect for what the older ones have done in their lives.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"But
              when you are 20, all old men are schmucks. And from the point of view
              of the older ones, the younger players are stupid jerks.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"They tried to work together, but each one could only integrate into the group according to their abilities.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"Some
              of them didn't want to understand anything. It can be like that."
              Domenech's team will break up, with Claude Makelele and Lilian Thuram
              confirming their retirement from international football.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Thierry Henry admitted: "Quitting the national team went through my head. I am here and I know what is going to happen now."</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Domenech added: "I saw some players in tears and others who threw their
              boots to the ground. Everyone lived through the disappointment in their
              own way."</p>

              <p><strong>Vieira 'in tunnel row' with Van Nistelrooy</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.independent.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00033/viera3_33792t.jpg" alt="" width="294" height="395"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Patrick Vieira did not play a part in France's elimination from Euro 2008 but the former Arsenal captain was alleged to be involved in a tunnel row with one of his oldest adversaries, the Netherlands striker Ruud van Nistelrooy. The two men are understood to have traded insults after France's 4-1 defeat to the Dutch in Berne last Friday after Van Nistelrooy purposely waited for Vieira after the game.</strong></p>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>The fall-out from France's woeful showing at Euro 2008 will claim the job of coach Raymond Domenech next month, however, for now the country is consumed with video footage of Vieira in the tunnel after the Netherlands game. It has been claimed that the pictures show Vieira being pulled away from an argument with Patrice Evra, the Manchester United left-back. That has been denied and it is the moments after that which are alleged to be the spiciest.</p>
              <p>Van Nistelrooy was said to be waiting for Vieira with whom he has had a turbulent relationship from his time at United. In his autobiography published in 2005, Vieira, who was included in the France squad despite a thigh injury, called the Dutch striker "a cheat and a coward", "deceitful" and "a nasty piece of work". While there is no suggestion that the two men came to blows this time, there had been trouble moments earlier when Vieira said he was spat at by a Dutch fan.</p>

              <p>Who else, the 2 old timer lah... They both hate each other so much that Vieira once said he respected Roy Keane cause they were tough fighters whereas rvn was a cheat and a coward who got him sent off...</p>
              <p>You can see rvn actually waited for him so that he could rub it in onto his face in person...  </p>
