              <p><strong>Sam Allardyce was bursting with pride after his side held title-chasers Chelsea to a 1-1 draw at Ewood Park - and he singled out debutant Phil Jones for extra praise.</strong></p>
              <p>He said ‘He will be very proud of himself in the morning. He could be the next John Terry.’</p>
              <p>A bold statement from Allardyce, but he certainly sees the 18-year-old centre-back as the next big thing for Rovers.</p>
              <p>But who’s going to be the next star to shine at your club? <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>takes a look round the Premier League to find the stars of tomorrow.</p>

              <h2>1 Arsenal – Benik Afobe (17)</h2>
              <p>The England youth international striker has been in prolific for the Gunners in the past couple of seasons – he bagged 11 in 13 appearances last term and is on his way to breaking the 20 mark this season.</p>
              <h2>2 Aston Villa – Arsenio Halfhuid (18)</h2>
              <p>The Dutch striker is already drawing comparisons with John Carew and Martin O’Neill was very pleased with Halfhuid after his hat-trick in the win over Millwall in the FA Youth Cup earlier this season.</p>
              <h2>3 Birmingham - Jack Butland (17)</h2>
              <p>Butland, who only turned 17 recently, has just penned a contract with the Blues until the summer of 2012. An agile stopper who is also developing a decent record of saving penalties.</p>
              <h2>4 Blackburn - Phil Jones (18)</h2>
              <p>The next John Terry, according to Sam Allardyce, and who are we to argue? He looked very comfortable playing against the likes of Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka on Sunday.</p>
              <h2>5 Bolton - Danny Ward (18)</h2>
              <p>The club secured the services of Ward from Leeds when he was 16. He made his senior debut earlier this year and has impressed with five goals during his loan spell at Swindon.</p>

              <h2>6 Burnley - Kevin Long (19)</h2>
              <p>Burnley paid Cork City a six-figure fee for the 19-year-old defender, who joined the Clarets in January. His favoured position is centre-half but he can also fill in at full-back.</p>
              <h2>7 Chelsea – Jeffrey Bruma (18)</h2>
              <p>He turned pro last summer and became a Dutch Under 21 in September last year at the age of just 17. Regularly trains with the senior side, he made his full debut as substitute against Blackburn in October.</p>
              <h2>8 Everton - Jake Bidwell (16)</h2>
              <p>The left-back signed scholarship forms last summer of 2009 and was handed a first team debut in the Europa League clash with BATE Borisov aged just 16 years and 271 days.</p>

              <h2>9 Fulham - Danny Hoesen (18)</h2>
              <p>The Dutch striker was a regular on the scoresheet for Gary Brazil's Under 18 side last season and impressed enough to earn his first professional contract.</p>
              <h2>10 Hull City – Mark Cullen (17)</h2>
              <p>City have struggled in front of goal this season but in a couple of years they could have this prolific marksman in their senior side - Cullen has scored 32 goals for the reserves this term and made his debut as sub in the FA Cup defeat to Wigan.</p>
              <h2>11 Liverpool - Raheem Sterling (15)</h2>
              <p>Liverpool beat Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal and Fulham to sign Queens Park Rangers’ wonderkid in February. And he has been in fine form since arriving on Merseyside, scoring in the clash with Everton earlier this month.</p>
              <h2>12 Manchester City - Nils Zander (17)</h2>
              <p>The Germany youth international left-back was signed from Schalke last summer. He has featured in half a dozen matches at Under 18 level this season and was offered a pro contract on his 17th birthday.</p>
              <h2>13 Manchester United - Joshua King (18)</h2>
              <p>Manchester United's 18-year-old Norwegian striker showed Sir Alex his pace in the Carling Cup win over Wolves last September. However, his opportunities have been limited since.</p>

              <h2>14 Portsmouth - Gael Nlundulu (17)</h2>
              <p>Pompey’s French striker has been in good form in front of goal this season but the future for the second year scholar is uncertain as long as the financial problems continue at Fratton Park.</p>
              <h2>15 Stoke - Louis Moult (17)</h2>
              <p>Moult, an academy graduate, who recently made his league debut in the draw with Burnley, has signed a two-year professional contract as reward for the progress he has made in the reserves.</p>
              <h2>16 Sunderland – Ryan Noble (17)</h2>
              <p>The Black Cats striker made his debut for the senior side in this season’s FA Cup clash with Barrow. He has also featured for the international side at Under-17 and Under-19 levels.</p>
              <h2>17 Tottenham - John Bostock (18)</h2>
              <p>Still waiting to come of age as a Tottenham player, Bostock went on loan at League One Brentford but Spurs fans remain hopeful that the former Crystal Palace youth player can fulfil his potential.</p>

              <h2>18 West Ham - Jordan Spence (19)</h2>
              <p>A prodigious talent who is already being tipped as a future England player, and captain. Still just 19, the defender has enjoyed successful loan spells at Leyton Orient and Scunthorpe over the past two seasons.</p>
              <h2>19 Wigan - Callum McManaman (18)</h2>
              <p>Cousin of Liverpool hero Steve, the young striker was handed his first-team debut in the Latics’ final game of the season last term.</p>
              <h2>20 Wolves – Nathan Rooney (18)</h2>
              <p>Rooney (no relation) is currently youth team captain and led the team to victory in the Gothia Cup in Gothenburg in July 2009.</p>
