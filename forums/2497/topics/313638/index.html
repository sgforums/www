              <p><strong>Cesc Fabregas has criticised Liverpool for 'refusing to play' in the first two of their three clashes with Arsenal this week.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Both games have finished 1-1, with Rafa Benitez's side closing out the matches at the Emirates, as Arsenal desperately looked for wins that would give them advantages in both the Champions League and the title race.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fabregas told The Sunday Telegraph:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"They defend very well and at 1-1, I think all they will want to do is defend and try to catch us on the break. We have to stick to our policy of playing football, attacking and trying to create opportunities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Just because the other team refuses to play doesn't mean we have to do the same thing. We want to stick to our football and that's what we will do."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is not the first time Fabregas has attacked opponents for a perceived lack of creative adventure. Last season he confronted Blackburn manager Mark Hughes on the touchline after their FA Cup fifth round clash, inquiring if he really used to turn out for those paragons of footballing virtue, Barcelona.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He went on to praise Javier Mascherano, whose tenacious play was a big reason for the Spaniard's peripheral role in the first leg at the Emirates last week:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I could feel his breath on my neck all the first half. For me, I think he is an amazing player. Defensively, he's very good and with the ball, he knows what he is doing. He reminds me a little bit of Mathieu [Flamini] as well."</p>

              <p>much as i like to watch Arsenal play (you got to admit they play some breathtaking football at times), it is incumbent on the team to break down the other team's defence if you want to do anything to them...</p>

              <p>Liverpool is great to watch when theyre putting up a huge defensive great wall against attacking teams like Arsenal and Barcelona. I get sucha huge kick seeing Mascherano and Lucas cutting off Arsenals passes. Plesis looks very decent too and i tell ya Lucas is gona be big!</p>
              <p>Once again Pool's intense defence is sucha joy to watch esp the last 15mins when u see Arsenal attacking desperately.</p>

              <p><strong>Wenger: We'll win in Europe</strong></p>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7">ARSENE WENGER insists fading Arsenal still have enough quality to win the Champions League this season.  </p>
              <p class="article">The Gunners boss has virtually conceded defeat in the title race following Saturday’s 1-1 draw with Liverpool at the Emirates. But he is refusing to write off their Euro chances ahead of tomorrow’s Champions League quarter-final return at Anfield after the first leg ended 1-1.</p>
              <p class="article">Wenger insisted: “It is still too early to make any conclusions about our season but I know we can qualify on Tuesday because we have the quality to do it. “This team have given everything against a very good Liverpool defence.”</p>
              <p class="article">Wenger admits his squad has been stretched to the limit in recent weeks but defends his transfer policy. While Arsenal’s Big Four rivals have spent millions on superstar signings in recent years, Wenger is operating at a profit in the transfer market.</p>
              <p class="article">Since Rafa Benitez took charge at Anfield in 2004, Liverpool have spent £154million, Manchester United £124m and Chelsea a staggering £250m.</p>
              <p class="article">Yet Wenger has spent just £52m and recouped £70m from the sale of stars such as Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira, Ashley Cole, Freddie Ljungberg and Jose Reyes.</p>
              <p class="article">Arsenal’s directors have always said there is no restriction on spending. But Wenger insisted: “If we had squads like the other three clubs, we would also have wage bills like them.</p>
              <p class="article">“I know that we have a rich budget and, when the stadium is paid for, we have a big financial potential. But I also feel some young players have made a big progress and will be better players next year.</p>
              <p class="article"><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/5_22034s.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p class="article">Kop boss Benitez knows a wounded Arsenal will be tough opponents tomorrow. He said: “They have a lot of quality and are always dangerous.”</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000080;">Same again: Bendtner will be looking for a repeat of his Emirates goal at Anfield on Tuesday</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Nicklas Bendtner has vowed Arsenal will not be intimidated by the Anfield roar as the Gunners aim to keep their Champions League dream alive against Liverpool. Arsenal travel to Merseyside locked at 1-1 in their quarter-final, second leg clash and 20-year-old striker Bendtner insists his side will not wilt under the pressure of a raucous home support on Tuesday night.</strong></p>
              <p>"We went there before this season and everyone was telling me before that game how great a place Anfield can be to play in," said the Dane, who scored the equaliser in the 1-1 Premier League draw with Liverpool at Emirates Stadium on Saturday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I came on and the atmosphere was fantastic. I expect the same on Tuesday, but we have to deal with it and win the game. As a player, you always want to produce, and in a big game even more so."</p>
              <p>The Premier League clash at Anfield in October also ended 1-1 and Arsenal know they must score or they will be eliminated. Bendtner, however, is backing his team-mates.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We have prepared well and kept the belief in the squad," he said. "I don't think we have many goalless draws at this club. They will have their game plan and we will have ours. We always score and get our chances."</p>
              <p>Despite Bendtner's confidence, Arsenal are in danger of ending the season without a trophy for the third year running - a slump unprecedented during Arsene Wenger's 12-year reign.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Saturday's 1-1 draw means Arsenal have picked up just eight points from their last seven League games and their title hopes are now effectively over.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000080;">Nicklas Bendtner says he won't be worried by the Anfield fans (above) tomorrow.</span></p>
              <p><strong>Wenger accepts that Arsenal's loss of form coincided with the loss of three key players through injury - Eduardo, Robin van Persie and Tomas Rosicky. All three have been absent for much of the spring and van Persie has not played regularly since October.</strong></p>
              <p>"It was difficult to predict that all three would be out together for such a long time," said Wenger. "I think had we got them back in the team, we'd still be up there."</p>
              <p>Mind you, all three were absent when Arsenal produced the performance of the season - that epic 2-0 victory over AC Milan in Italy in the Champions League last month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wenger has told his players they must dig deep to "recover physically and mentally" after the first two parts of their triple-header with Liverpool.</p>

              <p>i hope gunners score an early freak goal and then forces Liverpool to play football rather than just boot to gerrard and boot to Torres.</p>
              <p>and maybe Rafa can lose some weight pacing the sidelines deciding who to rotate again..</p>
