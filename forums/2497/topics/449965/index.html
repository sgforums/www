              <p>The Toon side which finished last Sunday's 3-1 win at West Brom amazingly cost £15million <strong>LESS</strong> than the whopping £35m Kop boss Kenny Dalglish paid for the big Geordie hitman.</p>
              <p>The sides clash tomorrow at St James' Park, where fans were in mourning 15 months ago when Carroll packed his bags for Anfield.</p>
              <p>But boss Alan Pardew, and in particular chief scout Graham Carr, have worked wonders by bringing in fresh faces which have helped Newcastle rise above the Kop in the table.</p>
              <p>The likes of Yohan Cabaye, Demba Ba and Papiss Cisse cost considerably less than big-money men Jordan Henderson, Carroll and Stewart Downing.</p>
              <p>But all have proved brilliant buys this term.</p>
              <p>Pards was at his lowest point when Carroll quit Toon. Yet now he could not be happier with his boys eight points clear of Dalglish's seventh-placed strugglers.</p>
              <p>The Toon boss said: "Of course they have proved great value and we put great pride in the homework we do before we sign players.</p>
              <p>"Graham Carr, our analyst and all the staff, we go through it all thoroughly. We also have to think a little left-field with our signings — we don't have the revenue of teams like Liverpool. But you also need a bit of luck, hoping they will come and settle in the city — which these guys have done.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Opener: Papiss Cisse heads home Newcastle's first goal as they eased to victory over Liverpool</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span><strong>Papiss Cisse showed £35million man Andy Carroll how to do it as Newcastle increased their advantage over Liverpool to 11 points.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The Senegal international's 19th-minute header set the Magpies on their way to a victory which leaves them in pole position to claim a top-six Barclays Premier League finish, and his second with 59 minutes gone sealed it.</span></p>
              <p><span>But on a black day for the visitors, keeper Pepe Reina was sent off nine minutes from time for head-butting defender James Perch, indicating as he belatedly left the pitch that he would resume their discussion after the final whistle.</span></p>
              <div class="artSplitter"><span>Cisse has now scored seven goals in as many games, one fewer than Carroll had managed in 48 appearances for the Merseyside club.</span></div>
              <div class="artSplitter"><span>.</span></div>
              <div class="artSplitter"><span>The Gateshead-born frontman's unhappy return ended with 11 minutes left when he was substituted after he had been serenaded with a resounding chorus of 'what a waste of money', while fellow old boy Jose Enrique, who had earlier been taunted over his claims that Newcastle would never again challenge for the top six, spent the final few minutes in goal with manager Kenny Dalglish having used all his substitutes.</span></div>
              <div class="artSplitter"><span>.</span></div>
              <p class="artSplitter"><span>But it was all smiles for the locals among a sell-out crowd of 52,363 as Alan Pardew celebrated a repeat of his first game in charge with another win over Liverpool.</span></p>
              <p class="artSplitter"><span>The game was billed as a significant showdown in the race for sixth place with the Magpies enjoying an eight-point advantage over the big-spending rivals ahead of kick-off.</span></p>
              <p class="artSplitter"><span>It was also a homecoming for Carroll and Enrique, both of whom were treated to a hostile reception by fans who mourned their respective departures, but have since found life without them more than bearable.</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Carroll's opening 45 minutes did not go as he would have liked as he became involved in a series of physical tussles after being booked for a blatant ninth-minute dive in an attempt to win a penalty.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>His fortunes did not improve when he was presented with his first real chance with 28 minutes.</span></p>
              <p><span>Another former Magpie, Craig Bellamy, caused problems for makeshift left-back Jonas Gutierrez throughout, and although Mike Williamson managed to get to his cross first, the ball looped up nicely for the striker to get to it before keeper Tim Krul, only for him to loop his header over.</span></p>
              <p><span>By that point, his side were already trailing as a patched-up Newcastle team defended deep and in numbers, but hit the visitors repeatedly on the break.</span></p>
              <p><span>Krul had tipped a Bellamy cross on to the bar and full-back Danny Simpson bundled the ball off the line after the Dutchman had spilled Steven Gerrard's cross.</span></p>
              <p><span>But when the home side broke, they did so at pace, and to great effect after 19 minutes.</span><span><span><span></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span>Hatem Ben Arfa skipped away from Jay Spearing and then Jonjo Shelvey to send the perfect cross to the far post for Cisse to rise and head past Reina.</span></p>
              <p> </p>

              <div class="artSplitter">
              <p><span>For all the Reds continued to enjoy more than their fair share of possession, Newcastle created as many openings, and they might have extended their lead 11 minutes before the break when Demba Ba's long-range shot clipped defender Martin Skrtel and wrong-footed Reina, only to drop just wide.</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>But Cisse should really have made it 2-0 with four minutes of the half remaining when Danny Guthrie crossed from the right and he sent a downward header past Reina, but wide of the post.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The woodwork came to Liverpool's rescue within three minutes of the restart when Williamson climbed highest to head Guthrie's cross against the foot of the post.</span></p>

              <p><span>But as the half wore on, it was Liverpool who started to gain the upper hand with their host`s carelessness in possession hurting them.</span></p>

              The match got 2 very funny dive, firstly is Carroll's then its Perch.
              
              Carroll one is like so god damn retarded. 
              He past the keeper and only left to tap the ball in, then he choose to dive. 
              Then his dive cui until some shit.
              After the keeper close down on him (no body contact), he still run 2 steps then start to fall.
              
              Perch one very lol lah, reminds my of barca's dive all cover face one. 
              Reina didnt head butt him, only a chest bump, then he fall to the ground like someone kick right in his face like that.

                  Thats such a LOL graph you got there. Totally true haha.
                  
                  I didnt know much about the EPL until this season cuz i found some way to watch the matches online.
                  
                  I dun think we need to say more on how bad Liverpool is now.
                  
                  But i just think that Kenny shouldnt have come back to be the manager. 
                  
                  Maybe he wants the challenge to be the liverpool manager, but he is not up for the challenge.
                  
                  Look at the state liverpool was in before Kenny and after Kenny, both is very screwed.
                  
                  Selling flops and then buying flops doesnt bring the club anywhere.

              <p><br>Thats such a LOL graph you got there. Totally true haha. I didnt know much about the EPL until this season cuz i found some way to watch the matches online. I dun think we need to say more on how bad Liverpool is now. But i just think that Kenny shouldnt have come back to be the manager. Maybe he wants the challenge to be the liverpool manager, but he is not up for the challenge. Look at the state liverpool was in before Kenny and after Kenny, both is very screwed. Selling flops and then buying flops doesnt bring the club anywhere.</p>

              <p><br>I can tell you in the close season when they start to buy flops they will tell you they have the next big thing blarblarblar.... Then they will be optimistic. Suddenly, they feel like title contenders. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Then when the season start, they will do well but always around dec the most crucial period of EPL, they faded away and they will use their favourite phrase "Ref is fucked up" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>So there goes their "Title contenders" tag. And they will say "Wait for next season"</p>
              <p>Standard one, never change for the last 20 years.</p>
              <p>Just like last season when man utd won the 19th, I taunt my liverpool friends in facebook, one of them reply, "See you in august when daglish revolution starts"</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span><strong>Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge has launched a withering attack on his old club and branded a run of two wins in 12 League games a ‘crisis’.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Writing in his weekly column in the Liverpool Echo, Aldridge is scathing of Kenny Dalglish’s squad and believes they have become a ‘laughing stock’ following a run of six defeats in seven Barclays Premier League games.</span></p>
              <p><span>Liverpool have not been immune from criticism by their former  players recently, with Alan Hansen and Mark Lawrenson giving pointed appraisals, but Aldridge, who won the League title and the FA Cup at Anfield, has taken things to a different level.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘The fact that this is the worst run of form since 1953 speaks volumes,’ said Aldridge. ‘The eyes of the world are on Liverpool and the critics are having a field day. We are becoming a laughing stock.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘At the moment being a Liverpool fan is just embarrassing and that’s something I haven’t had to say before.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘Liverpool are now in a crisis. Questions are being asked and they need to be answered. To have picked up eight points from the last 36 is shambolic. That’s relegation form.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘The team just seem to have lost their belief. You can blame the manager and the coaching staff but it comes down to the players. They are being paid unbelievable amounts of money and aren’t producing the goods. Some of them need to take a good look in the mirror.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘They need to realise how lucky they are and start doing it or their Anfield careers won’t last much longer. More than anything I want to see some pride. That’s all we’re playing for in the League now but there doesn’t seem to be much pride around.’</span></p>
              <p><span>Given the alarming way Liverpool’s campaign has unravelled, Dalglish, his assistant Steve Clarke and director of football Damien Comolli will all be asked at the end of the season to provide a written report to the club’s American owners, Fenway Sports Group.</span></p>

              <p><span>Though Liverpool have won the Carling Cup and could add the  FA Cup, they have rarely given the impression they could finish in the top four. Dalglish’s position is not under threat and the fact he will be asked for a written debrief shows there is no appetite to remove him in the summer.</span></p>

              Gerrard pleads for patience
              By ESPNsoccernet staff
              
              Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has asked the club's fans for patience as the Reds look to return to form following a poor run in the Premier League.
              
              Liverpool have lost six of their last seven matches in the league, resulting in the club slipping to eighth in the table, 16 points adrift of the Champions League places.
              
              The Reds have, however, won the Carling Cup this campaign, while they face rivals Everton at Wembley in the semi-finals of the FA Cup on April 14.
              
              Gerrard accepts Kenny Dalglish's team have been underperforming of late but is hopeful a turnaround is on the horizon as they host Aston Villa this weekend.
              
              "There are a lot of challenges ahead this season. I'd ask the supporters to be patient; we will get it right," Gerrard told the club's official website.
              
              "We have had a mixed March. We're in a league position we're not happy about and we need to look at ourselves and try to move up the league as soon as possible."
              =========================
              
              liverpool and some of its fans seem to think winning the carling cup is an achievement.
