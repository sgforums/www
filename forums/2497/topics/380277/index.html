              <p>Manuel Pellegrini faces the sack if <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Real Madrid</span></abbr> are beaten by Getafe on the weekend.</p>
              <p><em>Sport</em> says the ultimatum came just hours after Real's Copa del Rey humiliation by Alcorcon.</p>
              <p>The decision to dismiss Pellegrini would hit Real's finances hard. The
              Chilean is on a two-year deal at Real and would be due a massive €11
              million in compensation - the equivalent of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Cristiano Ronaldo</span></abbr>'s salary.</p>
              <p>Three losses, one draw and a win in the last five games is enough for
              Pellegrini's position to be questioned, however it was the manner of
              their Copa defeat which has most angered Real's board.</p>
              <p>Even victory over Getafe may not be enough should Real lose to Champions League opponents <abbr><span class="glossary-term">AC Milan</span></abbr> in Italy next week.</p>

              Manuel Pellegrini's position at the helm of los Merengues increasingly
              unclear, Florentino Perez is reputedly looking for potential

              <p>Real Madrid are following former Inter coach Roberto Mancini, hoping to open up dialogue with him should Manuel Pellegrini be dismissed.<br><br>According to <em>Il Corriere Dello Sport,</em> the Italian is in pole position to take the reigns at the Bernabeu if
              Los Merengues decide to part company with the Chilean coach. <br><br>The
              recent loss to third tier side Alcorcon in the Copa del Rey has sparked
              panic at the club and it is said that president Florentino Perez, who
              invested a record sum in the club this summer, is considering change.<br><br>Mancini
              has been out of work since being sacked by the Nerazzurri in 2008.
              However, his experience of managing a big dressing room with major
              stars makes him the ideal candidate. <br><br>Perez has made it clear
              that Pellegrini has time to turn things around. However, reports claim
              the clock is ticking and the coach has just 180 minutes of football to
              prove himself - matches against Getafe and Milan.<br><br>Luciano Spalletti's name has also made space in the Italian media, but he is close to Russian side Zenit St. Petersburg.</p>

              <p>haha ya they never learn their lessons. since like they tend to appoint coaches on a whim, in this case the board and the president whim. they should appoint someone who will bring trophies and long term growth in the future. they also want the club to play attractive football.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>wenger brings to mind, but he wont leave arsenal. the other is mourinho, he will bring you trophies, but his playing style isnt pretty, much like a professional and consistent style that will bring you results. alex ferguson is retiring soon and he also has no wish to join that mob club. how abt rafa, he bring trophies to valencia while there. at RM, rafa has no complaints about not bringing in players he wants.</p>
