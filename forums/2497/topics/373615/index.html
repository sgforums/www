              <h1>Zlatan overshadowed by magic Messi</h1>
              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Zlatan Ibrahimovic failed to
              impress as Champions League winners Barcelona beat Shakhtar Donetsk 1-0
              after extra time in the UEFA Super Cup.</span></strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/09/08/330/Pedro-and-Lionel-Messi-Barcelona-celeb_2353667.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Ibrahimovic, who moved from
              Inter Milan for £40million plus Samuel Eto'o, was completely
              overshadowed by Lionel Messi, who created the only goal for Pedro
              Rodriguez in the 115th minute.</p>
              <p>The Swedish striker will need to do much more to justify his
              price tag, especially with the likes of exciting young striker Bojan
              Krkic pushing for a place.</p>
              <p>UEFA Super Cups, the annual match between the winners of the
              Champions League and UEFA Cup, have rarely been classics and this was
              no exception.</p>
              <p>Barcelona had complained about the state of the pitch in the
              Stade Louis II stadium and with some justification - it was dry, rutted
              and horribly bobbly.</p>
              <p>Even so, and even without the injured Andres Iniesta, Barcelona
              still dominated against an unadventurous Shakhtar side packed with
              hard-running Ukrainians and only mildly spiced up by their four
              Brazilians.</p>
              <p>Shakhtar did not create a single opening in normal time while Barca at least showed some intent.</p>
              <p>Thierry Henry looked hungry and he was the first to threaten, a
              trademark dipped shoulder confusing his marker before he struck a
              rising shot which whistled over the crossbar.</p>
              <p>Dmytro Chygrynsky, playing his last game for Shakhtar before
              joining Barca, gave the ball away to Messi and then went in hard on the
              diminutive Argentinian to regain possession.</p>
              <p>A quick free-kick from Xavi saw Messi sting the fingers of
              Andriy Pyatov in the Shakhtar goal and the keeper recovered quickly to
              deny the lurking Henry.</p>
              <p>Barcelona claimed for a penalty after Messi's direct free-kick struck Olexandr Kucher's arm but the referee was unimpressed.</p>
              <p>If the first half had been disappointing, there was little to lift spirits in the second.</p>
              <p>Daniel Alves produced a hopeless blast into the stands and then
              Ibrahimovic produced his major contribution to the game, falling like a
              sniper victim under Olexiy Gai's challenge and bringing a yellow card
              for the defender.</p>
              <p>With the game drifting towards unwanted extra-time, Barcelona tried to step up a gear.</p>
              <p>Messi hit a fierce left-foot effort that Pyatov could only
              parry, and when the ball drifted out to Henry by the left touchline he
              took deliberate aim to loop a shot into the far corner but the Shakhtar
              keeper climbed just high enough to turn it over.</p>
              <p>Ibrahimovic continued to frustrate, failing to pass to Henry
              when he was clean through and then collapsing in the area theatrically
              under a fair challenge.</p>
              <p>Messi lit up the match with a Maradona-like dribble past four
              challenges only to be thwarted at the very last moment. Furious, he
              became involved in a pushing match with Kucher and both were booked.</p>
              <p>In the 98th minute Victor Valdes made his first save, diving low to keep out Julius Aghahowa's goal-bound shot.</p>
              <p>Bojan, on for Henry, could have wrapped it up with two chances
              before, having barely threatened, the Ukrainians were denied a blatant
              penalty when Ilsinho was felled.</p>
              <p>Shakhtar coach Mircea Luscescu stormed onto the pitch in fury
              but it was all in vain as Messi's brilliant pass set up Rodriguez for
              the latest of winners.</p>
