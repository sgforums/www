              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Wayne Rooney" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/wayne-rooney"><span style="color: #005689;">Wayne Rooney</span></a> has revealed that his wife, Coleen, will not be accompanying him to the World Cup in South Africa after partially endorsing the view of the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on England" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/england"><span style="color: #005689;">England</span></a> manager, <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Fabio Capello" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fabio-capello"><span style="color: #005689;">Fabio Capello</span></a>, and the captain, <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Rio Ferdinand" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/rio-ferdinand"><span style="color: #005689;">Rio Ferdinand</span></a>, that wives and girlfriends have been a distraction in the past.</p>
              <p>"If they want to come and support us there's nothing stopping them," he said. "Last time we were all together in the hotel and that was a bit of a problem. My wife's just had a baby so she's not going anyway."</p>
              <p>Last week Capello bristled when asked about the details of the Wags' accommodation in South Africa. "It is far enough when they stay out of the training ground, you understand?" he said. He had earlier announced that those wishing to travel would have to settle for weekly visits with the squad. "We're going to South Africa to play, not for a holiday," he added. "If they don't want to come for the day only, they should stay home."</p>
              <p>Asked if he thought the Wags had disrupted England's preparations at the World Cup in Germany, the England manager was scathing about their presence in the team hotel. "I think it will be [like a] virus, no?" he said. "I think so. I hope so. The same virus of the last World Cup."</p>
              <p>Capello, of course, was only an interested spectator of the antics in Baden-Baden, but Ferdinand has bitter memories of the episode. In 2008 he said Sven-Goran Eriksson's invitation for Wags and families turned the World Cup campaign into "a circus".</p>
              <p>"If I'm honest, we became a bit of a circus in terms of the whole Wag situation," said the defender. "It seemed like there was a big show around the whole England squad. It was like watching a theatre unfolding and football almost became a secondary element to the main event.</p>
              <p>"People were worrying more about what people were wearing and where they were going out, rather than the England football team. That then transposed itself into the team. That's said in hindsight. At the time we were caught up in the bubble ourselves. Being somewhere like Baden-Baden, walking around the town, there were paparazzi everywhere, our families were there. When you step back and look back at that, it was like a circus.</p>
              <p>"I'm not going to tell the other players what you should or should not do. But I just think that, as a squad, we were a bit too open, going out in and around Baden-Baden, and probably had too much contact with families. That's just my opinion. Some players may think they'd rather have that contact with their families.</p>
              <p>"But you're in a tournament and you don't get to play in many tournaments in your career. To give yourself the best chance, you have to be focused. Having the families around and the paparazzi that were following us, it was all a bit too close and the football wasn't really separated from it all."</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>having your family members with you shouldnt be an issue but having what he went thru during the last WC where wags are the main focus is a major issue.. they had to consider what they wear and where to go for dinner and so on.. it will pass on to their husband, as they would be nagging to their hubby about the clothes they didint bring along and so on.. and that would be a distraction</p></div>
