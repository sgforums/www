              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez has confirmed that </strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=13842"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Xabi Alonso</strong></span></a><strong> will be missing for the Premier League title chasers' crucial trip to West Ham United on Saturday.</strong></p>
              <p>The Spanish midfielder suffered severe bruising in the tackle that landed Newcastle United's <span style="color: #000000;">Joey Barton</span> a red card - and subsequently banishment from the club by his manager Alan Shearer - in last weekend's 3-0 win at Anfield.</p>
              <p>But the injury blow has been softened by the news that fellow midfielder <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=40380"><span style="color: #000000;">Javier Mascherano</span></a> has recovered from an ankle injury and hamstrung striker <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=24257"><span style="color: #000000;">Fernando Torres</span></a> have both been passed fit to travel with squad.</p>
              <p>"Xabi is not fit and cannot play," Benitez said. "We think maybe in the next week he will be okay. We had an idea that he could be fit for this game but in the end it was impossible. "Javier was training and is in the squad, and so is Fernando."</p>
              <p>Benitez will be hoping to call upon both stars against one of the meanest defences outside of the 'big four'. With the Hammers closing in on seventh spot and a place in the Europa League next season no quarter will be given at Upton Park.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Gianfranco Zola :</em> <em>aiming to pick up valuable points.</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><strong>West Ham manager Gianfranco Zola thinks his side still need a win and a draw from their last three games to book their place in Europe and is aiming to pick up valuable points against the Reds.</strong></p>
              <p>"It is another opportunity for us to beat a top team and also it has got double the value that if we win this game we have a great chance to get into Europe," Zola said. "We are just saying we need four points but we are going to try to get nine - that is the approach we have."</p>
              <p>Zola is determined to earn his first win against one of the league's top-four clubs as a manager, although he is wary of Liverpool's style away from home.</p>
              <p>"In my opinion they are a team you'd rather play at their home than away as if you look at their record away it must be one of the best in the Premier League," the Italian said.</p>
              <p>"So it is a really tough match for us but my players are determined to beat one of the really top sides. "We played Manchester United at home and Chelsea at home and we went very close and were unlucky. We keep trying as we lost against those teams but we learnt a lot from them and we are confident that Saturday is going to be a different game."</p>
              <p>Striker <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=20544"><span style="color: #000000;">Carlton Cole</span></a> is approaching a return from his groin injury but the Liverpool clash may come too soon.</p>

              <h2>BENITEZ STILL BELIEVES IN REDS</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/09/04/240/Rafael-Benitez-edited1_2221608.jpg" border="0" alt="Benitez - wants players to keep believing."><br><br></div>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Rafael Benitez has urged his Liverpool players not to lose their belief ahead of another vital Premier League clash away to West Ham tomorrow. Victory for the Reds at Upton Park will put them back on top of the table on goal difference, at least for 24 hours until leaders Manchester United face Manchester City at Old Trafford on Sunday.</strong></p>
              <p>But however hard Liverpool have chased the champions in these closing weeks of the campaign, the slip-ups that they crave have just not materialised.</p>
              <p>Arguably their last chance comes when United play their next three league matches in a week, with games against Wigan and Arsenal following the Manchester derby.</p>
              <p>Benitez, who will be without ankle-injury victim Xabi Alonso in east London on Saturday, said: "Every single week it has been an opportunity for us, to get three points and to put pressure on Manchester United.</p>
              <p>"We must keep winning, keep pushing and see what happens. It could be difficult for them against Manchester City, but United are a very good team with equally good players. "But you never know what could happen. It is up to us to win our games and be waiting."</p>
              <p>He added: "Maybe, hopefully, City can do us a favour. But there is nothing we can do about that match, only ours. "And I am not even sure whether I will be watching the game, there's nothing I can contribute so it may be better to just enjoy the day with my family.</p>
              <p>"But we have to believe. We have done well, we have been able to win a lot of games right at the end which shows our fitness. We have gained a lot of experience and the spirit has been fantastic among the players. "We will push right until the end. Even that will be of use to us in the future, but we still must believe we can do something this season, not wait for next."</p>
              <p>Benitez will have Fernando Torres (hamstring) and Javier Mascherano (ankle) fit to play, and maintains his own defiant belief that something could still disrupt Manchester United's relentless march toward retaining their crown.</p>
              <p>He said: "We have always talked about a twist in the end, maybe United will have problems against Manchester City or Arsenal in their run-in. "We have always known that this season was crucial to our development, but also that we must continue to have a positive approach to everything.</p>
              <p>"It has been good experience. But whatever people are saying about this season and our chances, we must maintain our concentration right to the end and stay focused in every game. "We have confidence we will be the closest challengers to United over the next few years. "But we have always felt we could win it this season, we have confidence in our squad and they have worked so hard. I hope I am answering in a different way in a fortnight, but we have gained a lot of experience whatever happens."</p>
              <p>Benitez paid tribute to the job Hammers boss Gianfranco Zola has done in his first management job. He says: "West Ham will be difficult. Zola is doing a good job, they are confident and playing well. "Zola was a fantastic player and now he is showing he can be a fine manager, he is doing a good job there.</p>
              <p>"It was a little difficult for him at the start, it always is when a new manager takes over. But he is clever, he knows the league and what to do, he will make a good manager. "But we know we have to win. A point is not good enough so the message is very clear to my players, win and increase the pressure ahead of United's game on Sunday."</p>
