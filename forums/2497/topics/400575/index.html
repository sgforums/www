              <h1>Former Liverpool owner David Moores 'hugely regrets' selling club to
               George Gillett and Tom Hicks and calls on American pair to stand aside<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Former Liverpool owner David Moores has admitted he 'hugely regrets 
              selling the club' to George Gillett and Tom Hicks, and called for the 
              Americans to ‘stand aside’ and not ‘punish the supporters any more’.</p>
              <p>Moores
               asserted that his successors - who bought the club three years ago in a
               deal worth £202million and which saw Moores walk away with £88m - ‘risk
               damaging a sporting institution of global reknown and if they have a 
              conscience or nobility they will stand aside and allow new owners to 
              take over the club.’</p>

              Hicks</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The American duo leveraged the club with debt, which currently stands
               at £351m. But Moores rejected claims that the due diligence process was
               not properly carried out.</p>
              <p>‘We had looked at George Gillett’s 
              affairs in detail and he came up to scratch,’ wrote Moores.</p>
              <p>‘To a 
              great extent, we took Tom Hicks on trust, on George’s say-so.’</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>

              </div>
              <p>Of the share offer, Moores contended it ‘was laid out in unambiguous 
              terms... the document pledged there would be no debt placed upon the 
              club, and significant funds would be made available for investment in 
              the squad and the new stadium.’</p>
              <p>In a letter to The Times, Moores 
              accepts that 'honest mistakes' were made despite him acting 'in the best
               interests of the club'.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Tom Hicks hit back at David Moores after the former Liverpool owner claimed he bitterly regretted his decision to sell the club to the Texan and George Gillett.</strong></p>
              <p>As the turmoil on Merseyside cast further doubt over the futures of Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard, Moores called on the unpopular American pair to leave Anfield while admitting that sufficient background checks had not been carried out on Hicks when the £202million deal went through in 2007.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool</span></a> are now £351m in debt but Hicks responded to Moores’ comments by claiming the club are in better shape than three years ago as he and Gillett seek a buyer prepared to meet their £800m asking price.</p>
              <p>He said: ‘I’m disappointed because I think we’ve done everything we can to improve the club. The truth is the club is much better off than it was three years ago.</p>
              <p>'We’ve grown our sponsorships from £40m annually in the last year of Moores’ ownership to close to £100m this coming year.</p>
              <p>‘We will have more than doubled the gross and net transfer spending on players. We will sell the club but not to the wrong group or at the wrong price.’</p>
              <p>Moores had called on the Americans to ‘stand aside with dignity’ and urged them: ‘Don’t punish the supporters any more.’</p>
              <p>He admitted to making ‘honest mistakes’ in agreeing to sell but claimed that Steve Morgan, now the owner of Wolves, was one of the shareholders who had put pressure on him to do so.</p>
              <p>Morgan responded by saying: ‘I would disagree with that statement. Perhaps if he had done some due diligence at the time then it wouldn’t have happened, but we are where we are.’</p>
              <p>Moores also came under fire from supporters groups who have not forgotten that he pocketed £88m from the deal — £8m more than if he had sold to Dubai International Capital</p>
              <p>Les Lawson, of the LFC Official Supporters’ Club, said: ‘It was on Moores’ recommendation that the shareholders agreed to sell the club to the Americans. Rick Parry (former chief executive) famously said, “We only sell the family silverware once, we have to get it right”. Well, they couldn’t have got it more wrong.’</p>
              <p>Jay McKenna, spokesman for fans group Spirit of Shankly, said: ‘What will anger fans is that, while checks were done on George Gillett, Tom Hicks rolled up and Moores took Gillett’s word for him.</p>
              <p>‘You only have to look at Hicks’ past record. He’s got a track record of this kind of thing. Some people will want an apology from Moores as they will see he played a part.’</p>
              <p>The controversy erupted on the 25th anniversary of the Heysel tragedy, with Liverpool officials unveiling a plaque in a private ceremony at Anfield. It also came amid increasing uncertainty over Torres and Gerrard staying at the club this summer. </p>
              <p>Although Hicks insisted none of the top players will be sold and promised more money for new signings, manager Rafael Benitez is still unclear whether he will be given profits from player sales to reinvest.</p>
              <p>Torres pointedly refused to pledge his future to the club when asked about it at a news conference for Spain’s World Cup squad, saying: ‘I am aware of the situation at the club, but I’m trying to stay apart from it now and focus on the national team.</p>
              <p>'When the World Cup is over we  will see what happens. My future is the World Cup.’</p>
              <p>Liverpool and Spain team-mate Pepe Reina welcomed Moores’ comments but warned change was urgently needed to revive the club.</p>
              <p>Reina said: ‘It’s a good move from Mr Moores but we have to move quickly and anything that happens has to be right.</p>
              <p>‘We have to be less optimistic than the last few years and get ready for setting another kind of target maybe.’</p>
              <p>Hicks claimed a deal to sell the club could be done before the end of the year, but he admitted earlier it may take another 18 months.</p>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish insists the club will not go backwards despite their current ownership issues and speculation about the futures of manager Rafael Benitez and star players Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard.</strong></p>
              <p>Former chairman David Moores yesterday gave a full and frank account of his reasons for selling to American owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett in 2007.</p>
              <p>After a tumultuous three-year reign the pair officially put the club, whose parent company Kop Holdings have debts of £351million with interest payments of £40million a year, up for sale last month.</p>
              <p>That has led to increased instability off the pitch with constant conjecture about whether the manager and players will remain at Anfield.</p>
              <p>Torres did little to quell that speculation yesterday when he side-stepped questions about his future, while Jose Mourinho, whose appointment as Real Madrid boss appears imminent, has spoken of his admiration for Gerrard.</p>
              <p>However, Dalglish said the club was bigger than any individual.</p>
              <p>"Liverpool FC is much more important than any one individual - it always has been and always will be," said the Reds former player and manager, who now has an ambassadorial role with the club's academy.</p>
              <p>"It will move forwards and move upwards.</p>
              <p>"It is not the greatest time in the club's history at this time but I don't think they will start to go backwards."</p>
              <p>Dalglish, voted Liverpool's greatest player, also said he had some sympathy with Moores for reacting to the criticism aimed at him for selling to the Americans.</p>
              <p>"David has got his own opinions and wanted to get something off his chest but everyone knows where David's heart lies," Dalglish told Sky Sports News.</p>
              <p>Two other Liverpool greats, Alan Kennedy and John Aldridge, have joined the growing calls for Hicks and Gillett to engineer a swift sale.</p>
              <p>Kennedy, a two-time European Cup winner, said the current state of uncertainty had affected the team this season, which saw Liverpool finish seventh - their worst league placing for 11 years.</p>
              <p>"We have to move on. We are stagnating and it has shown in the performances of the players, who have been disappointing as well," said the 55-year-old.</p>
              <p>Former striker Aldridge was more outspoken, criticising Hicks and Gillett for loading huge debts on the club and dismissing the former's claims that Liverpool were in a better position now than they were three years ago.</p>
              <p>"Any club that is losing £110,000 a day (on loan repayments) is in big trouble - whether they are Liverpool or not," he said.</p>
              <p>"We are in a massive mess. It is ridiculous to say we are in a good situation - absolutely ludicrous."</p>
              <p>Aldridge does take some comfort from the fact that the off-field problems may result in increased stability in the dressing room after speculation about Benitez.</p>
              <p>"The manager's future looks more tenable at the moment," he added.</p>
              <p>"There is no stability at the club and to lose the manager as well would put them in disarray.</p>
              <p>"Would the two Americans really replace Rafael Benitez considering they don't know an awful lot about football?"</p>
              <p>The future of some players seems less secure and Mourinho did his bit to encourage any seeds of doubt which were growing in the mind of Gerrard.</p>
              <p>"I like players in the final part of their careers," said the Portuguese.</p>
              <p>"I love to have some players who are 33 or 34 years old...they are players that you buy and you won't recover this money, but if they give you good performances for two or three years you've got your money's worth.</p>
              <p>"Both (Gerrard and Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard) are great players who always give everything."</p>
