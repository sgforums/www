              <p><strong>Aston Villa defender Martin Laursen has confirmed he will announce his retirement at a press conference on Friday. </strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/aston-villa/laursen_tongue.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>The 31-year-old former Denmark international, who joined from
              Milan in 2004, has suffered a succession of knee injuries in recent
              years and he has now told the Danish press he will not attempt a
              comeback. </strong></p>
              <p>“I will announce tomorrow [Friday] that I am finished with football,” he told BT.</p>
              <p>“This time, it would be even harder to recover than before.
              Because it would take a minimum of one year to recover and I had just
              one year left on my contract, I decided to stop now.</p>
              <p>“I am pleased with what I achieved during my career. I am proud
              of the matches I’ve played and I’m proud of what I did for Aston Villa.</p>
              <p>“My only regret is that I did not come to England sooner. That is where I have been happiest.</p>
              <p>“Here, my abilities were really appreciated.</p>
              <p>“It’s hard to imagine life without football, but I’m moving to
              Copenhagen now and then I’ll just enjoy spending time with my
              girlfriend and my son.</p>
              <p>“I miss Denmark.”</p>
              <p>Denmark boss Morten Olsen hailed Laursen for his ability and character.</p>
              <p>“Martin has had an enormous impact on the Danish national team
              with his determination and winning mentality, but he’s also a great guy
              in general,” he said.</p>
              <p>“You couldn’t find an easier player to work with.”</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Aston Villa confirm Laursen retirement</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p>Aston Villa have announced skipper Martin Laursen is retiring.</p>
              <p>Laursen was faced with a lengthy rehabilitation period on his right
              knee before he would return to full fitness and has opted to retire
              rather than undergo another major operation.</p>
              <p>Laursen joined Villa in the summer of 2004, however, his
              formative years at the club were plagued by a troublesome left knee
              injury which also restricted him during his earlier spell at AC Milan.</p>
              <p>The Dane had seemingly shaken off those concerns in recent
              years as he established himself as a rock at the heart of coach Martin
              O'Neill's defence, his good form earning the reward of the Villa
              captaincy at the start of this season.</p>
              <p>But after injuring his right knee in January, Laursen retired
              from international football with Denmark before his decision today to
              call an end to his football career completely.</p>
              <p>"Villa are sad to announce Martin Laursen's retirement from football," a statement on the club's website www.avfc.co.uk read.</p>
              <p>"The club captain made the decision after being faced with another lengthy spell on the sidelines.</p>
              <p>"He elected to hang up his boots rather than undergo another major operation - this time on his right knee.</p>
              <p>"The retirement of the lion-hearted defender will be a huge loss to the players, manager and fans."</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p>Aston Villa captain Martin Laursen has explained his decision to retire.</p>
              <p>The former Denmark international, who made 53 appearances for his
              country, said: "I cannot recover from my knee injury so I have to
              retire.</p>
              <p>"Over the last few weeks I've had to decide whether to go ahead
              with another operation or to retire. My decision was to retire as it
              would have been a very big and difficult operation. At this point it is
              better for my health and future life."</p>
              <p>Laursen, who admitted the last two seasons have been the best
              of his playing career, added: "It is so strange, so weird that I've
              made an announcement that I will no longer play again whereas half a
              year ago I was flying.</p>
              <p>"I was in the best shape of my life and playing every game. It is weird and I am really sad.</p>
              <p>"Football has always been my life. I've been a professional
              since 1997 and done nothing else. I am looking at the positives that I
              returned from my previous operation and was playing the best football
              of my life.</p>
              <p>"I'm now almost 32 and you cannot play football forever. You have to stop some time."</p>
              <p>Laursen paid credit to Villa manager, Martin O'Neill, who himself had to quit playing because of a knee injury.</p>
              <p>He said: "Martin O'Neill has been very helpful and has allowed me to take my time in making a decision.</p>
              <p>"I can honestly say there have been more positives than negatives since he took over as manager."</p>
