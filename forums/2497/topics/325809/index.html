              <p><strong>Tottenham will use the cash from Robbie Keane's £20million 'transfer' to Liverpool  to complete a sensational double capture of David Bentley and Andrei Arshavin.</strong></p>
              <p>Spurs Juande Ramos has been handed £34m by the White Hart Lane hierarchy and will sign Blackburn and England winger Bentley today for around £15m before pursuing Russia's Euro 2008 star Arshavin.</p>
              <p>Wantaway Bentley, who was undergoing a medical in London this morning, will finally get his move after Rovers gave up hope of persuading him to stay. And Arshavin will sign from UEFA Cup winners Zenit St Petersburg in a £19m switch, according to <span style="font-style: italic;">The Daily Mirror</span>.</p>
              <p>This double swoop should appease White Hart Lane fans - although chairman Daniel Levy also has emergency plans to buy another striker if the right offer comes in for Dimitar Berbatov - widely thought to be Arshavin's international team-mate Roman Palyuvchenko.</p>
              <p>The Spartak Moscow striker will cost Tottenham £12m. Bentley is set to agree terms on a £50,000-a-week contract at Tottenham today, but is sure to accept - even if the deal is not much more than he could have banked at Ewood Park until his fall-out there.</p>
              <p>Sportsmail online understands that the deal for Arshavin is close to being finalised after the clubs agreed a fee, and he will sign subject to a work permit. Boss Juande Ramos saw Spurs' money men come up with an improved offer yesterday and Zenit, who had been hoping for as much as £24m, reluctantly let their captain go.</p>
              <p>It is a major coup for Spurs, reeling from the loss of Keane to Liverpool, and they have beaten Barcelona for Arshavin, with the Catalans only rating him at £15m.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Well, I think if they are planning to sell Berbatov, they should have a huge budget to buy new players... As it is, they have already received more from the transfer fee than they have spent... A few players to Sunderland and Keane's deal to Pool have seen them generate over $40m... And if they add Berbatov in there... it could be about $70 million from sales alone... so you see, they didn't even come out one cent yet from their own pocket this season...</p></div>
