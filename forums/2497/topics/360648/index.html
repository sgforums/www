              <p> </p>
              <p>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson is ready to risk the wrath of
                  Newcastle United and Middlesbrough fans by fielding a rookie XI against
                  Hull City this Sunday.</p>
              <p>The Daily Mail says Gary Neville, Nani and Darren Fletcher will all
                  start, but the rest of the XI will be relative rookies as Ferguson
                  keeps his stars in cotton wool for their Champions League final against
                  Barcelona.</p>
              <p>Ferguson is aware of the criticism he will receive if he fields a team
                  of youngsters against Hull because Newcastle - who are at Aston Villa
                  on the same day - will definitely be relegated if United lose.</p>
              <p><strong><br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>A likely United XI</strong>:<br> (4-4-2): Ben Amos; Gary Neville, James Chester, Craig Cathcart, Richard
                  Eckersley; Nani, Darron Gibson, Darren Fletcher, Zoran Tosic; Kiko
                  Macheda, Danny Welbeck.</p>

              <p>The number of footballers on the books of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span></a> clubs will be drastically reduced if radical plans to overhaul squad sizes are approved.</p>
              <p>League rules could be dramatically redrawn early next month, with a new limit on the size of squads for a -season – perhaps as low as 25 players, but more likely around 30. If the new rule is agreed, clubs would have to stick with those players regardless of injuries and suspensions until, at least, the January transfer window.</p>
              <p>The news, welcomed by Uefa, comes following The Observer's recent report into the "Anfield 62", <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">the number of players currently on the books at Liverpool. Arsenal have</span></span> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">59, Manchester United 51 and Chelsea 46</span>.</span> The new rule – which needs support from 14 of the 20 clubs to be passed – would mean the "big four" clubs picking from the same number of players as, say, Bolton, who have the -Premier League's smallest squad of 27. The average squad size is just over 40.</p>
              <p>The idea won immediate support from Bolton. Phil Gartside, the club's chairman, said he would be firmly behind the introduction of a squad-limit rule. "Yeah, we'd go for that," Gartside said of the plan, which has been proposed by the Premier League. "It's a good idea. And my manager thinks it's a good idea," he added, after discussing it directly with Gary Megson. Asked if there was a general feeling among some clubs that it would be a good change to the rules, Gartside said: "I've no idea, it's not been discussed." But he pledged to canvass support for the proposal from his fellow chairmen.</p>
              <p>The plan comes in tandem with the Premier League's promise to adopt, from the 2010-11 season, -quotas of "homegrown" players – those who have been brought through a club's youth system. Talks are ongoing on whether the quota should apply to a matchday squad or a first-team squad named for the whole season. David Taylor, chief executive of Uefa, the European governing body who have taken the lead in adopting limits on squad sizes for their own competitions, told Observer Sport that his organisation would back the plans. "I'm very pleased to hear that not only are -they -discussing these things, but the likelihood is they may well adopt one or two ideas. It would be beneficial for the -English game in general, so I'm very keen to see what happens."</p>
              <p>Uefa do not always enjoy smooth relations with the Premier League. The president, Michel Platini, has been a consistent critic of the level of debt accumulated by clubs.</p>
              <p>The Premier League confirmed that during their summer meeting in the first week of June a day will be spent discussing how best to implement the "home-grown" player quotas. Experts in the field have been invited to offer advice. Clubs might have to select as many as eight "home-grown" players – those who, under Uefa's definition, have trained with a club for three successive years between the ages of 15 and 21.</p>
              <p>Taylor said he would be happy to offer advice, though the Premier League have not invited any Uefa representation to next month's meeting.</p>
              <p>"They are big enough themselves to come to their own conclusions," said Taylor. "Richard Scudamore [the -Premier League's chief executive] is in touch from time to time, so we talk. It's up to them."</p>
              <p>A Premier League spokesperson said last night: "The 20 Premier League clubs will -discuss various home-grown player systems at their summer meeting and decisions will flow from that."</p>
              <p>If the clubs do adopt the squad limits the Premier League will, according to Taylor, become the first in Europe to do so. "I really do hope they do it, because I really think it's in the best interests of the game."</p>

              <p><strong>Alan Shearer has been taking tips from his former Newcastle boss Sir Bobby Robson as he attempts to drag the club back from the brink of disaster.</strong></p>
              <p>The 38-year-old was plunged in at the deep end when he agreed to take over at St James' Park for the final eight games of a traumatic season which will come to a dramatic conclusion at Aston Villa on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Shearer freely admits he has drawn upon the expertise of several of the men under whom he worked during his illustrious playing career, with the likes of Robson, Terry Venables and Kenny Dalglish having made major impressions on him.</p>
              <p>However, the 76-year-old, currently fighting his latest battle against cancer, has been in regular touch with his Magpies captain over the last few weeks and has been able to pass on some useful advice.</p>
              <p>Shearer said: "Yes, I speak to Bobby on a regular basis. "We speak to each other quite regularly after games and before games. "He has given me little bits here and there, which is great. It's nice to speak to him."</p>
              <p>Robson, of course, guided the club to successive fourth, third and fifth-place league finishes during a five-year reign which re-established them as genuine challengers at both home and abroad.</p>
              <p>He also reached FA Cup and UEFA Cup semi-finals and guided them into the second group stage of the Champions League in 2002-03, a far cry from the mire in which they now find themselves.</p>
              <p>The former England boss was among the crowd at St James' on Saturday when Newcastle saw their hopes of easing themselves out of trouble blown apart by Fulham and referee Howard Webb's controversial decision to rule out Mark Viduka's equaliser.</p>
              <p>Shearer was furious with that call, but admitted he could not complain about the red card he showed French defender Sebastien Bassong from his 60th-minute challenge on Diomansy Kamara.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Relegation-threatened </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Newcastle</strong></span><strong> have lost their appeal against Sebastien Bassong's dismissal on Saturday.</strong></p>
              <p>The 22-year-old Frenchman was shown a straight red card by referee Howard Webb after tangling with <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/fulham.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Fulham</span></a> striker Diomansy Kamara. Bassong will now miss the club's final Barclays Premier League game of the season at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/aston-villa.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Aston Villa</span></a> on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Manager Alan Shearer is facing a major selection headache, with Habib Beye struggling with a hamstring injury while strikers Michael Owen, whose scan showed no seriuos cause for concern, and Obafemi Martins both battling groin problems.</p>
              <p>A draw against Villa would keep Newcastle in the top flight providing Hull lose at home to Manchester United - although they would have to win if the Tigers got a point.</p>
              <p>A victory for Phil Brown's men would ensure they finished above the Magpies regardless of what happens at Villa Park.</p>

              one of the reasons why Newcastle is down and out is simply,it changed too many managers in a season.
              
              which club changed its manager or coaches 3 times during a season? Newcastle did.
              
              To think that Newcastle once played in the CL during Sir Bobby Robson's time. Freddy Sheperd was crazy to replace Robson with a loser Souness.

              <p>restrict to 30? then we can probably see english teams losing to other country teams as they don't have that restriction.</p>
              <p>+ it's really giving a boost to the lower ranked clubs. Not in terms of cutting down the number of excesses the big clubs have. But simply because the bigger/more successful clubs are involved in more matches and fronts. Man U was involved in 5 trophy challenges this session, and are presently involved in 2. while all the smaller clubs have to worry about is 1 or 2.</p>
