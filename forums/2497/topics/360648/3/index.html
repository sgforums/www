                  Congratulations to Liverpool football club on winning the "we beat
                  Manchester Utd twice" cup for the 08-09 season, following in the
                  illustrious footsteps of Manchester City in 07/08 and West Ham in
                  06/07.<br>
                  I look forward to the commemorative mugs, t-shirts, posters, dvds
                  etc that will no doubt follow such a remarkable achievement.<br>
                  Well done to Liverpool FC and Rafa Benitez on another fantastic
                  trophy filled season.</span></p>

                  If MU wins the Euro...but Pool already beat them twice...but Boro also beat Pool before...So Boro is considered the best team in Europe? LOL!!! Stoke also drew with Pool,so Stoke is the 2nd best team in Europe??? LOL!!!
                  
                  Oh ya forgot about the World Club win,if go by the above reasoning(which deluded and "We won 18 titles when policemen wore shorts" Pool fans like to do), then Boro is the BEST TEAM in the world!  Then how come they are fighting for Premiership life? LOL!

              <p>I think there is a difference between a good banter and argument. There are some people who just can't have that (a healthy discussion)...Yes, there is a fierce rivalry between Liverpool and Manure but please do not call others stupid or calling names (ice fat boy, please note this)...Not everybody has a same opinion, need to respect each other opinion and don't force yours into others. </p>

              <h1>Fergie has every right to field weakened United team against Hull, claims Premier League chief Scudamore<br></h1>
              <p> </p>

              <p><em>Decision time: United manager Sir Alex Ferguson</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Barclays Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore believes Sir Alex Ferguson has every right to field a weakened team against </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/hull-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Hull</strong></span></a><strong> on Sunday.</strong> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United</span></a> face Barcelona in the Champions League final on Wednesday and, having already wrapped up the domestic title, Ferguson is expected to rest the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Nemanja Vidic.   </p>
              <p>That could have ramifications at the bottom of the table as Hull are still battling it out with <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/sunderland.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Sunderland</span></a>, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/newcastle-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Newcastle</span></a> and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/middlesbrough.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Middlesbrough</span></a> to avoid relegation on the last day of the season.   </p>
              <p>Scudamore told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'You can't alter the fact they've won the league and they've got the most significant game the following Wednesday against Barcelona.</p>
              <p>'You have to be realistic: they've got a squad, and therefore you can't argue that they deploy the benefit of that squad in a game on Sunday.'  </p>
              <p>Whatever side Ferguson chooses, Scudamore still believes United will be going all out for the win. 'They are the most professional of professional football clubs,' he said.</p>
              <p>'Sir Alex Ferguson's going to put a team out that he intends to win that game on Sunday.'</p>

              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has urged worried north-east football fans not to fret about the Manchester United team he will turn out at Hull on Sunday.</strong></p>
              <p>With Middlesbrough, Newcastle and Sunderland all facing the prospect of relegation from the Premier League, they are placing their faith in Ferguson's team not to roll over at the KC Stadium to effectively allow Phil Brown's side to survive.</p>
              <p>All three clubs have distanced themselves from speculation they might be tempted to launch a legal fight against United should their team be so weak it fails to provide Hull with any kind of resistance.</p>
              <p>However, just days before a Champions League final against Barcelona, they are acutely aware that Ferguson will rest almost all his senior players to prevent any risk of injury.</p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>The provisional squad named for Sunday's game is: </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Kuszczak, Amos, Neville, Brown, De Laet, Ferdinand, Chester, Eckersley, Simpson, Fabio, Nani, Fletcher, Gibson, Tosic, Martin, Drinkwater, Macheda, Welbeck. </strong></p>

              <p>Field a strong first XI, and they will get blamed for fielding a side that is playing half-heartedly to prevent fatigue and injury.</p>
              <p>Field an inexperienced second XI, and they will get blamed for fielding a weaker side.</p>
