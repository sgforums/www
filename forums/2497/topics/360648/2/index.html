              <h1>Why Manchester United playing a weakened team would be good news for Hull's relegation rivals</h1>

              <p> </p>
              <div id="article-body">
              <p><strong>I don't want Hull City to get a free pass to another season of Premier League football on Sunday. I don't want them to have an unfair advantage over Alan Shearer's Newcastle, Middlesbrough and Sunderland when relegation frenzy takes hold at 4pm.</strong></p>
              <p>I don't want the other three teams to stare at the final table with bitterness in their hearts, thinking Hull had it easy because they were playing a side that didn't care.</p>
              <p>That's why I hope Sir Alex Ferguson picks a weakened Manchester United side at the KC Stadium. That's why I hope he leaves out Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Ryan Giggs for the crunch game against Phil Brown's strugglers.</p>
              <p>Because a team of United fringe players, a team of hungry kids and reserves with a point to prove, is the best chance Middlesbrough, Newcastle and Sunderland have got.</p>
              <p>I'd like to see Nani out on the wing, dying to prove a point to Fergie after being left on the sidelines for so much of this season. I'd like to see Danny Welbeck up front, trying to live up to the assertion Ferguson made on Sunday that he'd force his way into Fabio Capello's World Cup squad next season. And I'd like to see Federico Macheda alongside him, bursting to recreate the glory of the crucial winners he scored against Aston Villa and Sunderland.</p>
              <p>Partly, it's because I want United to have the best chance of beating Barcelona in Rome three days later. For that to happen, Ronaldo and Rooney have to be as fresh as possible and not carrying any knocks.</p>
              <p>But partly it's because that for a match like Sunday, when United have nothing to play for but pride, Welbeck, Macheda and Gibson represent the best they have to offer. Even if Ferguson played Ronaldo in Hull, do you really think the World Footballer of the Year's heart would be in it knowing he was facing one of the biggest matches of his life so soon afterwards? Of course it wouldn't. No chance.</p>
              <p>The title's won. He wouldn't have any appetite for getting kicked up in the air by Andy Dawson every five minutes. But Gibson will be up for it. He'll be up for every challenge. So will Welbeck. It'll mean everything to them.</p>
              <p>Yes, I understand what Neil Warnock said on the radio on Monday night when he recalled looking up at a television screen on the final day of the 2006-07 season and seeing the team Ferguson had picked to play West Ham. He said it knocked the stuffing out of him.</p>
              <p>Ferguson rested Ronaldo, Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic because United were playing in the FA Cup Final the following week. United lost. Sheffield United went down. For Warnock, it was a bitter, bitter pill to swallow.</p>
              <p>The dynamic this time is slightly different. Ferguson has the Champions League Final to think of, a match that is one of the most important in his entire career, an opportunity that comes along only rarely even for a manager of his calibre and a club of United's size and tradition.</p>
              <p>He has a duty to his club to rest established stars that is far clearer than when he chose to omit players ahead of an FA Cup Final that was seven days away. Still, the team he put out that May day against West Ham two years ago went like this: Edwin van der Sar, Wes Brown, John O'Shea, Patrice Evra (Ryan Giggs, 58), Gabriel Heinze, Darren Fletcher, Kieran Richardson, Michael Carrick (Paul Scholes, 58), Alan Smith (Cristiano Ronaldo, 58), Wayne Rooney, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>
              <p>Not a bad side, all things considered. That's the point: the key wasn't in the line-up. It was in the attitude. "West Ham couldn't have come to Old Trafford on a better day," Ferguson said afterwards. "We had already won the league title and the edge was off our game."</p>
              <p>The same thing will apply on Sunday. It will be about attitude, not reputation. And that's why Gibson, Macheda, Welbeck and Ji-Sung Park might just turn into Hull City's worst nightmare.</p>

              <p>Lemme just say this.....</p>
              <p>Newcastle and Boro may whine and complain about Fergie being unsporting by fielding a weakened side, but let's face it: if your team has to depend on another team's performance in order to prevent relegation, then your team is seriously bad. Period.</p>
              <p>What Fergie is doing is tactically sound: test out new and inexperienced players for an inconsequential game while resting the specialists for a far more important international final. After all, even Man Utd's second XI is not something to be scoffed at, anyway.</p>
              <p>As other people have pointed out, Boro and Newcastle have had 37 games to do good. It wasn't Fergie's fault that they played poorly in those 37 games, and so there's no point in blaming Fergie for this 38th game if they do get relegated.</p>

              <p>Well, I reckon the MUFC reserves will be going all out to prove apoint against Hull. This will surely take the Tigers by surprise.</p>

              <p>I belief putting the reserved would be more effective as even if Fergie put the first team out, who will have the interest to play their hearts out knowing if getting injured would mean missing out on a chance to play in the biggest final of the year?</p>
              <p>We saw how the first team played against Arsenal when they already felt the title was won and their families were getting ready to celebrate...</p>
              <p>So playing the 2nd team would have a greater chance but we must not forget the huge incentive Hull will have... They know their fate is in their own hands... What happen in their stadium will be good enough and they don't need to look elsewhere for help... This alone could fire them to play hard, play well and stay in the Premiership. Even a half-hearted first team will find them difficult... But all these is irrelevant if Newcastle can't beat Villa at Villa Park...</p>
              <p>One thing I find would be interesting would be the half-time scores... When they all going in at around the same time and coming out knowing what they need... lol</p>

              <p class="heading"> </p>
              <p><strong>Neil Warnock has told Newcastle United, Sunderland and Middlesbrough to concentrate on their own problems and forget about which team Manchester United will field against Hull City on Sunday. The former Sheffield United manager has not forgiven Sir Alex Ferguson for selecting a weakened team against West Ham United on the final day of the 2006-07 season. West Ham won 1-0 at Old Trafford in May 2007 – a result which kept them up and relegated the Yorkshire club.</strong></p>
              <p>Ferguson is expected to play another weakened team at the KC Stadium, even though his controversial decision could lead to Hull staying up and two from Newcastle, Sunderland and Middlesbrough going down.</p>
              <p>“What will they do [to United]? Fine them two bob? Slap their wrist?” Warnock, who now manages Crystal Palace, said. "It just won't happen. It's just the luck of the draw. It's just how it happens, that's life. At the end of the day Newcastle still have to get a result at Villa and Sunderland have to get a result, possibly. They have to worry about themselves."</p>
              <p>A report this morning suggested that Newcastle, Sunderland and Middlesbrough could sue United if Hull overcome a weakened side to survive at their expense. "I can't see people suing Sir Alex and his club, it is just one of those things,” Warnock said. "I have every respect for him, I always have over the years - although I lost a little respect for him that day [when Sheffield United were relegated]. But I am sure that doesn't bother him or anyone else."</p>
              <p>The chances of Newcastle being relegated will increase dramatically if Hull win. "It is disappointing when you do see they [Manchester United] are not playing their top men but Sir Alex is single-minded and I don't think for one minute he will be concerned, when he picks his team, what happened to Neil Warnock or what happens to Alan Shearer or Phil Brown," Warnock said.</p>
              <p>“Manchester United's youngsters can always get a result against anybody on their day and the thing Hull haven't got is [Carlos] Tevez. He was a world-class player playing for West Ham that day and I don't think they would have beaten Manchester United that day if they hadn't had Tevez. “</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson intends to field a strong line-up against Hull City on Sunday.</p>
              <p><em>The Sun</em> says after a day of talks between Premier League chiefs
              and the clubs, United have promised they will change their plans for
              the weekend.</p>
              <p>Boss Alex Ferguson kicked off the compromise by saying Rio
              Ferdinand must prove his fitness at Hull ahead of the Champions League
              final three days later.</p>
              <p>But United are now also likely to deflect any potential
              criticism by starting with the likes of Tomas Kuszczak, Gary Neville
              and Park Ji Sung.</p>
              <p>Darren Fletcher is already pencilled in as he is suspended for the Barcelona clash.</p>
              <p>That is a major shift from Fergie’s original plan — which
              angered relegation candidates Middlesbrough, Newcastle and Sunderland —
              to play only Fletcher from his normal starting XI.</p>

              <p>Lemme just say this.....</p>
              <p>Newcastle and Boro may whine and complain about Fergie being
              unsporting by fielding a weakened side, but let's face it: if your
              team has to depend on another team's performance in order to
              prevent relegation, then your team is seriously bad. Period.</p>
              <p>What Fergie is doing is tactically sound: test out new and
              inexperienced players for an inconsequential game while resting the
              specialists for a far more important international final. After
              all, even Man Utd's second XI is not something to be scoffed at,
              anyway.</p>
              <p>As other people have pointed out, Boro and Newcastle have had 37
              games to do good. It wasn't Fergie's fault that they played poorly
              in those 37 games, and so there's no point in blaming Fergie for
              this 38th game if they do get relegated.</p>

              <p>you probably can find anything about YNWA in the www and trying to turn away from answering... hahahahahahaha... thats a good one.. as for Liverpool being able to field 2nd 3rd or whatever that they had is of course possible... just any guy being registered can play but against ManU 2nd sting????? hahahahaha... you gotta be kidding yourself if you indeed think they can rival that of ManU.. but whatever it is... go check the www and then see if there is similar topics in it and cut and paste here as "your" personal tots.....</p>
