              <h2>Romanian striker Adrian Mutu has described his FIFA sentence as inhumane.</h2>
              <p>Fiorentina's 29-year-old attacker Adrian Mutu was sacked by Chelsea
              following a failed drugs test, but has since resumed his footballing
              career in Serie A. Now, though, the player has been <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>told to pay the
              Blues €17m</strong></span></span> to compensate revenue losses suffered by the Premiership
              club as a result of his ban. <br><br>The player has enjoyed a change
              in fortunes since he moved to Italy, putting his troubled past behind
              him. However, it seems as though bad luck has finally caught up with
              him. In 2003 Chelsea paid Parma €22.4m for Mutu's transfer, but after
              the player's failed cocaine test the club moved to terminate his
              contract.  <br><br>Mutu moved to Juventus in 2005 in order to start a
              new adventure after his sacking, before thriving in Florence with La
              Viola. FIFA's sentence has been met with shock from the striker, who
              believes that the punishment is unfair. “My lawyers are examining the
              case,” confirmed the Fiorentina number ten.  <br><br>“Surely this is an
              inhumane and unjust punishment,” moaned the Romanian, adding, “I don't
              think I did something so terrible as to warrant this kind of
              punishment. For this reason, I believe we will appeal.”</p>

              <div id="ds-firstpara" class="ds-firstpara"><strong>World players' union FIFPro have pledged their support to Adrian Mutu as he prepares to appeal against FIFA's order that he should pay former club Chelsea £13.68million.</strong></div>
              <div id="va-bodytext" class="va-bodytext">FIFA's dispute resolution chamber announced on Thursday that Mutu must make the compensation payment after testing positive for cocaine while at Stamford Bridge in 2004..<br><br>A statement from FIFPro on their website, www.fifpro.org, said: "FIFPro is in disagreement with the decision of FIFA's dispute resolution chamber condemning the Romanian footballer Adrian Mutu to pay an amount of over 17 million euros as 'financial compensation' to his former club Chelsea, after he was caught in a doping test in September 2004 for using cocaine for which reason he was dismissed."<br><br>It continued: "FIFPro will assist Mutu when the Romanian player will lodge an appeal." FIFPro claim an English player in the same circumstances would have been treated differently.<br><br>The statement added: "When the same offence would have been committed by a player in possession of an English passport, than this player wouldn't have had to pay any damages at this dismissal, since the FA Premier League rules do not provide this.<br><br>"For this reason this can be considered as discrimination based on nationality." <br>They also state: "It is extremely strange that a player who is dismissed by a club must pay damages based on the transfer amount previously paid for him, whilst he has had no control whatsoever on the amount of this fee."<br><br>Romanian striker Mutu was sacked by Chelsea following his failed test and has since rebuilt his career in Italy, where he currently plays for Fiorentina.<br></div>
