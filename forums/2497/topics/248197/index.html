            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Former Fulham captain Sylvain Legwinski believes sacking Chris Coleman 'was the best thing that could have happened' to the club.</strong><br><br>Coleman paid the price for Fulham's poor recent run as he was dismissed earlier this week, with Northern Ireland manager Lawrie Sanchez brought in for the final five matches of the season.<br><br>Legwinski, who left Fulham to join Ipswich last summer, feels Coleman should have been axed much earlier.<br><br>Coleman took charge at Craven Cottage in 2003 and kept the club in mid-table in his first few season at the helm, but Fulham have struggled this season and are currently just four points above the relegation zone.<br><br>"Sacking Coleman was the best thing that could have happened to Fulham," Legwinski told the London newspaper.<br><br>"The only question is about the timing because it should have happened much earlier. It should have been done two years ago. I hope it is not too late."<br><br>Legwinski reckons Coleman lacked the intensity of predecessor Jean Tigana, and only succeeded in stagnating the club's progress.<br><br>He explained: "The club have gone backwards under him. This season was the first where it could be truly called his team as there was no one left from the Jean Tigana era.<br><br>"They are doing badly and it is sad to see where they are now, but in truth Fulham were lucky not to be in the relegation zone for the last two years and that is because of Coleman.<br><br>"It took him two years to realise how physical preparation in pre-season is vital in the Premiership.<br><br>"The work was different when Tigana was in charge. It was more intense - but under Coleman the training sessions were shorter, he did not work us as hard and we were given more days off.<br><br>"I found it very strange because I wanted to work harder and the players lacked fitness.<br><br>"But no one senior in the club was keeping an eye on him or seemed to know what it takes to run a football team." </span></div>
