              <p><strong>England and Chelsea captain John Terry has distanced himself from an email touting his name around for possible commercial endorsements ahead of next year's World Cup finals.</strong></p>
              <p>The email, released by a small marketing company based in Enfield, Riviera Entertainment, was circulated around the sports business community.</p>
              <p>The company claimed it was identifying suitable commercial endorsement opportunities for Terry in the period building up to the finals and beyond.</p>
              <p>"John Terry is available to create effective brand awareness and endorse products and services globally," claimed the firm.</p>
              <p>But Terry released a brief statement insisting that the email had been circulated without his knowledge or permission.</p>
              <p>"An email inviting commercial endorsements for me has been published," declared Terry.</p>
              <p>"This email was sent without my authority or knowledge and was not approved by me (or those advising me). I have nothing further to say on the matter."</p>
              <p>Terry is not in breach of any Football Association rules or any terms that might be in his contract at Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Chelsea are not unduly concerned as Terry is allowed to pursue any commercial and sponsorship agreements as long as they do not interfere with his football or cut across any agreements the Blues have with their own commercial partners.</p>
              <p>Elite management, who look after Terry's affairs following his split from long-term agent Aaron Lincoln in the summer, appointed Riviera Entertainment to identify suitable commercial endorsements.</p>
              <p>In a news release on Riviera's official website, Terry was quoted as saying: "There are certain commercial areas which I would be proud to be associated with.</p>
              <p>"Elite are in control of my marketing and promotional rights and they have identified Riviera as an ideal partner to help secure the right deals for me going forward."</p>
              <p>Russell Edwards, Riviera's commercial manager, said at the time: "John Terry has a great deal to offer the commercial world and we already have companies on our books that are interested in being linked with such a high-profile brand ambassador. With the World Cup just under nine months away we're expecting a busy winter."</p>
              <p>Terry, 28 is also the main face for the Umbro sportswear brand but has appeared in adverts for Samsung, Nationwide and has been the face of King of Shaves.</p>
              <p>He has a sponsorship deal with football gaming series Pro Evolution Soccer and appears on the cover of the UK version of Pro Evolution Soccer 6 with Brazil international Adriano.</p>
