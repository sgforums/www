              <p><strong>Out of control: friends attempt to restrain King</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Spurs' victory over holders Chelsea continued a phenomenal run in knockout competitions for manager Juande Ramos and ended the club's nine-year wait for silverware since they last lifted the League Cup in 1999. </strong><strong>But Spurs players were involved in a brawl in the early hours this morning as they celebrated their Wembley win.</strong></p>
              <p>Captain Ledley King was said to have "gone berserk" after being thrown out of Faces nightclub in Essex when he became too drunk to stand up. In a series of scuffles, the 27-year-old player grappled with bouncers as he tried to force his way back in. Seemingly oblivious to the waiting paparazzi, King struggled for some time before he was eventually restrained by a friend.</p>
              <p>One onlooker said: "He was clearly the worse for wear and could barely stand up. He got very angry when the bouncers got him outside. "He's a very big lad and they were having trouble keeping him under control. He looked completely out of it."</p>
              <p>Team-mate Alan Hutton attempted to hold King back and eventually helped him into a cab outside the Gants Hill nightspot. Other players partying until the small hours after their 2-1 win Carling Cup over Chelsea were Aaron Lennon, Jermaine Jenas, Tom Huddlestone, Steed Malbranque, Pascal Chimbonda and Younes Kaboul.</p>
              <p>Tottenham's new coach Juande Ramos allowed his stars to break their strict health regime and "have a good time" after Jonathan Woodgate headed the extra-time winner.</p>

              <p><strong>Catfight? Danielle Lloyd and David Beckham's sister Joanne were allegedly involved in a heated argument inside the club the same night</strong></p>
              <p>Inside the club there were wild scenes as players let their hair down. WAG Danielle Lloyd, who was partying alongside the Tottenham players, reportedly became involved in a heated argument with David Beckham's sister Joanne. But unlike King, the girls managed to remain composed as they made separate latenight exits from the club.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At White Hart Lane, Spurs fans filled pubs around the ground as they celebrated the club's first trophy since 1999, waving flags and cheering motorists as they sounded their horns. Jeremy Collis, 45, who took 16-yearold son Jack to Wembley, said: "We wanted it more than Chelsea, and that wasn't just the players, it was the fans too. We always throw it away but this time we didn't do that."</p>
              <p>After the match Tottenham captain King said he believes he will be fit to help Tottenham win more silverware for many years to come after captaining the club to victory over Chelsea. It was reported that yesterday's final would be King's last game for the club and that he would have to retire due to his long-standing knee problems. But the 27-year-old, who was superb on his return to the first team after being out for a month, is adamant that he still has a future in the game.</p>
              <p>He said: "I have a lot of football to come and will stay with the team. I'm confident there are more trophies to follow. "I have had some problems with the knee. I have played games and then afterwards it's been a bit of a problem. But I am not worried about it one bit, I'm confident."</p>
