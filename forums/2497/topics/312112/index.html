              <p><span id="intelliTXT">John Terry has urged the Football Association to
              change the rules and rid the game of ugly confrontations between
              players and officials.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/08/03/330/John_Terry_745407.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The Chelsea skipper is in favour of a rule
              change which would only allow team captains to speak to officials over
              contentious decisions on the pitch.</p>
              <p>His remarks come just days after his club and international
              team-mate Ashley Cole issued an apology for his horror tackle on
              Tottenham's Alan Hutton and for showing a lack of respect towards
              referee Mike Riley as he was shown the yellow card during their 4-4
              draw.</p>
              <p>Now Terry says it is time for the FA to get rid of mass confrontations between players and referees.</p>
              <p>"I do agree there has to be a line drawn and confronting the referee has to be taken out of the game," said Terry.</p>
              <p>"I think we have to give it a go and if it doesn't work then the
              FA and the officials have to say that. But we have to try these
              things."</p>
              <p>Terry was criticised in many quarters for running over to Riley
              when he saw the Tottenham staff react angrily to Cole's challenge on
              Wednesday night. But Terry played down suggestions he was trying to
              influence the official.</p>
              <p>"I saw their bench jump up and I ran forward to tell Mike Riley
              not to listen or be intimidated by their bench trying to force him into
              a decision," explained Terry.</p>
              <p>"I spoke to him and he told me 'It was a high tackle and it was going to be a booking', I agreed and walked away.</p>
              <p>"There was no argument from me or anyone else close to Mike Riley and I thought he handled it fantastically well.</p>
              <p>"Us players have got to set an example to the younger kids
              playing the game and people watching. But it is a natural reaction when
              a tackle is made. The fans show their frustration and whistle at the
              referee and the players have that same reaction because we are all so
              passionate about the game.</p>
              <p>"It is a case of Chelsea appealing for what they feel is right
              at the time on the pitch. The club have spoken to the players and the
              manager about it but at the moment we don't see we are doing it any
              more than any other club."</p>
