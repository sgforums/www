              <p><strong>Not since John Barnes memorably 'busted' lyrics in England's 1990 official World Cup anthem <em>World in Motion</em> has an Anfield star conquered the charts.</strong><span><em> </em></span></p>
              <p>And while Ryan Babel may have struggled to find the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;"><span style="color: #800080;"><span>Liverpool</span></span></span></span> <span>groove ever since his arrival from Ajax in 2007, he sensationally been hailed as a 'sick rapper' after linking up with artist Sway on the UK hip hop star's forthcoming album, The Signature 2.</span> <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> </span></span></span></span></p>
              <p>The 22-year-old Holland international is one of a host of stars to collaborate for the new album set to hit stores in 2010 and Sway is backing his close football pal to be the record's success story thanks to his 'amazing' cameo on the unannounced track.</p>
              <p>He said: 'Ryan Babel's a good mate of mine. He's a nice guy, he's a sick rapper.</p>
              <p>'The way he flips his flow is marvellous man, so I wanted him to do a bit - half Dutch, half British, and he really pulled it off man.'</p>
              <p>'We linked up in New York as well. He's a nice guy and I have a lot of fun with him.</p>
              <p>'We linked up with Neutrino and I think it's a track that people are gonna like.'</p>
              <p>It's not the first time Babel has featured on a hip hop track, mastering his MC'in skills with compatriot Daryl on the recent release Eeyeeyo, featuring Ali B and Soumia.</p>

              <p>wah, you rmb who i dislike, lol.</p>
              <p>the way dirk play doesnt fancy me, no pace, no creativity, no sight. but on a positive note, his crossing quite ok. he's those hardworking type, but what liverpool lack now, i believe is what he doesnt have. just my two cent..</p>
              <p>i've seen ryan performed before, that's why i dont think that he's a flop yet, maybe awhile more ba, afterall he's still young. i've faith in his potential abitity.</p>

              <p>LOL...cos you are my fellow fans ar...LOL</p>
              <p>Babel definitely got a talent but sometimes it can be quite frustrating seeing him lose the ball easily...the match against tottenham was one of the worst performance i've ever seen from him.</p>
              <p>I think Kuyt is one of the most underrated player in EPL...he has put in match winning goals more than anyone else in the team as far as I know...and yes, he is hard working, one moment you see him attacking, next you see him at the back defending. LOL</p>

              <p>oh, you're a liverpool fan also? i dint know that! haha, icic.</p>
              <p>great hail the KOP! lol.</p>
              <p>yup, i do agree that ryan had one of his worse performances ever again spurs.</p>
              <p>agreed that dirk does score match winning goals, but i would prefer if our team can acutally have a comfortable win rather than chasing for last min goals, of course, it's not easy to do that in the epl. but with the right talent and signings, i do believe it'll make things easier.</p>
              <p>one of such signings is glen. he's great against stoke. if this form of him cont, i would say we'll have one of the best right back.</p>
