              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">Roberto Mancini has admitted that </span><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><span style="font-size: small;">Manchester City</span></span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> face almost certain elimination from the Champions League. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">His side lost 2-1 at Napoli and must beat Bayern Munich at home in their final Group A match - while hoping the Italians fail to win at Villarreal - to prevent a demotion to the Europa League. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">Manchester United, meanwhile, will almost certainly need to avoid defeat in their final game away to Basle to qualify for the last 16 after a 2-2 home draw against Benfica. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">City's loss last night came amid confusion over the fitness of striker Mario Balotelli. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">The Italian scored City's goal but was sick on the pitch at half-time and Mancini later revealed the former Inter Milan forward had been ill with a fever the day before the game. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><span style="font-size: small;">This immediately raised questions about why Balotelli was selected ahead of Sergio Aguero and Samir Nasri - and why he was allowed to visit a pizzeria with his girlfriend the night before the match. </span></span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Mancini added: 'He had been unwell and he had a fever but it was only a small one. He went out the night before with my permission. He went to meet his girlfriend but he did not have any pizza. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'Balotelli scored a goal; maybe I should have sent all the players out for pizza.' </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The 21-year-old has had problems before with an allergy to grass, but Mancini insisted: 'It was not his allergy. He was sick yesterday (Monday), nothing serious.' </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>And the City boss added: 'I think we have a 30 per cent chance of going through but if we don't, we will make do with the Europa League. Our life does not finish if we don't go through. I'm disappointed with the result but not the performance. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'We conceded two very bad goals but I think we played quite well.'</span></p>

              <p>I don't think it's only about knowing how your opponent plays. Sometimes. it's a confident thing. If you lose this part of your game, the results always seems to go against you no matter how well you know your opponents...</p>
              <p>Arsenal are a good example cos over the years they have been playing great right until Jan/Feb, suddenly everything they do turns wrong...</p>
              <p>Well, City still have a long way to go, so lets see what are they made off... Of course they have great individual players more so than the rest. And a much more capable full squad too.</p>

              <p>of course, there are inter-clubs rivarly.. That's normal hor..</p>
              <p>and SAF is not a nobody before MUFC if I am not wrong. He did quite well in Aberdeen, winning the European Cup Winners' Cup beating RM.. He was nearly sacked until the FA winner from Robbins if I am not wrong.</p>

              <div id="article-body-blocks">
              <p>Victory over <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester City" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester City</span></a> was not enough to guarantee <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Napoli" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/napoli"><span style="color: #005689;">Napoli</span></a> progress to the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Champions League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championsleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Champions League</span></a> knockout stage, but it was enough to spark significant celebrations across the city and the rest of Italy. Few had expected Napoli to have their fate in their own hands at this stage of a group featuring City, Bayern Munich and Villarreal. "Even a piece of marble would have given in to the emotion," writes Maurizio Crosetti in La Repubblica <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/nov/22/napoli-manchester-city-champions-league"><span style="color: #005689;">of a mad night at the Stadio San Paolo</span></a>.</p>
              <p>Napoli's opponents, after all, had been not only the Premier League leaders but also one of the most expensively assembled ensembles the world has ever seen. It was a point that the Italian press were keen to linger on as they looked back on the night's events. "That City may be rich," notes Luigi Garlando in Wednesday morning's Gazzetta dello Sport, "But the city of Naples tonight is far richer – with joy and with dreams."</p>
              <p>"Sometimes miracles do happen," proclaims Il Mattino, while Fabrizio Bocca in La Repubblica also reflects on the unlikeliness of such a scenario. "At this point Napoli ought to have been dead and buried in the notorious Group A, which everyone back at the draw in August greeted as unfortunate and simply insurmountable for [Walter] Mazzarri's Napoli," he says. "Sometimes you need to go at that wall of scepticism around you with a pick axe. Napoli did just that, savaging the team of the moment, City, who have been trotting around England and Europe with all these great champions and with a €250m hole in their finances – created in just one year."</p>
              <p>Indeed, for all their spending, there was widespread agreement that City had been a rather underwhelming proposition. "English TV must have a system that speeds up the images when they broadcast Premier League games," writes Marco Ansaldo in La Stampa. "There is no other way to explain why the Manchester City we've seen running on TV all season were instead only walking, with a slowness of step, passing and thoughts that surprised us."</p>
              <p>That sentiment is reflected in Gazzetta's ratings, where <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/video/2011/nov/23/champions-league-napoli-manchester-city-video"><span style="color: #005689;">Roberto Mancini</span></a> receives five out of 10 for his performance as manager. "Having disembarked in Naples as a new footballing pope, Mancini leaves as a cardinal," reflects Sebastiano Vernazza. "Too much possession just for the sake of it." His colleague Garlando adds: "Manchester [City], strengthened by the €910m spent by Sheikh Mansour, dictated the play for a long time, but often with the presumptuousness of [the] well-to-do: their attitude in possession was leisurely and fanciful."</p>
              <p>But more than City's negatives, of course, they were keen to dwell on the positives for a Napoli side who were playing in the third tier as recently as the 2005-06 season. "Who would have dreamed of such a thing, five years ago?" exclaims Stefano Agresti in Corriere dello Sport. "A madman, maybe. Or perhaps not even him." In Il Giornale, Marcello Di Dio says: "In one evening Napoli transformed themselves from the ugly duckling of the group into a beautiful swan ready to open its wings."</p>
              <p>Back in La Repubblica, meanwhile, Crosetti believes Mazzarri's side should be proud of their football heritage. "Mazzarri should not be offended if he hears people talking about his team playing 'Italian style'," says Crosetti, referencing how Napoli allowed City to keep so much possession. "Through history, this approach has led to many triumphs – World Cups, Champions Leagues – even against opponents who seemed unbeatable. Napoli is the modern interpreter of this tradition. They don't use <em>catenaccio</em>, but they know how to close themselves up and then inject some venom."</p>
