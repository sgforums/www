              <p class="article">Valencia, 24, who celebrated his first United goal last weekend, doubled his 
                  tally for the club four minutes from time, just moments after rattling the 
                  crossbar with a fierce drive.</p>
              <p class="article">United have now won all three of their European ties and sit six points clear 
                  at the top of Group B.</p>
              <p class="article">The plastic pitch played havoc with both teams' play, but particularly 
                  affected the visitors' normal crisp passing style.</p>
              <p class="article">With divots in the field making the ball bobble everywhere, United failed to 
                  create any real chances in the opening half.</p>
              <p class="article">Paul Scholes had their best opportunity with a 35-yard shot that goalkeeper 
                  Igor Akinfeev saved.</p>
              <p class="article">United found plenty of space on the left but Milos Krasic was a constant 
                  threat for Juande Ramos' CSKA.</p>
              <p class="article">United began to assert themselves more midway through the opening period and 
                  Fabio twice crossed only for Valencia to be crowded out, allowing Akinfeev 
                  to claim.</p>
              <p class="article">CSKA responded with Alan Dzagoev lifting a ball into the box but Tomas Necid's 
                  header was of little concern to Edwin van der Sar.</p>
              <p class="article">United's most productive route appeared to be down the left and another Nani 
                  cross was just too high for Berbatov at the far post.</p>
              <p class="article">Krasic — who looked CSKA's most dangerous player — 
                  beat two defenders to create another chance just inside the area but shot 
                  across goal.</p>
              <p class="article">Nani again found good space for United before the break and the ball worked 
                  its way across goal for Gary Neville to shoot but the veteran's left-footed 
                  effort was just over.</p>
              <p class="article">United had a scare moments before half-time when a Dzagoev free-kick into the 
                  box was cleared unconvincingly for a corner.</p>
              <p class="article">The second period got off to a lively start, with chances at both ends.</p>
              <p class="article">Nani raced through from a Valencia backheel but could not find a team-mate 
                  with his cross.</p>
              <p class="article">Necid then brought down the ball brilliantly outside the United box but after 
                  doing the hard work, his shot was tame.</p>
              <p class="article">Deividas Semberas then shot well over and Dazagoev had the ball in the net 
                  before the hour but the flag had long since been raised for offside and the 
                  home celebrations were shortlived.</p>
              <p class="article">Berbatov flicked the ball into the area for the visitors but his attempts to 
                  win a penalty from Aleksei Berezutski came to nothing when he was booked for 
                  diving.</p>
              <p class="article">United took Rio Ferdinand off with a third of the game remaining and created a 
                  chance soon after when Neville crossed for Nani but Akinfeev proved 
                  unbeatable again.</p>
              <p class="article">United continued to press forward and Valencia's 30-yard effort came crashing 
                  back off the crossbar.</p>
              <p class="article">But with four minutes remaining, Ferguson's side got their reward for a 
                  dominating second-half performance.</p>
              <p class="article">Nani's cute cross into the box found Berbatov, whose downward header reached 
                  Valencia and the former Wigan star slammed the ball home from a tight angle.</p>

              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United equalled Ajax’s record of 14 successive unbeaten away matches in the Champions League last night after beating CSKA Moscow 1-0 to move within touching distance of the knockout stages.</strong></p>
              <div>
              <div>
              <div>
              <div>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson hailed a thoroughly professional performance as Antonio Valencia’s second goal in as many matches, four minutes from time, saw off Juande Ramos’s side and ensured United matched the record set by the Dutch club between 1994 and 1997.</p>
              <p>Like Chelsea, 4-0 winners over Atlético Madrid at Stamford Bridge, a point from their next fixture — against CSKA at Old Trafford on November 3 — should be enough to secure qualification with two games to spare.</p>
              <p>With Liverpool to play in the Barclays Premier League on Sunday, it was the perfect run-out and result for United, who also avoided any further injuries on the artificial pitch at the Luzhniki Stadium.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00632/antonio_valencia_58_632215a.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="350"></p>
              <p class="small"><em>Antonio Valencia fires home Manchester United's late winner in the Luzhniki Stadium</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div>
              <div>
              <h3>“The issues of the surface were not a problem,” Ferguson, the United manager, said. “As I said before the game, good footballers can play on that quite easily.</h3>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>“I’m very pleased with the performance. We have a home game against CSKA next, so we have the opportunity to ensure we go through to the next stage. I think we should be proud [of equalling Ajax’s record].</p>
              <p>“There is a way of playing with maturity and you saw that tonight. In the first half I think we played with a lot of patience, which is necessary when you are playing away from home. Experience in these sort of situations is always vital.</p>
              <p>“In the second half we increased the tempo of the game and got more penetration. We created some good opportunities and if we have to wait to the 86th minute, so be it. We had to have the patience to win, and we did that.”</p>
              <p>Ferguson also paid tribute to Valencia, who continued his good form, and Fábio Da Silva, the teenaged defender who excelled on his Champions League debut. “Valencia has been a plus point for the last few weeks,” Ferguson said. “He is emerging very well, settling into the club and his confidence is getting stronger.</p>
              <p>“He has tremendous assets for a wide player but the assets he didn’t show at Wigan were his goals, where he would maybe get three or four a season.”</p>
