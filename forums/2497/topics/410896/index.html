              <div><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Fernando Torres</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> has recognised the importance to </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> supporters of a victory over </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> ahead of the Merseyside club's visit to Old Trafford this weekend.</span></strong></div>
              <div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
              <p>Liverpool have had an indifferent start to the new season, winning one, losing one and drawing two of their opening four matches, the most recent being the goalless draw at Birmingham City on Sunday. But Torres knows that beating United will ignite their campaign.</p>
              <p>"It means everything to them," the Spain striker said. "We are the two most successful teams in England but it has not been nice for the Liverpool fans to watch Manchester United have so much success over the recent years. We have a great squad and a great manager, and we really hope to give the fans a trophy this season, as well as beating Manchester United for them.</p>
              <p>"The Liverpool fans are great, when you play well they are behind you and when you are not playing the best they are still behind you. I walk my dogs round the city, and before matches like Manchester United the fans will tell you good luck and things like that. It's clear how much the Manchester United games means to them."</p>
              <p>Liverpool's last win at Old Trafford was the stunning 4-1 rout of March 2009.</p>
              <p>"Nobody ever really wins at Old Trafford and beating Manchester United 4-1 on their own ground is practically unheard of," added Torres, who scored Liverpool's first on that day after they had fallen behind to a Cristiano Ronaldo penalty. "To this day I think that has to be one of my favourite days wearing the Liverpool shirt."</p>
              <p>Ahead of Sunday's game, Torres has pinpointed Wayne Rooney as United's biggest threat. "They [United] have some amazing players, but I think Wayne Rooney is their stand out player," said Torres in BBC's Match of the Day magazine. "Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs have had great starts to the season though, and if they were still in the 20's then I don't think my decision would be quite so easy.</p>
              <p>"I really like Wayne Rooney, I think he is a great player and a funny guy, so we usually have a little chat at the end of the game."</p>

              <p>Unless the midfield can hold the veterans of man utd, Liverpool is looking to lose this match.</p>

              <p>I am not sure whether Ah Roy would put up a strong enough team to fend off the devils.</p>

              <p>And Manchester United boss Fergie blamed the new Inter Milan chief for making their feud personal during his six years at Anfield.</p>
              <p>Asked about Liverpool's financial woes, he said: "In the last regime they spent a lot of money on players, far more than Manchester United did.</p>
              <p>"They had a huge squad of players so I don't know if that's anything to do with it."</p>
              <p>The bad blood between the pair peaked with the Spaniard's infamous 'fact' rant in January 2009.</p>
              <p>But Fergie said: "I've never been personal. You have to examine him, not me.</p>
              <p>"I've always enjoyed a good relationship with Liverpool managers.That changed under the last regime."</p>

              <p>The Liverpool chief knows all about fierce rivalries from his time at Inter Milan and they were not happy experiences.</p>
              <p>While the Manchester and Merseyside derbies are all about bragging rights, the real feeling these days tends to come from United and Liverpool showdowns.</p>
              <p>It was the same story in Serie A, where the Milan derby played second fiddle to Inter's games against Juventus.</p>
              <p>Hodgson managed just one point from four clashes with Juve - and is desperate to taste success in the Premier League's equivalent.</p>
              <p>He admitted: "The Milan derby was big but the 'derby d'Italia', Inter v Juventus, was the real killer one that grabbed the imagination and this certainly compares with that.</p>
              <p>"I relished them and no doubt will feel the same about this game but I'm hoping I'll have a better record than in Italy.</p>
              <p>"Like the rivalry this weekend, they are not games you want to lose. Ever.</p>
              <p>"On Sunday, I'd like to say my record in the big game is quite good thank you!"</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>A spectacular acrobatic goal sandwiched by two towering headers from Dimitar Berbatov helped settle a pulsating match at Old Trafford this afternoon.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>His stunning bicycle kick on the hour was almost overshadowed by the sheer drama of the match as <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> threw away a two-goal lead for the second week in a row.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But the Bulgarian was on hand to head home the decisive goal from a John O'Shea cross in the closing stages.</span></p>
              <p><span>Berbatov broke the deadlock just before half-time from a corner and then doubled United's lead with a wonderful acrobatic effort that nestled in the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html">Liverpool</a> net via the crossbar. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But when it seemed Sir Alex Ferguson was certain to get one over on the old enemy, Fernando Torres, largely anonymous until the 63rd minute, was felled by Jonny Evans in the box. </span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Sir Alex Ferguson</span><span style="color: #000000;"> praised Dimitar Berbatov after the striker's hat-trick, his first for the club, </span><span style="color: #000000;">gave Manchester United victory over Liverpool</span><span style="color: #000000;">. The Bulgarian has performed well in short periods since his £30m move from Tottenham Hotspur in 2008, but Ferguson said he always had faith in the striker.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Berbatov had opened the scoring with a header from Ryan Giggs's corner, before doubling United's lead with a brilliant overhead kick. However it seemed </span><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span><span style="color: #000000;"> would escape with a point after drawing level through a penalty and a free-kick from Steven Gerrard, only for Berbatov to seal his hat-trick with an 84th minute header, his sixth goal of the season.</span></p>
              <p>"It was unexpected, a surprise attempt," Ferguson said of Berbatov's brilliant second goal. "Not many of those go in the net but fortunately it did this time.</p>
              <p>"There was a lot of criticism of him last season from the media – it happens when we buy someone for a lot of money, that's the way of the world.</p>
              <p>"But this season he has started off in the right fashion. He was good in pre-season and on tour and has carried it on. There has never been any doubt about the quality of the man."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Ferguson admitted he feared United would end up with only a point from today's game after they had thrown away a two-goal lead for the second week in a row. Last Saturday United had held a 3-1 lead at Everton well into stoppage time, and somehow ended up drawing 3-3.</strong></p>
              <p>"From thinking to myself 'it's going to be 10' we ended up at 2-2," said Ferguson. "It was a travesty of a scoreline then – but a great result at the end.</p>
              <p>Ferguson also revealed Ryan Giggs and Rio Ferdinand, who was left out, have been suffering from a sickness bug. "Ryan was ill at half-time and was feeling really queasy," he added. "Rio was the same last night, so we hope it's not going to spread." </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool's manager, <span style="color: #000000;">Roy Hodgson</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span> revealed his disappointment that his side had left Old Trafford with nothing after a spirited fightback in the second half.</strong></p>
              <p>"I thought our second half performance was good and we deserved to get back in the game," said Hodgson. "I think we were a bit unlucky to go two down when we did – and of course to concede late on was tough.</p>
              <p>"We're disappointed but otherwise I thought we made a really good effort in the second half to get back in the game. Had we had a little bit more composure at the end maybe we'd have seen the game out.</p>
              <p>"In the first half I don't think the front players received that many balls they could deal with, more because of good defending than anything else. But then the game opened up and there was more excitement for the fans in the second half."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ALEX FERGUSON last night branded Fernando Torres a cheat.</h2>
              <p>Manchester United's John O'Shea escaped calls for a red card after bringing down the Liverpool hitman during yesterday's pulsating clash.</p>
              <p>Following United's 3-2 win, boss Fergie fumed: "I have watched it again and Torres made an absolute meal of it to try and get the player sent off."</p>
              <p>Roy Hodgson, the Liverpool manager — whose side have won just once in their first five league games — refused to be drawn on the matter, suggesting he hadn’t had a clear view of the incident.</p>
              <p>He said: ‘Some of my coaches were jumping up and down but I didn’t have a great view. Sir Alex was closer to it. but I must say I didn't think the player should have been sent off."</p>
              <p>'I thought the referee had a good game. Sir Alex is entitled to his opinion but I prefer to talk about things that interest me. I am not a fan of game saying.</p>
              <p>United were cruising at 2-0 up thanks to Dimitar Berbatov's double strike.</p>
              <p>But after 64 minutes Torres was fouled by Jonny Evans to earn a penalty, which Steven Gerrard knocked in.</p>
              <p>Six minutes later Torres went down under O'Shea's challenge on the edge of the area - earning the United man a booking - and Gerrard scored from the free kick.</p>
              <p>But Berbatov completed his hat-trick in the 84th minute to give United a thrilling victory.</p>
