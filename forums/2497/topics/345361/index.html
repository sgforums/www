              <h2>The fixture organisers have a case to answer for the way the
              matches fall, argues the Arsenal boss, which is pretty much what Rafa
              was saying recently.</h2>
              <p>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger agrees with his Liverpool counterpart
              Rafael Benitez that the fixture list unfairly favours Manchester United.<br><br>According
              to the Daily Mail, Wenger feels Benitez has a point in his complaint
              that the fixtures in the Barclays Premier League tend to favour United.
              That was one of the central points in Rafa's recent rant against
              United's manager Sir Alex Ferguson.<br><br>Wenger is quoted by the Mail
              as saying: "I feel that next week [Liverpool manager Rafael] Benitez
              has a case if you look at the way the fixtures are arranged.<br><br>"You can say that Manchester United have been extremely advantaged, unexplainably advantaged.<br><br>"But
              that is what we have to cope with. It is difficult to explain why one
              team plays on Tuesday and the others are all on Wednesday.<br><br>"It
              is unfair competition. Next week the fixtures are advantaged for
              Manchester United, who before had a point against Liverpool - I
              supported them when they had a case. But this week, I think Benitez has
              a case.<br><br>"Manchester United play on Tuesday at West Brom, after
              they play against Everton who will have played on Sunday, again on
              Wednesday night.<br><br>"I do not think you need to be a specialist in
              football to understand that in this case it is an unfair advantage for
              Manchester United.<br><br>"Will it have an advantage on the global season? I don't know, you would have to analyse that better.<br><br>"It
              is not Manchester United's fault, it is not Liverpool's fault. It is
              the organisers of the fixtures. They have a case to explain."</p>

              <p>Yeah, and they all kept quiet when United were the only one who had to play all their 6 matches after their CL games away to difficult places... Had United not manage to handle the first half of the season, they could already be out of the CL let alone the Premiership...</p>
