              <p><em>BENITEZ  "THE TERMINATOR"</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>IT HAS happened before and it will no doubt happen again. There Chelsea are, tootling along without a care in the world, bowling over all and sundry with their lovely, winning football. And then along comes Rafa Benitez.</strong><br><br>He did it to Jose Mourinho, to the Special One’s fury, he did it to Claudio Ranieri, he very nearly did it to poor old Avram Grant and now he has done it to Luiz Felipe Scolari …stopped their teams in their tracks and completely upset the seemingly unstoppable applecart.<br><br>No one has the measure of Chelsea quite like Benitez. The Spaniard’s tactical wizardry all too often explodes in his face, especially in domestic games, but not against the men from Stamford Bridge.<br><br>Twice he has ended their hopes at the semi-final stage of the Champions League, once turfed them out of the FA Cup, several times frustrated them in the Premier League.<br><br>Yesterday in the driving rain at Stamford Bridge, Benitez wrote his name in the record books as he ended the longest unbeaten home league run in English football. Eighty-six games, four years and three managers had gone by since Chelsea last went  down on their own turf – on February 21, 2004, when Arsenal won 2-1.<br><br>But thanks to Xabi Alonso’s deflected shot yesterday, Benitez confirmed Liverpool’s status as genuine title challengers this season. Not since 1990 have they lifted the trophy, but this win gave them their best start to a Premier League season – and their manager’s first away victory in the league against another top-four team. Of course, it had to come against Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Benitez has been grumbling lately that with just two years of his contract left he has heard nothing from the Anfield hierarchy about talks on a new deal. Six weeks ago his team, once again without Fernando Torres, beat Manchester United at Anfield. Now they have beaten Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. His pounding on the boardroom door will surely soon become difficult to ignore.<br><br>As for Chelsea? The end of an era. Even Grant never lost at home in the league.</p>

              <p>It is due to the financial constraints of the american owner that ah ben cannot tinker as he like as in the last four season.</p>

              <p>I sincerely hope that the spirit of the team can carry the victory forward as the only unbeaten team this season.</p>

              <p>Well, Grant took them to finals they have never been before. And for me, the results is what matters and not the fancy star names coach or managers... And to think Grants salary was like 1/3 of Scolari's.</p>
              <p>What I am most impress of Grant was during the pressure period between Feb to May, his side kept it going and even cut United's lead all the way until it became level a few match from the last game of the season...</p>
              <p>I know he is not like by many cos he replaced Jose but without a pre-season and thrown in at the deep end all of a sudden... He still did what not every top manager could.</p>
              <p>And seriously, had it not been for Terry... He would have lead Chelsea to their first ever Champions League title already.</p>

              <p>Indeed 2nd place but more importantly, they got to the biggest final in club football that no other manager previously had taken them to. All these in his first season and without a pre-season to prepare... Did Mourinho or Ranieri despite having good start brought them to that stage with all the pre-season and spending?</p>
              <p>And I don't think people will forget they have been to a CL final in 10 yrs time if Chelsea never makes it to another one in the next 10 or 15 yrs... People will still bring it up once in a while that they have been in a European Cup final before. Just like people talk about the Arsenal and Barcelona final too... And have Wenger won anything in the last 4 yrs?</p>
              <p>Grant didn't win anything but he could have won the double or the very least, club football's greatest prize the Champions League title. It is no fault of his that Terry couldn't score the winning shot from the last penalty. It was there to be taken but the player couldn't. If he did, Grant would have been credited for the win.</p>
              <p>When we talk about Arsenal almost won the CL, what about Chelsea... wasn't it closer... It couldn't get any closer than that one single kick.</p>
              <p>So was it Grant's fault that Terry couldn't put it in?  </p>

              <p><br>Ahh... for your info, Grant had worse injury problems last season then Scolari have currently... If anything, he lost their 2 important players in Lampard and Terry. They were both out for a while... Drogba was out for sometime too... Ballack only came back in late Dec... They also didn't have Bosingwa or Deco then... Though they had a number of average players there last season that Scolari didn't want this season... Ben Haim, Makelele, SWP, Pizarro, Sidwell... Ferreira, tho he is still there...</p>
              <p>They also lost some players to the ACN tournament.</p>

              <p>if rafa can stay in liverpool for 10 seasons, i think he can take the titles for at least 2-3 times. not as prolific as SAF but good enuf as long as liverpool remain the most successful club in england.</p>
              <p>in rafa, we thrust.</p>
