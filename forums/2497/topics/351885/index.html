              <p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Guus Hiddink led Chelsea to a 1-0 win over Manchester City on Sunday, but saw Deco hobble out of the action. A solitary strike from Michael Essien was enough to keep the Blues in the title race as they reclaimed second spot in the Premier League standings.</strong></p>
              <p>However, the victory was soured by an injury to Portuguese playmaker Deco. He was forced from the field four minutes before half-time after suffering a recurrence of a hamstring problem and could be sidelined for the remainder of the season.</p>
              <p>"I think he will be out for a while," Hiddink said. "He was fit and has been working hard but got the same problem again."</p>
              <p>Asked whether Deco would recover before the end of the season, the Dutch coach said: "I have my doubts but let's see." The injury blow aside, Hiddink was otherwise delighted to take three points from the City clash.</p>
              <h4>Tension</h4>
              <p>Chelsea now sit four points behind league leaders Manchester United, with all to play for between now and the end of the season. "If it was just four points it would be very close, but they have that game in hand," he said.</p>
              <p>"But it's clear that after yesterday's unexpected result (United's 4-1 defeat to Liverpool) that the tension has come back in the league. "It's a boost. But if we want to track them, we have to keep on winning. That'll give tension to the end of the season, which is good for everyone.</p>
              <p>"Every now and then you get a defeat you don't expect. Sometimes you don't expect it at home because you have a beautiful record, then all of a sudden it happens.</p>
              <p>"But they're a very experienced team. Let's see how they react in the up-coming days. It's not the first time that it's happened, but the big teams always react.</p>
              <p>"I don't know what their reaction will be. When you are in the driver's seat and someone else is coming, you can get a little bit nervous. It is a little bit open now."</p>

              <h1 class="sIFR-ignore">Deco back within 'three or four days'</h1>
              <p><strong>Deco has allayed fears of his season being over, saying he expects to be training again by the end of the week. </strong></p>
              <p>The Portugal playmaker was forced off in the first half of Chelsea’s
              1-0 win over Manchester City on Sunday and replaced by Juliano
              Belletti.</p>
              <p>When questioned about the injury after the game, manager Guus
              Hiddink said that he ‘had his doubts’ as to whether Deco would be
              available before the campaign comes to a close.</p>
              <p>However, the player himself has now issued a miraculously more positive prognosis.</p>
              <p>“I don’t think the injury will be an impediment, the first
              impression is in three or four days I will be training without
              limitations,” he is quoted as saying in The Sun.</p>

              <p><strong>Portugal playmaker Deco has
              vowed to put his injury nightmares behind him and is looking to shine
              in Saturday’s clash with Newcastle. </strong></p>
              <p>Initially ruled out for the rest of the season with a second
              hamstring strain, Deco made a successful return for Portugal this week
              and now the diminutive dynamo wants games under his belt as he seeks
              match fitness.</p>
              <p>“Of course for me it was difficult after the second injury but I
              recovered well, starting here in Chelsea and then with the national
              team," Deco told the club's official website.</p>
              <p>“For me it was good to play some minutes on the pitch, and of course I still need more games as I only played a few minutes."</p>
              <p>The 31-year-old limped off against Manchester United and early signs
              indicated he would be out for months and Deco admits the setback was
              tough to take.</p>
              <p>He said: “It was difficult. I was disappointed because the week
              before I was training hard and training well and felt confident I was
              ready.</p>
              <p>“Then I felt something in my hamstring again in the game, it was so disappointing.</p>
              <p>“After a few days I started again and hoped to play this season.”</p>
              <p>Deco goes straight into the Chelsea squad for Saturday’s trip to St James’ Park.</p>
