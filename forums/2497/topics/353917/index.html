              <h1>REAL BACK FOR RONALDO</h1>
              <div class="image-holder"><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00032/RONALDO3_32964a.jpg" alt="" width="516" height="175"></div>
              <h2>Spanish giants will make new move for United ace</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>MAKE-UP, lights, camera, action - the Cristiano Ronaldo Show is about to enter its second season. </h3>
              <p>Stand by for the Manchester United star to once more start polishing his ego, fluttering his eyelashes and wooing would-be suitors. </p>
              <p>His admirers have not changed. Real Madrid continue to be attracted by the prospect of securing a player who has become World and European Footballer of the Year since they last tried to sign him. </p>
              <p>United are fooling themselves if they think that Real's pursuit of the Portuguese winger ended when Sir Alex Ferguson chased them away last summer. </p>
              <p>The Spanish giants will be back in the close season with a renewed passion and an £100million package to try to entice club and player. </p>
              <p>But the seduction process has already begun. The Real key figure has changed but the aim remains the same. Former president Ramon Calderon has left centre stage, ousted in a vote-rigging scandal during club elections last year..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="image-holder"><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00032/perez_02_280x420_32418a.jpg" alt="FLORENTINO PEREZ - ambitious" width="280" height="420"></div>
              <div class="caption-container">
              <div class="caption"><em>FLORENTINO PEREZ - wants to bring the glamour and Galacticos back to Real.</em></div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The contest to replace him is already under way with Florentina Perez ready to stand for office, three years after leaving his Bernabeu seat of power. Perez wants to bring the glamour and Galacticos back to the Spanish capital and Ronaldo's name is the top one on his election ticket.</strong></p>
              <p>So, too, is the Brazilian superstar Kaka - another £100m target - while Arsenal's Cesc Fabregas has also been linked but is more likely to be attracted to his former club Barcelona. </p>
              <p>Perez will not present his package to the Real electorate until all his potential signings are in place. But he is convinced he will see off any rival candidates and win the keys to the boardroom. </p>
              <p>Steven Gerrard was to be his third star capture but the Liverpool skipper has kicked that idea into the long grass by pledging the rest of his career to the Anfield club. </p>
              <p>Ronaldo's attempts at a similar show of loyalty have been less convincing. He contends he is happy at United but, of the future, adds: "Only God knows about that." </p>
              <p>There are echoes in that remark of those he made a year ago when his commitment to the United cause gradually wavered to the point where he admitted he wanted to join Real. </p>
              <p>Spanish sources have been insisting for several months that a deal has been struck between Madrid, United, Ronaldo and his agent Jorge Mendes, a claim that has been vehemently denied at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>But ex-president Calderon recently told a Spanish radio station that his legacy to the club was to have clinched Ronaldo's arrival this summer. And the winger's international team-mate and Real defender Pepe believes he is on his way to Spain. </p>
              <p>Pepe said: "Cristiano wants to play in the Santiago Bernabeu. I would love him to join Madrid. He has already said that he wants to come and I hope that next season he is with us." </p>
              <p>Claims that Ronaldo is not receiving sufficient protection from Premier League referees are being interpreted in Spain as a further sign that he will leave United in the summer. </p>
              <p>A new wave of media frenzy broke out in the Spanish capital this week when it was revealed that he intends to open a branch of his chain of fashion stores in Madrid. There are also claims he has plans to open shops in Paris, Milan, Madrid, London, Prague, Berlin, Tokyo and Los Angeles but, significantly, not in Manchester. </p>
              <p>A Spanish source told Sport of the World: "There is a cleverly conceived plan in place for Cristiano to join Real. </p>
              <p>"The reports that he is unhappy with the treatment he gets in England is part of it and will be used as a lever for him to get his dream move to Madrid. </p>
              <p>"Of course, it will have to be achieved with United's approval but part of the strategy is to keep chipping away at their resistance until they give in." </p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson will fight tooth and nail to keep his star player from the clutches of a club he has come to despise for their underhand tactics. </p>
              <p>And United have been drawing up a new deal which could earn him up to £200,000-a-week as a reward for his status as the world's best player. </p>
              <p>That will provide the ultimate test of Ronaldo's fidelity. Any hesitation on his part will begin a re-run of the saga which stretched through last summer. </p>
              <p>For there to be a different ending he will need to utter the words which so far he has failed to deliver: "I want to leave Manchester United." </p>
              <p>If he does the curtain will fall. And it will be exit, stage left, Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>

              <p>I don't think any United fans should blame him at all... If he really wants to go, let him as he have done a lot for the club already... First, he is a foreigner afterall and not an English... So going to Spain is like going home for a Portuguese player... They are more closer in terms of a lot of stuff, even the weather...</p>
              <p>For Footballing reasons, he has won everything there is in England... Team wise as well as on a personally level so going to Spain especially to Real Madrid would be a right move I feel... Its a totally different culture and their fan base is also different from the current United ones... Real Madrid may not be as popular in Asia but they are big in S America. Bigger than any English clubs in that region...</p>
              <p>Anyway, with Fergie retiring very soon, a lot of things could change... So I don't see why he should stay any longer... From United's point of view and their fans, I think its almost the right time to cash in before he loses his value... How much he goes for, be it $60, $70, $80 or even $100 million, it doesn't really matters, its still big money and it will help the club. We can say he played for them 5 yrs for free... lol</p>
              <p>But again, I would say if he wants to go and test himself in another league, United should let him go and the fans should not be unhappy or blame him. I know football is a team sport but the titles won over these last 3 years... A lot of it was down to him this we have to accept if we are being honest... And who knows, his best years may be behind him for all we know so getting big bucks to improve the squad may not be a bad thing afterall...  </p>

              <p>But all 3 la if they have the money.... 200million for all 3... This is insane... Real Madrid is insane!!!</p>

              <p>firstly i dont believe they have the $$$ since they are in
              debt</p>
              <p>secondly, letting ronaldo go for 100 million pounds is a great
              deal coz we get to use that cash to buy other players like benzema
              and maybe even secure tevez</p>

              <h2 style="color: #333332; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px;">The world's most profitable football club continue to triumph over the global credit crunch, and with flying marks...</h2>
              <p></p>
              <p style="color: #333332;">Businesses around the world have been shedding tears ever since early September, when the global financial crisis took its toll on the world's largest corporations. The same can't be said about Real Madrid though, who released their financial expectations for the 2008-09 season to reveal some shocking revelations.</p>
              <p style="color: #333332;">According to a report released by <em style="color: #333332;">Agence France-Presse</em>, Real Madrid have announced that they are expecting a record €407 million in revenue by June, up from €366 million during the same time last year.</p>
              <p style="color: #333332;">Even more impressive, pre-tax profits are expected to rise to a whopping €58 million. This would see Real Madrid emerge as the world's highest earner in terms of both revenue and profit.</p>
              <p style="color: #333332;">As for the club debts, which have been a controversial issue ever since the infamous 'Galatico' Era, they are expected to drop to €125 million, a world-record 37.5 per cent decrease in total.</p>
              <p style="color: #333332;">Meanwhile, los Blancos' arch-rivals Barcelona are still behind in terms of finances, expecting a 'meagre' €308 million in revenue, €100 million less than Real Madrid. Barca's debts are still at €180 million, and are not expected to decrease severely by the time the financial year ends this June.</p>
              <p style="color: #333332;">The sharp jump in earnings for both teams are largely down to their luxury <span style="color: #000000;">television </span>contracts, their main source of income, along with merchandising, sponsorship deals, and ticket sales.</p>
              <p style="color: #333332;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333332;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333332;">they are not doing as bad as you thought. </p>
