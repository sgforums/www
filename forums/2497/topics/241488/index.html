            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea striker Andriy Shevchenko has revealed his deep dissatisfaction with manager Jose Mourinho and says he has had "better coaches."<br><br>"He is professional, no more and no less. He is a tactical fox and has strict ideas, but I've had better coaches," Shevchenko told the website of German TV channel ARD this week.<br><br>"It is the first time in my career that a coach has said publicly that I don't fit in with his concept.<br><br>"That is not exactly great for motivation. If that is what he really thinks, then why am I here?<br><br>"We had a meeting and he said his opinion had been twisted. But deep inside it still bothers me. If the owner asks me what I think of the manager, then I will speak my mind."<br><br>The Ukrainian who has been written off as a 30-million-pound flop by the British media after his move from AC Milan last year claimed he had become a pawn in the deteriorating relationship between Mourinho and Chelsea's billionaire Russian owner Roman Abramovich.<br><br>"It is no secret that I was more on the wish list of Mr Abramovich than the coach's," Shevchenko said.<br><br>"But Mourinho was very positive and happy with me in the transfer talks. Then a few months ago I suddenly became a target for him because he was having a spat with the chairman."<br><br>He also admitted he was struggling to adapt to life in London.<br><br>"I am here in body, but not in spirit. In January I wouldn't have been opposed to being sent out on loan, but that is not an issue any more."<br><br>He said he felt he was less comfortable in the Chelsea tactical setup than at Milan, where he was the undisputed target man.<br><br>"At Chelsea everyone is responsible for joining in the attacking moves, which is a plus point, but for me personally it is very hard for me to make an impression," he said.<br><br>Shevchenko helped to steer Chelsea to a place in the quarter-finals of the Champions League on Tuesday, setting up the crucial goal for Michael Ballack in the 2-1 win over FC Porto which gave the Londoners a 3-2 victory on aggregate.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea's Ukrainian striker Andriy Shevchenko has denied giving an interview to a German website in which he appeared to criticise coach Jose Mourinho.<br><br>In a statement released by Chelsea, Shevchenko insists the interview was a complete fabrication.<br><br>Shevchenko declared: 'This is complete rubbish. I have never spoken to this German website or to the journalist who claims to have interviewed me.'<br><br>The club statement continued: 'The only official comments from Andriy appear on the Chelsea website, his own website or in interviews organised by the club, his sponsors or official pre or post-match press conferences.<br><br>'Andriy and Chelsea FC will now be considering what further action to take.'<br><br>German tv website sport.ARD.de. claimed that Shevchenko had spoken of the tensions within the club.<br><br>'It's true I have complained about Mourinho, but there are a lot of things which drove me to that,' Shevchenko was quoted as saying.<br><br>'A few months ago I suddenly became his dartboard because he was having a spat with the president at the time.'<br><br>Failing to find his form since his high-profile move from AC Milan, Shevchenko showed his hand by allegedly saying: 'I'm an employee of the club so I do what the president says.'<br><br>'The manager never spoke to me or played me in the position where my strengths lie.<br><br>'It's also no secret that I was more on Mr Abramovich's wish list than the manager's.<br><br>'In the transfer talks, Mr Mourinho seemed positive and happy at first.'<br><br>Talks of a rift at Stamford Bridge have been reported in the media for the past few weeks, and Shevchenko is reported to have hinted that it was the root cause of his troubles: 'A manager should be objective and not take it out on a player. For the first time in my career a manager said in public that I did not completely fit in with his plan.<br><br>'That's not exactly great motivation. If he thinks that why am I here?<br><br>'One on one with me he cleared the matter up and said his opinion had been twisted. But inside it still bothers me.<br><br>'I don't like arguing but I don't forget things either. If the club boss asks me again what I think of the manager then I'll speak for me personally.<br><br>'Mourinho is a very good manager, but I don't fit into his system. In any event I know it can't carry on like that.<br><br>'Our relationship is professional. Nothing more nothing less. He is a tactical fox and has strict beliefs, but I've had better managers.'</div>

The Â£30million Ukrainian striker said Mourinho is not that special and he has played for better coaches, and would have been happy to leave the club in January on loan.<br><br>Mourinho's future at Chelsea is in doubt after falling out with Abramovich, and the striker made it clear where his loyalty lies. "I'm an employee of the club so I do what the club president says," said Shevchenko. "Yes it's true I've complained about Mourinho - but there are a lot of things which drove me to that. The manager never spoke to me or played me in the position where my strengths lie," he said in an interview with a German website.<br><br>In the transfer talks Mourinho seemed positive and happy at first. But a few months ago I suddenly became his dartboard because he was having a spat with the president at the time. "A manager should be objective and not take it out on a player. For the first time in my career a manager said in public that I didn't completely fit in with his plan. That's not exactly great motivation. If he thinks that, why am I here?<br><br>"One on one with me he cleared the matter up and said his opinion had been twisted. But inside it still bothers me. I don't like arguing but I don't forget things either. If the club boss asks me again what I think of the manager then I'll speak for me personally."<br><br>Shevchenko, in an interview with German TV website sport. ARD. de, added: "Mourinho is a very good manager but I don't fit into his system. In any event I know it can't carry on like that. "Our relationship is professional. Nothing more and nothing less. He is a tactical fox and has strict beliefs. But I've had better managers.<br><br>"In all honesty I still haven't completely settled in to living in London. My body is here but my soul is missing. In January if the club had loaned me out I wouldn't have had anything against it. But that's not an issue any more."<br></div>
